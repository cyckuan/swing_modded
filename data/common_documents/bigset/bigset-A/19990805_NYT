   LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles officials sent a simple message to
the NFL Wednesday: Play or punt.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with demands for more money from the NFL to win a
franchise, Los Angeles officials developed a united front in
opposing any public subsidies beyond what's already been pledged.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the state, county and city levels, Democrats and
Republicans alike, issued the message in a variety of forums that
it was now up to the NFL to prove it really wants to come to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the NFL is truly concerned about how well an ownership
group can succeed, they should reduce some of their demands,''
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said following a meeting of the Coliseum
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can cut the parking in half (to 10,000) and save $75
million. They can make other changes in their demands to make a
team profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission President Sheldon Sloan suggested the league return
to its original proposal by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue that a
price be set on the franchise costs rather than start a bidding war
among different ownership groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they set a reasonable price, a new ownership group will be
competitive,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Nate Holden predicted there would be an immediate
referendum to block the use of any public money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would qualify like that,'' Holden said, snapping his
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Council President John Ferraro offered his own political
assessment. ``It would pass easily,'' Ferraro said. ``The NFL has
to realize that Los Angeles and California are different. They are
not going to use public money for professional football.''
</P>
<P>
   The tough talk came a day after investment banker Bill Chadwick,
whom Gov. Gray Davis had named as lead negotiator, sent a letter
asking to be relieved of his duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a ploy,'' Chadwick said. ``We had come up with an
exclusive negotiating agreement that the NFL didn't accept. I have
told the governor about what I think happened here and we shouldn't
be negotiating with ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we hear from the NFL, my usefulness is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was in New York City and aides said he had not made a
decision on whether to accept Chadwick's resignation. Chadwick said
he would continue working on the deal if Davis so desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still possible to do a deal, but it will be up to the
NFL to respond to the negotiating agreement,'' Chadwick said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In the meantime, representatives of the two ownership groups
were assessing the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everyone is taking stock and waiting to see what
happens next,'' said Ron Hartwig, spokesman for the Eli Broad and
Ed Roski Jr. team.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani said the Mike Ovitz and Ron Burkle group was in a
similar position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really not much to comment on until we hear from the
NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Coliseum General Manager Pat Lynch said he has talked with some
NFL staff members, but has not heard anything on what will happen
next.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Aiello, vice president of public relations for the NFL,
said the league is ``in contact with the Governor's Office, and
we're awaiting direction on how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to work with Los Angeles to get this project
done. We have done what Los Angeles has asked us to do, which was
to come to the Coliseum, realizing it would be very expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The league has set a Sept. 15 deadline for a decision on Los
Angeles, even though it is not holding its next meeting until Sept.
22. It could call a special meeting or send out a group of owners
or staffers to meet with local officials at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick had developed a proposal under which the state would
advance $150 million to pay for parking structures to be reimbursed
by revenue and ticket tax money. It also would have given the new
owners naming and signage rights at the facility to raise more
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners, however, said they felt more public money should be
contributed, and they want more for the franchise fee.
</P>
<P>
   Such actions, however, would result in a new team generating $25
million to $28 million a year in profits, making it difficult to
field a competitive team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our discussions with everyone in Los Angeles, we said we
were ready to build the stadium privately,'' Aiello said. ``But for
this project to work, it had to have parking. And the community
would have to step forward and pay for the parking and the
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Aiello said funding solely from bonds wouldn't work because
``(the bonds) are being paid by revenue generated by the NFL games
which takes away our ability to pay for the stadium.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Dodgers did the expected Wednesday and declined a
proposal given by the Fort McDowell Indian Community to build a
spring-training complex near Phoenix, but it doesn't figure to be
the end of the relationship or negotiating between the sides.
</P>
<P>
   It was also announced the Dodgers would return to Dodgertown in
Vero Beach, Fla., for their 52nd consecutive spring training, which
the Daily News reported June 12.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers collect themselves and decide which route to
take in securing a spring-training home for the future, club
president and CEO Bob Graziano said they would continue speaking
with representatives from Fort McDowell because the situation isn't
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to leave the door open if something makes sense
and I think they're going to leave the door open in case something
makes sense,'' Graziano said. ``We spent some time with the
governor's office and we will spend some time with the governor's
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort McDowell termed it's proposal ``final,'' but neither side
is viewing it as that.
</P>
<P>
   The core problem is with finance. Fort McDowell offered to build
a $40 million complex, complete with six practice fields, a
12,000-seat stadium with offices. But it didn't include on-site
housing, which the Dodgers have in Vero Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were worried about the economical impact of signing
on for the long term with Fort McDowell if it didn't have state
funding. To that, the Arizona legislature meets in January, and
Fort McDowell is expected to ask for financial assistant that could
enhance the proposal and make it more attractive for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to work with both parties to try to get something
done,'' said Chris Baier, director of sports development at the
Arizona department of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Fort McDowell representatives said they would begin discussions
with other clubs in hopes of luring another team but said they
didn't rule out a deal with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers continue to talk with Vero Beach and Indian River
County (Fla.) officials in hopes of landing a long-term deal.
Parties from each side spoke during a Tuesday conference call.
</P>
<P>
   The local Florida community has $12.5 million in funding. That's
enough to purchase the land from the Dodgers and lease it back to
the club, but it leaves no money for renovations to the antiquated
complex. The stumbling block continues to more money, but that
could be changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some opportunities (for more funding),'' Dodgertown
managing director Craig Callan said. ``It's something we're working
on.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Osuna cancels surgery: Injured reliever Antonio Osuna
continues to frustrate and infuriate Dodgers management. The
right-hander, who was scheduled to undergo Tommy John surgery
today, told the club Wednesday he's decided to wait and seek
another opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to be empathetic,'' general manager Kevin Malone
said. ``He wants to do the right thing. That's his decision. It's
his arm. He has to make it. He knows the position of the Los
Angeles Dodgers. We can strongly recommend (to have the surgery),
but what he feels is best is his option.''
</P>
<P>
   Some folks in the Dodgers organization believe Osuna's balking
at the surgery because he wants to prove he can pitch and collect
his $1.5 million option. But Dodgers officials said it's unlikely
such an option would be picked up.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time this season Osuna's balked at surgery.
He had bone spurs removed in May, but that came after he canceled
one surgical procedure. Renowned Dodgers physician Dr. Frank Jobe,
who pioneered the tactics now used in elbow and shoulder surgery,
recommended the Tommy John surgery. Osuna agreed to it last week,
only to stun the Dodgers with his change of mind.

   LOS ANGELES: for the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   David Carter of the Sports Management Group said the message
being sent by Los Angeles officials was important.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in this community are beginning to ask how much is too
much,'' Carter said. ``Gov. Davis, Chadwick and the ownership
groups are saying we are not going to acquiesce to all your
demands. There is a changing of the dynamics and the local
officials are drawing a new line in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important symbolic step to say we are not going to
take it anymore,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials also questioned why the owners were seeking a
short-term gain of a one-time payment of perhaps $3 million, when
it could be looking at much more on an annual basis from television
revenue by putting the team in the nation's second-largest media
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the end this will be media-driven,'' Sloan said.
``I think the networks that televise football will have to put
pressure on the league to say whether they want to be in the
second-largest media market or in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky said the league also had to recognize the different
public attitude in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, this is a city that put on the Olympics with no public
money, and it was the most successful in history,'' he said. ``This
is not Charlottesville or somewhere else where they need football.
We already have football here with UCLA and USC, and several other
professional sports teams. I think the NFL needs Los Angeles more
than we need them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, plans to try to develop other sources
of state revenue began to firm up.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than return to an earlier proposal that would have
diverted all money generated within Exposition Park to be allowed
to raise additional funds, the plan being developed now would
involve tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   The credits would amount to $50 million over 20 years and would
be given for special events held at the Coliseum, such as Super
Bowls or Pro Bowls, that are directly related to having a football
team in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is to be made to the state Senate's president pro
tem, John Burton, D-San Francisco, and Assembly Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, within the next few weeks. Aides to
both officials said they had not been presented with any such
proposal and would not comment. &QL;

METS DEFEAT BREWERS, 9-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The level of opposition has been suspect for three
weeks, but that doesn't matter to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   What is important is the National League East standing. The Mets
are two games in front of Atlanta after Wednesday night's 9-5
victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the first-place Mets (66-43) were more than a game
ahead in the standing was the final day of the 1988 season. The
last time the Mets were 23 games over .500? 1988 again. That was
the last time the Mets qualified for the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have the best record in the National League and trail
Cleveland and Texas by percentage points for the best record in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   So what if Kenny Rogers allowed five runs in six innings in his
second start as a Met? Led by three hits from Edgardo Alfonzo, the
Mets pounded out 17 hits at County Stadium, most of them after the
Braves had lost swiftly, 3-2, in Pittsburgh in 1 hour 48 minutes.
Robin Ventura and Alfonzo each hit a home run to offset the three
that Rogers allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who deserved to win in his first start with the Mets
last Wednesday, is 1-0 since being acquired from Oakland on July
23.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who won five of six games on this road trip, zoomed
past the Braves this week by sweeping a three-game set from the
Brewers. Since the All-Star Game break, the Mets are playing .800
baseball: 16-4. They have played seven series and have won them
all.
</P>
<P>
   None of their opponents, however, were over .500. (The Pirates
reached .500 by beating the Braves.) Their critics will say the
Mets have not beaten anybody, but last season the Mets were
criticized for not being able to beat the teams under .500, which
cost them a wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have been able to beat those teams this year. Still,
the remaining schedule looks challenging: three West Coast trips,
which will include three games each against the Giants and the
Diamondbacks. In September the Mets will play six games each
against the Braves and the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the Mets' No. 4 and 5 hitters did the most
damage. Mike Piazza and Ventura have combined for 5 homers and 14
runs batted in over the last three nights. Ventura homered in all
three games, Piazza in the first two.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's two-run homer in the second inning, off the rookie
right-hander Kyle Peterson, erased the 1-0 lead Jeff Cirillo had
given the Brewers with a one-out homer off Rogers. It was Ventura's
team-leading 25th home run of the season and seventh in his last
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets added another run on Rogers' first regular-season major
league hit, a one-out single to left with runners on first and
third to give himself a 3-1 lead. (He had an infield single for the
Yankees in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series.)
</P>
<P>
   But Rogers, who was not as sharp as he was in his Met debut, hit
Geoff Jenkins with a 2-2 pitch to open the bottom of the second,
then served up a two-run homer to Marquis Grissom, which sailed
over the center-field fence and tied the score, 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. The Brewers' defense is as bad as the Mets' is
good. Piazza singled with one out in the third, took second one out
later when Darryl Hamilton walked, and was being stopped at third
on Benny Agbayani's single to left. The ball bounced off Jenkins's
glove in left, however, and Piazza easily scored the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets left the bases loaded in the inning when Rogers flied
to left. But they scored four runs in the fourth to go up by 8-3.
Piazza singled in two with the bases loaded and nobody out. Rey
Ordonez singled in two more with the bases loaded and two out.
</P>
<P>
   And Rogers had a comfortable lead.
</P>
<P>
   Not for long, again. Before the game, Manager Bobby Valentine
had said Rogers' right hamstring, which had bothered him throughout
his last start, was fine. But Rogers' pitches were up on Wednesday
night. And when Jenkins blasted his 18th home run, with one on and
nobody out in the fourth, it was an 8-5 game.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who was denied the victory last Wednesday when Dennis
Cook allowed a tying home run, needed to go another inning this
evening to qualify for his first N.L. victory, and for a moment in
the fifth, it looked as though he might not make it. But Rogers
induced Jenkins to hit into an inning-ending fielder's choice with
runners on first and second to complete the fifth. And then Rogers
tossed a perfect sixth to complete his night on a high note.

<P>
   Hundreds of times last year, police carrying submachine guns
stormed a building in Arizona, set up a blue tent and cleaned up a
methamphetamine lab.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to taxpayers: $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The busts have more than doubled every year for the past four
years, and as they continue to explode, so will their price tags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meth is poisoning the community,'' said Detective Mike
McCullough of the Phoenix Police Department, ``but killing the
taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   While most people know that meth production in Arizona is on the
rise, they may not realize how much they're paying to fight it. It
costs $8,600 for an average-size lab.
</P>
<P>
   And the cost doesn't even include all the officers necessary for
a bust, officer training, equipment and prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 300 meth labs were dismantled in Arizona by
a federally funded task force.
</P>
<P>
   The meth war is not going to end any time soon, said Jim Molesa,
Phoenix spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Once known as a ``West Coast biker drug,'' experts now say meth
is cropping up in every pocket of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's literally at an epidemic level,'' Molesa said. ``It's the
drug of choice in the metro Phoenix area, but in other in rural
counties as well, from Springerville to Show Low to Sierra Vista.''
</P>
<P>
   Methamphetamine is a drug that produces feelings of mental
alertness and well-being. It can be smoked, snorted, orally
ingested or injected.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty two different chemicals can be cooked together to make
methamphetamine, including anything from brake fluid to drain
cleaner to red phosphorous &UR; _ a highly flammable chemical that can
easily combust when mixed with water or air and a nearby flame.
</P>
<P>
   Once mixed together, the chemicals create toxic fumes that can
lead to liver and kidney failure, severe lung damage and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest threat to residents living near meth labs is an
explosion &UR; caused by the mixture of such volatile chemicals. But
neighbors can also inhale toxic fumes by walking by, or fumes can
travel through air-conditioning units.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biohazard problem is very real. It's misunderstood,'' said
Don Schneidmiller, a Maricopa County Sheriff's Office lieutenant
who works for the task force. ``What's even more scary is the
thought that what if my kids are going down the street and eating
crackers over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the danger meth labs leave behind, law-enforcement
officials try to remove all chemical traces, which raises the cost
of a bust significantly. Some recent high-dollar examples:
</P>
<P>
   In May, officials dismantled a trailer lab in Kingman that had
been producing about three to five pounds of meth every three days
for the past five years. The trailer was destroyed, and the dirt
had to be removed. Cleanup cost was $70,000. Investigators were at
the site for five days, costing an additional $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Officers raided a meth lab in a Tempe condominium near Broadway
Road and Cairo Drive in April. Because the lab had been cooking for
at least six months, much of the building was contaminated.
Officers had to take out the sinks, carpeting, flooring and parts
of the closets and bathrooms. The cost was $23,000.
</P>
<P>
   A lab was found in an attic near 40th Street and Vineyard Road
last winter. Because the lab had been cooking for about three
years, officials had to tear out walls and wood in the attic. It
cost $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Because the federal government realized that most local
departments can't handle this cost, it started the &UR; Maricopa County
Clandestine Lab Task Force &UR; in 1995. The task force includes &UR; 112 law
officers from 35 state and local agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, its work has exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The task force usually busts three to five meth labs in Maricopa
County every week, spending about seven hours at each site.
</P>
<P>
   An average raid has at least 20 primary officers. Those include
special-tactics officers, a safety inspector, chemists, air-quality
and hazardous-materials experts, investigators and those needed for
transportation and cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   A paramedic usually is on standby in a helicopter above.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``This isn't overkill, this is necessary,'' Molesa said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers have to take such precautions because of the nature of
meth users.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a higher degree of violence with meth use,'' said Lt.
Al Thiele of the Phoenix Police Department, who works with the task
force. ``People become extremely paranoid and violent things occur.
They don't sleep for a great deal of time and tend to get a little
testy.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers at the scene are equipped with heavy-duty gear,
including breathing masks, to protect them from hazardous air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still unclear how meth fumes will affect officers at
scenes. Some have developed tuberculosis, respiratory problems,''
said Steve Werner, former project coordinator of the meth task
force.
</P>
<P>
   Werner said officers have collapsed at lab sites. As a result,
the government must pay for officers' physicals every year to make
sure there's no poison in their systems.
</P>
<P>
   The task force recently arrested three people cooking meth in a
west-central Phoenix home.
</P>
<P>
   It was an average-size lab, yet it will likely cost taxpayers
about $11,500 for personnel and initial cleanup, Molesa said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors watched as workers in biohazard suits pulled out
glassware, bottles of drain opener and gallons of yellow acid. A
box was filled with jars of iodine crystals, ph strips and bottle
stoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators will take samples of the materials for
evidence; the rest must be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA contracts with a waste-management company that
incinerates or neutralizes some of the materials. Much of it is
boxed up and shipped to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   An average labs costs from $2,000 to $4,000 just to clean up,
Molesa said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of such labs said they didn't mind the expense.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Rowswell, a neighbor of a recent meth-lab bust, said he
could smell the stench from his house a block away, and he wouldn't
let his son near the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would take a loan out and spend $30,000 to get it the hell
out of here,'' he said. ``It doesn't scare me. It's a relief it's
taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal government pays for most of the primary
investigators and cleanup, local taxpayers must pay for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Fire departments are often called in case of an explosion, local
police supply officers to protect the scene and bomb squads are on
call for booby-trapped sites.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers may also end up paying for the aftermath of a raid.
</P>
<P>
   Children are at a higher risk of child abuse and neglect in a
meth house, and may become exposed to dangerous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   When there's nowhere else to go, Child Protective Services steps
in to care for them.
</P>
<P>
   It happens all the time, Werner said, ``Kids. They're the
casualty of the meth war.''
</P>
<P>
   And for every pound of meth produced, five to six pounds of
chemical waste are left behind, according to the Center for
Substance Abuse Treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Justice recently found that meth
cookers have little regard for the environment, saying in a study
that ``most take little care when disposing of the residue from
meth cooking and tend to pour it down the drain or dump it in the
dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Those toxins can contaminate groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, a lab in a shed caught fire near Interstate 17
and Deer Valley Road.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix firefighters unknowingly sprayed water on the fire,
creating a reaction with red phosphorous. The shed exploded,
causing toxic liquid to seep into the ground. Dirt 2 feet deep in a
30-foot perimeter was hauled away, costing taxpayers $63,000 in
cleanup alone.
</P>
<P>
   The task force is kicking off an advertising campaign this month
to educate people about the chemicals bought for meth production,
and what's left behind after a lab has been dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Officers say it's a necessary effort, but a needless fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already the doormat for illicit drugs into the United
States, now we're known for clandestine labs,'' Molesa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly an expense we can afford to do without.''  &QL;

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ When a team finishes 8-8 for three
consecutive seasons, fingers have to be pointed in some direction.
Among the players, it is usually the quarterback who is singled
out. But in the case of the Tennessee Titans, it would be unfair to
blame Steve McNair.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who enters his fifth season with a franchise recognized
more for moving than for winning, threw for 3,228 yards and 15
touchdowns last season, not bad but not overly impressive. However,
he threw only 10 interceptions, five fewer than in 1997 and the
fewest ever by an Oilers starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   What began to set McNair apart last season wasn't yards passing,
touchdowns or interceptions. What got the attention of defensive
coordinators around the NFL was the way he established himself as a
dangerous two-minute quarterback who excels near the end of games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the game's on the line, I want the ball in my hands,''
McNair said between two-a-day practices at training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Against AFC Central rivals Pittsburgh and Jacksonville, McNair
engineered scoring drives in the last two minutes to pull out
victories. At Tampa Bay, McNair scored on a 71-yard run to secure a
win over the Bucs.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't McNair's fault when the then-Oilers blew games against
Seattle and Chicago. He led them to a late field goal that should
have been enough to beat the Seahawks, but the defense collapsed in
the final seconds. Against Chicago, McNair guided the Oilers to a
tying touchdown, but the special teams fell apart in the last
minute to cost them a win.
</P>
<P>
   Why has McNair been so successful in the last two minutes? There
are different theories, and all make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's successful because he knows what to do in the two-minute
drill,'' Titans coach Jeff Fisher says. ``It's something we work on
a lot. Steve makes very few mistakes in the two-minute drill. He
understands clock management. He doesn't throw interceptions in
pressure situations like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our two-minute offense (before halftime and the end of
regulation), Steve put us into position to score on 10 of 17
drives. Of those 10 drives, we scored eight times (five field
goals, three touchdowns) and missed two field goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Les Steckel watches every play of practice
and games over and over. He sees things in McNair that others might
overlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, Steve's fearless, confident and courageous,''
Steckel says. ``Then, you have to realize how mobile he is. There's
no doubt that he's the best running quarterback in the league. In
those situations, not only can he make plays by running, but he can
use his mobility to buy some time while a receiver gets open.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair's mobility and power as a runner get almost as much
attention as his right arm. He has rushed for 1,233 yards over the
past two seasons, more than any other NFL quarterback. Many of his
best runs came on third down or in the last two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a matter of me using my instincts and mobility to
make plays,'' McNair says. ``I feel like I can get a lot more done
if I don't have a lot on my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those situations, they (coaches) let the players play. We
don't go to the line of scrimmage and have to think. We have our
plays that we run in the two-minute offense. We work on them in
practice. Everybody knows them. Everybody knows what the
adjustments are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm competitive, and I don't like to lose, and I can do extra
things in the two-minute offense. I can do things you won't see in
the first and second quarters. And I think my teammates have
confidence in me in those situations.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Titans are trying to become more consistent on
offense and are working hard to find ways to avoid blowing games in
the end, a habit that has been difficult to quit over the past 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little things make a big difference,'' McNair says. ``If we do
things right in the first three quarters, maybe it won't come down
to the last two minutes of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair has been a regular starter for the past two seasons. One
thing the coaches have ingrained in him is to not force the ball
into coverage. Over his team's past 11 games, McNair suffered only
five interceptions. During one six-game stretch, he threw only two
touchdown passes but the team was 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of last season, the coaches have been working hard
to find a way to throw the ball down the field with more
effectiveness. McNair had only two pass completions of more than 40
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We attempted to throw the deep ball as much as anyone, but we
didn't complete as many as we wanted to for one reason or
another,'' Fisher says. ``Steve's not going to pass up an open
receiver to try to force the ball deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve doesn't throw the ball into coverage, but he wants to
make things happen down the field. We have to take advantage of our
one-on-one situations. We have to give our receivers a chance to
make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   If receiver Yancey Thigpen stays healthy and Kevin Dyson
develops, McNair will have a better chance of completing longer
passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried it a lot last year but didn't take advantage of it
the way we should have,'' McNair says. ``I didn't throw long as
much as I wanted, but I think that's going to change. If we can
throw it deep, it'll open up a lot of things underneath and take
some pressure off (Eddie George).''
</P>
<P>
   One NFL personnel director said the Titans should line up McNair
in the shotgun with running back George next to him and four
receivers in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine what it would be like to try to stop McNair
and George in the two-minute offense for the entire game?'' the
personnel director said. ``Thank God it's too much like the
run-and-shoot for them to actually do.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CYNTHIA Cooper sports almost matching large, blotchy bruises on
both her upper arms, the result of what she calls the WNBA's latest
``let anybody but Coop beat us'' defensive conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   What we don't see is the contusion on Cooper's heart, and the
pain it causes her daily. The Comets' ``old pro,'' as coach Van
Chancellor calls her, may still be the centerpiece of the best team
in the brief history of women's professional basketball in the
United States, but this season is beating her down. Big-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough _ physically, mentally and emotionally,''
Cooper says of a year that, outwardly, wears a familiar happy face.
The naysaying notwithstanding, another Comets end-of-summer
coronation appears likely with the WNBA's twice champs hellbent on
lapping the league.
</P>
<P>
   And Coop, 36 years young, remains a leading candidate to
three-peat as Most Valuable Player despite the double- and
triple-teaming roughhouse tactics everyone has begun to employ
against her.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper is a marked woman, just as the Comets are a marked team.
However, blessed with an inordinate reserve of talent, confidence
and resilience, they're 20-4 and Coop has found a way to score just
a shade under 22 points per game, again tops in the WNBA and only a
hair off her pace of the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento game Monday was typical. Hogtied by the Monarchs
in the first half, she set her jaw, ratcheted up her resolve
several notches and knocked down 18 points in the second 20 minutes
as the Comets escaped the clutches of a troublesome opponent that's
on the short list of teams presumed capable of bringing their reign
to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, it has become popular to disrespect the Comets these
days. Women's basketball has arrived to the point that the talking
heads have taken notice, and lots of them apparently believe the
Comets are ripe for a fall. Of late, Los Angeles is the trendy pick
to go the distance. Sacramento and New York get votes, too. It's
difficult to find an ``expert'' who believes the Comets will go
3-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Comets' 71 victories (vs. 18 losses) since
the WNBA's inception are almost 50 percent more than any other
franchise has posted.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor, nonetheless, remains a true believer. His faith in
the Comets will be unwavering until it's proven to be unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `C' teams always save their `A' games for us,'' he said,
his voice rising like a TV evangelist's. ``Everyone wants to blow
us off our perch. But this team flat knows how to win. Most teams
are good at finding ways to lose. Our team is good at finding ways
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, what the Comets are doing would
amount to a resounding second encore, for both the team and Cooper.
Given that Kim Perrot, the scrappy little point guard who, against
rather long odds, willed herself to a front-and-center spot during
the consecutive championship runs, hasn't been part of the
proceedings, it's all the more amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Were Perrot simply injured, she would provide a measure of
ancillary inspiration to her teammates and especially to Coop,
Kim's best friend and basketball soul mate. But Perrot isn't down
in Mexico seeking a cure for a sprained ankle or a wrenched knee.
She has a virulent cancer in her body, and even a third title will
hardly make everything all right in the Comets' orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong got his miracle, which certainly inspires hope
for Perrot's recovery. But as sick as he was, he wasn't as sick as
Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Ask either Chancellor or Cooper about Perrot, and their eyes
reflexively water up. Whatever great things the Comets accomplish
over the next month, the result will have a melancholy backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's still very much a part of us,'' Chancellor said. ``You
bet we miss her. Man, do we ever. She was my coach on the floor
and, more important, she was the heart of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper has been speaking to Perrot every day, and she was
excused from practice Wednesday to travel to Mexico to see her.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper tries to sound optimistic, although it's not a subject
she is overly comfortable addressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim's doing OK,'' she said softly. ``She has good days and bad
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was asked if Perrot might see the Comets' gaudy 20-4
record and feel irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Coop said. ``Kim knows better than that. She
knows what she means to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: Cooper said ``means,'' not ``meant.'' While the Comets,
collectively, may not have dedicated their every droplet of sweat
to winning for Kim, she remains a huge spiritual presence in the
locker room. You suspect another title, should it come to pass,
will be celebrated with equal parts satisfaction and sadness.
</P>
<P>
   There figures to be a tear for every cheer.

PERU TAKES NEW STEP TO DIMINISH AUTHORITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ President Alberto Fujimori on Wednesday withdrew a
team of lawyers who were to represent the government before an
international court in a suit filed by an Israeli-born television
station owner charging he was stripped of his Peruvian citizenship
solely because of his channel's reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's action comes three weeks after he persuaded Congress
to enact a resolution partially disavowing the court, the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which is affiliated with
the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Fujimori said he could not accept a decision made
by the court in June calling on Peru to retry four Chileans now
serving life sentences for treason and terrorism committed as
members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. The Peruvian
president said any retrial would open the door to the freeing of
hundreds of terrorists and would endanger security.
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori's new decision, announced in the official
government gazette tersely and without explanation, extends Peru's
disavowal of the court's jurisdiction from matters of terrorism to
a civil case that has drawn international attention to the
president's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves Baruch Ivcher, the owner of the Peruvian
television station Frecuencia Latina, which broadcast several
reports in 1996 and 1997 critical of the Fujimori government. One
stinging report said the government was spying on journalists and
opposition figures. Another gave details on tax forms filed by
Vladimiro Montesinos, the chief of the government intelligence
services, showing a rise in income from $8,500 to $600,000 in only
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after, the government announced that Ivcher had never
been naturalized and therefore had no legal right to own his
station.
</P>
<P>
   Frecuencia Latina was handed over to minority owners known to be
friendlier to the government. Ivcher has lived in exile in Israel
for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Ivcher was tried in absentia and convicted of
customs fraud. He faces a sentence of 12 years in jail. Ivcher's
former station manager, Jose Arrieta, has fled the country after
his taxes were audited and he and his family received death
threats.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights court, which is based in Costa Rica, decided in
June that the four Chileans did not receive a fair trial because
they were tried in a courtroom in which the judge wore a mask and
his lawyers did not have the right to cross examine witnesses. The
court is also scheduled to hear a case brought by three judges who
were removed from office last year by Fujimori after they ruled
that the constitution prohibited him from running for a third
consecutive term.

   SYRIA-ISRAEL (Quneitra, Syria) _ From here, only a few coils of
barbed wire lie between Syria and its land, occupied by Israel for
32 years. To Syrians, the high-tech observation posts on
surrounding hilltops seem to laugh down at them, a boast about who
still controls the Golan Heights. The streets are all but deserted,
off-limits to most Syrians. The buildings are rubble, sacked by
Israeli forces years ago. But such is the mood in Syria today that
when visitors look into the middle distance, they say they see
prospects for an Israeli-Syrian peace that may be nearer than ever
before. By Douglas Jehl.

them a few months before. On Sunday, despite U.S. promises of
protection, all the 350 or so Serbs of Zitinje demanded and

TOLEDO TRIES TO PUT SCANDAL BEHIND HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like a comic who had thoroughly rehearsed his
routine, UCLA coach Bob Toledo stepped up to the microphone to
address reporters Wednesday and calmly delivered his punch line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry I'm late. I had to valet-park the car,'' Toledo joked, a
reference to the parking scandal that engulfed his program in
recent weeks and culminated with nine players pleading no contest
to illegally acquiring handicapped placards.
</P>
<P>
   Since these were Toledo's first public remarks over the
controversy, he started off with a disarming comment. But later, he
seriously addressed the issue at the Pacific-10 Conference's annual
media day in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't condone it. I was disappointed. I'm embarrassed,''
Toledo said. ``They got punished greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the protesters at last week's court hearing might
dispute that last statement, but Toledo is trying to focus on
football now, along with the other nine coaches who attended the
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I think is important is you've got to continue to
educate the kids, scold them when they're wrong, but continue to
love them,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo is trying to get ready for training camp, knowing that
nine players will be suspended from the first two games because of
the handicapped-parking scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we've only got 68 scholarship players and 18 of them
are true freshman,'' Toledo said. ``If you don't know the reason,
you've been in a cave.''
</P>
<P>
   The other news of the day concerned USC, and in a sense, it was
old news.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett was unhappy that wide receiver R. Jay
Soward has made only a handful of appearances at summer workouts.
Big shock there, since Soward missed most of the winter workouts
earlier this year and was briefly AWOL from the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affects me with great disappointment,'' Hackett said.
``After he decided to come back for his senior season, you would
think his attitude would be, `Let's prepare to have a great senior
year.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   USC tailback Chad Morton said he has seen Soward twice all
summer, although Soward has appeared for some media interviews and
photo sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he's not in trouble, that's fine. He's hanging out,
doing little things on the side,'' Morton said. ``He can still be a
kid for a year. There's no bad feelings toward him.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward's eligibility, which always gives cause for pause around
USC, should be better known in the next few days when he completes
USC summer school. He is expected to pass, but nothing is
official.But as even a ``disappointed'' Hackett pointed out
Wednesday, ``once we get to (training camp in) Irvine, it doesn't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: If Soward is in shape, he will be expected to
return punts, kickoffs and be the Trojans' most explosive offensive
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   USC was picked second in a media preseason conference poll; UCLA
was a close third. But both schools were far behind Arizona, which
was easily chosen to win the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Former Taft player DaShon Polk, now a Wildcats linebacker, was
cautious about the poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to look at that as nothing,'' Polk said. ``If we
take it seriously, that's the worst thing that can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coach Dick Tomey was equally reserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing guaranteed you (just) because you've won a few
games last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bygones? Oregon coach Mike Bellotti and Washington coach Rick
Neuheisel had a brief conversation that apparently was intended to
bury any impression of hard feelings. The two have feuded since
Oregon and Colorado played in the 1995 Cotton Bowl, and it
escalated when Neuheisel's staff illegally contacted Oregon
recruits during an NCAA dead period after Neuheisel was hired by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a bitter relationship with anyone,'' Bellotti
said. ``I see it as having a lack of tolerance for breaking the
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Hackett said USC running back Malaefou MacKenzie is
also playing receiver occasionally during his summer workouts and
could be used at that position this season. . . . Toledo said all
four UCLA quarterbacks (Drew Bennett, Scott McEwan, Cory Paus, Ryan
McCann) will get an opportunity to win the starting position.
``Bennett, I think, is the most athletic,'' wide receiver Danny
Farmer said. ``I think whoever it is will fit in nice.'' &QL;

EMERGENCY SPENDING MEASURES WOULD EAT UP MOST OF NEXT YEAR'S
SURPLUS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 7th graf for updating on passage of House emergency measure)  (See also TAX-CONGRESS and DEBT-BUYBACK) 
(sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress on Wednesday night moved closer to
spending most of the projected surplus in next year's budget with
two ``emergency'' measures to aid farmers and conduct the 2000
census.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, preparing to pass a $61 billion agriculture spending
bill for fiscal 2000, approved a separate $7.4 billion emergency
measure for farmers. The House, debating a $36 billion spending
bill to finance the Commerce, State and Justice Departments next
year, included a $4.5 billion emergency measure to pay for the
census.
</P>
<P>
   Next year was supposed to bring a federal budget surplus of
about $14 billion, the first in 30 years. Wednesday's emergency
measures, which total nearly $12 billion and are likely to pass in
some form, are a strong sign that the surplus may be largely spent
before it materializes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is already gone,'' said Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin,
the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency spending, intended to address unexpected problems, is
a device that allows Congress to spend money beyond its budget. The
money can come from two places: cutting other programs or spending
out of surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   But most domestic programs, except for the military, already
have been cut or frozen. There are surplus Social Security funds,
but Congress has deemed them untouchable, for now. That leaves one
alternative: tapping into next year's projected black ink.
</P>
<P>
   The House also passed yet another emergency spending measure on
Wednesday night. On a 246-to-176 vote, it approved $270 million to
cover $1.5 billion in loan guarantees for steel, ol and gas
companies. The bill, already approved by the Senate, now goes to
the president. The money would come from across-the-board cuts in
domestic programs in the current fiscal 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Obey called the Republicans' designation of the census
funds as an emergency a crime against common sense and ``a
prescription for chaos.'' The law says emergency spending is
supposed to finance unforseeable crises. The Constitution says the
government must carry out the census every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wholesale breach of the emergency designation would not be
too smart,'' said Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., and the chairman of
the Appropriations Committee. But the creative accounting for
census funds was commanded by the House Republican leadership as a
way of appearing to hew to the strict limits on spending created by
Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has not declared financing the census an emergency.
Nor has the House matched the Senate's emergency measure for
farmers. The issues, like most of this year's spending bills, will
be resolved in a House-Senate conference in September.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to complete debate on the $36 billion
Commerce, State and Justice Department spending bill on Thursday.
The bill is more than likely to be vetoed by Clinton, according to
White House officials and House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It cut the president's spending request by nearly $3 billion. It
withheld $1 billion from the Commerce Department and another $1
billion from Clinton's program to help pay for local police forces.
It denied $506 million sought by the State Department and cut $329
million requested for the Department of Justice, including $182
million from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also bars the FBI from spending money on a program
called Fidnet, a new initiative to create a computer monitoring
system with the stated intent of combating ``cyberterrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill places legislative roadblocks against paying part of
the $1 billion in back dues the United States owes the United
Nations and also cuts back programs for civil rights and
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, as written, slashed the budget for the Legal Services
Corp., which defends poor people in court, from $300 million to
$141 million. But on Wednesday the House voted, 242 to 178, to
restore most of that money, leaving the legal-aid group with a $250
million budget, a $50 million cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate earlier approved by voice vote a $7.4 billion
emergency aid package for American farmers. Republicans blocked two
attempts by Democrats to pass larger emergency aid packages, just
as they stymied an even bigger $10.8 billion plan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency aid package contains $5.6 billion in direct
payments to farmers, $400 million in crop insurance, and hundreds
of millions of dollars in various subsidies for livestock, cattle,
sugar beets, soybeans and other crops.
</P>
<P>
   In other votes, the Senate set aside an amendment, by a vote of
66 to 33, that would have ended price supports and loans for
American sugar growers. Senators also failed to break a filibuster
on a bill that would extend the Northeast Dairy Compact, which lets
farmers set milk prices, by another year.

AIKMAN FOCUSES HIS ENERGY ON 4TH TITLE, NOT NFL LEGACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ With the 1999 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game
days away now, Troy Aikman said that he gives no thought to his
place in NFL history and that winning a fourth Super Bowl with the
Cowboys is what burns inside his belly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've surpassed my wildest expectations in the National
Football League, and it's still not enough,'' Aikman said during a
one-hour, small-group interview session at the team's Midwestern
State University training-camp site Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's first visit to the Canton, Ohio, pro football shrine
will be to play in Monday night's NFL preseason opener between the
Cowboys and the new Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said this is a better team than last year's team that
finished 10-6 after completing an unprecedented sweep of NFC East
teams to win the division, only to lose in the first round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and others continue to adapt better and better
to Chan Gailey's Offense, The Sequel. He added that it will be
important for tight end David LaFleur, who missed three games
because of injuries last season, to keep himself on the field.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Michael Irvin remains his ``go-to guy,'' and that
the rest of the receiving corps _ Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail, Ernie
Mills, James McKnight, Jeff Ogden and rookie standout Wane McGarity
_ need Aikman to be ``not too tough and more supportive'' with a
group that leads the way in unfamiliarity among teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the return of center Mark Stepnoski will improve
the team's blocking schemes and running game, adding, ``The only
guy who wanted Step back here more than I did might have been (left
guard) Larry Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear of losing, the fear of embarrassment, is what
motivates me each and every year,'' Aikman said. ``At times, I may
be too much of a perfectionist on the field. I don't know if that's
always a good thing. It has helped me be the player that I am, but
I wish I could harness it a little better. I expect a lot. I'm very
demanding, maybe sometimes unrealistically.''
</P>
<P>
   As for thinking of himself as a future Hall of Famer, Aikman
said, ``I've never counted on being in the Hall of Fame. If someday
it happens, I would be as honored as anybody ... but I've never
given it any thought. ''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman turns 33 years old when the Cowboys play at Arizona on
Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I feel good,'' Aikman said. ``Of course,
(ex-QB-turned-TV sports anchor) Babe Laufenberg told me awhile back
that when you start saying you're in the best shape of your life,
it means only you're getting older, and I refuse to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Aikman has never played in a pass-oriented offense in
his NFL 10 seasons, he would need to keep playing another 10 or 11
seasons after Dan Marino retired to even make a run at any of
Marino's NFL all-time passing records.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who is signed through 2007, did say Wednesday that he
plans to play ``another three to five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who came into the league in 1989, or six years after
Marino, has thrown for 30,000 fewer yards and 267 fewer touchdowns
than the NFL's all-time passing leader. But what Aikman has that
Marino doesn't are three Super Bowl rings. Marino lost his only
Super Bowl appearance _ 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't throw the ball 30 or 40 times a game,'' Aikman said.
``I've never played in a system where the offense has been based
around the passing game. But if I can leave the game with the
respect of my teammates, my peers and the coaches around the
league, then I would have had a successful career.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has a .610 career winning percentage (94-60) despite a
1-14 record in his first 15 starts. In postseason play, he's 11-3,
including 3-0 in Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win the Super Bowl as bad today as when I won the
first one,'' Aikman said. ``I don't concern myself with my place in
history. I think winning is what I'm paid to do. I don't think
Jerry (Jones) pays me to go out and throw for 400 yards a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a season that statistically could have been his best
if he hadn't missed five games with a fractured collarbone, Aikman
seems to have arrived at a place in his NFL life where he should be
able to feel good about what he has done. But he won't let himself,
not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as intense about the game, as driven, as impassionate, as
I've ever been,'' he said. ``Sometimes I wish I wasn't as intense
about it. Maybe some of the push that I have, sometimes I wish it
wasn't quite as strong as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is what it is, and that hasn't changed. I don't ever
think it will.'' nn

AIKMAN'S HAPPY, HE'S SNAPPY, AND HE WANTS TO WIN AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ In his line of work, Troy Aikman can
never perform the miracle of pleasing all the people all the time.
But it might just be possible to appease some of the people some of
the time if Aikman would do the following three things in 1999:
</P>
<P>
   (1) Win another Super Bowl, therefore allowing Dallas Cowboys
fans worldwide to regain their rightful title of the most spoiled
and obnoxious in football.
</P>
<P>
   (2) Get married at the Texas Stadium 50-yard line at halftime of
the Thanksgiving Day game, therefore peeling back the cover on a
private life that is an obsession with a segment of nosy fans and
media.
</P>
<P>
   (3) Smile more for the network sideline cameras. And this last
item is very important, particularly if it would finally shut up
those sports talk-show callers who have agonized for years over
whether Aikman is enjoying his work.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, of course, the odds are very long on any of the three
actually happening. Start off by completely eliminating No. 2, but
as far as No. 3, Aikman did mention here Wednesday how he wished at
times he wasn't so intense. Could a sideline smile actually be
coming this season?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the football part. In a wide-ranging interview
Wednesday, Aikman talked openly on many subjects, including the
Cowboys' chance of returning this season to a Super Bowl. No
surprise here: He's very optimistic,
</P>
<P>
   meaning his public stance is the same as it has been for the
past seven or eight summers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, however, haven't been within smelling distance of
the Super Bowl in the past three seasons. And by most national and
local estimates, they couldn't locate Atlanta, site of this
season's ultimate game, with a map-reading bloodhound.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman did want to stress, however, that this summer he even
believes his own football words. ``Maybe there was a time a few
years back where that wasn't the case,'' he added, smiling. ``I
would come into camp trying to be optimistic, but...''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you get that picture.
</P>
<P>
   What hasn't changed is that Aikman still has a great belief in
team owner Jerry Jones. But now he also adds head coach Chan Gailey
to his list of most admired. He looks at the team's restocked
talent level, and he bounces that off what went wrong offensively
at the end of last season. And so he talks confidently of ample
room for legitimate personal optimism.
</P>
<P>
   And then he also judged the quarterback, while also defending
last season's sudden offensive slump in December and January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel my best years are ahead of me,'' he said, and spoke of
adding five more seasons, or at least three, to what has already
been a 10-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my game has slipped,'' Aikman added. ``I think
I'm at the same level. I'm not saying I'm the same as when I was
25, but physically, I feel well.''
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is not something Aikman has ever worn on his sleeve,
trying to trick people. What you saw, you saw. But now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy where I am,'' he said. ``This is a good time
professionally and a good time personally. I'm as intense as I've
ever been, and sometimes I wish I wasn't. But I want to win a Super
Bowl today as much as I did the first one.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people who are close to Aikman, and that's only a
few, say they've never seen him with a brighter outlook. Part of
that is the football thing. Part of that is his recent engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm engaged and very happy,'' he said, cutting if off at that.
This might be a result of his privacy surfacing, or it might be a
intense displeasure with the tabloid-like journalism that followed
when he became engaged in early July.
</P>
<P>
   When you are Troy Aikman, life can be good even though normal
life is impossible. Such is the territory.
</P>
<P>
   What won't change is the intensity on the football field. He
spoke freely of being driven by the fear of being embarrassed, and
how he was embarrassed by the lack of offensive performance in the
Arizona playoff loss.
</P>
<P>
   But in the good games, when the network cameras seek a sideline
smile, well...
</P>
<P>
   ``See there, I'm smiling just talking about it,'' he said. ``If
that's always going to be the No. 1 complaint about me, I'm
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is what all those talk-show callers want to
know. Is he happy?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bizarre thing,'' said Aikman, meaning the question.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, with the Cowboys on Super Bowl rolls, Aikman
talked of not playing long into his 30s. He's now 32, and
retirement is way off on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want our football team to get back the respectability it
once had,'' said Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Only then would some of the people be happy some of the time.

THIS DOGFIGHT PITS BLUE ANGELS VS. MICROSOFT CODE JOCKEYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A dozen bullet holes in the windshield, no rudder and
a few howling dives into the ground would normally be serious
concerns to Blue Angels pilot Lt. Doug Verissimo.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the lead solo pilot for the Navy's crack
formation-flying squadron laughed off those problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the heck. It's only a game,'' Verissimo, 34, said.
</P>
<P>
   And he was right.
</P>
<P>
   In town for Seafair, where they'll perform Saturday and Sunday,
Verissimo and fellow pilot Lt. Cmdr. Kiron O'Connor, 35, spent part
of their only day off here playing Microsoft's Combat Flight
Simulator.
</P>
<P>
   The squadron arrived earlier this week to plan and practice
their performances, which will take place from noon to 12:45 p.m.
Saturday and Sunday along south Lake Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the pilots took this game seriously. They had to, because itpitted flyboys against code jockeys: the very programmers who had
created Microsoft's World War II dogfight simulator.
</P>
<P>
   In a public relations brainstorm, Microsoft invited the pilots
and 18 support staff out to the Redmond, Wash., campus across Lake
Washington to take on Tucker Hatfield, the game's program manager,
and developer Matt Ployhar.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots had the advantage of experience _ but in their
Boeing/McDonnell Douglas FA-18 Hornets, not the P-51
propeller-powered fighters used in Microsoft's consumer-oriented
game.
</P>
<P>
   So a half-hour passed before Verissimo realized his Microsoft
feedback-enhanced joystick works as a rudder when twisted. He is
used to conventional rudder pedals (which a Microsoftie hinted are
on the way).
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the P-51s, whose guns fire 300 yards, the FA-18s
aren't armed, carrying only smoke pods.
</P>
<P>
   The developers had the advantage of insiders' knowledge and
hours of practice. Still, they were nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is scary,'' Hatfield admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Who won? The ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ground always has all the advantages,'' Verissimo said,
crashing yet again.
</P>
<P>
   All four participants managed to down each other repeatedly
during the one-hour session. No one kept score.
</P>
<P>
   Verissimo is one of the Angels' two solo pilots, who cut loose
when the other four fly in the Diamond formation. O'Connor flies in
position No. 3 within the formations.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots praised the game's realistic imaging and scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's fun, they said, it can't match the G forces, the
Mach 1.8 speed or the sheer exhilaration of the FA-18s.
</P>
<P>
   For anything close to that, they had to go down the hall, to the
bank of stereo-enhanced Midtown Madness driving simulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now those are some great games!'' said support staffer Petty
Officer Stephen Jason.

GORE, SON TAKE SECRET GETAWAY TO NEW HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vice President Al Gore and his son are vacationing on
Mount Rainier as part of a private, unpublicized family visit, an
official at the White House said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the visit, a senior member of Gore's staff said
Wednesday night, ``The vice president is on vacation in the West
with his son,'' Albert Gore III. ``Beyond that, I cannot comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, an avid jogger and hiker, told the Post-Intelligencer last
September that he was eager to climb the 14,411-foot-high volcano
at some point in 1999, if he could spare the time.
</P>
<P>
   The White House official who acknowledged that Gore was on
Rainier would not comment for attribution. He said the trip has
been kept so secret that even many senior staff and presidential
campaign aides were not informed of it. A Democratic Party adviser
confirmed that account of the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's presidential campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, told a
meeting in Washington, D.C., Wednesday that Gore was enjoying
``private time'' and would be back in the capital on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   John Krambrink, chief ranger at Mount Rainier National Park,
said Wednesday night: ``We just can't confirm that the vice
president is on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard rumblings even from my own staff that the vice
president may be climbing the mountain,'' Krambrink added. ``We
have had the Secret Service contact us, and we've had the
communications people contact us. We did invite him to the Aug. 12
celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   A week from Thursday, the 238,000-acre national park will
celebrate its centennial with a ceremony at Paradise on the south
side of Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   Krambrink said the vice president's name was not on lists of
clients supplied by guide services now leading climbs of the
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's son, now 16 years old, was hit by a car, thrown 30 feet
and severely injured as the family was leaving a baseball game at
Baltimore's Memorial Stadium 10 years ago. The episode in part
galvanized Gore to write his best-selling book ``Earth in the
Balance.''
</P>
<P>
   A runner who has completed the Marine Corps Marathon in
Washington, D.C., and competed in Seattle's 1998 Race for the Cure,
Gore has talked extensively about the Mount Rainier climb with Rep.
Norm Dicks, D-Wash. Dicks is a close Gore friend and fellow
basketball player in the House gym.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Dicks had planned to spend time at the mountain late
last summer. But the plan was thwarted by security complications
involving an official visit, and because Sen. Patty Murray,
D-Wash., wanted Gore in Seattle for what one Dicks aide described
as ``a blue suit event.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, during the September visit, that he was ``looking
forward'' to the climb but voiced surprise at the amount of time
required to learn such mountaineering safety techniques as
self-arrest on steep snow, and the two-day climb of the mountain
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa! In other words, we need to block four days for this?''
Gore asked.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's athletic plans have also been influenced by
political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, Gore was persuaded by his daughters
Karenna and Kristin to run in the Marine Corps Marathon, which ends
with a climb up to the Iwo Jima Memorial at Arlington National
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president later joked in a Runner's World magazine
interview that he could see the newspaper heading, ``Gore drops
out,'' if he did not complete the race. ``In my business, there are
good metaphors and bad metaphors,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gore paddled into some controversy during an outing
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   He was maneuvering a canoe along the Connecticut River for a
photo opportunity, but he had some help staying afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Utility officials, saying they were acting on a request by the
Connecticut River Joint Commission, opened a dam and released about
4 billion gallons to raise the level of the river so Gore's canoe
wouldn't get stuck in low water during the campaign visit.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore spokesman said no one on Gore's campaign staff had asked
for the water to be released.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Gore has still been able to enjoy a pleasure
that he will probably have to relinquish if he wins the White House
next year _ the ability to take private vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went off to the Caribbean one year, and we couldn't reach
him at all,'' said a former aide who now lives in Seattle. ``He
learned to scuba dive, and we knew magazines would be interested.
But what we heard was nothing doing. He was gone. He was out of the
loop.''

ISMAIL FALLS ON LEFT SHOULDER, BUT INJURY IS ONLY A SPRAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys survived a scare of
sorts Wednesday when prized free-agent signee Raghib Ismail fell on
his left shoulder after catching a deep pass from quarterback Troy
Aikman during the morning practice.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail got up and threw his helmet in disgust before being taken
off the field by the Cowboys' training staff. Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones ran down from the observation deck.
</P>
<P>
   Good news of sorts came when Ismail's injury was diagnosed as a
sprained shoulder. He is listed as day-to-day by team trainers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said Ismail will likely be
out for at least a week _ sidelining him for today's Blue-White
scrimmage and Monday's preseason opener against the Cleveland
Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who brought in Ismail to juice up the Cowboys' offense,
knows it could have been worse. Ismail should be ready for the
Cowboys' second preseason game against the Oakland Raiders on Aug.
15.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of watching (players) fall down, you can tell when
it might be bad...,'' Gailey said. ``It wasn't one of those type
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Mills will replace Ismail in the starting lineup opposite
receiver Michael Irvin.
LIVE ACTION IN SCRIMMAGE
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey said the two things the Cowboys hope to accomplish
in tonight's Blue-White scrimmage, set for 8 at Wichita Falls'
Memorial Stadium, is to get some live action for his first-team
units and see some of the younger players perform under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the offensive and defensive starters) really have not
been able to go 100 percent out there in practice,'' Gailey said.
``You want to see that happen. The next thing you want to see is
the young guys who have to play on the first team like (rookie
guard Solomon Page) and the backups who are vying for positions.
You want to see them live and find out if they can make plays when
it counts under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the first part of the scrimmage will be more like a
practice, as the Cowboys need to install some things in the
red-zone offense. Once the scrimmage starts, it will consist of
roughly 36 to 40 plays.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive and defensive starters will go for 10 plays. The
reserves will go for about 12 plays of team scrimmaging, followed
by some goal-line and red-zone work before finishing with more team
scrimmaging from the reserves. TUCKER CATCHING ON
</P>
<P>
   Former TCU receiver Jason Tucker's play in training camp has
been noticed by Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason has been a pleasant surprise for me,'' Gailey said. ``I
like what I've seen from the guy. He's dropped a couple of passes,
but he's made a couple of fantastic catches. Over the course of the
next two or three weeks, we'll be able to determine which is true _
the drops or the catches.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Gailey, who said Tucker has got a little natural talent
and a feel for the game, said the wide-out has already made enough
of an impression to be a viable candidate for a roster spot.
LIGHTNING STRIKES
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' second workout Wednesday was cut short by about an
hour because of lightning at around 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught of wind and rain that followed reminded
training-camp visitors of a scene from last year when the winds
from torrential thunderstorms were so bad that the inflated Pepsi
Ball blew across town.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' marketing staff was on the ball, so to speak, this
time.
</P>
<P>
   They had the Pepsi advertisement deflated just before the storm
hit. nn

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Five years after the Clinton administration hammered
out a landmark plan to settle legal and environmental disputes over
logging across the Pacific Northwest, the region's timber wars are
flaring up again.
</P>
<P>
   The same federal judge who once issued rulings to protect the
northern spotted owl has now blocked nine major logging deals and
threatened to stop dozens of others by declaring that federal
officials have failed to take proper steps to ensure that other
species are being protected as well.
</P>
<P>
   Siding with environmentalists and enraging the forest industry,
U.S. District Judge William Dwyer of Seattle ruled Monday that the
U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management had
unlawfully neglected to conduct detailed wildlife surveys on
federal forest land, as required by the 1994 compact, before
approving contracts allowing logging of parcels in old-growth
forests west of the Cascade Mountains in Washington and Oregon and
in northwestern California.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling could ultimately affect logging on half a million
acres or more of federal land.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration brokered the compromise in 1994 under
pressure from environmentalists and the logging industry. The judge
lifted a ban on logging on about a third of remaining federally
owned old-growth forests. In his latest ruling, Dwyer declared that
the agencies' actions under the plan were ``arbitrary and contrary
to the plain language'' of that plan.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer's ruling this week effectively put the land agencies back
under a degree of court jurisdiction until they can show they are
doing a better job of monitoring logging's effects on 77 animal and
plant species, including rodents, snails, salamanders, mollusks and
wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the species are considered indicators of the overall
health of the old-growth forest ecosystem. Under terms of the 1994
plan, all were supposed to be intensively surveyed by the federal
agencies, which say they believe they have followed those terms.
But the environmentalists, in their suit, said the agencies had
failed to do complete surveys before granting logging permission.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer's ruling has the immediate effect of blocking logging
plans for about 100 million board feet of timber. But even more
broadly, the judge indicated that his court's approval would be
needed before new logging could occur under about 200 other deals
in the region. If upheld on appeal, after a likely challenge from
the industry, the ruling could significantly curtail logging in the
majority of contracts approved by the federal officials in the last
three years in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was hailed as a ``blockbuster victory'' by one of the
lawyers for the 13 environmental groups who joined forces in the
lawsuit. A spokesman for the timber industry said it was
``disappointed that the judge feels he knows the plan better than
the professionals in the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The forest service said it was still studying the ruling to
assess its impact. But Rex Holloway, a spokesman for the agency in
Portland, Ore., said the forest service believed it had correctly
followed the guidelines of the 1994 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it is unclear whether the red tree vole, a small
rodent favored as food by the spotted owl, or the blue-gray
tail-dropper, a tiny snail, will acquire the emotional symbolism
that the owl brought to the fight over old-growth forests. Both are
among the species at issue in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But it is certain that the fight is renewed, and that
environmentalists are again on the offensive, trying to move toward
a much broader ban on logging in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so little old-growth left, there's no good place to
cut it anymore at all,'' Doug Heiken, western Oregon field
representative for the Oregon Natural Resources Council, said in a
telephone interview Wednesday. ``All of it should be protected for
future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The council, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit, says that
only 10 percent of the region's old-growth forests are left, and
that about 30 percent of that area remains eligible for cutting
under the 1994 plan.
</P>
<P>
   The industry, meanwhile, says the judge's ruling imperils
hundreds of logging jobs and the local economy in some pockets of
the Northwest and many are pressing Congress to relax the survey
regulations. U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has sponsored
legislation to relax some of the requirements of the environmental
surveys, making it easier for many of the timber deals to go
through, and the judge's ruling is likely to intensify the fight
over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the region as a whole is far less dependent on logging
than it once was _ in Oregon, for example, the high-tech industry
is now a bigger source of jobs than forest-products companies. And
even in some places that were once deeply reliant on logging,
tourism built on the area's natural beauty is now a mainstay of the
economy, which leads at least some local business people to oppose
the logging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It messes up the area, big-time,'' said Tom Vuyovich, owner of
the All Seasons Motel in Detroit, Ore., on the edge of the
Cascades, who said much of his clientele consists of tourists drawn
to the area's natural beauty and its many recreational
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them look around, there are clear-cuts visible all
around, and they say, `What happened here. Where are the trees?'
They want to know where the old growth is, and I can carefully
point them out to the last few spots that have been saved _ so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris West, a spokesman for the Northwest Forestry Association,
an industry group, said Wednesday that the judge's ruling was just
``the tip of the iceberg'' and that it could eventually lead to a
ban on logging for lumber that could be used to build nearly
100,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ban would not in itself be likely to significantly affect
building activity or drive up the cost of lumber in general, but it
would curtail the amount of the old-growth wood on the market. Many
builders and prospective home owners, both here and in overseas
markets, consider it particularly desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists say there is no good reason to allow
logging of the old-growth forests at all, and concern over the
forests is what sparked the first of the legal battles that have
been revived by the judge's ruling this week.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Dwyer issued a sweeping ruling that temporarily
halted all logging in the spotted owl's habitat region under
federal jurisdiction, nearly 25 million acres in all.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by both environmentalists who wanted the logging
permanently stopped and by industry officials who described the
judge's ruling as economically devastating, Clinton moved shortly
after he took office in 1993 to broker a compromise. He did,
permanently setting aside about 10 million acres of federal land on
top of millions of acres of owl habitat that were already protected
because they were in national parks or other wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise, including the requirement for the wildlife
surveys, cleared the way for Dwyer to lift his ban. But it
satisfied neither side, and there is still a debate over whether
the plan is sufficiently protective of the owl.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service estimates that there are about 8,000 pairs of
owls in the Northwest. A recent federal survey found that the owl
population is declining at about 3.9 percent a year. Agency and
industry officials said the decline rate was significantly less
than what it had been and was in fact an indication that the
long-term plan for recovery of the species was working.
Environmental groups said the continued decline called into
question the whole plan, and they renewed their push for a halt to
all logging on old-growth land.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said it is committed to shifting
forest policy toward conservation. It announced earlier this year,
for instance, that it would continue its suspension of logging-road
construction in most of the national forests. So the judge's ruling
will also set the stage for a likely battle within the
administration over how the Forest Service should respond _ in
other words, whether it should contest the ruling or use it as a
continuing reason to halt logging projects.
</P>
<P>
   Heiken, of the Oregon Natural Resources Council, said that the
group was not opposed to the 1994 plan, as long as it was
scrupulously followed. And he disagreed with the forest industry's
contention that it was being subject to renewed and unfair judicial
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what the courts are here for,'' Heiken said.
``The point is, the agencies are going to have to come up with a
way to do it right. And as soon as they figure out how to do it
right, the judge will be out of the picture.''

LAWMAKERS' LETTER URGES CLINTON TO CONSIDER DAM REMOVAL ON SNAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying that the future of Pacific salmon is a
national issue, 107 members of the House of Representatives are
urging President Clinton to consider removal of four dams on the
lower Snake River.
</P>
<P>
   Their letter to Clinton could mark a turning point in the debate
over dam removal in the Pacific Northwest. Dam removal as a tool to
restore endangered salmon runs has broad support in the
environmental community, but until now environmentalists have been
handicapped by a total lack of political support for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   The House members who signed the letter, including six from
Washington and Oregon, are not advocating dam removal, but are
insisting that dam removal remain an option as the nation debates
how to restore Pacific salmon runs. The letter contradicts a
resolution offered by Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., that calls on
Clinton not even to consider dam removal as a possibility because
of the economic benefits generated by the dams.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman called the letter ``helpful.'' The
Clinton administration is expected this fall to release two
important documents on dam removal: an Army Corps of Engineers
study recommending whether to breach the lower Snake River dams,
and a National Marine Fisheries paper on actions needed to restore
salmon runs in the Columbia River basin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the process we now have under way is directed at
achieving just what the letter calls for _ a decision based on a
thorough analysis of all the relevant science and economics,'' said
Elliot Diringer, communications director at the White House Council
on Environmental Quality. ``Our objective is a lasting solution
built on sound science and regional consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, 95 Democrats and 12 Republicans argue that the
future of the dams is of national importance. Northwest signatories
include Reps. Jay Inslee and Jim McDermott, D-Wash., and Reps. Earl
Blumenauer, Peter DeFazio, Darlene Hooley and David Wu, D-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that Snake River salmon, and steelhead, are an
economic and environmental asset whose preservation is a national
responsibility,'' the letter says.
</P>
<P>
   The letter's prime Republican author, Rep. Thomas Petri, R-Wis.,
said his constituents deserve a voice in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmental issues affect all of us in the country,
especially if there's a cost associated with dealing with it,''
Petri said in an interview. ``We're simply asking that nothing be
ruled out, and that a thorough and professional review of the
different options be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have long urged that salmon preservation be
viewed as a national issue. As long as the debate is merely
regional, those who believe dam removal is an essential step for
salmon preservation seem unable to overcome the opposition of those
who benefit economically from the dams.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in Washington state, citing the benefits of the
dammed river for irrigation, transportation, hydropower and flood
control, are generally opposed to dam removal. Gov. Gary Locke and
Sen. Patty Murray, both Democrats with strong environmental
records, have joined Republicans in opposing dam removal.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings and Rep. George Nethercutt, both Eastern Washington
Republicans, are pushing a congressional resolution saying that
``plans for the recovery of federally protected fish species in the
Columbia and Snake River System should not rely on dam removal
schemes.'' The resolution, which is not binding, has been approved
by the House Resources Committee but has not been considered by the
full House.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., also has supported two provisions in
an Energy appropriations bill that would limit the administration's
salmon restoration options. One would prevent the Bonneville Power
Administration from amassing what Gorton describes as a slush fund
to pay for dam removal; another would bar the administration from
continuing to study drawdown of the John Day or McNary dams on the
Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton last week delivered a Senate speech opposing dam removal,
citing several federal studies that he said demonstrate that dam
removal would be of only modest benefit and great harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we get by removing the four Snake River dams?'' he
asked. ``Shattered lives, displaced families and communities who
will have seen their livelihoods destroyed, generations of family
farmers penniless, industries forced to drive up consumer costs,
air pollution, a desert that once bloomed with agriculture products
goes dry, a far less competitive Northwest economy and a Northwest
scrambling to repay a BPA treasury debt with less revenue, and
scrambling to buy or build higher cost polluting sources of
power.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional letter was spurred by the efforts of a variety
of organizations advocating dam removal, including American Rivers,
the National Wildlife Federation, the U.S. Public Interest Research
Group, Save Our Wild Salmon and the Sierra Club. The groups claim
support from 360 organizations and prominent individuals,
including, most recently, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the president of
the environmental group Water Keeper Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This establishes a new political center of gravity on the
issue, signaling that it's both a national and a regional issue and
that Congress cares about the problem and has an open mind about
the solution,'' said Ralph DeGennaro, executive director of
Taxpayers for Common Sense, an organization supporting dam removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a national issue because every taxpayer in America
subsidizes the (river) navigation, and will be liable for
compensation payments of billions or tens of billions of dollars to
Native Americans when the salmon go extinct,'' DeGenarro said.
``Furthermore, the salmon are a national economic and environmental
asset, and this letter shows the rest of America is waking up to
its stake in this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of dam removal did not welcome news of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue isn't dam removal, it's how we are going to save
salmon,'' said Murray. ``If we focus on doing everything we can (to
save salmon), from the local level to protecting the Hanford Reach,
we could preclude a very difficult decision in the Pacific
Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastings did not return a call seeking comment, but Nethercutt
was so upset by the letter that he immediately dashed off a
response to the 12 Republican signatories and started pigeonholing
them in the corridors of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``This letter is couched in terms of preserving all options, but
in fact the very people who are behind the letter have a sole
mission of removing dams,'' Nethercutt said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Taxpayers for Common Sense ran a classified
ad in Roll Call this week seeking a ``campaign director ... to run
a campaign to remove Northwest dams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These groups have avoided reasonable salmon restoration
efforts,'' Nethercutt charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This letter is a pretext for wanting to remove the dams, as
opposed to a sincere effort to solve the salmon recovery problem.''

SHEFFIELD'S NEW ATTITUDE BALANCES TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So you've grown weary of Raul Mondesi's act.
You've had enough of his partying, his petulance, his prima
donna-like disregard for basic team rules.
</P>
<P>
   Before you give up on the right fielder, there's something you
should know.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield once sported a chip on his shoulder as big as the
gaudiest piece of jewelry in his Cartier's starter set.
</P>
<P>
   At times in Milwaukee and Florida and even last year in L.A.,
Sheffield said and did things that made his exasperated bosses want
to string him up by his 24-carat gold ropes.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the left fielder has gone on to become the Los Angeles
Dodgers' most consistent, most communicative, most commanding
leader, a veritable diamond in this salt mine of a season.
</P>
<P>
   If Sheffield weren't adding a little luster to the Dodgers'
prosaic lineup, he'd fit just fine under glass in some museum, a
paradigm of how brilliantly a gem can shine when given a little
polish.
</P>
<P>
   When Mondesi is ready to mature, he has a ready model in the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's worth to the Dodgers goes beyond the 11-game hitting
streak that was snapped over the weekend, his 58 RBI and his .304
batting average.
</P>
<P>
   At various times, Sheffield has counseled Craig Counsell and
chided Eric Young and cradled Mondesi's fragile psyche.
</P>
<P>
   He has quietly become the de facto judge and jury of the
clubhouse's kangaroo court. So respected is his record _ it
includes an NL batting title and a World Series championship _ that
when he talks, his teammates listen.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange and scary and sappy story, how Sheffield came to
be so valuable to the Dodgers. He had hired an image consultant
when he was with the Florida Marlins, after a single gunshot nearly
struck him down on a street in his hometown and some sinister
saboteur started distributing handouts saying he was HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until he found his soulmate that the Gary
underneath all the glitter started to shine through. Sheffield
bumped into Deleon Richards at the 1998 NBA All-Star Game in New
York and was instantly smitten.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, a gospel singer with a voice as sweet as Sheffield's
swing, has challenged the baseball player to become as familiar
with the Scriptures as he is the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, whom Sheffield wed in the Bahamas in February, ``has
really helped Gary find out who he is,'' Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone says. It was something Malone also set out to discover
after he replaced interim GM Tom Lasorda last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard all the various stories about him in the past,''
Malone says.
</P>
<P>
   He gave Sheffield a clean slate anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's image had suffered long before he held up the deal
that sent disgruntled catcher Mike Piazza packing to the Marlins
until he was able to negotiate for more money (the better to offset
the bigger chunk of change he was going to have to pay in
California taxes).
</P>
<P>
   His image had been scuffed up long before he expressed
ambivalence about playing in the 1998 All-Star Game in Denver (he
preferred to spend the time with his three children).
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield already had alienated a lot of fans _ including many
holding front-office positions throughout the league _ before he
squawked about retiring at spring training this year because of
custody complications involving his kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary's always been somewhat misunderstood,'' Malone says.
``Maybe because he says what's in his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield has worn his emotions outside since Milwaukee, the
first stop on his baseball odyssey. He was 19 _ a child, really,
but already with a child of his own _ when he was called up to the
Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being seen and not heard, as all good rookies should,
Sheffield gave players such as Paul Molitor the same sort of
needling Young and Devon White have been hearing lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't know how to communicate with people,'' Sheffield
says now.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield lost his way in a sea of acrimony and considered
quitting baseball before the Brewers shipped him to San Diego for
little more than postage and handling in 1992. That season he won
the batting title at the tender age of 23, batting .330 with 33
home runs and 100 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield was traded to the Marlins as part of the Padres' fire
sale in 1993. A series of misadventures in Florida fanned his
smoldering reputation. Sheffield was charged with driving under the
influence. Another time he narrowly escaped a bullet fired at his
car from close range as he tooled around his old neighborhood in
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the speech he delivered during spring training in
1998, the one in which he declared, ``(The Marlins) didn't give me
$61 million as a leader. . . I don't think anybody can say you have
to . . . be a leader just because they gave you something.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Florida, Sheffield's words went over about as well as
modest bathing suits. So much for basking in the afterglow of the
Marlins' 1997 World Series title. Two months later, Sheffield was
traded to L.A. He appeared in 130 games with the Dodgers and batted
.302, with 22 home runs and 85 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   When Malone trekked to Florida this past winter to get a read on
his enigmatic outfielder, he returned to L.A. convinced Sheffield
was serious about succeeding in L.A. Nothing he has seen from
Sheffield the past few months has made Malone change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's committed to winning,'' Malone says. ``I think he
recognizes there's a need for him to do what it takes to get people
in line and get everyone focused on the goal of winning. He's got a
tough battle in there. But his teammates know his only agenda is
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone mentions this to other general managers and they curse
the awful telephone connection. ``Sorry, pardner, but I don't think
I heard you right. It sounded like you said Sheffield is a positive
influence in the room.''.
</P>
<P>
   They better believe it. Now a league turns its leery eyes to
you, Raul. &QL;

MAVS TAKE 2ND IN SUMMER LEAGUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson returned from
Salt Lake City early this week a happy camper after the Mavericks
finished second in the Los Angeles Summer League and Rocky Mountain
Revue with a 10-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   In the final game, the Mavericks defeated Utah, 95-75, in Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the chemistry on our team, from the first guy to the
last guy, really got us through some tough stretches,'' Nelson
said. ``There was a period when we played eight games in nine
days'' and went 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Dirk Nowitzki averaged nearly 30 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, he was doing everything,'' Nelson said. ``We
posted him, he was shooting 3s and tearing it up on the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were only a couple of games where we had to challenge
him with his rebounding and on defense. But he got rave reviews
from everybody in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Leon Smith also shined before he left for Chicago. In one
game, Smith had 16 points and 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Smith and Shawn Bradley are scheduled to attend Pete
Newell's Big Man Camp, which is designed to help big players polish
their games. CEBALLOS PUZZLED Free-agent forward Cedric Ceballos
wonders why Mavericks coach/general manager
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson didn't offer him a more lucrative contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to get $15 to $16 million,'' Ceballos said. ``I
want to be compensated for what I can do. I don't want to be taken
advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Dallas would be a good situation for me to come back
to, being that they've got my full (Larry) Bird Rights. But they're
just offering the minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson called the two-year, $2 million offer ``fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos said he is entertaining offers from Seattle, San
Antonio, Houston, Miami, New York, Atlanta and the Los Angeles
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nellie's a good guy, but I just can't read Nellie,'' he said.
``I never know what he's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, he told me to wait until he gets a point guard, and
then they got Steve Nash. All I've done is waited. I don't know
what else I've got to do.'' TRENT HAS COMPETITION
</P>
<P>
   Forward Gary Trent, the Mavericks' top free-agent priority, is
competing with forward Shandon Anderson for an offer from Seattle,
a source close to the situation said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who played for Utah last season, is seeking a $6
million-a-year contract from the Jazz, but Utah is offering $3
million to $4 million, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the three-year, $11.28 million contract the Sonics
are contemplating offering Trent might wind up in Anderson's lap.
</P>
<P>
   Also, free-agent guard Mitch Richmond, who is tops on Seattle's
wish list, is leaning toward re-signing with Washington, the source
said. nn

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
As the beneficiary of baseball's richest contract, Kevin Brown will
be able to buy a team by the time the Los Angeles Dodgers are
finished paying him the $105 million he is due over the next seven
years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No need to consider the Astros; he already owns them.
</P>
<P>
   Brown outdueled Chris Holt in a classic pitchers' showdown and
hung a 2-1 loss on the Astros in the process Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was oustanding and then some, outdueling Holt and the
Astros before 31,771 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   On almost any other night, Holt would have picked up his third
win; instead he lost No. 11 in the most painful of ways. The
hard-luck righthander held the Dodgers to four hits and two runs
(one earned) in eight innings, the unearned run coming as a result
of his own throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, talk of Brown's dominance was the buzz
following Wednesday's game _ and rightfully so _ but Holt might
have replaced him in the spotlight with a break here or there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown was as good as usual,'' Astros shortstop Tim Bogar said.
``When he made mistakes, we didn't hit them, and after that he just
put you away. It's amazing how he can throw that hard and get the
ball to move as much as it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad part about this game is that Holtie pitched just as
well, if not better than Brown, but we just came up short.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' loss allowed Cincinnati to move within 1{ games of
first place in the National League Central Division. The Reds
defeated Colorado 6-3 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown fired a four-hitter and improved his record to 3-2 with a
1.50 ERA in seven career starts against the Astros. How can such
dominance be explained? Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell didn't
have to search long for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got 28 different arm angles, he's throwing sliders,
sinkers, cutters, forkballs, he's throwing 95 mph, and when he
keeps the ball down, it's sayonara,'' Bagwell said. ``I've never
seen the guy struggle. He's always dominated us.''
</P>
<P>
   Including his 1998 postseason mastery as a member of the San
Diego Padres, Brown has held the Astros to three runs on 13 hits in
his last 31 innings against them. He has struck out 36 batters
during that stretch, including seven Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell, Bill Spiers and Richard Hidalgo were the only Astros
to get a hit against Brown, who tossed his second complete game of
the season. Bell was 2-for-4 and drove home the Astros' run with a
two-out double in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Wednesday, Bell had seven strikeouts and just one hit
in 15 career at-bats against Brown. But lately, it seems Bell can
hit just about anyone. He is batting .380 in his last 13 games to
raise his batting average to .255 _ the highest it has been since
June 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been trying to have quality at-bats, and I've been
putting some flex in my legs,'' Bell said. ``If I had known putting
flex in my legs would get me going, I would have done it earlier in
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Brown, Bell said: ``It was the same old nasty Brown with
that nasty slider. The bottom just falls out of that thing. Chris
did a great job of keeping the game close; they just got the
breaks, and we didn't. Chris has had a lot of hard luck this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   While Holt didn't exhibit Brown's flair, he was every bit as
effective, and in some ways identical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the same approach as he does, and that is to go after
guys and try to induce ground balls,'' said Holt, who has watched
the Astros average just 3.1 runs in his losses. ``I knew it was
going to be this kind of low-scoring game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a 2-11 pitcher. I know I keep saying that, but there's
nothing I can do about it except keep trying to keep the team in
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   What clearly bothered Holt more than anything else was that he
committed his first error of the season _ and it led to the
decisive run in the game.
</P>
<P>
   With the Astros trailing 1-0 in the seventh inning, Holt fielded
a leadoff bunt by Dodgers center fielder Devon White and his errant
throw on the bunt single allowed White to advance to second.
</P>
<P>
   White ultimately scored from third on Craig Counsell's
fielder's-choice grounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't have thrown that ball away,'' said Holt, who has
allowed only three earned runs in his last 22 innings in the
Astrodome. ``If I make that throw, it's an out. If I make a good
throw, it's a whole different inning and a whole different game.
That's a play I should make.''
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre's RBI single in the second accounted for the
Dodgers' other run.

   LOS ANGELES: public health as a responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner was cited with three violations, including the broken
blower, hot food kept at an improper temperature and food kept in
unprotected conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the truck, Tony Moufarrege, said a blown fuse
caused the refrigerator's blower to stop working. He said he
strives to keep his fleet of 15 trucks up to code but that the
streets take a toll and can break machinery.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes it is unfair to hold trucks to the same
health standards as restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to obey the rules but sometimes the rules are too
much,'' Moufarrege said. ``The restaurant sits there 100 years,
this truck moves every 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   By stopping at upward of 15 different locations each day, the
truck serves about 150 meals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Imbrenda's second inspection of the day led to another closure.
The refrigerator in the Eagle Foods truck parked outside a San
Fernando business read 66 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Vendor Sarah Jaimes said she assumed the refrigerator was
working because she could hear the fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to do the best for my customers so when the health
department comes they don't get us. Plus, you feel a lot better
working in a clean truck,'' Jaimes said. ``We try to do everything
but it's very hard. If something breaks you fix it and the next day
something else breaks and you have to fix that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaimes said she gets inspected about twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   Imbrenda gave the refrigerator time to cool but after about 15
minutes it was still not cold enough. Two violations were recorded
_ cold food stored at improper temperatures and an improperly
working fridge.
</P>
<P>
   As Imbrenda ordered the sausage links, burritos and chicken be
thrown away, he noted, ``Food-borne illness can be very violent and
severe.''

HEALTH INSPECTORS FIND FAULT WITH FOOD TRUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Staff writer Douglas Haberman contributed to this story

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Even in the shade of a tree, the temperature
outside the Los Pastores sandwich truck crept toward 100 degrees as
county health inspector Tony Imbrenda examined the refrigerator
stocked with pork and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Gasping and struggling at 52 degrees, the refrigerator was more
than 10 degrees above the minimum level set by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of the food spoiling in those conditions was too
great, so Imbrenda said he had no choice but to shut down the truck
and destroy the food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hot today that it's just not cutting it,'' Imbrenda
said Wednesday of the refrigerator in the Los Pastores truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions are a lot more difficult to control in these trucks
in the summer. So the idea is to catch them early and make sure
everything is working properly before they head out.''
</P>
<P>
   As the summer sizzles, the county's 25 health inspectors are
waging war against bacteria and other food-borne threats to people
who eat at the 2,500 permitted hot trucks or 4,500 hot dog carts
and other mobile food stands.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure how many operate without permits.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said they act quickly to close trucks and
pursue legal action because the trucks move around so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can close them one day but there's little outside a boot to
prevent these guys from stocking up and heading out again the next
day,'' said Kenneth L. Marks, the county's chief environmental
health specialist who oversees the vehicle inspection program.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike restaurants, these trucks are not required to carry
letter grades that clearly signify whether they have passed
inspections. That could change, however. The Board of Supervisors
will receive a recommendation to include the trucks in the rating
system within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clearly looking at this,'' said John Schunhoff, chief of
operations for the county Department of Health Services' public
health programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwich trucks were left out of the original ordinance so the
county could focus on the 20,000 restaurants and 10,000 food
markets it monitors, Schunhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the heat soared to 97 in the Northridge community
of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley and a strong high pressure
ridge over the area meant temperatures will stay hot through the
weekend, weather officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That made Imbrenda's job all the more important.
</P>
<P>
   The refrigerator is the first place he looks, because that is
all that keeps the sandwich meat, chicken patties, sausage links,
cheese and other staples at the state-mandated 41 degrees or
cooler.
</P>
<P>
   And in each of three routine inspections done before noon
Wednesday, that piece of equipment was either broken or not up to
standards.
</P>
<P>
   All three trucks were shut down, and the operator's public
health permit was suspended. The owner must make the repairs and
pass a reinspection before the trucks can go back on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Those owners with prior violations likely will be prosecuted in
Municipal Court and face fines, inspection fees and restitution
that can top $2,000, Imbrenda said. First-time offenders usually
get a warning during a hearing with health inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In his first inspection of the day, Imbrenda pulled up to a hot
truck in the parking lot of an industrial park in the Pacoima
community in the San Fernando Valley and immediately saw a problem
_ wastewater pouring out of tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Imbrenda checked the refrigerator and found the blower was not
working. That alone is enough to shut down the truck, but Imbrenda
found other violations of state and county health codes.
</P>
<P>
   A container of meat mixed with carrots and other vegetables was
sitting out, improperly cooling at room temperature, he said. Fried
chicken patties sat stacked next to the grill but should have been
in the refrigerator, Imbrenda said.
</P>
<P>
   The hot sandwiches in a warming oven accessible to customers
were uncovered, also posing a risk of contamination, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Imbrenda began to gather evidence like a detective.
</P>
<P>
   He took a photo of the thermometer as it read the refrigerator
temperature and took a sample of the fried chicken and cheese from
the refrigerator. Both samples were sealed in plastic evidence bags
and will be stored in a walk-in evidence freezer at the health
department's headquarters in Monterey Park.
</P>
<P>
   The chicken, sausage and grated cheese in the broken
refrigerator were removed and later destroyed by being chopped up,
covered with soap and thrown away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being closed down is not a fun thing for them _ it's a
hardship,'' Imbrenda said. ``But we don't care because it's a
public health issue. The people who do this have a very idealistic
approach and look at public health as a responsibility.''

FOOT SPEED CARRIES RANGERS PAST TWINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Texas Rangers' high-octane offense runs
on wood. The bats, driving balls to the outer reaches of ballparks,
are why the team is second in the American League in runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   They won four of the first five games of the current homestand
by hitting .358 and scoring 43 runs. They scored at least nine
times in three of those games.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, though, the Rangers were forced to seek an
alternate source of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The bats were comparatively silent against Minnesota Twins ace
Brad Radke and four relievers, managing only nine singles and one
double. So, the Rangers used shoe leather to beat the Twins, 3-1,
manufacturing all three runs with good base running.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding different ways to win,'' said shortstop Royce
Clayton, who stole a base and scored the final run in the seventh
inning. ``Radke was tough. We really had to manufacture runs.''
</P>
<P>
   After being shut out for the first five innings by Radke, the
Rangers broke through in the sixth because of Rusty Greer's hustle.
</P>
<P>
   Greer singled with one out, and Juan Gonzalez followed with a
sharp single to center. Twins outfielder Jacque Jones charged the
ball, but Greer didn't hesitate at second. He put his head down and
sprinted toward third, sliding in headfirst just in front of Jones'
throw.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed Greer to score when Rafael Palmeiro sent a deep
drive to center field that Jones caught with a leap at the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that won the game for us, Rusty going from first to
third,'' third base coach Jerry Narron said. ``A lot of players
don't make that play. They shut it down at second.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored twice more in the seventh, thanks to speed
and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, rookie outfielder Ruben Mateo hit a ground ball to
third and hustled down the line. Twins infielder Corey Koskie had
to hurry his throw, and Mateo was safe with an infield single when
the ball eluded first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo stole second, and remained there when Twins shortstop
Cristian Guzman and second baseman Denny Hocking tried to fool him
with a decoy play, pretending the ball got past them and went into
the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton followed with a sharp grounder to first. If Mateo had
still been at first, it might have been a double play. Instead,
Clayton beat it out _ thanks to a favorable call by umpire Joe
Brinkman _ while Mateo went to third.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton also stole second, and again the Twins tried to fool the
rookie. Catcher Terry Steinbach threw to Guzman instead of Hocking,
who was covering the bag, hoping to catch Mateo straying. Mateo,
though, didn't move.
</P>
<P>
   With runners at second and third and one out, the Twins played
the infield in. Mark McLemore slapped a single to right field, and
both runners scored. nn

WOMEN SAILORS FIND THE USS DECATUR AN ESPECIALLY GOOD FIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE USS DECATUR _ On her first ship, Petty Officer Pamela
Munsey went head-to-head with the Old School Navy Guys and hated
every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the gunner's mate 2nd class is on the Decatur, and she
couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a woman in the Navy _ on this ship _ is just like being
a man in the Navy,'' Munsey said Wednesday as the ship headed for
Seattle's Elliott Bay and its Seafair celebration, along with a
handful of other Navy and Coast Guard ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my first ship, they had only been integrated a year when I
got there, and they set me up to fail in my job. My job includes
having to lift 65-pound projectiles. The guys would tell me `Why
don't you step back and let me do that for you?' They weren't
letting me do what I was trained for,'' Munsey said.
</P>
<P>
   In a vocation where gender didn't matter for 200 years _ because
everyone was male _ now it doesn't seem to matter all that much.
About 13 percent of the Navy's enlisted force is made up of women;
about 14 percent of its officer corps is female.
</P>
<P>
   Munsey is one of 56 women on the Decatur, one of only a handful
of Navy combat ships built from the keel up to accommodate women
sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year old, the Decatur is another step in the Navy's
goal of integration _ the Navy's word for mixing some of the 51,251
women in the Navy into the combat fleet.
</P>
<P>
   There are 155 ships in the fleet with women crew members; 104 of
those are combat ships.
</P>
<P>
   Most are older than the Decatur, and need extensive modification
before enlisted women are allowed to serve on them; women officers
are able to serve on any ship because they have semi-private
staterooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Decatur was built from scratch with women in mind. That
means bathrooms that can turn them from a men's room to a woman's
room with the flip of a sign, depending on demand, as well separate
bunking, shower areas and bathrooms _ sans urinals..
</P>
<P>
   But that's about it, aside from the 1950s-college-dorm-way of
calling out ``Man on the deck,'' when a man needs to enter the
women's quarters, or ``Woman on the deck,'' when the situation is
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Integration here is transparent,'' said Lt. J.T. Garry, the
destroyer's combat-systems officer. He started sailing 10 years
ago, before the 1991 Tailhook scandal sparked a massive culture
change in the Navy . ``From a leadership or management perspective,
no one notices if a sailor's a man or a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman work on deck crews _ sweating and swearing the air purple
as do male sailors when they haul in mooring lines. They steer the
ship, work in supply and can fire missiles, torpedoes and guns, if
assigned to do so. ``You have your ups and your downs,'' said Lt.
j.g. Kathy Sandoz, the Decatur's first lieutenant, one of six
female officers on the destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ups are we don't have many problems on this ship, everyone
works together pretty well. The downs is that my former commanding
officer told me that women have a different way of looking at
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about this until he told me. If I'm standing
watch and a contact comes up (on the ship's radar or sonar), I'll
ask my partner (another female officer) what she thinks. We'll
confer on it. If it happens when the watch team after us is on _
they're both men _ they'd just say `Here's the contact,' and act on
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's from being a woman or just being me.
But it was something I had to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all women have had a good experience as sailors. There
have been stories about shipboard sexual relationships, unwanted
pregnancies and female sailors being passed over for duty.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Decatur, sailors said it's much smoother because from
the time the ship was launched, there were women on its crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problems are logistical,'' Sandoz said. ``We have 60 racks
for women to sleep in. When we have visitors, we have to be very,
very specific about what kind we get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each summer we get midshipmen here to train. We have
</P>
<P>
   to look at our berthing and say `OK, we can only handle four
women and six men', or whatever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   All the sailors who report to Ensign Faith Tabatsko, the
destroyer's strike officer, are male. And, she said, no one has a
problem with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at the Naval Academy, I heard the stories about how
women were treated there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the only time we ever had a problem with it was when the
alumni would come back to the campus and these guys who graduated
in the '20s or '30s would get offended at women there.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that is because the Navy began its major culture change
in the wake of the 1991 Tailhook scandal, now almost a decade past.
The average crew member on the Decatur has been in the Navy four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ship, the guys I work with, have all been to schools with
women before,'' Munsey said. ``They're used to us, to having us
around.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Decatur came into Elliott Bay, the ship's crew was sent
to ``man the rails'' _ standing along the deck for show. Jeannette
Perez, a boatswain's mate 3rd class was with them, hands clasped
behind her back looking at the Seattle skyline, patiently waiting
for the destroyer to dock so she could help with the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like I can't complain about something,
because the guys aren't complaining,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the chain of command here is very good about supporting
you. I think they've got a good balance. I don't feel like I'm a
female here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm a sailor.''

THIS DOGFIGHT PITS BLUE ANGELS VS. MICROSOFT CODE JOCKEYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A dozen bullet holes in the windshield, no rudder and
a few howling dives into the ground would normally be serious
concerns to Blue Angels pilot Lt. Doug Verissimo.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the lead solo pilot for the Navy's crack
formation-flying squadron laughed off those problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the heck. It's only a game,'' Verissimo, 34, said.
</P>
<P>
   And he was right.
</P>
<P>
   In town for Seafair, where they'll perform Saturday and Sunday,
Verissimo and fellow pilot Lt. Cmdr. Kiron O'Connor, 35, spent part
of their only day off here playing Microsoft's Combat Flight
Simulator.
</P>
<P>
   The squadron arrived earlier this week to plan and practice
their performances, which will take place from noon to 12:45 p.m.
Saturday and Sunday along south Lake Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the pilots took this game seriously. They had to, because it
pitted flyboys against code jockeys: the very programmers who had
created Microsoft's World War II dogfight simulator.
</P>
<P>
   In a public relations brainstorm, Microsoft invited the pilots
and 18 support staff out to the Redmond, Wash., campus across Lake
Washington to take on Tucker Hatfield, the game's program manager,
and developer Matt Ployhar.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots had the advantage of experience _ but in their
Boeing/McDonnell Douglas FA-18 Hornets, not the P-51
propeller-powered fighters used in Microsoft's consumer-oriented
game.
</P>
<P>
   So a half-hour passed before Verissimo realized his Microsoft
feedback-enhanced joystick works as a rudder when twisted. He is
used to conventional rudder pedals (which a Microsoftie hinted are
on the way).
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the P-51s, whose guns fire 300 yards, the FA-18s
aren't armed, carrying only smoke pods.
</P>
<P>
   The developers had the advantage of insiders' knowledge and
hours of practice. Still, they were nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is scary,'' Hatfield admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Who won? The ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ground always has all the advantages,'' Verissimo said,
crashing yet again.
</P>
<P>
   All four participants managed to down each other repeatedly
during the one-hour session. No one kept score.
</P>
<P>
   Verissimo is one of the Angels' two solo pilots, who cut loose
when the other four fly in the Diamond formation. O'Connor flies in
position No. 3 within the formations.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots praised the game's realistic imaging and scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's fun, they said, it can't match the G forces, the
Mach 1.8 speed or the sheer exhilaration of the FA-18s.
</P>
<P>
   For anything close to that, they had to go down the hall, to the
bank of stereo-enhanced Midtown Madness driving simulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now those are some great games!'' said support staffer Petty
Officer Stephen Jason.

   LOS ANGELES -- There are a lot of ways a guy can break the ice

   Joe Jaye decided to go for the direct approach. When you're 89,
you don't have a lot of time to waste on small talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, how's your love life?'' he asked Edith Fishman the first
time he laid eyes on her this June over at the Jewish Home for the
Aging in the Reseda community of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad,'' the 78-year-old widow said, without batting an eye.
``How's yours?''
</P>
<P>
   They smiled at each other and bells went off.
</P>
<P>
   It was love at first quip.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday, in front of four generations of their families,
Edith and Joe are tying the knot after four years of widowhood for
each.
</P>
<P>
   Joe wants it known up front there's absolutely no truth to the
rumors flying around the home that he's after Edith's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although she does have a lot,'' he told me Wednesday. ``I
checked _ $61. Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Edith shakes her head and laughs. She's been doing a lot of
laughing the past couple of months since Joe walked into her life,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   It's like Burns and Allen are back, people around the home say.
You'd better be quick, or you'll miss the best lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe, tell me again why I'm marrying you?'' Edith says. ``I
forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe's eyes light up. What a great straight woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at her,'' he says, proudly. ``She's got all the negatives
a man could want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I gave all the women around here a chance at me, but
there were no takers,'' Joe says. ``Then Edith showed up, and I
swept her off her feet with my charm.''
</P>
<P>
   Edith shoots him a look that says, ``Yeah, right, pal. In your
dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   All the laughs and one liners are great, their friends say, but
they tend to overshadow the real story here.
</P>
<P>
   The love story.
</P>
<P>
   You don't marry someone just because they make you laugh. You
marry them because they touch something deep inside you that's been
missing after years of living alone. Something you want back.
</P>
<P>
   The tenderness of another person, Joe and Edith call it, turning
serious for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both have missed not having someone to hold in our arms, or
just hold hands with,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter whether you're young or old, Edith says.
Romance is romance, and it's a wonderful feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Joe smiles and nods. ``It was the right time, the right
chemistry,'' he says, taking Edith's hand as they walk down the
hallway to the dining room for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of this sappy stuff, the look in their eyes says. It's
time for Burns and Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere has changed in this place since we told
everybody we're getting married,'' Joe says with a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel the hormones stirring in them again, even though
they've been dead for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come by congratulating us, eyeing us,'' he says,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, after the wedding ceremony Sunday, the bride and
groom plan to honeymoon at home because that's where they get all
their meals and medication, they say.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect them for breakfast, Edith says.

PAC-10 MEDIA DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They staged the annual PAC-10 football media
session Wednesday at the Gateway Sheraton near LAX, and all the
conference's coaches except one got up and spoke about their teams'
strengths and weaknesses for the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   There was USC's Paul Hackett telling about how the rebuilding
Trojans are now on a path destined to land the team back in its
ancestral roots, the Rose Bowl, in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   There was Washington's Rick Neuheisel discussing his decision to
leave one pressurized job at Colorado for another one in Seattle
where the shadow of Don James still stalks whoever is in charge of
the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   There was Arizona's Dick Tomey relating how difficult it will be
for his heralded team to match last season's 12-1 record and how he
plans once again to alternate his two extraordinary quarterbacks,
Kevin Smith and Ortege Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   And there was UCLA's Bob Toledo talking about, oh, parking
violations instead of the departure of Cade McNown, or the running
skills of DeShaun Foster, or the incredible athletic ability of
Freddie Mitchell, or anything other than where his players parked
their cars last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry I'm late, but I had to valet park my car,'' joked Toledo
in his opening comments to the reporters as he stood at the podium
with his All American candidate receiver, Danny Farmer, seated next
to him. ``I didn't want to get Danny in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   As you might know, there were 11 UCLA football players recently
nabbed for illegally obtaining handicap parking permits, a
development that has resulted in widespread condemnation of the
Bruin players and cast a negative light on the school's football
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a list drawn up on a piece of paper of things I don't
want any of my players to do,'' said Toledo. And one of them is not
to park in handicap parking spaces. That's something I've
emphasized a lot, but I guess I should have told them not to get a
handicap parking placard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect these kind of things to happen at UCLA. I
don't condone it. I'm very embarrassed by it. The kids made a big,
big mistake, and they've been punished for it. We'd like to put
things behind us, but I realize it's also something that still has
to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as he sat and had lunch with a few journalists, Bob
Toledo, starting his fourth season in Westwood with a 25-10 record
that included a 20-game winning streak, confided this has not been
his most enjoyable summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting ready for my daughter Alissa's wedding when I
got the call about the parking,'' said Toledo. ``I wanted to
address the issue immediately, but the lawyers kept us from saying
anything until the case was settled. That was very frustrating. You
want to speak up and say what you feel, but you can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``This definitely has been the worst vacation I've ever had. My
wife and I were planning to go on a few short trips around the
area, but we were told to stay close to home to deal with this
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Toledo if he felt his stature had been diminished
by an incident in which nine of the Bruin players---two no longer
are in school---have been suspended for the team's opening two
games against Boise State and Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope not,'' he said. ``You don't have total
control over everyone on the team. What could I have done
differently? I tried to do the right thing. I had warned the
players constantly about not parking in the handicap spaces. I warn
the players constantly that they're student-athletes, and are
judged differently. I have what amounts to 105 sons on the team.
It's like a large family, and sometimes your children make
mistakes. You just have to punish them, and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   With McNown now a multi-millionaire drawing a paycheck from the
Chicago Bears, Toledo will start this season without a proven
commodity at quarterback, an ominous sign for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't have a starting quarterback yet,'' he said. ``We
have four guys, Drew Bennett, Cory Paus, Scott McEwan and Ryan
McCann, competing for the starting job, but none has stood out to
the point he has won it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Bruins figure to be dangerous offensively as they
possess a trio of top running backs in Jermaine Lewis, Keith Brown
and Foster and a trio of talented receivers in Brian Poli-Dixon,
Farmer and Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Although eight starters return from last year's much-ridiculed
defensive unit that reached the dark depths in the regular-season
finale against Miami and then dipped even lower against Wisconsin
in the Rose Bowl, Toledo isn't sure that's a positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, we weren't very good on defense,'' said Toledo,
in a classic understatement.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins are able to remain as poised as their coach, then
they should be a formidable team again.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Toledo was interrogated constantly about the Bruin players'
parking indiscretions throughout the get-together, but he never
betrayed a hint of anger, answering the questions candidly and
openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me when I tell you I'm embarrassed by it,'' he said.
``I wish it had never happened. I wish the kids would have listened
to me. But I've seen a lot worst things over the years. Remember,
I've coached at a lot of places.''

AMGEN, PARTNER TEST NERVE DRUG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Amgen Inc. and biotech partner Guilford
Pharmaceuticals Inc. have started the first clinical tests of a new
nerve regenerating drug they hope will aid in treating illnesses
like Parkinson's disease, the companies announced.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, a class of compounds known as neuroimmunophilins, will
be given to healthy volunteers in Europe to determine whether they
cause any side effects. This phase should last for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the next step will be giving the drug, which is
administered orally, to volunteers who have the disease. Absent any
major problems it could be seven or eight years before the drug is
ready for market, said Amgen spokesman David Kaye on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the drug is taken orally, the compounds are easily
absorbed into the blood and then the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hope to eventually use these kinds of drugs to treat
a variety of brain-related illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease
and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Neuroimmunophilins were discovered several years ago by two
scientific teams, one led by Guilford founder Solomon Snyder, a
researcher at Johns Hopkins University, and the other by Bruce Gold
at Oregon Health Sciences University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached an important milestone in the development of
the neuroimmunophilins. We will undoubtedly learn a great deal
about neuroimmunophilins over the next few months,'' Craig R.
Smith, Guilford's president and chief executive officer, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen licensed worldwide rights for the neuroimmunophilins from
Guilford in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen's stock closed Wednesday at $77.0625, up 43.75cents.

LOAIZA LEADS RANGERS TO SERIES SWEEP OF TWINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Texas Rangers' rampage has brought about
two surprises totally unforeseen at the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The club's record is tied for the best in the major leagues, and
revitalized starting pitcher Esteban Loaiza has a four-game winning
streak. Each occurrence seemed three weeks ago about as unlikely as
Jeff Zimmerman giving up a run in two consecutive appearances.
</P>
<P>
   But the wonders keep coming at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza pitched six scoreless innings despite five walks, and the
Rangers completed a three-game sweep of the Minnesota Twins with a
3-1 victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman retired six of seven batters in two innings but
allowed the only run, a home run to Denny Hocking in the eighth
inning. He has now allowed a run in his past two appearances,
driving his earned-run average up to 0.99 and seriously damaging
his chances of being selected to Major League Baseball's
All-Century team.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger concern for an otherwise happy bunch is center
fielder Ruben Mateo, who injured his left wrist swinging the bat in
the seventh inning. X-rays after the game appeared to be negative,
but Mateo's hand was put in a splint. He will be examined by hand
specialist Dr. Bobby Wroten today.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are 17-3 since the All-Star break, giving them an
overall record of 65-42 that is tied with the Cleveland Indians for
the best in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a vote I'd say they're the best team in baseball,''
Hocking said. ``You can tell these guys are playing for a purpose.
They're more focused than anything. You can see it in their eyes. I
think they've got the team to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza has suddenly become a part of that after spending the
first half either in the bullpen or on the disabled list. Given a
second chance, Loaiza is 3-0 with a 2.65 ERA in three starts. Add a
victory in relief, and he has matched the longest winning streak of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy where I'm at right now,'' said Loaiza, who was never
happy serving in long relief. ``I'm throwing the ball great, and
I've come back strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Johnny Oates, ``If anything is different, he kept
his off-speed pitches and his slider down. He threw a lot of good
sliders and changeups down, especially against left-handed hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is he got three wins, however he does it. The
only thing is I know he can throw more strikes. Walking five in six
innings, he has better control than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza outpitched Twins ace Brad Radke, who had a 3.57 ERA
entering the game, third lowest in the American League. They
matched each other through five scoreless innings before the
Rangers broke through in the sixth on Rafael Palmeiro's sacrifice
fly. The Twins also had a chance for a breakthrough in the sixth,
but the Rangers' defense saved Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   He got himself into trouble by walking Jacques Jones to start
the inning. Cristian Guzman bunted him to second and Todd Walker
was intentionally passed.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Cordova followed with a sharp grounder down the third-base
line, where Todd Zeile made a terrific backhand diving stop. Zeile
lost the race to the bag, but he did take away a run-scoring
double.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed the Rangers to escape because first baseman Lee
Stevens turned Corey Koskie's grounder into an inning-ending double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Defense has been a part of the Rangers' rampage; they've
committed just eight errors in their last 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had confidence in our defense,'' shortstop Royce
Clayton said. ``We worked extremely hard on it in spring training
and sometimes when you stress something too much, you try to be too
perfect. I think everybody is settling down.'' nn

20 percent gain expected for Public Storage 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE _ Public Storage Inc., the nation's largest
self-storage company, is expected to report strong second quarter
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Profits of 66 cents per share, a 20 percent increase from a year
ago, are expected by Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call.
</P>
<P>
   The estimates ranged from a low of 62 cents to a high of 68
cents. With 1 representing a strong recommendation to buy and 5 a
strong one to sell, the analysts gave Public Storage an average
rating of 1.8. They pegged the company's growth rate at 11 percent,
compared with the industry's 10 percent, First Call also reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing very well,'' said Mark Benson, an analyst at
Jefferies &AMP; Co. in West Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Benson cites three reasons for his optimistic outlook: The real
estate investment trust's core business is growing about 7 percent;
the company's pickup and delivery operation is likely to break even
by the end of the year as losses continue to shrink; and the
purchase of Storage Trust Realty strengthens its position in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Public Storage recently closed its acquisition of Storage Trust
for $600 million in stock and assumption of debt. The deal expanded
Public Storage's holdings to 1,300 facilities in 37 states, further
widening the gap between the company and Amerco, the second largest
provider of self-storage facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Benson believes company shares are a good value. Public Storage
closed at $25.375 on Wednesday.

BROWN MAKES A PROBLEM FOR HOUSTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ How long are the next two months going to feel for the
Los Angeles Dodgers? Just take Kevin Brown's 2-1 domination of the
NL's top club, the Houston Astros, on Wednesday as the latest
example of this fragmented club.
</P>
<P>
   After getting Houston's Daryle Ward to fly out to right to end
Brown's four-hitter and give him his first nine-inning complete
game of the season, Brown stood behind the mound while infielders
congratulated each other before they finally turned toward the
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was paid $105 million not just to make 35 starts but to
elevate the Dodgers' performance for 162 games.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's made them immeasurably better for nearly all of
his 24 starts, but the intangibles he was supposed to bring haven't
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (12-6) is 8-3 after Dodgers losses, but the Dodgers are
3-8 following a Brown win. And the winning streaks don't
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope for that every night,'' Brown said of starting a
winning streak. ``Not just because I'm throwing. (I'd) just like to
start playing well and reeling off some wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has pitched well, but he hasn't had the profound effect on
the rest of the club, particularly the pitching staff, that the
Dodgers hoped for. Maybe it's unfair pressure, but his acquisition
was supposed to thrust the Dodgers into the playoffs. Instead, the
Dodgers (47-60) are drowning at the bottom of the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   But who's to blame? Dodgers manager Davey Johnson and the club's
management say Brown's been everything they hoped for, which shifts
the burden to the others to feed off his success and work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park, who spoke wonderfully of Brown during spring
training, stating he studied video of Brown, has been miserable and
Carlos Perez even worse. Dodgers starters have a 4.87 ERA, which
would qualify as one of the worst numbers in Dodgers' history.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Brown, he seems to be the guy who stops the losing
streaks, and we're riding him,'' said center fielder Devon White,
who scored the Dodgers' second run. ``Other teams want to know,
they're asking when he's pitching. They know how tough it's going
to be. It doesn't carry over.''
</P>
<P>
   But has Brown been allowed to do what he was brought to Los
Angeles to do? In his last start, Brown was pulled after 72/3
innings with a four-run lead. The bullpen blew it.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't going to happen against the Astros because Johnson
wasn't about to give the bullpen an opportunity. When asked how
long Brown was going to stay in the game, Johnson replied, ``Till
his arm fell off.''
</P>
<P>
   Or until Johnson could pry the ball out of Brown's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Brown threw 121 pitches, and not even Derek Bell's RBI double
with two outs in the ninth could cause Johnson to stir from his
seat on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to let that one get away from him like the one
before,'' Johnson said. ``With any luck he should have 18 wins, but
we lost a couple for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Management and players have sensed Brown's frustration for the
last two months, which might have peaked after his last outing. But
Brown, who hadn't thrown a pitch in the ninth inning as a Dodger,
remained stoic after coming within an out of shutting out the
first-place Astros (65-43).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to finish but more important to win,'' Brown
said. ``I would have liked to get that third out a little easier.''

MERGER EXPECTED TO LOWER GUITAR CENTER'S EARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Analysts expect Guitar Center Inc.'s second
quarter earnings to fall about 29 percent compared to the like
year-ago period, largely due to its merger with a catalog and
Internet retailer.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey of industry analysts by First Call, when
the Agoura Hills company reports its quarterly results today, it
should post earnings of 10 cents per share during the three-month
period ended June 30, compared with 14 cents that Guitar Center
actually earned last year.
</P>
<P>
   Guitar Center had warned in June that dilution related to its
merger with Medford, Ore.-based Musicians Friend, which also
operated nine retail stores, would cause earnings to fall. The
company also said that a slowdown in some business categories would
contribute to lower earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Nelson, a retail analyst with Stephens Inc. in Chicago,
said that changes in Guitar Center's direct mail program didn't
produce the anticipated benefits. In addition, sales slowed in the
high tech end of the business due to a lack of new merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   That business, Nelson said, had done particularly well in second
quarter 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been growing at a very rapid rate and they were bumping
up against tough numbers this year versus a year ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson also said that the opening of stores in markets such as
Dallas, Houston, Detroit and Southern California where the company
already had outlets created a situation where Guitar Center was in
effect competing against itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cannibalizing their existing store sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Nelson thinks Guitar Center's place in the
industry is still secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the strongest format in the industry,'' he said.
``Their stores are still very profitable.''

WOOLRIDGE SAW AGEM IN THIS YUGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ All it took was one game and Orlando
Woolridge knew Yugoslavian point guard Gordana Grubin would fit
perfectly in the Los Angeles Sparks' plan.
</P>
<P>
   Woolridge, coach of L.A.'s WNBA team, was right.
</P>
<P>
   Grubin has found her niche in the team's lineup and doesn't
appear as if she's going to give it up any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   At first, however, it was hard to tell how Grubin would pan out.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Only Woolridge, and players DeLisha Milton and Lisa
Leslie had ever seen her play.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Because of a commitment to the Yugoslavian national
team's schedule in the European Championships, Grubin and
Yugoslavian teammate Nina Bjedov, wouldn't join the Sparks until
this season's opening day.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) And, the United States-led NATO armed forces had just
ceased airstrikes on their country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 23 games into a season in which the Sparks are in position
for their first WNBA playoff appearance, every team in the league
knows about Grubin and her capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Woolridge knew all along and boasted about her every
day until she arrived.
</P>
<P>
   As an assistant coach on the USA Basketball team last February,
Woolridge first saw Grubin when Yugoslavia played the U.S. in a
European Tour. He says he was a believer from Day 1 and wasted no
time in finding out how to make her a member of the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see right there if Gordana came to the WNBA she'd be
one of the best point guards in the league,'' Woolridge said. ``The
question was whether or not the league was going to draft her.
That's not my job. Even if the league would have signed her, I was
going to find a way, by way of the draft, to get her.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Woolridge the league concentrated solely on
players from the defunct American Basketball League. Because Grubin
and Bjedov were left unsigned, thus ineligible for the draft, the
Sparks were able to pursue them independently. L.A. beat out
Houston and Cleveland for Grubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I do know about professional basketball is
that those who wait miss out,'' Woolride said. ``When I saw Gordana
play that very first game, I talked to her coach after that game. I
asked her coach if she had any interest, she told her coach, `Yes.'
I immediately asked the coach who the agent was and I was on the
phone with the agent that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Van Chancellor realizes he missed out on a great
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a heckuva player,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grubin knew that Houston was a ``good team,'' but she said her
agent, Italian Paolo Ronci, told her that the Sparks ``think they
can be champions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he told me who the people are (on the team), I thought
maybe it would be good to come here,'' said Grubin, who has started
the last seven games. ``I knew from the national team, DeLisha
Milton and Lisa Leslie, who everybody knows she's a great player.
She plays very well. I like how she played against us in Europe.
She played a very good game. So I saw what she can do. When you
have centers like two of them and some good perimeter players, I
think you can be the champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Grubin, who turns 27 next month, wanted to play in the WNBA last
year. She played professionally in Yugoslavia for two years, but
because of the embargo in her country, the team was not allowed to
play internationally. She left Yugoslavia to play for a Hungarian
team in the Euroleague last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every competition I had I saw that I could play on every
level in Europe,'' she said. ``I had a wish to play here (in the
WNBA), because this is the highest level in the world and finally,
you know, I'm here. I'm glad I came. I'm glad I fit in (with) the
Sparks so well. I think I do
</P>
<P>
   , from the beginning 'till this moment, I do a better job. Maybe
I can do more good, but it's OK, we're winning. It's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   She won't get any complaints from Woolridge. Once Grubin found
her comfort zone with the team and Woolridge told her to play her
normal style, which meant the green light was on, Grubin has become
another offensive threat for the Sparks. She's averaging 8.2
points, 2.4 assists and shooting 44 percent from the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's playing exactly the way I envisioned her playing,''
Woolridge said. ``The thing that I'm the most pleased with is she's
really adapted to that point guard position. She's pushing the ball
up the court, she's hitting the open shot, she's penetrating, her
defense is a lot better than she gets credit for, she's going to
the glass. She's playing a complete game. Right now she's playing
as good as any point guard in the league.''

FOX GETS `EARLY BIRD' CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After two seasons of forgoing bigger paychecks to
play for the Los Angeles Lakers, forward Rick Fox will get his due
today, when he is expected to sign a six-year, $24 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had not planned an announcement as of late Wednesday
afternoon, but Fox's representatives confirmed a deal had been
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick is extremely happy to know that he's going to finish his
career in Los Angeles,'' said agent Douglas Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who recently turned 30, has twice turned down multiyear,
multimillion-dollar offers elsewhere, signing one-year deals for $1
million and $1.75 million with the Lakers. But he earned so-called
``early Bird'' rights in the process, enabling the Lakers to exceed
the salary cap to give him a starting salary of $3 million next
season, climbing to about $5 million by the final year, 2004-05.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, Fox received similar offers from two other
teams _ one of which is believed to be San Antonio _ as recently as
Wednesday morning. He agreed to the Lakers' offer later in the day.

LOS ANGELES GALAXY NOTEBOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD GONZALEZ  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Five games down, five to go.
</P>
<P>
   But while mired in its most grueling stretch of the season _ 10
games in a span of 32 days _ the Galaxy has yet to show any ill
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Credit coach Sigi Schmid's utilization of team depth in helping
his side inch up the Western Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, which plays Saturday in San Jose before facing
Columbus in a U.S. Open Cup match at Cal State Fullerton next
Wednesday, sits in third place, a point behind Dallas and eight
behind Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very demanding on the players the next couple
of weeks, Schmid said ``Luckily, we have a little bit more depth
than we had at the beginning of the season. Roy Myers has been the
biggest addition. We have the personnel now to be able to adapt in
a number of areas with different combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid is combating the physical demands of the game scheduling
by allowing pared down intensity in the practices while putting
players in the pool to aid in tissue regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   -- Schmid's guess that Mexico's involvement in the
Confederations Cup final on Wednesday night might keep Chivas
supporters away from the Rose Bowl was off mark. When Galaxy
players appeared on field to warm up, an unmistakable chorus of
boos and whistling jeers rained down from the stands. The response
turned to cheers minutes later when Chivas player took the field.
</P>
<P>
   bullet The most entertaining moments to the Chivas-Galaxy clash
were provided by well-known Hispanic comedian Paul Rodriguez.
Appearing at Tuesday's Galaxy practice, Rodriguez took a stab at
Galaxy midfielder's diminituve stature by quipping aloud: ``Hey
Mauricio, you're in the wrong place, man. Santa Anita (and the rest
of the horse racing jockeys) is down the road from here.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Rodriguez lived out his dream in re-enacting a
World Cup moment. With Galaxy keeper Kevin Hartman in goal,
Rodriguez unleashed a penalty kick which successfully found the
left corner. The comedian dropped to his knees in jubilation before
tearing off his uniform topp -- unveiling the black sports bra he
was donning underneath.
</P>
<P>
   __ Doug Logan's ouster as MLS commissioner -- rumored since
season's outset -- was inevitable. But to replace one commissioner
of no soccer background with another of similar lack of expertise?
</P>
<P>
   Don Garber, who was named to the post on Wednesday, is known
more for his marketing expertise while with NFL International than
anything. That being the case, Garber should have been given Randy
Bernstien's job. Bernstein is MLS' reigning Chief Marketing
Officer.

HOMESTORE.COM IPO EXPECTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- HomeStore.com is expected to go public as early
as Wednesday amid heavy interest from investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Thousand Oaks parent of real estate Web sites will be
selling its shares at $20 each, up from the $8 to $10 it originally
planned, according to Tom Taulli, an IPO analyst and author of
``Investing in IPOs.''
</P>
<P>
   The company _ owner of the Realtor.com, HomeBuilder.com,
SpringStreet.com and CommercialSource.com Web sites _ has an
exclusive arrangement with the National Association of Realtors.
The relationship enables HomeStore.com to provide one of the
nation's largest listings of homes online.
</P>
<P>
   Realtor.com provides general home listings, HomeBuilder.com is a
site for new homes, SpringStreet.com lists apartments, and
CommercialSource.com serves the commercial real estate industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to have as many homes listed as possible and by not
being a threat to agents and brokers,'' Taulli said. In most cases,
consumers still will have to call the local real estate agent to
look at the homes.
</P>
<P>
   Taulli expects the HomeStore.com initial public offering to
attract healthy interest from investors, despite the choppy IPO
market. In recent weeks, market turbulence has knocked down many
Internet stocks and put a damper on the IPOs of Internet companies
as well. However, selected IPOs have done well.
</P>
<P>
   HomeStore.com's lead underwriter is Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
for the 7 million-share offering.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to receive about $121.7 million in proceeds,
up from $56.6 million at the IPO's initial price range, according
to IPO Monitor, a Calabasas company that tracks the initial public
offering market.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, capital
expenditures, working capital and accelerated payments of $6.3
million under a distribution agreement with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   HomeStore.com has attracted the prominent Silicon Valley venture
capitalist firm of Kleiner Perkins, which had backed Netscape,
Excite, Intuit and Sun Microsystems in their infancies.
</P>
<P>
   After the offering, Kleiner will hold 14.4 percent of the
company and GE Capital will own 5.3 percent, according to IPO
Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   True to the Internet company stereotype, HomeStore.com is
unprofitable. In the first six months of the year, the company lost
more money than it made: $50 million in losses on revenues of $21.4
million.

ALICIA GWYNN HAPPY FOR HUSBAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS __ Fifth inning on a pleasant evening at Busch
Stadium. Small groans from Cardinal fans gain momentum as the
Padres load the bases. Up walks Tony Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   Someone behind Tony's wife Alicia, sitting just off the Padres'
third-base dugout, says the Cardinal fans aren't cheering as loud
for Tony now, with the bases loaded, as they did in the fourth
inning, when he stroked hit No. 2,996 of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia pauses in her conversation with a reporter to watch her
husband. On the first pitch, that pause is broken by the crack of
Gwynn's bat and the sight of the ball soaring into the right field
bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Hit number 2,997 is a grand slam, and most of those in the Gwynn
entourage stand and cheer as Tony makes his way around the bases
and then taps fists with his teammates. At the lip of the dugout,
he taps a high fist with his son, 17-year-old Anthony, and then
gives him a fatherly push on the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Gwynn did not get up when Tony hit his grand slam. She
didn't even clap. Like her husband, she is a humble person at
heart. And sometimes, it is much more meaningful to let a moment
wash over you. And this moment was a tidal wave.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Gwynn's face reflected a thousand emotions during those
seconds, her eyes going to Tony, and to her son, and to others in
her family. Eventually, she looked at the several thousand Cardinal
fans, most everyone in the lower level located between the dugouts,
who stood and gave her husband a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a crowd like this to stand up and clap for you,''
said Alicia, ``when you can make them cheer for you when they are
here to see their team, that's respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited. But I mostly am happy for Tony. Because he earned
this. He deserves this.''
</P>
<P>
   The night would end with Tony getting a third hit, a slashing
single to left field, leaving him two hits shy of 3,000, and with
Mark McGwire hitting the 499th home run of his career, a 436-foot
blast that tied the game a Cardinals would eventually win, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Gwynn has been along for every hit of Tony's career, and
much more. They met when they were kids growing up in the same Long
Beach neighborhood, started dating when they were at Long Beach
Poly, got engaged while they were at San Diego State, and married
soon after she graduated and Tony went off to play professional
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   You can get Tony Gwynn to talk about baseball and his
experiences for a fortnight, and he can breakdown his swing the way
a biologist can breakdown a cell. But Alicia has played a large
role the last half-decade in making her husband more accessible to
the everyday fan, and not just because she was the first one to
videotape his at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Personal hubbub and huzzah are not Tony Gwynn's thing, to the
degree that he can't wait for his 3,000th hit ``just so things can
get back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony has always been a little shy,'' she said between hits
2,996 and 2,997. ``I don't know if I exactly told him to get out of
his shell. He'll talk baseball all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's blessed to be a good ballplayer. And a lot of the
people who wanted access to him are those who helped him get here,
whether he knows it or not. He has his talents, but the fans played
a big part in him getting recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicia hears from those fans all the time people in the
neighborhood, people she meets at the store, old friends from Long
Beach, 20-year Padre season ticket holders. They tell her they've
been fans since the beginning and love her husband because he's
such a good guy.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia talked Tony into creating their foundation, The Tony and
Alicia Gwynn Foundation, in 1993 as a way to organize and better
direct their charity work. Prior to that, Gwynn gave of himself
through golf tournaments and special appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation allows us to direct exactly where the benefits
go,'' she said. The YMCA, Police Athletic League and several youth
programs are among the charities. Baseball honored Gwynn with the
Branch Rickey Award (for community service) in 1995 for his
foundation work, and he's a two-time winner of the Roberto Clemente
Award, which goes to one player on every team.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has since grown to include an annual golf
tournament, a benefit dinner, silent auctions and Gwynn's novel
mobile museum. A friend who owned a big rig asked if the Gwynns had
any use for one, and Alicia came up with the idea of a museum that
includes artifacts from Gwynn's career. The $1 admission fee goes
to foundation charities.
</P>
<P>
   Other contributions are more direct. There are several dozen
kids in the Gwynn neighborhood in Poway, friends of Anthony and his
sister Anisha, who have turned the Gwynn household into their
second home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come to the house to play, and I love to cook for them,''
she said. ``It's not uncommon for 15 kids to be over at the
house.'' And when Tony is home, there is undoubtedly a lot of
baseball talk.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``he will talk a lot about their lives, and what they're
going to do with it. There can be quite the little roundtable of
Tony and kids talking baseball and life.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his dad, Charles, did with Tony, older brother Charles and
younger brother Chris? ``Absolutely,'' said Alicia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony is a genuine person. He's just ... Tony. He gets his
(humility) from his parents. It was something his parents and my
parents reiterated to us. He may be wiser now, but he's basically
the same person he was when we met.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony's attitude is he loves what he does and he doesn't have
to tell everybody about it. And he does (charity) things because
they make him feel good, and it's not necessary to tell everyone
when he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that. I just want him to get his due. There's
something to be said for being consistent. Maybe that's what people
were cheering about tonight.''

GWYNN TWO SHY OF MILESTONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Wednesday night may have been the most electric
night of the 1999 baseball season. At least until tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Before 43,546 at Busch Stadium, Tony Gwynn got three hits,
leaving him two shy of 3,000 in his career, and Mark McGwire hit
the 499th home run of his career. The convergence of two players
nearing two baseball milestones in the same game was more than
enough to render the Cardinals' 7-6 win as
</P>
<P>
   meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Never in baseball history have two players reached 500 home runs
and 3,000 hits in the same game. A 500-to-3,000 parlay has happened
in the same season only three times, what with there being only 22
members of the 3K club and only 15 players with 500 home runs.
Needless to say, tonight's game here is a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn singled sharply to left in the fourth inning, slammed the
third grand slam home run in his 18-year career in the fifth, and
singled to left again in the seventh. He was waiting on deck when
the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   The slam was a stunning moment in Gwynn's march to 3,000. The
Cards led 3-2 when Gwynn drove Kent Mercker's first pitch over the
fence, putting the Padres up 6-3. Despite that, a large portion of
the crowd gave him a standing ovation, including most everyone in
the expensive field seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was unbelievable,'' said Gwynn afterwards. ``I can't
explain it. Their team is up by a run and suddenly down by three,
and people got on their feet. To be a visiting player and get that
kind of response is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's St. Louis,'' said McGwire. ``But I think people
appreciate milestones everywhere. I know they're special. I was
fortunate to see Dave Winfield get his 3,000th, and I'd like to see
Tony get it here. If he gets a single, I'll shake his hand and give
him a hug before he gets mobbed by his teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's three hits came after going 1-for-10 in the first two
games and three innings of this four-game series. He has been
struggling with his mechanics since coming off the disabled list
July 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty happy to get a hit and finally do something
right,'' he said of his fourth-inning single. ``He (Mercker) got me
on a changeup my first at-bat. I stayed back on my second at-bat
and got the hit. My third at-bat, I thought he might try to get
ahead with the bases loaded and went looking for a fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn said he felt a little embarrassed to get such a response
from the fans. `It's great because it's not at home,'' he said.
``It would be historic if we both reached our milestones in the
same game, but I feel guilty because it's Mark's town. They may see
my 3,000th, but they're coming to see Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's blast with two out in the seventh off Carlos Reyes
tied the game at six, and an unearned run in the eighth gave the
Cards the win.
</P>
<P>
   A pitching change in the seventh after Gwynn's third hit allowed
McGwire and Gwynn the chance to talk. They discussed what bat
McGwire has been using this season a Davey Lopes-model bat and how
difficult it is dealing with the media demands during moments like
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``For both of us, it's just a matter of time. What game, what
inning, what pitch,'' said McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do is play,'' said Gwynn. I can't preview it any
more. I'm numb. I really want to get it done with so I can get back
to being just one of 25 guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's previous grand slams were also on the road. one at
Philadelphia in 1995 and one against the Dodgers, an
inside-the-parker in 1997 when Brett Butler dove for slicing drive
and injured himself

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ This just in: Cortez Kennedy and Sam Adams are
big.
</P>
<P>
   XXXXL big. Larger-than-life big. Big even by NFL standards.
Their weight has been a constant source for conversation,
consternation and even fines for as long as each has worn an
overmatched Seahawks uniform _ Kennedy coming aboard in 1990 as the
club's first-round draft choice and Adams joining him as a
first-round pick in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, both of the rotund defensive tackles checked into
training camp last week lighter and in better shape than they have
been in years.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with the arrival of new coach Mike Holmgren, weight has
become relative. In Green Bay, Holmgren had Gilbert Brown, who is
listed at 350 pounds but has played as heavy as 365 and taped
segments for NFL pregame shows flaunting the eating habits that
stoke his girth.
</P>
<P>
   Put Kennedy and Adams next to Brown and they would become a
diminutive duo.
</P>
<P>
   ``How big is too big to play?'' Holmgren said Wednesday. ``Each
guy is different. He can be big, but if he can play, that's the
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   While there have been a ton of questions about Kennedy's and
Adams' weight, no one has ever questioned that they can play.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was NFL defensive player of the year in 1992 on a 2-14
team and has played in the Pro Bowl seven times in his nine-year
career.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was a first alternate to the Pro Bowl two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Holmgren asked each to report at a reduced weight
because he will ask them to do different things than the previous
coaching staff, who used their massive bodies as disruptive
battering rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real pleased; Cortez and Sam worked real hard to get their
weight down,'' Holmgren said. ``If a player realizes why you're
asking them to do (something), it makes it easier for everyone.
It's stamina. It's longevity for their career. It's for their
health. It's for their quality of life. There are a lot of reasons
to try and get down; it's just hard for those big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy got the message. He weighs 308 pounds, the lightest he
has been at training camp in four years. So did Adams, who played
at 320 last year but now weighs 314 and plans to get down to at
least 300 by the Sept. 12 regular-season opener against the Detroit
Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like being lighter,'' Adams said. ``It's just easier on
your joints. With all the turf we play on (10 of 16 games this
season), toward the end of the season you slow down, your joints
are tired, you're in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his reduced weight, Kennedy delivers a playful scowl
before offering, ``You know I don't talk about my weight. Let's
just say I'm underweight.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is the type who prefers to let his actions speak for
him, even if he will be doing it with a little less body language.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I respect about Holmgren's coaching is that he wants
you to be disciplined, play football and everything else will take
care of itself,'' Kennedy said. ``My weight has never been an issue
with me. People have made it an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get to the regular season, I'm always at my weight, so
I don't care what they say or don't say. I'm just going to do my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren doesn't want Kennedy and Adams to lose the explosive
burst that regularly launches them past would-be blockers and into
opposing backfields. But he also wants them to remain more under
control, so they can make more plays once they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see Sam penetrate, then the quarterback or running back
will run right by him,'' Holmgren said. ``I saw that on film a
number of times. The same thing with Cortez. We don't want to take
away what has made them so successful, but we want them to
penetrate and, boom, make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   And at times, hold their own on the line and make the play as it
comes to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We term it a square-shouldered defense,'' said defensive line
coach Larry Brooks, who was a 260-pound Pro Bowl defensive end
during his career with the Los Angeles Rams in the mid-70s before
the influx of 300-plus-pound offensive linemen forced a similar
evolution in defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to run up the field and create gaps the
linebackers can't fill. We like the linemen to use their hands and
play with leverage. For these guys, it's new.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kennedy and Adams, so is reporting to camp at less than 315
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: The team got a scare during the morning practice when
CB Fred Thomas crumpled to the ground while in pass coverage and
grabbed his right knee. The injury appeared serious, but Thomas was
able to walk off the field. ... DE Phillip Daniels sat out the end
of the workout after bruising his left knee. ... After seven very
physical practices, Wednesday's second session lasted only an hour
and focused on the punting game, which meant the offensive and
defensive linemen got the afternoon off. The lone exception was C
Greg Bloedorn, who handled the deep-snapping. ... Play du jour: FS
Jay Bellamy's stunning hit on RB Reggie Brown. Stunning? Brown was
stunned momentarily and remained on the ground for several minutes
after Bellamy arrived at almost the same instant as a short pass
from QB Jon Kitna.

HOLMGREN GIVES UNDRAFTED ROOKIE A RARE SECOND CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY _ Sunday morning when he walked out of Seahawks training
camp, Jonathon Nance kissed his cleats goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kissed `em, stuck `em on top of my locker and called my
buddies to come get me,'' Nance said.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that the shoes were covered in sweat, grass and medical
tape. Nance needed to perform some kind of symbolic final act to
end his blip of an NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   So Nance pressed his lips to the leather of his Nikes and blew
it all away.
</P>
<P>
   Or so he thought at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Nance, the 24-year-old rookie free agent defensive end out of
Washington State, had participated in exactly one practice session
before deciding he had seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   It did not matter that he was making the NFL-mandated $675 a
week just to be in Cheney or that his Seahawk contract would pay
him six figures if he made the team. At a slightly undersized 257
pounds, Nance felt he'd be better off running into brick walls than
hitting the 300-plus-pound offensive linemen now staring into his
face mask. And after spending too little time developing his
aerobic conditioning, Nance said he was too winded, too out of
shape to compete in Mike Holmgren's camp.
</P>
<P>
   Or so he thought at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams die hard. Ever since he was 10 years old, growing up with
his six brothers and two sisters in football-mad Miami, Nance
dreamed of playing in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   But even more surprising than Nance walking out of Seahawk camp
after one practice is that he was back Wednesday. And he was back
because Holmgren called him and told him he had made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't thank him enough,'' Nance said of his return, thanks
to a coach who refused to let the rookie buckle to doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he saw that I made a bad decision. He said he wished I
had come talked to him man-to-man, told him what was going on, that
I was out of shape. I think what it shows is that coach cares about
his players,'' Nance said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren did not want to discuss at length the details of their
conversation, only that he felt he should reach out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hard. It's very competitive and hot, and I wanted to
make sure that if he was leaving, he was doing it for the right
reason. We just had a little chat and he's back here now,''
Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's action has made a big impression on a lot of
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other coach would have taken the time with a guy who has
all that stacked against him,'' said veteran defensive end Phillip
Daniels, who has now taken Nance under his wing, telling him about
all the free agents who have made it in the NFL and about how he,
too, weighed only 250 his first training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Against all odds. That's how some of the game's most
professional players make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another coach would have said `Let him go. We'll bring
somebody else in here,''' Daniels said, ``but coach took the time
to say to tell Jonathon, `You're young. You're making a dumb
mistake.' He said come back in. He gave him a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   With some difficulty, Nance was tracked down in Pullman at the
home of former WSU teammates Joey Hollenbeck and Ryan Tujague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do much of anything except sit around the house for a
couple of days, eating and thinking. I was pretty down,'' Nance
said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 credits shy of his degree in criminal justice, Nance
said his plan was to save up some money and head back to school in
the spring. He said he wants to be a juvenile parole officer back
home in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Only now he realizes he can pursue that avenue later _
especially with veterans like Daniels keeping on him to stay
focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're young, you come in to camp, it's unfamiliar
territory. You come in and feel the odds are stacked against you.
You get to thinking that and thinking that you can't make it when
actually you can,'' Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to tell him was never think negative. Always
think positive because you can get a spot on this team or somewhere
else. This is an opportunity. He would have regretted that the rest
of his life,'' Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the veterans didn't rib Nance. When they saw him come
walking through the training room Wednesday, Daniels looked over at
Cortez Kennedy, who started singing ``Welcome Back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Michael) Sinclair was on the table saying, `Leave him alone.
He's OK.' And Tez said, `I'm just playing with him. He knows I'm
joking with him.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Tez shook his hand and said, `Let's go. Welcome back,
Dog.' All us vets knew Jonathon made a bad decision. And we all
said we wished he had come talked to us. But I'm glad he's back,''
Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys dream of being in the NFL. I mean, you always
dream about this one shot. You just don't want to pass it up.
That's the one thing I told him.''
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday, Nance took his cleats down from the top of the
locker, put them back on and went back out to try again.
</P>
<P>
   Word is he had a great practice.

DISARCINA'S AS FIRST THOUGHT 
ONE BAT DOES IT FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 NOTE: IT WAS EDMONDS' BAT, NOT(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ A cynic might question why the Angels hitters
even bother to bring a bat to the plate, considering their lack of
offense this season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels tried something different Wednesday night in
their 4-3 win over the Kansas City Royals before 18,216 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The first time through the order, all nine Angels batters used
the same bat, which belonged to Jim Edmonds. They went 4 for 8 with
a walk, including an RBI double by catcher Ben Molina that drove in
the first run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But it also caused a little confusion. Orlando Palmeiro led off
the first inning and struck out looking. He dropped the bat on the
plate for Gary DiSarcina, who was up next.
</P>
<P>
   But home-plate umpire Tim Tschida thought Palmeiro was showing
him up and threw Palmeiro out of the game. Manager Terry Collins
came out of the dugout to explain, and Palmeiro was allowed to stay
in.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will try just about anything to change their
fortunes. Going into Wednesday's game, they had scored one run or
fewer in nine of the 19 games since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, they were hitting .231 as a team and averaging 3.0 runs
per game since the break.
</P>
<P>
   Molina's double off Royals starter Jay Witasick (4-9) in the
second inning not only drove in Darin Erstad (single) to give the
Angels a 1-0 lead, but it was Molina's first &UR;  &LR; major &UR; - &LR; league hit.
He added an RBI single in the fourth inning and an infield single
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Molina, who got into two games last season and had one at-bat,
finished 3 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a chance to see him a lot in spring training,''
Collins said. ``But the reports on him were great. And the guys
that have pitched to him really like him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also got three hits from Jeff Huson, an RBI single
from Garret Anderson and a sacrifice fly by Palmeiro in a 10-hit
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Ken Hill continued to pitch well after missing
nearly three weeks in July with an inflamed elbow. On Wednesday
Hill allowed three runs (two earned) and five hits in 62/3 innings.
In his four starts since returning from his elbow problems, Hill
has an ERA of 2.63.
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Mike Holtz and Shigetoshi Hasegawa got the Angels to
the ninth, when Troy Percival closed it out for his 25th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels find themselves will play out the final 50-odd games
with nothing to play for but pride. Collins said it shouldn't be
difficult for his players to come to the ballpark motivated each
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a challenge to get the effort, that's
easy,'' he said. ``That's stuff I not only demand of myself and the
players, but they should demand of themselves and me.''

`STUDENT-DRIVER' HANAUER PAYS HOMAGE TO MENTOR MUNCEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If Chip Hanauer had his way he would have retired in
1982 after winning his first Gold Cup _ unlimited hydroplane
racing's crown jewel. He genuinely doubted his racing career could
get any more magical.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hanauer's third victory and remains number one No. 1 in
his heart because of the emotional circumstances surrounding it. It
was his first win after replacing his mentor, the late racing
champion Bill Muncey, as driver.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades and seven driver championships later, Hanauer
comes to the Seafair General Motors Cup on Lake Washington this
weekend needing only one more victory in the Fred Leland-owned Miss
Pico to tie Muncey's all-time record 62 victories. Although you'd
think the occasion warrants great celebration and anticipation, the
Seattle native has mixed feelings about the feat.
</P>
<P>
   Hanauer strongly believes that not all records are made to be
broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways I wouldn't want to break the record,'' Hanauer
said. ``I already have more Gold Cups (11) and national
championships than Bill. Frankly, I don't feel all that good about
taking this record away. He's Bill Muncey; he's a legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it would be bittersweet. Bill's memory has more
of a good use for the record than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Muncey's widow, Fran, has always encouraged
Hanauer to stay after the record. She welcomed his return from the
sport this season after a 2{-year absence in hopes Hanauer would go
down in history alongside her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Muncey and Hanauer have remained close friends. She arrives
in Seattle Thursday to witness Hanauer's weekend run for the record
and for her induction into the Hydroplane Hall of Fame along with
George Henley and Bill Brow.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fran Muncey, Hanauer's competitors and those that have
followed the sport may be more enthusiastic about the impending
record than he is. Hanauer sees it more as another victory for his
team. Others believe Hanauer's quest has energized the sport and
drawn welcome welcomed attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like comparing apples and oranges for different sports,
but for our sport this is like him getting the home run record,''
said Dr. Ken Muscatel, commissioner of the Unlimited Hydroplane
Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think the home run record would stand longer. Then
again no one ever thought Bill's record would be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is newly- crowned home run king Mark McGwire
never competed alongside Roger Maris, whose record he broke. They
never spent long afternoons in the dugout talking about the nuances
of their sport, a veteran teaching the up-and-comer.
</P>
<P>
   Hanauer and Muncey did share that type of relationship, and
understanding their bond helps us appreciate Hanauer's reverence
for Muncey, if not for the record run itself.
</P>
<P>
   Muncey was about to clinch his sixth and final championship when
Hanauer came on the scene in the late 1970s and early '80s, but the
veteran liked the young driver so much they raced as teammates in
off-weekend endurance events around the West Coast. It wasn't so
much a tutorial in the art of driving a boat as a primer in being a
champion, in representing the sport with poise and personality.
</P>
<P>
   Muncey wasn't just a champion driver, he was hydroplane racing's
showman, a reporter's ideal interview, the series ambassador. As
Fran Muncey likes to joke, ``No one else needed to talk because
Bill did the talking for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   That couldn't have been a better situation for Hanauer at the
time. Although he is considered one of sports' best interviews now,
when Hanauer first started racing he was extremely shy, a
``yes-and-no'' answer kind of guy. Then Muncey started dragging
Hanauer along to his own news conferences and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Hanauer still laughs remembering a particular interview with a
Seattle television station after one of the pair's endurance races.
The boat broke with Muncey at the helm on the first lap of the
nine-hour event. With Hanauer sitting expressionless at his side,
Muncey told the reporter that Chip was driving at the time and made
a mistake costing them the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told this whole story that was untrue and so I finally had
to say, `Wait a minute, that's not how it was,''' Hanauer said.
``He had been prodding me to talk and take the initiative, and so
really he forced the issue on me. He had always told me that I had
the ability to drive, so we didn't need to go there. He wanted me
to learn not to be so shy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the lesson was put to the test earlier than anyone could
have imagined. Muncey was killed in a crash while leading the final
heat of the 1981 season finale, the Acapulco World Championship in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Bill cared so much about the sport, he always made me
promise that if anything ever happened to him that I'd get the boat
to the next race _ that the race must go on,'' Fran Muncey said.
``I felt I had to honor his request, and Bill always liked Chip
because he was such a good student of the sport. Chip was my only
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Fran Muncey and her new driver carried on with the Atlas
Van Lines team, and the results never reflected the great
challenges this new adventure handed them. Not only did Hanauer win
the 1982 Gold Cup, he won four other races en route to the season
championship and collected two more titles during his seven-year
tenure with Muncey's team.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Hanauer, who also had stints in the Circus Circus
and Miss Budweiser boats, successfully made the transition from
introverted young driver to experienced professional. He is
accessible to the media, popular with fans and Seattle's favorite
homegrown sports figure.
</P>
<P>
   And like Muncey, Hanauer has managed to protect his privacy away
from the racing circuit. He escaped to his beach home this week for
a little peace before the Seafair hubbub begins. And there's even a
slim chance Hanauer will take himself out of the cockpit this
weekend since his neck and back are still sore from a horrifying
flip-over last weekend at Tri-Cities.
</P>
<P>
   The chase for the record has almost become more a burden than a
notch in his belt. The expectations, the constant hype have Hanauer
eager to accomplish the feat as much for relief as for glory.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the rare moments Hanauer allows himself to reflect upon
the significance of this accomplishment, he is humble and
respectful.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it says was that I was fortunate enough to work with
talented people a whole lot of years, and I rode on their
shoulders,'' Hanauer said. ``I contributed my portion, and I'm
proud of that, but the thing that means the most to me is that the
guys that have worked so hard on the boat have entrusted it to me,
and I was able to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel if it (the record) would happen, we've kept it in the
family, and I hope Bill would look at it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fran Muncey assures the family would have it no other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often ask me who I think is the better driver,'' Fran
Muncey said. ``Bill was more a showman and cared about building the
sport. Chip is so focused and concentrated every time he goes out
in the boat, he could never just let even one heat slide. In seven
years he drove for us, he never made one driver error that caused
us to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Muncey and Chip Hanauer are both my heroes. Not only are
they the very best people in the world at what they did, they are
honorable and decent human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   It's likely Hanauer will cherish that legacy most _ not victory
No. 63.
</P>
<P>
   His return this season and the ensuing record run have
invigorated the sport and given it an element of intrigue that's
been waning the past few years. People across the world are
interested in hydroplanes again.
</P>
<P>
   And that, Chip, would also make Bill Muncey proud.

ON-THE-JOB TRAINING FOR BUHNER AT FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For those wondering, Jay Buhner's previous first-base
experience can be measured like the hairs on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Zippo.
</P>
<P>
   When Buhner starts at the first base Saturday against the New
York Yankees, it will be a career first _ at any level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish I would have played a little bit (at first base)
in spring training ... so I wouldn't be so nervous,'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   Since trading David Segui to Toronto last week, the Mariners
have used John Mabry and Raul Ibanez, both left-handed hitters, at
first.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Edgar Martinez has played first in the past,
but the Mariners say they are more inclined to let him concentrate
on his hitting. That leaves a need for a right-handed batter at the
position.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   Normally a right fielder, Buhner had considered playing first
base during spring training, uncertain how his surgically repaired
right elbow might hold up on long throws from the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   But he proved to be a fast healer, the plans were scrapped and
he assumed his normal spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners turn to him now because of his athleticism and
their obvious need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks you get old and get put at first base, but
there's a lot to it,'' said Lee Pelekoudas, vice president of
baseball administration. ``He's athletic enough to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mariners manager Lou Piniella, ``He's got nice hands. I
think he'll do a real good job.''
</P>
<P>
   For Buhner, the move could be a career enhancer, an alternative
once his outfield skills diminish. He's looking forward to his new
duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it'll work out,'' Buhner said. ``I'm sure it won't
hurt me. Actually, it'll be nice to try something new, to break up
the monotony.''
</P>
<P>
   DON'T FORGET TO WRITE: He won't admit to helping Segui pack his
bags or high-fiving guys in the clubhouse, but the person who
benefited the most from the Segui trade was Mabry. A part-time
player since coming to the Mariners in the offseason, Mabry has
started seven of eight games at first base, including Wednesday
night, since the vacancy was created.
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime .286 hitter and full-time player entering the season,
Mabry was hitting .242 and playing sporadically when Segui left.
With regular at-bats, he had raised his average to .250 entering
Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what's going to happen,'' Mabry said
cautiously. ``Baseball is a crazy game. You treat the game with
respect and it respects you. You never expect anything.''
</P>
<P>
   BLACK HOLE: If it seems there have been a large number of balls
skipping past the catchers at Safeco Field _ seven wild pitches and
two passed balls so far _ there is a reason.
</P>
<P>
   Catchers have had trouble picking up high pitches early in the
game against the center-field backdrop, combating both the
reflective glare from the sun and white lettering that rotates on
an advertising board.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners catchers Dan Wilson and Tom Lampkin met with club
officials on the field before last night's contest to try to
resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 5 to 8:30, it's brutal,'' Lampkin said. ``Sometimes you
can't even see the spin on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   An obvious solution discussed was to change or darken the
lettering on the reader board.
</P>
<P>
   TICKET WINDOW: The four-game series that starts tonight against
the Yankees is virtually sold out. As of Wednesday, there were just
a handful of single tickets available for each game, though
season-ticket holders have the option of turning in seats and
making them available at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the series that started selling immediately,''
Mariners spokesman Tim Hevly said.

SONICS LOOKING AT MAVS' TRENT AS RICHMOND DEALING COOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Sonics were close to signing a free agent
Wednesday, and an announcement could come as early Thursday,
according to a source.
</P>
<P>
   But the chances of that player being veteran shooting guard
Mitch Richmond are fading barring a sudden, multiple-team deal. The
source said one of five different deals could materialize for the
Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Among those on team president Wally Walker's ``prioritized list
that's reasonably short'' is Dallas free agent forward Gary Trent,
who has emerged as perhaps the most intriguing prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Walker rationalized his interest in Trent in Wednesday's
editions of the Forth Worth Star-Telegram, which reported the
Sonics are offering the 6-foot-8 forward a three-year deal worth
$11.28 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty well loaded at power forward and center, but you
can have a lot of guys who are versatile at the positions and go to
the best matchups and punish some folks,'' Walker told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   If Trent signs, the Sonics plan to use him at small forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics Wednesday still had not ruled out quicker, more
athletic small forwards: Cleveland's Cedric Henderson, Dallas'
Cedric Ceballos and Utah's Shandon Anderson. But each of those
players can earn more by re-signing with their respective teams.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson originally wanted $9 million from the Jazz, which
offered $4 million a season. Now, Utah is presenting Anderson with
a four-year package worth $24 million and a spot in the starting
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos will simply go to the highest bidder, and the Sonics'
interest in Henderson is believed to have turned lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they'd know something by the afternoon,'' said
Dwight Manley, who represents Vernon Maxwell, another player the
Sonics are interested in signing. ``I don't know if they're still
trying to get Mitch or what. But we'll be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker has tirelessly pursued a sign-and-trade deal with the
Washington Wizards for Richmond. A source said Walker had not
completely given up late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are no takers for Hersey Hawkins and the
remaining two years/$8.6 million on his contract. So Walker's chore
has been to find a team with enough salary cap room to trade for
Hawkins or engineer a three-team transaction to complete a
sign-and-trade deal with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say the Sonics are out of (the Richmond
sweepstakes),'' the source said. ``Washington just doesn't want
Hawk. They're not going to give Richmond away. They've got someone
specific in mind and they want the Sonics to go get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unloading Hawkins' $4.1 million salary for this season plus the
team's $3.3 million under the salary cap would allow the Sonics to
absorb roughly $7.5 million in salary for Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Walker will not talk about prospects until deals are announced.
Richmond's agent, Mike Sharpe, did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``With every day that goes by, it's getting tougher to do,'' the
source said of a Richmond deal.
</P>
<P>
   That is because of a few developments.
</P>
<P>
   Washington raised it's three-year offer to Richmond. It is a
deal that would start the six-time All-Star at $12 million. Also,
Miami was reportedly trying to find a third team with salary-cap
space to facilitate a three-way trade that would bring Richmond to
the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Losing out on Richmond would be a big blow to the Sonics,
considering the size of shooting guards in the Western Conference.
Portland added 6-foot-8 Steve Smith, Sacramento traded for 6-6 Nick
Anderson, the Los Angeles Lakers have 6-7 Kobe Bryant, San
Antonio's Mario Elie is 6-5 and the 6-6 Anderson could be in a Utah
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Barring any changes in the Sonics lineup, any of those players
could post up Hawkins, who stands 6-3.

MECHE HIT HARD AS DEVIL RAYS END MARINERS' WIN STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariners might have had Yankees on the mind.
</P>
<P>
   What they got instead was a former Yankee on the mound, a big
deficit before the first train rumbled past and a painful learning
experience for rookie Gil Meche.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to extend a six-game win streak and move to the plus side
of .500, the Mariners (53-54) went the other direction. After a
week of good feelings at Safeco Field, the home club turned
listless Wednesday night, losing 7-1 to Tampa Bay before a crowd of
42,336.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a momentum-builder for a visit from New York,
which shows up Thursday for the first of four games _ and its only
tour of Seattle this season. On the mound, Roger Clemens will
oppose the Mariners' Jamie Moyer, a considerable step up in marquee
value from Wednesday night's Meche-Dave Eiland pairing.
</P>
<P>
   Against Tampa Bay, Meche (2-2), making his sixth big-league
appearance and fifth start, lasted just 11 batters. He retired the
first two. Easily. Strikeout and groundout to the catcher. The next
nine batters, however, roughed him up good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't sharp tonight,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``He
couldn't get his breaking ball over and they were sitting on his
fastball. He threw 15 curveballs and only two for strikes. That's
not a very good percentage. He had the flu earlier in the week, but
he said he was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the damage was Wade Boggs' 2,997th hit, an infield
safety in the second inning, leaving him three shy of a cherished
milestone. The Devil Rays star, however, didn't play that much more
than Meche, leaving with right knee inflammation in the fifth
inning and taking just three at-bats. Boggs' exit was described as
a precautionary move.
</P>
<P>
   Meche served up two runs in the first, Fred McGriff's homer to
right-center following up Tony Graffanino's triple to left-center.
That was the first long ball off the Mariners' pitching staff in
six games.
</P>
<P>
   The young Mariners starter was touched for two more runs in the
second, his wild pitch sending one across and Terrell Lowrey's
double bringing in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Meche finally sat down after Boggs got aboard, leaving runners
at first and third with two outs. Boggs slapped a ball to a diving
John Mabry at first and beat the throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's all right,'' said Mariners reliever Frankie Rodriguez of
Meche. ``He's got a good head on his shoulders. He knows what he
needs to do, and that's get it done the next time out.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Mike Defelice had four hits for the Devil Rays,
including a two-run homer off Rodriguez in the ninth. McGriff had
three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the Mariners in check was Eiland, one of the big
league's ultimate journeyman pitchers and an unlikely nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Eiland was 1-6 entering the contest, 7-22 for his
undistinguished career. He had been up and down and shuffled around
so much, he spent two separate tours of duty with New York, four
years apart. He spent the first two months of this season in the
minors. In fact, his job security had been so shaky, Eiland got
work last winter as a double for actor Kevin Costner in the
unreleased movie ``For The Love Of The Game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke in with me in New York,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Eiland doesn't have to keep his day job any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the 33-year-old Floridian mixed his pitches and
threw six shutout innings at the Mariners before turning the game
over to his bullpen. He was in trouble only once, loading the bases
in the second inning, but got a double-play grounder from Russ
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Eiland scattered five hits, walked just one and picked up his
first road victory in the big leagues since 1990 _ when he pitched
the Yankees to a 7-2 win over Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Albie Lopez and Roberto Hernandez finished up, retiring nine of
10 batters, the only interruption a leadoff walk to Ken Griffey Jr.
in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   This one was over so quickly, the Mariners emptied their
bullpen. Newly acquired Tom Davey made his first appearance,
becoming the 25th player and 13th rookie to step on the mound for
Seattle this season. He threw 21/3 innings, giving up an unearned
run as the defense turned sloppy behind him, committing a pair of
errors.
</P>
<P>
   The home side was so quiet, the biggest stir from the crowd came
in the top of the ninth when a fan in a black T-shirt and shorts
sprinted across the field, only to be sent crashing hard into the
left field fence by security guards.

ONE BAT ENOUGH FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 WRITETHROUGH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ A cynic might question why the Anaheim Angels
even bother to bring a bat to the plate at all, considering their
lack of offense this season.
</P>
<P>
   But they tried something a little different Wednesday night and
it worked in their 4-3 win over the Kansas City Royals before
18,216 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The first time through the order, all nine Angels batters used
the same bat, which belonged to outfielder Jim Edmonds. They went 4
for 8 with a walk, including an RBI double by catcher Ben Molina
that drove in the first run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was hitting coach Rod Carew's idea to lighten things up a
little. Picking Edmonds' bat had no real significance; they also
had Gary DiSarcina's bat ready, but they didn't need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It broke the tension a little bit,'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said. ``We're just trying to have a little fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting in the dugout before the game and I hear someone
say, `Let's use one with tape on it because I need a grip on it.' I
said `What is going on?' They said, `We're using one bat,' so I
said, `There better be some (expletive) hits in that bat.'''
</P>
<P>
   But it also caused a little confusion. Orlando Palmeiro led off
the first inning and struck out looking. He dropped the bat on the
plate, leaving it for DiSarcina, who was up next.
</P>
<P>
   But home-plate umpire Tim Tschida thought Palmeiro was showing
him up and threw Palmeiro out of the game. Collins came out of the
dugout to explain, and Palmeiro was allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was confusing, because I didn't say anything,'' Palmeiro
said. ``I didn't do anything in disgust and didn't say anything to
him. I was in shock. He said, `Come back and pick up your bat,' and
I said, `The next guy's using it.' It was just a
misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will try just about anything these days to change
their fortunes. Going into Wednesday's game, they had scored one
run or fewer in nine of the 19 games since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, they were hitting .231 as a team and averaging 3.0 runs
per game since the break.
</P>
<P>
   Molina's double off Royals starter Jay Witasick (4-9) in the
second inning not only drove in Darin Erstad (single) to give the
Angels a 1-0 lead, but it was Molina's first major-league hit. He
added an RBI single in the fourth inning and an infield single in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Molina, who got into two games last season and had one at-bat,
finished 3 for 4. He also got to keep Edmonds' bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have it right here, and the ball,'' Molina said, pointing
inside his locker. ``It's kind of awesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he's got the hottest bat in the American League
right now,'' Collins said. ``He handles the bat all right and he
throws all right. But before we put him in the Hall of Fame, let's
see him play a few more games.''

MO HAS INFECTED SHIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mo Vaughn was not at Edison Field for
Wednesday's Anaheim Angels game against the Kansas City Royals.
Instead, he was resting at home in Newport Beach, fighting a staph
infection in his right shin.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn came out of Monday's game after five innings because he
felt ill, but he played Tuesday night. After Tuesday's game, Vaughn
had a 104-degree temperature and was instructed to go to the
hospital, but never did.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn finally went to the hospital Wednesday morning and now is
taking antibiotics. He'll be re-examined today, but isn't expected
to play tonight against his former team, the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   -- It wasn't working for him, so Angels manager Terry Collins
pawned it off on Todd Greene. Collins has had in his office all
season a decorative wheel, designed by a Native American witch
doctor. It is supposed to ward off evil spirits.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a wood carving of a bear, which is recognized as
the strongest symbol on a Native American Totem Pole. Both were
given to Collins by a woman who says Edison Field is cursed because
it sits on Native American burial ground.
</P>
<P>
   Both artifacts are now in Greene's locker.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's locker sits in the darkest corner of the clubhouse and,
in the past few seasons, it has been occupied by Eddie Murray and
Cecil Fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, yeah, it's cursed,'' Greene said of his locker. ``Look
at all the people who have been there. They've been released or
sent down or hit .230. Or all of the above.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Going into Wednesday's game, pitchers starting against the
Angels had thrown four complete games in five days.
</P>
<P>
   The only pitcher who didn't go the distance was Royals pitcher
Jose Rosado, who pitched seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pitcher Mike James threw four scoreless innings at Class-A
Lake Elsinore Tuesday. He allowed three hits, struck out two and
didn't walk a batter in his second rehab appearance.
</P>
<P>
   James, recovering from elbow surgery, is expected to continue
his rehab at Triple-A Edmonton.

GALAXY KNOCKS OFF CHIVAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD GONZALEZ  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ While the most popular of party hosts were
nowhere to be found Wednesday night, a festive Rose Bowl crowd of
14,106 _ mostly of Latino descent _ managed to find plenty to cheer
about.
</P>
<P>
   From the continued solid play of the Los Angeles Galaxy to the
welcomed appearance of Chivas, right down to word of Mexico's
victory over Brazil in the Confederations Cup several thousand
miles away, it was a time for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibition match at the Rose Bowl, the Galaxy upended
Chivas de Guadalajara 3-1 in a game marred by the absence of
several top players for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy opened a 2-0 lead on a superb individual effort by
Ezra Hendrickson for a goal early in the second half, then
withstood a Chivas goal in the 73rd minute by countering with one
of its own down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Galaxy's second victory in as many chances against
the popular Mexican club team. L.A. defeated Chivas (on penalty
kicks) in a 1997 exhibition in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cobi Jones nor Robin Frasier played for the Galaxy,
having just returned from national team duty. Both represented the
U.S. in Tuesday night's third-place game at the Confederations Cup.
Popular striker Carlos Hermosillo, still nursing a strained lower
back, also opted to rest as a precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to win every time out by going all out with our
people,'' said Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid, who made six substitutions
at halftime. ``We have a long haul right now. If we can make use of
our depth to get through this stretch, we will take full advantage
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chivas was also at partial strength. Defenders Claudio Suarez
and Joel Sanchez were playing for Mexico against Brazil while the
trio of Luis Garcia, Alberto Coyote and Oswaldo Sanchez left Galaxy
officials red-faced by not making the trip. The threesome is
expected in town for Sunday's qualifying of the Libertadores Cup at
the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. opened the scoring in 25th minute, with rookie Seth George
running full stride to convert a Clint Mathis cross from just
inside the top of the penalty box. Mathis reacted quickly to a
service from midfield to beat Chivas defender Juan Pablo Alfaro to
set up the goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy increased its lead to 2-0 when Hendrickson got free
from three defenders, gathered the ball at the top of the box and
fired a shot past Chivas keeper Gustavo Sedano.
</P>
<P>
   The night's loudest response came in the 62nd minute, when the
scoreboard flashed the final in the championship game of the
Confederations Cup: Mexico 4, Brazil 3.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously spurred by the news, Chivas battled valiantly down the
stretch. The Mexicans cut the deficit in half in the 73rd minute,
with Paulo Cesar Chavez scoring over Galaxy keeper Kevin Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   An offside call against Chivas in the 82th minute nullified an
apparent goal. Jose Botello of the Galaxy closed out the scoring a
minute later, redirecting a nice cross from George on the left
flank.

 GOV. DAVIS HAS RAKED IN $6.1 MILLION SINCE JAN. 1  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Tapping traditional sources of GOP campaign money
such as agribusiness and utilities, Gov. Gray Davis pulled in a
record-setting $6.1 million in contributions since January 1 _ more
than $2.8 million in June alone, according to statement released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Davis received at least $360,700 from unions, the
Democratic governor garnered at least $328,000 from farming, dairy
and ranching interests and an additional $437,000 from utilities,
including $110,000 from Pacific Telesis.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Pete Wilson set the previous fund-raising record for
his first six months in 1991 with $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's press office referred calls to his political
operation, which did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, Davis told The Chronicle's editorial board
``everybody, when you are governor, wants to give you money.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say Davis' fund-raising zeal _ for which he has been
legendary throughout his political career _ creates an appearance
that hefty contributors may get special treatment from Davis'
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are going to be giving to an incumbent are
very-special interest groups that have issues pending,'' said Craig
Holman, project director of the Center for Governmental Studies, a
Los Angeles nonprofit organization that studies campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it isn't quid pro quo corruption, which it may be, it
certainly has the appearance of corruption,'' said Holman, who is
also a co-author of Proposition 208, an initiative which restricted
campaign contributions but was declared unconstitutional by a
federal judge last year.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also told The Chronicle's editorial board that he ``wanted
to be judged by the results that come from the regulatory and
legislative policies, not by the fact that somebody decided to have
a fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' first two nominees for the University of California Board
of Regents both contributed $100,000 to the governor this year.
</P>
<P>
   One is John Moores, chairman of the San Diego Padres baseball
club. The other is Judith Hopkinson, who heads Ameriquest Capital
Corp. in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' biggest individual contributor was Jerry Perenchio, the
billionaire owner of Univision _ the nation's largest Spanish
language television network. He gave $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 2 was Fox Group, owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch,
which gave $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   In previous interviews, Garry South, Davis' top political
adviser, said the governor does not go after industries for
contributions. Davis' fund-raising is ``broad based,'' South said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the spring, Davis set his sights on agriculture. Sources
said two of the governor's confidants _ Rep. Gary Condit, D-Ceres,
and Keith Brackpool, head of Cadiz Land Co. _ organized a Davis
fund-raiser for agriculture interests at the Sutter Club in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   On May 10, the Davis campaign committee received $5,000 from the
California Association of Wine Growers, $3,000 from the California
Citrus Mutual and $5,000 from the California Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In all, agricultural interests donated at least $328,000 to
Davis, including $20,000 from Brackpool's company.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Davis angered environmentalists by siding with
farmers and urban water districts in a long-standing court battle
over the distribution of California's water.
</P>
<P>
   Health care groups, including hospitals and HMOs, gave Davis at
least $109,000. The report does not include a fund-raiser sponsored
by HMOs in early July for Davis in Los Angeles. That event raised
at least another $110,000.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was criticized when, three days later, he called key state
legislators and asked them to slow down the progress of bills
increasing state regulation of health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   A small fraction of Davis' contributions were $500 or less. Most
came in chunks of $5,000 to $10,000, sometimes $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the contributions to Davis by industry:
</P>
<P>
   -- Oil _ $125,000. Occidental Petroleum gave $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gambling _ $125,000 including $75,000 from Hollywood Park
racetrack and $25,000 from the California Commerce Club, the
state's largest card club.
</P>
<P>
   -- Developers _ $226,000. Sacramento developer Angelo
Tsakopoulos gave Davis $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   -- Insurance Companies _ $136,000, including $75,000 from Zenith
Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   -- Timber Companies _ $46,500.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spent $34.8 million last year during his gubernatorial
campaign. Between the election and the new year, he had raised $3.1
million more.
</P>
<P>
   With less than $1 million in expenses, Davis is sitting on $8.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   He is up for re-election in 2002.

ORLANDO MAKES SUNS WAIT  
 HARDAWAY DEAL LIKELY TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Thinking they had a deal completed for Orlando's
Anfernee ``Penny'' Hardaway, the Suns were still standing alone at
the altar Wednesday evening while Magic officials hesitated to walk
down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   But a league source told ``The Arizona Republic'' that the deal
is likely to be consummated today.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Penny) has told us he wants to be here,'' Suns President
Jerry Colangelo said. ``We've finalized the contract, and now we're
waiting for Orlando to pull the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources told ``The Republic'' that the Suns believed the trigger
already had been pulled.
</P>
<P>
   The club had a commitment from Orlando General Manager John
Gabriel to make the deal, reportedly for Phoenix forwards Danny
Manning and Pat Garrity along with two first-round draft picks, if
the Suns could reach terms with Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway told Colangelo on Tuesday that he had decided to play
for the Suns, and Phoenix agreed to his contract terms _ seven
years for about $86 million, the maximum allowed for a player with
six years of experience in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Then the deal hit a snag.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic wouldn't complete the transaction as Coach Doc Rivers
apparently tried to derail the sign-and-trade arrangement either to
convince Hardaway to remain with Orlando or to sign for less money
and accept a different trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a deal until it's signed by us,'' Gabriel told
the ``Orlando Sentinel.'' ``We're not trying to undercut the Suns.
We just want to make sure everything has been discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make sure on a decision of this magnitude that we
have thoroughly discussed it and thought it through to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said the Suns were in contact Wednesday with Hardaway,
who assured the Suns that his position had not changed. Hardaway
told Colangelo again that he wants to play in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   With that, all the Suns could do was wait to find out whether
Gabriel would honor his commitment to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Manning's agent, Mark Bartelstein, said he expects the deal to
happen and Manning is ``OK either way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrity worked out Wednesday at America West Arena and said he
also expects a deal, although the Suns had not told him he would be
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has told me anything,'' he said. ``But everything I've
heard is that it's me, Danny and a couple of picks.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was speculation that the Magic might be asking the
Suns to sweeten the deal, sources indicated the Magic has known
what the Suns were willing to give _ and already had agreed to take
it.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel said Tuesday that it was the only deal left on the table
for the Magic, which must work a sign-and-trade, re-sign Hardaway
and keep him, or lose him via free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Before the June draft, the Magic sent the Suns a list of players
it would consider attractive in a trade. The Magic wanted Duke's
Corey Maggette, but the Suns drafted Nevada-Las Vegas' Shawn Marion
_ who wasn't on the Orlando list _ because no trade was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic later traded Horace Grant to Seattle in a deal that
included Maggette.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, meanwhile, held fast to their offer of Manning,
Garrity and draft picks _ despite continuing inaccurate reports
that forward Tom Gugliotta would be included.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were so insistent that Gugliotta would not be part of a
deal that General Manager Bryan Colangelo asked Gabriel to contact
Gugliotta's agent and assure him that Gugliotta was not being
discussed. Gabriel made that call.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway was a first-team All-NBA selection in 1995 and 1996 and
was voted by fans into the Eastern Conference starting lineup for
the 1995, '96, '97 and '98 All-Star Games.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hardaway reportedly clashed with former Orlando Coach
Chuck Daly, Rivers has lobbied to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to wind down what we know the landscape of the
league to be, what Penny's value is and what his intentions are,''
Gabriel told ``Florida Today.'' ``Those things are becoming much
clearer to us now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's challenging and difficult to get everything you want in a
deal. But I don't know really what else we can do. We're going back
now and re-examining the work that was done 10 times and asking
whether we missed anything. All we can do is our best. We've put in
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And all the Suns could do was wait. &QL;

 YOSEMITE KILLINGS CALLED HATE CRIMES  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Eureka woman who lost her daughter, granddaughter
and a family friend in a brutal Yosemite triple murder testified to
Congress Wednesday that the killings were a hate crime against
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else could they be?'' asked Carole Carrington, whose
daughter Carole Sund was killed in February, along with her
granddaughter Julie and Julie's visiting Argentine friend Silvina
Pelosso. ``A person who doesn't know the people at all, and murders
them only because they are women? It has to be that.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have said handyman Cary Stayner confessed to the
killings, along with the decapitation of 26-year-old Yosemite
naturalist Joie Armstrong in July, claiming he had fantasized about
killing women for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Carrington was called to testify at a House Judiciary Committee
hearing by ranking Democrat John Conyers of Michigan, who wants to
expand federal discrimination law to cover crimes motivated by
gender, sexual orientation and disability as hate crimes, along
with race, religion and national origin.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give federal authorities jurisdiction to
investigate and prosecute such crimes and to aid local law
enforcement. Although Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said most
hate crimes are investigated and prosecuted at the state level,
``in rare circumstances where state or local officials are unable
or unwilling to bring appropriate criminal charges ... the United
States must be able to bring federal civil rights charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said the Clinton administration strongly supports the
legislation. Holder said that all murders and assaults should be
taken seriously but that crimes motivated by hatred of certain
groups of people ``I consider, quite frankly, more serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said such attacks are ``not just on the individual
victim, but on the victim's community, and their impact is broader
because they send a message of hate.'' He said broader federal
jurisdiction to prosecute these crimes is essential.
</P>
<P>
   But several legal scholars called by the committee said labeling
certain crimes as motivated by hate punishes thought, in violation
of the First Amendment right to free speech. John Yoo, a professor
at the University of California at Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of
Law, said such legislation could be struck down by the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``All crimes are hate crimes,'' added Daniel Troy, a
constitutional lawyer at the conservative American Enterprise
Institute. Troy said the bill ``wrongly suggests that one person's
life is worth more than another's. ... If someone were to kill me
for being a yuppie swine or a ... Jew, I would be dead
regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Hurd, a professor of law and philosophy at the University
of Pennsylvania who described herself as a liberal Democrat, said
all rapes would probably have to be classified as hate crimes. Hurd
said the bill is an ``extremely worrisome'' attempt to ``legislate
virtue'' by ``political perfectionists who believe the power of the
state should be used to improve people's thoughts and beliefs.''
Hurd said modern criminal law has always prohibited acts, not
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Carrington flew from her home in Eureka the night before the
hearing, and she also appeared Wednesday on ``Good Morning
America,'' ``Today'' and CNN. She said that although the FBI was
called in to investigate the murders in her family in part because
Yosemite is federal property, she had met many families of crime
victims whose cases remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The hate crimes bill tops the agenda of the Human Rights
Campaign, a gay rights lobby. It died in the last Congress, but has
found stronger support this year (40 co-sponsors in the Senate and
182 in the House) after the beating death of openly gay Matthew
Shepard in Laramie, Wyo., and the murder of James Byrd, Jr., an
African American who was dragged to death behind a pickup truck in
Jasper County, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the bill passed the Senate on a voice vote as an
amendment to an appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois said
he was undecided on the legislation and called Wednesday's hearings
to explore the effect of existing hate-crime laws and the potential
for overlap with other criminal statutes, as well as potential
conflicts with the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   A committee spokesman said Hyde may hold more hearings but has
not yet decided whether to proceed with legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Carrington, the panel heard from Tony Orr, a gay
man who was beaten with his partner, Tim Beauchamp, in Tulsa,
Okla., while getting money at an automated teller machine. Orr
testified that three young men approached the pair, referred to
them with a crude epithet and then proceeded to beat them severely,
only stopping when passers-by called police from a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Orr said the attackers told police they were ``only rolling a
couple of fags'' and that the local district attorney accepted a
plea bargain for 40 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Reuben Greenberg, an African American who worked for the San
Francisco city government and now is chief of police in Charleston,
S.C., said that during the civil rights movement in the 1960s,
``federal legislation was seen as our only hope,'' but now local
law enforcement is adequate to prosecute such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in both the Byrd and Shepard cases, local and state
authorities ``acted quickly and decisively to arrest, prosecute and
convict those local persons who were responsible. ... There was no
delay, no hesitation and no reluctance,'' adding that Wyoming has
no hate crimes laws.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 21 states have hate crimes laws covering sexual
orientation and disability as well as race, while 22 cover gender,
and the rest states have no hate crime laws.

 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Absolutely no animals were harmed in the
production of this column. Unless you count the fly that drowned in
my coffee. Wish I'd noticed sooner.
<P>
   CONGRATULATIONS to all of us for surviving July, at least those
of us who didn't die trying. One month down, two to go.
Nostradamus, Daryl Glen reminds us, prophesied that ``in either
July, August or September of 1999 there will appear in the sky a
Great King of Terror.''
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion: When the King appears, let's throw him a curve.
Everyone look up and laugh like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   IF MR. TERROR KING does appear, won't the people who have been
in a panic over the Y2K crisis feel like a bunch of ninnies?
</P>

   CRIME RIPPLE: From the Marin Independent Journal police log,

   TRIHACK the well-read cabbie says: ``Thanks to the Macy's ads in

   So the Macy's ads have good cartoons and stories?
</P>
<P>
   NOT A BAD RUMOR, just an outdated one: Reported here that John

   THE VULTURES of the tabloids, not to be confused with we
vultures of the legit media, are circling the Bay, sniffing out the
recent last-minute cancellation of a big-time diva's East Bay

``exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   Like I've been trying to explain to my boss: Calling in sick
repeatedly can be very exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   AND THEY GET the bases dry-cleaned: Ray Birch wasn't surprised
to see, at a baseball game at Tamalpais High in Mill Valley, the
dirt-smoother screen being pulled around the infield by a BMW.
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL ANGLE: ``The Haunting,'' at a theater near you, is based
on ``The Haunting of Hill House,'' by the late Shirley Jackson
(died '65), who was born and raised in Burlingame, Calif., and
placed many of her spooky books and stories on the Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   MIXED REVIEWS for that film. It sux, says a Chronicle critic.

   THOSE UCLA football players caught using bogus

AN ANEMIC FOOD STAMP PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government says food stamps are ``the first line of defense
against hunger.'' Unfortunately, years of bureaucratic delay are
punching holes in that defense, according to a report from the
General Accounting Office. The US Department of Agriculture, which
runs the food stamp program, must fix the holes.
</P>
<P>
   The report describes a sharp drop in food stamp use _ a 27
percent decline in participation over the past 3 1/2 years. The
main reason for the drop is a strong economy; other factors are
welfare reform and tighter food eligibility rules.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also voices concern that state efforts to reduce
welfare caseloads ``may have diminished eligible children's
participation'' in the food stamp program. The statistics concur.
The number of children helped by food stamps has dropped more
sharply than the number of children living in poverty. This
suggests that the program isn't meeting the need. Proof turned up
in New York City and Milwaukee, both of which have violated federal
law with unduly strict food stamp policies, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The larger problem is that states are in a federal policy
vacuum. Three years ago the federal welfare reform law changed the
rules on food stamps, giving states more leeway in setting up
procedures. But the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service still hasn't
published the rules. The department attributes the delay to a
reorganization. In addition, required yearly examinations on how
states are running their food stamp programs do not always occur
because of a lack of resources.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare is no longer an entitlement program, but food stamps
are. And they are essential to low-income families as well as to
welfare recipients who are expected to find and keep jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Watkins, The USDA's undersecretary of food, nutrition,
and consumer services, is expected to testify in a congressional
hearing. The best thing she could do is announce a major overhaul
that will cut through the bureaucratic barbed wire that keeps
eligible citizens from getting this crucial aid.

HALLE BERRY'S ROAD TO `DOROTHY DANDRIDGE'

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Halle Berry in
``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    They are from different generations _ indeed, from different
worlds _ but Halle Berry says she has no difficulty identifying
with the trials and tribulations of the late star Dorothy
Dandridge.
 &HT;    Both actresses have the faces of angels, and both embody a
smoldering sexiness that captivated Hollywood in their respective
eras.
 &HT;    Dandridge made film history in 1954, when her performance in
``Carmen Jones'' led her to become the first black ever nominated
for an Oscar as Best Actress. Her career soon went downhill,
however, and in 1965 she died at 42 from an overdose of
antidepressant pills.
 &HT;    Dandridge was beautiful and talented, but because she was black
she never had a chance to compete with the top Hollywood leading
ladies of her day. Berry has enjoyed a promising start _ including
memorable roles in ``Jungle Fever'' (l991), ``Losing Isaiah''
(l995) and ``Bulworth'' (l998), as well as the television
miniseries ``Alex Haley's Queen'' (l993) and the cable movie
``Solomon and Sheba'' (l995) _ and is hoping that she may be able
to make the leap that Dandridge was denied.
 &HT;    Times have changed, she says, but not as much as you might
think. Pencil-slim in a blue halter top with matching slacks and
sandals, the actress sits in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Pasadena,
Calif. She's talking about her own performance in ``Introducing
Dorothy Dandridge,'' which airs on HBO on Aug. 2l, but she's
thinking about Dandridge.
 &HT;    ``I feel we had a lot in common,'' she says. ``There was
something that Dorothy and I uniquely shared, and that was being in
Hollywood, wanting to be a leading lady and feeling like a leading
lady _ but being in an industry that has no place for us.''
 &HT;    Berry isn't so unrealistic as to compare end-of-millennium
America to the segregated world of the 1940s and 1950s. But she
says that Hollywood still has miles to go before she'll feel she's
playing on a level field.
 &HT;    ``Of course I realize how far we've come,'' she says. ``I can
walk into any club on any day of the week, speak to anybody I want
to and walk out the front door. But I still face barriers ... I
still don't feel like there's a space for a leading lady in
Hollywood who's black.''
 &HT;    Directed by Martha Coolidge, the movie co-stars Klaus Maria
Brandauer as director Otto Preminger, Dandridge's one-time lover,
and Brent Spiner _ best known from television's ``Star Trek: The
Next Generation'' _ as Earl Mills, the devoted manager who loved
her until the end.
 &HT;    It does not make excuses for Dandridge's often-foolish choices,
but it attempts to understand why, given the circumstances of her
life, the end was almost inevitable.
 &HT;    Sexually assaulted as a teen-ager by her mother's often-violent
female lover, Dandridge was uncomfortable with intimacy for the
rest of her life. Both of her marriages _ to dancer Harold Nicholas
of the famous Nicholas Brothers, and then to a minor-league con man
who left her bankrupt _ failed, and her only child was a retarded
daughter.
 &HT;    Her death was never officially ruled a suicide, but Berry
believes the actress killed herself.
 &HT;    ``I'm not saying I believe the night she died she took the pills
and said, `OK, I'm doing to lie down on the floor and die right
now,''' she says. ``I think it was a slow process. She was taking
the pills and mixing the alcohol and slowly killing herself for
years before she died.
 &HT;    ``At 42 she was back at the bottom of the heap,'' she says.
``When she was young and fresh and at her prime at 32, she was at
the top _ and still she was denied the brass ring. I think she was
tired and didn't want to fight that fight to get back on top
again.''
 &HT;    Born in Cleveland _ as Dandridge also was _ Berry grew up in
Ohio with a white, British mother who, she says, kept her on the
straight and narrow after her black father, Jerome Berry, deserted
the family when she was only 4 years old.
 &HT;    Berry never had to endure the everyday humiliations of
segregation _ even as a headliner, Dandridge often had to go
onstage via the service kitchen and was sometimes denied access to
bathrooms.
 &HT;    But growing up biracial wasn't easy. She remembers being called
``Zebra'' and ``Oreo,'' especially after her mother moved the
family to a predominantly white suburb.
 &HT;    It helped her understand Dorothy Dandridge, she says.
 &HT;    ``When I was 18 I first saw `Carmen Jones,''' she recalls. ``I
had no idea who she was. But I was moved and inspired by her _ I'd
never seen a black lady who was so beautiful and charismatic. I
didn't find out at that time that she was from Cleveland, too.''
 &HT;    As a young actress benefiting from Hollywood's improved racial
climate, Berry says she feels an obligation to those who went
before, particularly Dandridge, to get their story told. That sense
of obligation sustained her through the six years it took to get
the film made.
 &HT;    ``What really inspired me was the fact that Dorothy had been so
forgotten,'' she says, ``and that her contribution was so great and
so meaningful, not only to me but to an entire community of people.
 &HT;    ``I'm still almost in the exact same position she was, trying to
carve out that niche,'' Berry says. ``But because she lived and
ultimately died, I'm able to tell her story. And I have a chance to
carve my own big niche.''
 &HT;    Berry, who is also the film's executive producer, had to fight
to get the rights to Dandridge's story. Whitney Houston and Janet
Jackson both wanted to portray Dandridge, and for a while they
seemed to have the inside track.
 &HT;    ``How did I get it?'' Berry asks. ``I'm still asking myself that
question. I was relentless in my efforts. The other ladies are also
singing superstars, so they had other careers that demanded much of
their attention.''
 &HT;    To prepare for the role, Berry watched hours of tapes of
Dandridge and rehearsed lip-syncing to the voice of Wendy Williams,
who sings Dandridge's music. She also spent four months studying
dance with the film's choreographer, Kim Blank, in an effort to
duplicate Dandridge's sexy moves.
 &HT;    The biggest problem with the role, she says, is that it's raised
her expectations unrealistically high.
 &HT;    ``Now that I've done this amazing role of a lifetime,'' she
says, ``I have not been able to find a project that can even
compare to the role that I've just played.''
 &HT;    That would presumably include her next role, as the weather
goddess Storm in the big-screen movie adaptation of the hit comic
book ``The X-Men.''
 &HT;    Storm may be no Dorothy Dandridge, Berry says, but she takes
heart from the fact that she was able to play Dandridge at all.
 &HT;    ``In terms of black women in the entertainment industry,'' she
says, ``we've come a long way, because in l999 I had the power to
dare to dream a dream of producing a movie for myself about a woman
that I adored. Somehow I managed to make that happen.
 &HT;    ``Dorothy would never have been able to produce a movie back in
l953,'' she adds. ``It was a racist and sexist industry. But I do
think it's changing.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Flighty lawsuits challenge boundaries of tort
 &HT;    (For release Aug. 8, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There seems to be no end to creative lawsuits, giving support to
consumer advocate Ralph Nader's recurring contention that a museum
be built to acclaim our wackiest litigations.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, two cases arose on either side of the continent
that, if they reach the courtroom, likely will rival the case of
the New Mexico woman who spilled hot coffee in her lap at the
McDonald's drive-through.
</P>
<P>
   (The jury awarded the 81-year-old woman $2.9 million in punitive
and compensatory damages for a scalded crotch. Afterward, the judge
reduced the award to closer to a half-million dollars, which still
can buy a lot of lukewarm hamburgers and coffee down at the Golden
Arches.)
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Ana Margarita Martinez of Miami. She has filed a
personal injury claim against the entire island of Cuba. She's
claiming rape.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, she found out too late, was a double-agent, with
his prime allegiance to Fidel Castro's regime. He fled Miami for
Havana in 1996, deserting his wife, and Martinez says she was an
unwitting cover for him. She claims no knowledge of her husband's
covert activity.
</P>
<P>
   What she does have knowledge of, however, is that she and her
husband maintained a normal sexual relationship and that, in fact,
he was working for Castro and not intending to stay with her or in
this country. Therefore, she maintains, she actually was being
raped each time they had sex _ and it was the Cuban government that
was raping her.
</P>
<P>
   OK, we'll come back to that later.
</P>
<P>
   Now, out of Los Angeles, a man has filed a civil rights lawsuit
against the L.A. police department and city government, accusing
police officers of assault, battery and wrongful death in a case in
which his mother was shot to death by one of the officers.
</P>
<P>
   What intrigues me is that Margaret Mitchell, 54, was a homeless
woman who wandered the streets of Los Angeles pushing a shopping
cart. The police contend she threatened one of them with a
screwdriver, which resulted in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, there is a good case against the police. A 54-year-old
woman with a screwdriver shouldn't rate a bullet in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   But this son, the one who's suing; what do we know about him?
Well, we know that he allowed his mother to be homeless. We also
are told that the woman was mentally ill _ and, apparently, her son
did not provide help for that either.
</P>
<P>
   Why should this guy get rich over her death? If anything, I
think someone ought to sue him, maybe arrest him _ for neglecting
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cuba-raped-me lawsuit will get quite an airing in
Miami, which is heavy into Cubans. A precedent was set in 1996 when
families of four private-plane pilots shot down and killed by
Castro's MiGs in the Straits of Florida were awarded more than
$187.6 million in damages from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Fidel did not pull out his checkbook. Instead, the
victors are trying to pry loose the money from frozen Cuban assets
in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The two most recent cases could wind up as key exhibits in
Nader's fantasized museum of unconventional tort. As this first
surfaced a year ago, and I have heard nothing of it since, I would
assume that Ralph hasn't yet the funding for it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he could sue somebody for something.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The red flag of racism
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a notion being hustled around naively _ or is it slyly?
_ that we've become a colorblind nation and that after 350 years of
severe racial oppression and 30 of indifferent relief, the books
are squared and broad efforts at racial catch-up such as
affirmative action abuse the downtrodden white folk.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this scenario is that reality keeps rudely
intruding. It is easy enough to pass off the continuing racist
murders _ de facto lynchings _ as random acts by the aberrant. But
how do you explain away the whole state of South Carolina?
</P>
<P>
   Fed up that the state's politicians can't summon the small
gumption to stop flying the Confederate battle flag over the
Capitol, the state's NAACP and the National Council of Negro Women
want African Americans to shun South Carolina's vacation sites, and
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and even the staid
Urban League have canceled conventions there.
</P>
<P>
   This has moved the governor only to promise he will poll state
legislators on the issue _ legislators who savaged the previous
governor for proposing to take down the flag. Expect nothing better
than the same rebel yells from that quarter again.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one state senator, the deliciously named Arthur Ravenel
_ ``Gone With the Wind'' isn't gone! _ has said of a black tourist
boycott, in effect, good riddance. Ah, Southern hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina can't just be shrugged off as eccentric. Alabama
struck the Confederate ensign from its capitol in 1993 only because
a state judge ruled its display there illegal. Mississippi and
Georgia stick by state flags that incorporate the design.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgent and noisome Sons of Confederate Veterans recently
hoisted a huge Georgia flag near I-75, you may be sure only because
of that incorporation. One rhapsodized, ``With everyone who passes
by here every day, it should make everyone feel really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. (To boot, Georgia recently named a bridge on I-75 for
the state's last race-baiting governor, Lester Maddox, helping the
sons-of to make that interstate a racist sluice for traffic.)
</P>
<P>
   All of this is not said to pick on the South. It uniquely
suffers from having a handy and universally recognized symbol with
which literally to wave its racial irreconciliation and defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Those same attitudes occur in other regions, if less overtly
often even more destructively. One way: predatory attacks in the
courts on racial progress by tax-exempt law firms richly funded by
the sugar daddy families and foundations of the hard right.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, we've made huge racial progress in the last
generation. The gaps between black and white income, education and
health, and in most other social indices, have narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   But don't make the contrary mistake either. The gaps remain and
there are no few folks among us who, in ways both theatrical and
meanly real, are busy about the business of leaving to African
Americans alone the task of closing them.
</P>
<P>
   A colorblind nation wouldn't even think of flying the
Confederate battle flag, in fact or in mind.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: JUMPING INTO THE FLIMSY INTERNET
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial queues for release
Sunday, Aug. 8.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wall Street's wedded bliss with the Internet now
seems in need of a marriage counselor. When the market capital of
an online firm that sells discounted airline tickets exceeds the
combined stock value of several major airlines, there well may be a
reason to seek a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Internet's glamour has faded among many
investors just as cheaper computers and powerful software have made
the Internet at long last into a true mass medium.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in years to come, the threat to the continued rapid
growth of the Internet will not be a lack of investment capital,
but rather a glut of computer code crackers, scam artists, thieves,
foreign spy rings and other forms of low life that appear to thrive
in cyberspace. High technology hasn't altered the human condition.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who have been paying our bills on line for years,
with the aid of virtual banks, know how nice it is to remotely
access current reports on the status of our accounts, without ever
writing checks or licking stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group, an Internet research company, estimates that
less than 5 percent of U.S. households now pay their bills on line.
In another decade, however, the firm predicts that this figure will
climb to 70 percent _ roughly following the trajectory that has
seen VCRs become standard items in most American homes.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with any such projection is that computer networks
aren't safe. The bigger they get, the greater the risk. The only
sure way to protect yourself on the Internet, a vast network of
networks, is to pull the plug. Even then, it's best to set up shop
in a double-walled, lead-lined chamber, where your keystrokes can't
be read by outside snooping devices.
</P>
<P>
   Editors love to play up stories revealing hardware or software
security holes that let hidden intruders gain access to the
computers of millions of customers, in order to steal or destroy
their data or shut down their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed industry executives duly come clean. They announce
that programs to patch the flaws are in the works. Things then
simmer down for a while until, inevitably, the same sad cycle
repeats itself.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the White House has cooked up a its own ``patch,''
which calls for sensors to detect intrusions into government
computers and report suspicious activity to the FBI. Critics charge
that an exaggerated threat of terrorism is being manipulated to
erode civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, however, miss the point. By their nature, all
networks can be hacked and passwords broken. The same federal
government that frets about internal intrusions has spent billions
of dollars to penetrate external targets.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do?
</P>
<P>
   First, put a halt to the culture of admiration among some
computer gurus for bold cyber-safecrackers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, learn to ``hide in the open'' by keeping those elements
of your life that you truly need to keep private where no network
can ever find them.
</P>
<P>
   Third, read newspapers, magazines and books. They remain immune
one-way mirrors into an increasingly networked world.

   TRAVEL-AUSTRALIA (Sydney, Australia) _ In almost every survey,
international travelers name Sydney their favorite destination. And
certainly its scenic beauty, location and friendliness are prime

   EDIBLE-FLOWERS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Nasturtiums, geraniums, day
lilies, sunflowers, Johnny-jump-ups and roses are all edible,

   FILM-RUSSO-PROFILE (Undated) _ When you need an actress to play

 &HT;    AGE OF ROBOTS MAY FINALLY BE READY TO DAWN
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Aug. 8.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Weren't we supposed to have robots following us
around by now, protecting us with their metallic arms and helping
with the housework?
</P>
<P>
   Science-fiction writers have fueled our robot fantasies for
decades, building up hopes for a mechanical man capable of yelling
``Danger! Danger!'' in the face of trouble, just like the automaton
in the 1960s TV series ``Lost in Space.''
</P>
<P>
   While all sorts of new technologies have rushed at us in recent
years, the robot with retractable arms has yet to appear in our
daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   But early in the next century, that may change. Robot experts
predict that the combination of cheaper microprocessors and more
expensive workers will spur the development of smart robots to
replace large numbers of workers, even those who perform the most
intimate tasks in workplaces from hospitals to brothels.
</P>
<P>
   The switch from human to mechanical labor began in the 1950s,
when primitive robots first began turning up in factories. Today,
the typical mechanical ``worker'' has a fixed arm that can be
programmed to do repetitive tasks. In auto assembly plants, for
example, tireless steel arms reach out to paint auto bodies or weld
parts.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a growing number of robots have been stepping
off of their fixed bases and going out to do hazardous jobs. Bomb
squads now routinely use robots to help disarm explosives. Workers
removing asbestos from pipes in the Pentagon are using robots to
help strip away the cancer-causing coating. Robots figure
prominently in efforts to explore the ocean floor, the surface of
Mars and the crumbling Chernobyl nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, workers are glad to have robots help with
such dangerous jobs. But employers are becoming more interested in
getting robots to do service work that is merely unappealing. For
example, in this booming economy, it's tough to find people willing
to scrub a factory floor at 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Mr. Robo. In a few years, large numbers of employers may
be using robots to wash and wax floors, vacuum carpets and mow
lawns.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent convention of the World Future Society, a non-profit
organization whose members ponder the future, a session on robots
spurred interesting speculation on where the metal androids might
turn up in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the gathering here, Joanne Pransky, a marketing
representative for Sankyo Robotics, tossed out predictions based on
robots now being developed:
</P>
<P>
   _ As sensors become more powerful, robots dedicated to cleaning
will become more versatile and commonplace. For example, vacuuming
robots will be able to zigzag across rooms without hitting
furniture or running over toes.
</P>
<P>
   _ In hospitals and nursing homes, robots will zoom down the
hallways, delivering prescriptions and charts to patients.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Companion robots'' may help elderly people live longer in
their own homes. By holding out a helping arm, the robot might help
an aged person get out of bed and walk over to the toilet. It could
be programmed to clean the floors, hand out pills and call 911 if
something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents might use a robotic day-care worker. With a camera
built into its head, the robot could follow around a child and
provide updates on play activities and weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sexual activity robots could become popular with the very _
very _ lonely.
</P>
<P>
   While the thought of having robots do our dirty work sounds
great, an increasingly robotic workforce could have a negative
impact on society. If robots are busy cleaning our buildings and
watching our children, what will happen to the millions people who
do those jobs today? Will welfare reform falter if low-end jobs
disappear?
</P>
<P>
   Even white-collar workers should not feel safe from the threat
of robots. As robots get smarter and more versatile, they may
become better at preparing meals than the best chefs and at flying
planes than the best pilots. And perhaps even better at writing
than the best journalists.
</P>
<P>
   As they say: ``Danger! Danger!''

 &HT;    MEXICO CITY URGES RESIDENTS TO SCOOP DOG POOP, A HEALTH THREAT
 &HT;    With Photos.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Whenever a scruffy vagabond known as ``Bones''
relieves himself in a public park here, he's not engaged in an
isolated act.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 million other stray dogs that roam this vast
metropolis have no choice but to use the city's streets and squares
as their toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the pack in this unfortunate slice of urban life are as
many as 2 million additional dogs lucky enough to have homes, but
whose masters habitually neglect to clean up their pets' solid
waste.
</P>
<P>
   The result is more than 350 tons of fecal matter deposited in
public areas here each day(CQ). It's a phenomenon that's not only
an assault on the eyes and feet, but a significant threat to
respiratory health, according to Mexico City health officials.
</P>
<P>
   Unchecked dog feces contributes to Mexico City's notoriously bad
air, along with automobile emissions, officials say. A transmitter
of bacteria and parasites, particles of dried dog waste also
contaminate food served in the city's ubiquitous outside taco
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dries and then it flies into the air. Then I breath it and
you breath it,'' said an exasperated Laura Elena Herrejon,
president of the Pro-Neighbors Movement, a Mexico City residents'
group working with city officials to clean up dog excrement.
</P>
<P>
   For Herrejon, reducing dog waste is a matter of political will.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling the long-festering problem of street dogs is very
tough, she said. But laws exist requiring pet owners' to clean up
pet crud. They just haven't been enforced -- until now.
</P>
<P>
   In response to public outcry, officials in this capital city's
biggest and busiest district-- the Cuauhtemoc Borough -- have
initiated a campaign to clean the parks and raise pet owners'
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Last year special maintenance teams were created to scoop poop
in prominent public areas, while officials began sending out fliers
warning residents of the health risks of ``fecalism,'' or
``fecalismo,'' as officials call the abundance of dog doo in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   By its own count, during one 85-day period last year the
district picked up 13 1/2 tons of excrement left by pets and
strays.
</P>
<P>
   In June the district teamed up with Pro-Neighbors Movement and
started a pilot program to impose penalties on negligent pet
owners.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro-Neighbors Movement provides plastic bags and officials
make sure that containers to throw the bags are available in a park
that's been chosen as the site of the pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   Police and volunteers are dispatched periodically to the Santa
Maria de la Ribera Park to remind pet owners of their obligations.
Officers have the power to give violators a ticket requiring them
to appear before a judge.
</P>
<P>
   A banner in the park warns: ``Neighbor! As of June 16 you could
be fined up to 344 pesos and 50 cents ($35) or jailed for between
six and 12 hours if you fail to pick up your pets' feces. We ask
that you cooperate in this action for the good and the health of
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Wire baskets are attached to a fence and signs instruct pet
owners on how to dispose of droppings and explain laws requiring
the clean up.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been cited yet for violating the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to take someone before a judge to make an example,''
said Jose Carner, the district's chief of urban services.
</P>
<P>
   But officials would be happy, he said, if people comply with the
law because they understand their health is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc, Carner added, is a massive district chock full of
Mexico City's oldest buildings, monuments and squares, including
the city's historic downtown area. More than 600,000 people live in
the district and between 4 million and 4.5 million people work,
shop, eat or simply visit there every day.
</P>
<P>
   The excrement-extermination program fits into the district's
plans to reclaim the borough's decaying public areas, Carner said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the result of a push for greater ``civic involvement''
in government, he said, a cornerstone of the 1997 election campaign
of Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas -- the city's first
democratically elected mayor.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other district is following Cuauhtemoc's example
and has signed an agreement with the Pro-Neighbors Movement to also
start cracking down on dog waste, said Herrejon.
</P>
<P>
   At the Santa Maria de la Ribera Park, people on an early morning
stroll with pets said they're in full support of reducing errant
dog feces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always pick up the poo poo. I can't pick up the pee pee, of
course,'' said an elderly woman walking her Bassett hound.
</P>
<P>
   Fabiola Perez, mistress of two dogs, pulled out a plastic bag
from her pocket as evidence that she was cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good program,'' she said. ``We've become way to used to
just letting our dogs run around and letting them do their thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said some pet owners continue to ignore the regulations
and scoff at police -- probably because they don't respect them,
and associate police with corruption and bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only real vigilance,'' she said, ``is going to be between
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond pets, Perez said, the city and federal health officials
need to start better managing the capital's street dogs.
Periodically, dogs are rounded up and vaccinated or even
sterilized, but they're often released back on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Two such dogs live in Santa Maria de la Ribera Park. Perez and
other residents offer the animals affection -- they say they are
gentle -- and have named them Bones and Buford. On a recent
morning, one young man even was walking Bones with a rope tied
around the dog's neck.
</P>
<P>
   The strays, which appear to have been pets at one time, eat
scraps residents give them or hang around restaurants. But they
sleep, play -- and defecate -- in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Street dogs are ``a delicate subject,'' according to Carner.
</P>
<P>
   People often get upset when officials try to round the dogs up
because they fear they will be killed. Yet few people are willing
to give the animals a home. And it's common for people in Mexico to
dump pets they can no longer manage on the street to let them fend
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they killed all the strays in Mexico City, the next
day there would be more back on the streets,'' Perez said, petting
Bones and Buford, who looked at her lovingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lack of culture when it comes to taking care
of dogs,'' Perez said.

 &HT;    With RUSSIA-CRISIS-$ADV08; RUSSIA-ECONOMY-$ADV08.

crash.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ After an economic boom in 1996 and 1997, Russia fell on
hard times last summer. Its stock market collapsed, the ruble
declined in value, many banks closed and foreign investment dried
up. The sharp economic downturn caps a decade since the fall of the
Soviet Union that has seen Russia's standard of living decline.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some aspects of Russia's life today:
</P>
<P>
   MORE POOR: The number of Russians living in poverty has
increased from 33 million last year to 55 million today, according
to official statistics released in July. Nearly four of every 10
Russians live below the official subsistence level, defined as an
income below 829 rubles a month, the equivalent of about US$34.
</P>
<P>
   LESS MONEY: The average monthly wage is 1,225 rubles, or about
US$51. Before the Aug. 17 crash, the average wage was the
equivalent of about US$200. Millions of workers go months or even
years without getting paid at all. The average pension is 403
rubles -- U$17 -- a month.
</P>
<P>
   MORE WORK: With the price of imported goods from the West out of
reach of most Russians, many sectors in Russian industry are
reporting an upturn, producing affordable, Russian-made consumer
goods. Industrial output is expected to rise 1.5 percent in 1999,
but still not rebounding from the loss in 1998 of 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   LESS TRADE: Imports fell 46 percent in the first six months of
1999, while exports dropped 11 percent compared to the same period
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   MORE TAX COLLECTIONS: In the first six months of this year,
Russia's tax police nabbed 6,000 tax cheats and added $200 million
to the government treasury, almost totaling the number for all of
1998. But the chief of the tax police, Vlacheslav Soltaganov, said
the figure ``is in my opinion a drop in the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   LESS COMPETITIVE: In an annual survey of business
competitiveness in 59 countries released last month by the
Swiss-based World Economic Forum, Russia finished dead last, ranked
below countries such as Bolivia (ranked 55) and Zimbabwe (57).
</P>
<P>
   MORE CRIME: Russia's murder rate is one of the world's highest,
triple that of the United States and seven times higher than in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   FEWER PEOPLE: Russia's population stands at 146 million,
dropping by 401,000 people last year, and about 2 million over the
past seven years. Alcoholism and the decline in health care have
contributed to a rising death rate and people are having fewer
children. Life expectancy is now estimated at 60.8 years for men,
up considerably from a low of 57.6 years in 1994, but still low for
an industrial nation.
</P>
<P>
   PESSIMISM ABOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   In May of this year, and last September, the Public Opinion
Foundation polled 1,500 Russians assessing their attitudes about
life and the economy. Here's what it found:
</P>
<P>
   ....................................................................
...........................September 1998..............May 1999
</P>
<P>
   Those that believe the worst is 
over?..............................2%...............................

</P>
<P>
   Those that believe the worst is 
now?.............................26%................................

   Those that believe the worst yet to
come?..................60%..................................53%
</P>
<P>
   Those that have no 
opinion...................................................12%.......
.............................9%
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Poll results have a accuracy of plus or minus 4 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ How's this for spin? Russian officials recently
delivered the good news that the country's economy will not expand
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the times, the government issued the promising
forecast that the economy would remain flat in 1999, compared to
earlier estimates that predicted the downward spiral that commenced
last summer would continue.
</P>
<P>
   One year into its deepest economic crisis since the Soviet Union
collapsed, Russia's outlook is assessed not so much by what's going
right, as by the horrible things that could have -- but haven't --
gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation is down. Industrial production is up. The value of the
ruble has remained relatively steady. To call it the start of an
economic recovery is premature; but neither is Russia the unbridled
disaster some thought it would be by this time.
</P>
<P>
   On August 17, 1998, the value of Russia's national currency
plummeted as the country of 146 million slid headlong into an
economic abyss -- and the world held its collective breath and
watched to see how the globe's second-largest nuclear power coped.
</P>
<P>
   Russians did not riot. With stoic resignation to their plight,
they made do. Though Russia today is a considerably poorer place
than it was last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Russians living in poverty has increased from 33
million to 55 million, according to official statistics released in
July. Today, nearly four of every 10 Russians live below the
official subsistence level, defined as an income below 829 rubles a
month, the equivalent of about US$34.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can we do? `` asked Sergei Kastanov, an out-of-work
Moscow laborer who collects empty bottles and offers rides in his
dilapidated compact car to earn a meager living. ``We're cursed
with bad leaders, bad factories and bad fate.''
</P>
<P>
   The predictions were dire. In the weeks after the ruble crash,
major banks closed and hundreds of thousands of workers lost their
savings and their jobs. Food shortages were reported, including one
Arctic town where residents were said to be killing and cooking
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   As winter set in, some areas of Russia were without heat. Even
an official United Nations report speculated that the cold and
scarcity of food could incite social unrest. After all, an economic
crash in Indonesia earlier in 1998 provoked rioting in the streets
and the fall of the government in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, the sickly President Boris Yeltsin seemed out of
touch, changing his prime ministers with nearly the same frequency
as his hospital visits. Four overhauls in the government were
ordered in the 14 months between March 1998 and May of this year,
when current Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin was appointed.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia has managed to confound the Western experts who last
fall were predicting calamity. Accustomed to coping with Soviet-era
scarcities and previous economic crises since communism fell in
1991, Russians hardly protested when their currency dropped
fourfold, from 6 rubles to the dollar to the current rate of 24
rubles to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But if the worst predictions have not come true, neither has
real progress.
</P>
<P>
   Russian government and businesses are still plagued by
corruption and inefficiency. Wealth remains in the hands of the
relative few. The stock market is edging up, but nowhere near its
boom levels of two years ago. Foreign investors fled last summer
and for the most part have stayed away. Tax collections are up, but
far from levels needed to fulfill the state's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin continues to remain largely secluded, leaving the
country's affairs to be run by a close circle of insiders. No one
expects real improvement until Russia struggles through its
election season and the post-Yeltsin era takes shape. Parliamentary
elections are scheduled for December and Russia is set to elect a
new president next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stuck somewhere between feudalism and capitalism,''
laments Olga Pushkina, a financial consultant whose company seeks
to turn around failing Russian firms.
</P>
<P>
   The larger, looming unknown element now is not economics, but
politics: Will the elections for parliament and president be fair?
Who will prevail -- market reformers, old-style communists or
something in between? And what of the fate of Russia's experiment
with democracy?
</P>
<P>
   ``We approach the elections in a state when nothing is known for
sure. Absolute uncertainty,'' said Yevgeny Yasin, a former
economics minister. ``What will happen after the elections? Nobody
knows.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Russians are getting by as best they can. In some
instances, the ruble collapse worked to Russia's benefit,
invigorating domestic industries that can produce goods cheaper
than foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
   At the Spirovski bottle factory, near Tver, production has
tripled as Russian vodka-makers have turned from importing more
expensive glass bottles from European suppliers to the factory's
cheaper bottles. Likewise, the Russian carmaker Autovaz has this
year hit a five-year high on its production lines.
</P>
<P>
   Such sporadic good news was bolstered further in July when two
of the world's financial institutions gave Moscow some breathing
room.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund agreed in July to resume lending
to Russia with a $4.5 billion assistance package to be delivered
over the next 18 months. And foreign debtors of the so-called Paris
Club in last week(CQ) eased the payment schedule on $8.1 billion of
arrears dating back to Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet billions more dollars in debt has piled up in the years
since 1991. (The Soviet-era debt deal settled in Paris represents
only about half of Russia's' external debt.). It is a crushing
burden that unless deferred or forgiven threatens to consume
Russia's entire government budget, currently at $25 billion in
1999. ``Any economic growth in the next 10 years is absolutely out
of the question,'' Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Zadornov warned
recently, referring to the debt problem.
</P>
<P>
   And the upbeat anecdotes and financial tidings cannot mask the
fact that Russians are vastly poorer today, and largely soured on
Western-style economic reforms that they equate with economic
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard of living for Russian citizens has noticeably
dropped and is currently only 60 percent of 1997 levels. A new
economic decline has taken place in Russia,'' said Vladimir
Kuzmichev, who writes about economics for the daily Nezavisimaya
Gazeta.
</P>
<P>
   They survive largely by taking advantage of Soviet-era subsidies
that keeps the cost of housing and health care low. They also grow
their own food on small plots of land in the country. Russians also
operate in an underground economy based on cash -- mainly U.S.
dollars -- not recorded by government statisticians.
</P>
<P>
   The news is not all bad. Russia continues to develop an
entrepreneurial class of younger people accustomed to their
post-Soviet freedoms and commercial opportunities. According to
polls, few Russians are satisfied with the messy transition from
communism to Russia's current system of half-done capitalism. But
the majority does not want to go back to the USSR, either.
</P>
<P>
   Yevgeny Primakov, the former foreign minister who led the
government from last September until this May, gave Russia ``no
progress and no steps back,'' according to Yasin.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's cautious approach seemed to be the correct one for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Russia could not return to drastic Soviet-era economics --
printing rubles and nationalizing industries -- without alienating
the IMF and donor countries like the United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But with its hamstrung economy and political gridlock
(communists and nationalists control the opposition parliament),
neither could it dig itself out of its hole and make gains toward
real democratic and market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The worst predictions have not come true. But neither have the
greatest hopes. Russia reckons the good news is somewhere in
between, where things may be uncertain, but stable for now.

   Success was measured by the steady volume of raw steel rolling
from its production lines. The fallout from the open blast furnaces
turned the snow black throughout this city of 430,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the snow is white,'' but times are hard, complains Yelena
Sherbakova, a retired mill worker struggling to live on a monthly
pension of just $20. ``It is difficult for everybody. Prices are
very high. You can see signs of improvement, but our lives are
still horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The output from Magnitogorsk Metal Works is less than half of
what it was a decade ago. The quality of what it manages to churn
out is low. Even Russia's automakers choose to import steel rather
than buy locally because the surfaces of the inferior Russian
product can't hold a paint job.
</P>
<P>
   The promise and problems of Magnitogorsk illustrate the deep
troubles of the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Magnitogorsk has the natural resources, the technical know-how
and the labor force to compete in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is lacking the modern facilities to do the job, a stable
Russian economy in which to operate, and an efficient management
and workforce honed for a free-market economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Soviet town that with privatization in this decade
became a company town, buffeted by the country's stormy transition
since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The factory survives on barter deals, pays its bloated workforce
in part with credits to be used at the company store and largely
still measures success the old-fashioned Soviet way -- not so much
by profits as by its capacity to produce.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is an industrial town trying its best to modernize and
compete. In the good times, before Russia's economy crashed last
August, the plant sunk its profits back into the company to replace
several antiquated open furnaces with two modern and cleaner
furnaces.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it has plans to borrow by issuing ruble-denominated bonds
to raise money to further modernize the mill. Meanwhile, the
factory and the city are seeking investors to develop other
companies -- construction, manufacturing and light industry -- and
become less reliant on steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're adapting the economics and politics to the real
conditions that exist in the country. In socialist times,
Magnitogorsk was an industrial center. Now, there are other
directions,'' said Faik Mukhametzianov, chairman of the local Duma,
or city council.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in the southern Urals about 800 miles southeast of
Moscow, Magnitogorsk was founded in 1929 on ``magnetic mountain''
-- a ridge of solid iron ore that was central to the first Soviet
five-year industrialization plan.
</P>
<P>
   Magnitka, the nickname bestowed on both the city and the
factory, stretches for seven miles along the river it pollutes.
Smokestacks still spew columns of orange, gray, brown and black
exhaust that forms an almost permanent haze over the city.
</P>
<P>
   The factory operates in a uniquely Russian mixture of
capitalism, socialism and shadowy financing. Company officials
declined to be interviewed for this article and sought to prevent
city officials from speaking to Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The company maintains a payroll of some 55,000 employees, down
only slightly from Soviet days and unrealistically high in a market
economy, according to industry experts. About 40 percent of
Magnitogorsk's transactions are done in barter; a system that keeps
the business running but injects no new cash into the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Russia's domestic demand for steel is less than 30
percent of its levels a decade ago, and Russian producers have
confronted trade barriers in seeking to sell their product in the
United States and Europe. Asia offers good customers, but the
economic downturn of 1997-98 has hurt that market, too.
</P>
<P>
   Landlocked and remote, Magnitogorsk pays heavy costs to
transport its goods, making it tough to compete with Russian
companies closer to seaports.
</P>
<P>
   Young people, too, feel a bit trapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no where to go. There's nothing else to do. No new
businesses. No new jobs,'' said Slava Masla, 24, a factory
machinist.
</P>
<P>
   But in relative terms, the mill is prospering amid Russia's
economic crisis. Steel sold abroad -- mainly to Asian markets --
brings hard currency, while the factory's operating costs, fixed in
rubles, have fallen over the past year as the ruble plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Workers earn about 4,000 rubles a month -- about US$167, well
above the national average. But half of it is paid in cash and half
in credits redeemable at the company store.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times Magnitogorsk was a ``closed'' city, off limits
to foreign travelers and many Russians, a testament to its
importance. The city still has main streets named for Lenin and
Marx.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgi Tikhonov, editor of the local newspaper, the
Magnitogorsk Worker, says pragmatism, not politics, guides the city
and its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a workers' town,'' he said. ``Magnitogorsk works no
matter what the system is in Russia.''

 &HT;    MEXICO CITY URGES RESIDENTS TO SCOOP DOG POOP, A HEALTH THREAT
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Aug. 7 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Whenever a scruffy vagabond known as ``Bones''
relieves himself in a public park here, he's not engaged in an
isolated act.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 million other stray dogs that roam this vast
metropolis have no choice but to use the city's streets and squares
as their toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the pack in this unfortunate slice of urban life are as
many as 2 million additional dogs lucky enough to have homes, but
whose masters habitually neglect to clean up their pets' solid
waste.
</P>
<P>
   The result is more than 350 tons of fecal matter deposited in
public areas here each day(CQ). It's a phenomenon that's not only
an assault on the eyes and feet, but a significant threat to
respiratory health, according to Mexico City health officials.
</P>
<P>
   Unchecked dog feces contributes to Mexico City's notoriously bad
air, along with automobile emissions, officials say. A transmitter
of bacteria and parasites, particles of dried dog waste also
contaminate food served in the city's ubiquitous outside taco
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dries and then it flies into the air. Then I breath it and
you breath it,'' said an exasperated Laura Elena Herrejon,
president of the Pro-Neighbors Movement, a Mexico City residents'
group working with city officials to clean up dog excrement.
</P>
<P>
   For Herrejon, reducing dog waste is a matter of political will.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling the long-festering problem of street dogs is very
tough, she said. But laws exist requiring pet owners' to clean up
pet crud. They just haven't been enforced -- until now.
</P>
<P>
   In response to public outcry, officials in this capital city's
biggest and busiest district-- the Cuauhtemoc Borough -- have
initiated a campaign to clean the parks and raise pet owners'
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Last year special maintenance teams were created to scoop poop
in prominent public areas, while officials began sending out fliers
warning residents of the health risks of ``fecalism,'' or
``fecalismo,'' as officials call the abundance of dog doo in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   By its own count, during one 85-day period last year the
district picked up 13 1/2 tons of excrement left by pets and
strays.
</P>
<P>
   In June the district teamed up with Pro-Neighbors Movement and
started a pilot program to impose penalties on negligent pet
owners.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro-Neighbors Movement provides plastic bags and officials
make sure that containers to throw the bags are available in a park
that's been chosen as the site of the pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   Police and volunteers are dispatched periodically to the Santa
Maria de la Ribera Park to remind pet owners of their obligations.
Officers have the power to give violators a ticket requiring them
to appear before a judge.
</P>
<P>
   A banner in the park warns: ``Neighbor! As of June 16 you could
be fined up to 344 pesos and 50 cents ($35) or jailed for between
six and 12 hours if you fail to pick up your pets' feces. We ask
that you cooperate in this action for the good and the health of
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Wire baskets are attached to a fence and signs instruct pet
owners on how to dispose of droppings and explain laws requiring
the clean up.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been cited yet for violating the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to take someone before a judge to make an example,''
said Jose Carner, the district's chief of urban services.
</P>
<P>
   But officials would be happy, he said, if people comply with the
law because they understand their health is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc, Carner added, is a massive district chock full of
Mexico City's oldest buildings, monuments and squares, including
the city's historic downtown area. More than 600,000 people live in
the district and between 4 million and 4.5 million people work,
shop, eat or simply visit there every day.
</P>
<P>
   The excrement-extermination program fits into the district's
plans to reclaim the borough's decaying public areas, Carner said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the result of a push for greater ``civic involvement''
in government, he said, a cornerstone of the 1997 election campaign
of Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas -- the city's first
democratically elected mayor.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other district is following Cuauhtemoc's example
and has signed an agreement with the Pro-Neighbors Movement to also
start cracking down on dog waste, said Herrejon.
</P>
<P>
   At the Santa Maria de la Ribera Park, people on an early morning
stroll with pets said they're in full support of reducing errant
dog feces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always pick up the poo poo. I can't pick up the pee pee, of
course,'' said an elderly woman walking her Bassett hound.
</P>
<P>
   Fabiola Perez, mistress of two dogs, pulled out a plastic bag
from her pocket as evidence that she was cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good program,'' she said. ``We've become way to used to
just letting our dogs run around and letting them do their thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said some pet owners continue to ignore the regulations
and scoff at police -- probably because they don't respect them,
and associate police with corruption and bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only real vigilance,'' she said, ``is going to be between
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond pets, Perez said, the city and federal health officials
need to start better managing the capital's street dogs.
Periodically, dogs are rounded up and vaccinated or even
sterilized, but they're often released back on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Two such dogs live in Santa Maria de la Ribera Park. Perez and
other residents offer the animals affection -- they say they are
gentle -- and have named them Bones and Buford. On a recent
morning, one young man even was walking Bones with a rope tied
around the dog's neck.
</P>
<P>
   The strays, which appear to have been pets at one time, eat
scraps residents give them or hang around restaurants. But they
sleep, play -- and defecate -- in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Street dogs are ``a delicate subject,'' according to Carner.
</P>
<P>
   People often get upset when officials try to round the dogs up
because they fear they will be killed. Yet few people are willing
to give the animals a home. And it's common for people in Mexico to
dump pets they can no longer manage on the street to let them fend
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they killed all the strays in Mexico City, the next
day there would be more back on the streets,'' Perez said, petting
Bones and Buford, who looked at her lovingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lack of culture when it comes to taking care
of dogs,'' Perez said.

 &HT;    With RUSSIA-CRISIS-$ADV08; RUSSIA-ECONOMY-$ADV08.

crash.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ After an economic boom in 1996 and 1997, Russia fell on
hard times last summer. Its stock market collapsed, the ruble
declined in value, many banks closed and foreign investment dried
up. The sharp economic downturn caps a decade since the fall of the
Soviet Union that has seen Russia's standard of living decline.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some aspects of Russia's life today:
</P>
<P>
   MORE POOR: The number of Russians living in poverty has
increased from 33 million last year to 55 million today, according
to official statistics released in July. Nearly four of every 10
Russians live below the official subsistence level, defined as an
income below 829 rubles a month, the equivalent of about US$34.
</P>
<P>
   LESS MONEY: The average monthly wage is 1,225 rubles, or about
US$51. Before the Aug. 17 crash, the average wage was the
equivalent of about US$200. Millions of workers go months or even
years without getting paid at all. The average pension is 403
rubles -- U$17 -- a month.
</P>
<P>
   MORE WORK: With the price of imported goods from the West out of
reach of most Russians, many sectors in Russian industry are
reporting an upturn, producing affordable, Russian-made consumer
goods. Industrial output is expected to rise 1.5 percent in 1999,
but still not rebounding from the loss in 1998 of 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   LESS TRADE: Imports fell 46 percent in the first six months of
1999, while exports dropped 11 percent compared to the same period
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   MORE TAX COLLECTIONS: In the first six months of this year,
Russia's tax police nabbed 6,000 tax cheats and added $200 million
to the government treasury, almost totaling the number for all of
1998. But the chief of the tax police, Vlacheslav Soltaganov, said
the figure ``is in my opinion a drop in the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   LESS COMPETITIVE: In an annual survey of business
competitiveness in 59 countries released last month by the
Swiss-based World Economic Forum, Russia finished dead last, ranked
below countries such as Bolivia (ranked 55) and Zimbabwe (57).
</P>
<P>
   MORE CRIME: Russia's murder rate is one of the world's highest,
triple that of the United States and seven times higher than in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   FEWER PEOPLE: Russia's population stands at 146 million,
dropping by 401,000 people last year, and about 2 million over the
past seven years. Alcoholism and the decline in health care have
contributed to a rising death rate and people are having fewer
children. Life expectancy is now estimated at 60.8 years for men,
up considerably from a low of 57.6 years in 1994, but still low for
an industrial nation.
</P>
<P>
   PESSIMISM ABOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   In May of this year, and last September, the Public Opinion
Foundation polled 1,500 Russians assessing their attitudes about
life and the economy. Here's what it found:
</P>
<P>
   ....................................................................
...........................September 1998..............May 1999
</P>
<P>
   Those that believe the worst is 
over?..............................2%...............................

now?.............................26%................................

come?..................60%..................................53%
</P>
<P>
   Those that have no 
opinion...................................................12%.......
.............................9%
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Poll results have a accuracy of plus or minus 4 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ How's this for spin? Russian officials recently
delivered the good news that the country's economy will not expand
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the times, the government issued the promising
forecast that the economy would remain flat in 1999, compared to
earlier estimates that predicted the downward spiral that commenced
last summer would continue.
</P>
<P>
   One year into its deepest economic crisis since the Soviet Union
collapsed, Russia's outlook is assessed not so much by what's going
right, as by the horrible things that could have -- but haven't --
gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation is down. Industrial production is up. The value of the
ruble has remained relatively steady. To call it the start of an
economic recovery is premature; but neither is Russia the unbridled
disaster some thought it would be by this time.
</P>
<P>
   On August 17, 1998, the value of Russia's national currency
plummeted as the country of 146 million slid headlong into an
economic abyss -- and the world held its collective breath and
watched to see how the globe's second-largest nuclear power coped.
</P>
<P>
   Russians did not riot. With stoic resignation to their plight,
they made do. Though Russia today is a considerably poorer place
than it was last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Russians living in poverty has increased from 33
million to 55 million, according to official statistics released in
July. Today, nearly four of every 10 Russians live below the
official subsistence level, defined as an income below 829 rubles a
month, the equivalent of about US$34.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can we do? `` asked Sergei Kastanov, an out-of-work
Moscow laborer who collects empty bottles and offers rides in his
dilapidated compact car to earn a meager living. ``We're cursed
with bad leaders, bad factories and bad fate.''
</P>
<P>
   The predictions were dire. In the weeks after the ruble crash,
major banks closed and hundreds of thousands of workers lost their
savings and their jobs. Food shortages were reported, including one
Arctic town where residents were said to be killing and cooking
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   As winter set in, some areas of Russia were without heat. Even
an official United Nations report speculated that the cold and
scarcity of food could incite social unrest. After all, an economic
crash in Indonesia earlier in 1998 provoked rioting in the streets
and the fall of the government in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, the sickly President Boris Yeltsin seemed out of
touch, changing his prime ministers with nearly the same frequency
as his hospital visits. Four overhauls in the government were
ordered in the 14 months between March 1998 and May of this year,
when current Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin was appointed.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia has managed to confound the Western experts who last
fall were predicting calamity. Accustomed to coping with Soviet-era
scarcities and previous economic crises since communism fell in
1991, Russians hardly protested when their currency dropped
fourfold, from 6 rubles to the dollar to the current rate of 24
rubles to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But if the worst predictions have not come true, neither has
real progress.
</P>
<P>
   Russian government and businesses are still plagued by
corruption and inefficiency. Wealth remains in the hands of the
relative few. The stock market is edging up, but nowhere near its
boom levels of two years ago. Foreign investors fled last summer
and for the most part have stayed away. Tax collections are up, but
far from levels needed to fulfill the state's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin continues to remain largely secluded, leaving the
country's affairs to be run by a close circle of insiders. No one
expects real improvement until Russia struggles through its
election season and the post-Yeltsin era takes shape. Parliamentary
elections are scheduled for December and Russia is set to elect a
new president next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stuck somewhere between feudalism and capitalism,''
laments Olga Pushkina, a financial consultant whose company seeks
to turn around failing Russian firms.
</P>
<P>
   The larger, looming unknown element now is not economics, but
politics: Will the elections for parliament and president be fair?
Who will prevail -- market reformers, old-style communists or
something in between? And what of the fate of Russia's experiment
with democracy?
</P>
<P>
   ``We approach the elections in a state when nothing is known for
sure. Absolute uncertainty,'' said Yevgeny Yasin, a former
economics minister. ``What will happen after the elections? Nobody
knows.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Russians are getting by as best they can. In some
instances, the ruble collapse worked to Russia's benefit,
invigorating domestic industries that can produce goods cheaper
than foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
   At the Spirovski bottle factory, near Tver, production has
tripled as Russian vodka-makers have turned from importing more
expensive glass bottles from European suppliers to the factory's
cheaper bottles. Likewise, the Russian carmaker Autovaz has this
year hit a five-year high on its production lines.
</P>
<P>
   Such sporadic good news was bolstered further in July when two
of the world's financial institutions gave Moscow some breathing
room.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund agreed in July to resume lending
to Russia with a $4.5 billion assistance package to be delivered
over the next 18 months. And foreign debtors of the so-called Paris
Club in last week(CQ) eased the payment schedule on $8.1 billion of
arrears dating back to Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet billions more dollars in debt has piled up in the years
since 1991. (The Soviet-era debt deal settled in Paris represents
only about half of Russia's' external debt.). It is a crushing
burden that unless deferred or forgiven threatens to consume
Russia's entire government budget, currently at $25 billion in
1999. ``Any economic growth in the next 10 years is absolutely out
of the question,'' Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Zadornov warned
recently, referring to the debt problem.
</P>
<P>
   And the upbeat anecdotes and financial tidings cannot mask the
fact that Russians are vastly poorer today, and largely soured on
Western-style economic reforms that they equate with economic
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard of living for Russian citizens has noticeably
dropped and is currently only 60 percent of 1997 levels. A new
economic decline has taken place in Russia,'' said Vladimir
Kuzmichev, who writes about economics for the daily Nezavisimaya
Gazeta.
</P>
<P>
   They survive largely by taking advantage of Soviet-era subsidies
that keeps the cost of housing and health care low. They also grow
their own food on small plots of land in the country. Russians also
operate in an underground economy based on cash -- mainly U.S.
dollars -- not recorded by government statisticians.
</P>
<P>
   The news is not all bad. Russia continues to develop an
entrepreneurial class of younger people accustomed to their
post-Soviet freedoms and commercial opportunities. According to
polls, few Russians are satisfied with the messy transition from
communism to Russia's current system of half-done capitalism. But
the majority does not want to go back to the USSR, either.
</P>
<P>
   Yevgeny Primakov, the former foreign minister who led the
government from last September until this May, gave Russia ``no
progress and no steps back,'' according to Yasin.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's cautious approach seemed to be the correct one for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Russia could not return to drastic Soviet-era economics --
printing rubles and nationalizing industries -- without alienating
the IMF and donor countries like the United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But with its hamstrung economy and political gridlock
(communists and nationalists control the opposition parliament),
neither could it dig itself out of its hole and make gains toward
real democratic and market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The worst predictions have not come true. But neither have the
greatest hopes. Russia reckons the good news is somewhere in
between, where things may be uncertain, but stable for now.

   MAGNITOGORSK, Russia _ In its heyday, the giant steel mill on
the Ural River was one of the world's largest, a smoke-belching
symbol of Soviet industrial might.
</P>
<P>
   Success was measured by the steady volume of raw steel rolling
from its production lines. The fallout from the open blast furnaces
turned the snow black throughout this city of 430,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the snow is white,'' but times are hard, complains Yelena
Sherbakova, a retired mill worker struggling to live on a monthly
pension of just $20. ``It is difficult for everybody. Prices are
very high. You can see signs of improvement, but our lives are
still horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The output from Magnitogorsk Metal Works is less than half of
what it was a decade ago. The quality of what it manages to churn
out is low. Even Russia's automakers choose to import steel rather
than buy locally because the surfaces of the inferior Russian
product can't hold a paint job.
</P>
<P>
   The promise and problems of Magnitogorsk illustrate the deep
troubles of the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Magnitogorsk has the natural resources, the technical know-how
and the labor force to compete in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is lacking the modern facilities to do the job, a stable
Russian economy in which to operate, and an efficient management
and workforce honed for a free-market economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Soviet town that with privatization in this decade
became a company town, buffeted by the country's stormy transition
since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The factory survives on barter deals, pays its bloated workforce
in part with credits to be used at the company store and largely
still measures success the old-fashioned Soviet way -- not so much
by profits as by its capacity to produce.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is an industrial town trying its best to modernize and
compete. In the good times, before Russia's economy crashed last
August, the plant sunk its profits back into the company to replace
several antiquated open furnaces with two modern and cleaner
furnaces.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it has plans to borrow by issuing ruble-denominated bonds
to raise money to further modernize the mill. Meanwhile, the
factory and the city are seeking investors to develop other
companies -- construction, manufacturing and light industry -- and
become less reliant on steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're adapting the economics and politics to the real
conditions that exist in the country. In socialist times,
Magnitogorsk was an industrial center. Now, there are other
directions,'' said Faik Mukhametzianov, chairman of the local Duma,
or city council.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in the southern Urals about 800 miles southeast of
Moscow, Magnitogorsk was founded in 1929 on ``magnetic mountain''
-- a ridge of solid iron ore that was central to the first Soviet
five-year industrialization plan.
</P>
<P>
   Magnitka, the nickname bestowed on both the city and the
factory, stretches for seven miles along the river it pollutes.
Smokestacks still spew columns of orange, gray, brown and black
exhaust that forms an almost permanent haze over the city.
</P>
<P>
   The factory operates in a uniquely Russian mixture of
capitalism, socialism and shadowy financing. Company officials
declined to be interviewed for this article and sought to prevent
city officials from speaking to Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The company maintains a payroll of some 55,000 employees, down
only slightly from Soviet days and unrealistically high in a market
economy, according to industry experts. About 40 percent of
Magnitogorsk's transactions are done in barter; a system that keeps
the business running but injects no new cash into the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Russia's domestic demand for steel is less than 30
percent of its levels a decade ago, and Russian producers have
confronted trade barriers in seeking to sell their product in the
United States and Europe. Asia offers good customers, but the
economic downturn of 1997-98 has hurt that market, too.
</P>
<P>
   Landlocked and remote, Magnitogorsk pays heavy costs to
transport its goods, making it tough to compete with Russian
companies closer to seaports.
</P>
<P>
   Young people, too, feel a bit trapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no where to go. There's nothing else to do. No new
businesses. No new jobs,'' said Slava Masla, 24, a factory
machinist.
</P>
<P>
   But in relative terms, the mill is prospering amid Russia's
economic crisis. Steel sold abroad -- mainly to Asian markets --
brings hard currency, while the factory's operating costs, fixed in
rubles, have fallen over the past year as the ruble plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Workers earn about 4,000 rubles a month -- about US$167, well
above the national average. But half of it is paid in cash and half
in credits redeemable at the company store.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times Magnitogorsk was a ``closed'' city, off limits
to foreign travelers and many Russians, a testament to its
importance. The city still has main streets named for Lenin and
Marx.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgi Tikhonov, editor of the local newspaper, the
Magnitogorsk Worker, says pragmatism, not politics, guides the city
and its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a workers' town,'' he said. ``Magnitogorsk works no
matter what the system is in Russia.''

 &HT;    Puns intended in this array of groaners
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Since I acquired the habit every few months
of relaying a few puns in this space that were sent to me by
friends and readers, the number of submissions has mushroomed. So
it's time to clean out the closet and torture you once again with a
few of my favorite groaners.
</P>
<P>
   _ Evidence has been found that William Tell and his family were
avid bowlers. However, all the league records were unfortunately
destroyed in a fire. Thus we'll never know for whom the Tells
bowled.
</P>
<P>
   _ A skeptical anthropologist was cataloging South American folk
remedies with the assistance of a tribal brujo who indicated that
the leaves of a particular fern were a sure cure for any case of
constipation. When the anthropologist expressed his doubts, the
brujo looked him in the eye and said, ``Let me tell you, with
fronds like these, who needs enemas?''
</P>
<P>
   _ A famous Viking explorer returned home from a voyage and found
his name missing from the town register. His wife insisted on
complaining to the local civic official who apologized profusely
saying, ``I must have taken Leif off my census.''
</P>
<P>
   _ There were three Indian squaws. One slept on a deer skin. One
slept on an elk skin and the third slept on a hippopotamus skin.
All three became pregnant and the first two each had a baby boy.
The one who slept on the hippopotamus skin had twin boys. This goes
to prove that the squaw of the hippopotamus is equal to the sons of
the squaws of the other two hides.
</P>
<P>
   _ Then there was the sausage-maker who took a sea gull as
payment. One could say he took a tern for the wurst.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were chilly, but when they lit
a fire in the craft, it sank, proving once and for all that you
can't have your kayak and heat it, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two boll weevils grew up in Louisiana. One went to Hollywood
and became a famous actor. The other stayed behind in the cotton
fields and never amounted to much. The second one, naturally,
became known as the lesser of two weevils.
</P>
<P>
   _ This guy goes into a restaurant for a Christmas breakfast
while in his home town for the holidays. After looking over the
menu he says, ``I'll just have the eggs Benedict.'' His order comes
a while later, and it's served on a big, shiny hubcap. He asks the
waiter, ``What's with the hubcap?''
</P>
<P>
   The waiter says, ``Well, there's no plate like chrome for the
hollandaise.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A doctor made it a regular habit to stop off at a bar for a
hazelnut daiquiri on his way home. The bartender was familiar with
his routine and would always have the drink waiting at precisely
5:03 p.m. One afternoon, as the end of the work day approached, the
bartender was dismayed to find that he was out of hazelnut extract.
Thinking quickly, he made a daiquiri with hickory nuts and set it
on the bar. The doctor came in at his regular time, took one sip of
the drink and exclaimed, ``This isn't a hazelnut daiquiri!''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm sorry,'' replied the bartender, ``it's a hickory
daiquiri, doc.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A sailor was caught AWOL as he tried to sneak on board his
ship at about 3 am. The chief petty officer spied him and ordered
the sailor to stop. Upon hearing the sailor's lame explanation for
his tardiness, the officer ordered the sailor, ``Take this broom
and sweep every link on this anchor chain by morning or it's the
brig for you!
</P>
<P>
   The sailor began to pick up the broom and commence performing
his charge. As he began to sweep, a tern landed on the broom
handle. The sailor yelled at the bird to leave, but it didn't. The
lad picked the tern off the broom handle, giving the bird a toss.
The bird left, only to return and light once again on the broom
handle. The sailor went through the same routine all over again,
with the same result. He couldn't get any cleaning done because he
can only sweep at the chain once or twice before the blasted bird
returns. When morning came, so did the chief petty officer, to
check up on his wayward sailor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What in the heck have you been doing all night? This chain is
no cleaner than when you started! What have you to say for
yourself, sailor?'' barked the chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honest, chief,'' came the reply, ``I tossed a tern all night
and couldn't sweep a link!''
</P>
<P>
   _ Everyone knows the story of Mahatma Ghandi, how he refused to
wear shoes so his feet became hard and tough. He went for long
periods fasting and refused to eat meat, even when he wasn't
fasting. The fasting and his diet gave him have extremely bad
breath. He was of lean, slight build, especially in his later
years.
</P>
<P>
   Thus he was a super-callused fragile mystic plagued with
halitosis.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.

 &HT;    Reserves an integral part of today's military
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Most of the time, Alex Tafolla is director of
the City of San Angelo's public housing program. But at least once
a month and for a minimum of two weeks in the summer, he puts on a
camouflage uniform and becomes Sgt. Maj. Tafolla.
</P>
<P>
   He ramrods an artillery battalion based in New Braunfels and he
delights in talking about how well the unit can shoot. His reasons
for being a member of the Texas National Guard are complex, but he
sure as heck doesn't eat dust and swat mosquitoes for lack of
things to do.
</P>
<P>
   He was on active duty in the Air Force in the late 1960s, joined
the Guard in 1983 and worked his way up to the highest enlisted
rank there is.
</P>
<P>
   Tafolla is, as they say, thoroughly briefed and highly
motivated. He is the kind of soldier they ought to put on a poster.
</P>
<P>
   He comes to mind because I just saw him a couple of weekends ago
when he stopped by my folks' house in San Angelo to say hello. He
was just back from Annual Training, 18 days in the field, and still
in his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   He's my cousin.
</P>
<P>
   And he comes to mind because service in the National Guard and
Reserves has become something of a political football again. Press
questions about Gov. George W. Bush's service in the Air National
Guard in the 1960s center on whether he got special favors to get
in. But the tone of the questions does collateral damage to Reserve
and Guard personnel. As letter writer Ladd Patillo, a colonel in
the Army Reserve, noted in a letter to the editor published in the
Austin American-Statesman on Monday, an unflattering picture of
Guard and Reserve service emerges from those questions.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Patillo is overreacting a bit, but he does have a point.
In the late 1960s, service in the Guard and Reserve was a refuge
from active duty. Because it was, getting in was rather difficult.
The reserves weren't being called up, so, if you got in, chances
were excellent that you wouldn't get any closer to the war than the
evening news. The reserve components also had an image of being a
bunch of beer swillin' good ol' boys who liked playing soldier once
a month.
</P>
<P>
   That's the one that haunts today's Guard and Reserve. It isn't
your dad's Oldsmobile, it's not your same old Statesman, and
service in the Guard and Reserve today sure isn't whatever it used
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Today's reserves are pulling more of the weight as active duty
components continue to shrink. Picking up that slack has costs,
both financial and personal.
</P>
<P>
   A 21-day deployment is plenty disruptive enough to families and
careers. Longer ones, like the three to five month tours in the
Balkans and elsewhere, are tougher still on the part-time soldier.
In January, a headquarters unit of Texas' 49th Armored Division _
complete with a general _ is to deploy to Bosnia for a nine-month
tour.
</P>
<P>
   They do it for whatever reason, but because they do it, somebody
else doesn't have to. We could question, I suppose, whether anyone
should have to do what a soldier does. But coffeehouse idealism and
cocktail-party chatter is no basis for making foreign policy, much
less enforcing it.
</P>
<P>
   The national leadership is constantly renewing military
commitments and adding new ones. Active duty personnel are
stretched thin and getting thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Today's reserve components are 50 percent of the country's
military forces. You don't have to be Gen. George C. Marshall to
figure out that these days Guard and Reserve troops are a safety
valve for politicians and the public. Using Guard and Reserve
personnel to fill in the ranks of the active duty is relatively
cheap and holds at bay discussion of reviving a draft.
</P>
<P>
   Ironic, no?
</P>
<P>
   I'll thank my cousin for you the next time I see him.

captain in the Texas National Guard, is the editorial page editor

 &HT;    Forget bipartisanship as parties vie for House
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ All his Texas Democratic siblings have been
killed in political battle. He's the only elected Democratic
official left with statewide clout.
</P>
<P>
   A movie about his political mission for 2000 might be called
``Saving Speaker Laney.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's no movie _ just Texas politics. And like former U.S.
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen used to say, Texans consider politics a contact
sport.
</P>
<P>
   In the one-party Democratic days in the Texas Legislature,
personal loyalty and personal organizations were more important
than party affiliations. The late Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock
eventually made bipartisanship a mantra, and Republican Gov. George
W. Bush picked up on it.
</P>
<P>
   But as Republicans near a majority in the Texas House of
Representatives, amicable dealing across the aisles might be in
greater danger than the whooping crane. The GOP has 72 seats to the
Democrats' 78.
</P>
<P>
   Laney, a cotton farmer and used-car dealer from Hale Center,
northeast of Lubbock, was elected speaker in 1993 after two decades
in the House. Though a Democrat, he's always had Republicans on his
leadership team, as they were for his predecessor for a decade, Gib
Lewis of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   But particularly since the legislators elected next year will
redraw legislative and congressional districts in 2001, overt
bipartisanship might be ending. As Republican numbers have steadily
grown, so have demands from the more strident Republicans _ known
as ``Shiites'' _ that Republicans vote for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican Caucus has asked its members not to sign
pledge cards to any speaker candidate until after the 2000 election
_ obviously to pressure Republicans who might want to pledge
support for Laney to stay neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Laney on paper remains bipartisan, and indeed has a cadre of
Republicans _ several from his area of the state _ who might vote
for him even if the Republicans gained a slight edge. But given the
hardened attitude of Republicans, Laney's team obviously has a
vested interest in holding or adding to Democratic seats.
</P>
<P>
   That team includes five freshman Democrats who won open seats
last year targeted by Republicans (Dan Ellis, Livingston; David
Farabee, Wichita Falls; Mark Homer, Paris; David Lengefeld,
Hamilton; and Allan Ritter, Nederland).
</P>
<P>
   It also includes veteran Democrats from districts whose voters
often choose Republicans at the top of the ballot (David Counts,
Knox City; Craig Eiland, Galveston; Bob Glaze, Gilmer; Patricia
Gray, Galveston; Tom Ramsay, Mount Vernon; Bob Turner, Voss; Tom
Uher, Bay City; Ken Yarbrough, Houston; and Zeb Zbranek, Winnie).
</P>
<P>
   Though Laney caters to incumbents, his supporters' tears would
dry quickly if some marginal seats now held by Republicans (Wayne
Christian, Center; Rick Green, Dripping Springs; Rick Hardcastle,
Vernon; Charles Jones, College Station; and Todd Staples,
Palestine, if he runs for Drew Nixon's Senate seat) were captured
by respectable mainstream Democrats. Recruiting posters are already
up.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans think Bush for president atop the Republican ticket
will help them. They're using that argument to try to get some of
their Democratic colleagues to switch parties. But word so far is
that Democrats aren't defecting. They think they can hold their
own, and maybe even gain a seat or two because:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush's coattails will be shorter in 2000, because he won't
spend much time or money on Texas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Polling indicates Democratic issues, such as regulating health
maintenance organizations and protecting Social Security, resonate
with voters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Laney's running a full-out speaker's race that includes noting
the repercussions to members who vote for the loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be out actively working,'' he said. ``I'll try to
be everywhere every member wants me to.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, for those Republicans who want him out.

 &HT;    School initiatives are a bit heavy on the starch
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ With the 2000 census near, it was instructive to
do a nose count at a recent photo op touting education reforms by
the majority party in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For this photo, children were assembled. A school bus was rolled
into place before the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The scene shared by The Associated Press shows House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, surrounded by suits, and by 30-plus kids in
T-shirts. My eye finds every nose in the picture to be white except
for two.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there were more black and brown children at the event.
Maybe they were just cropped out.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair to read too much into a picture. But he who lives by
the photo op shall die by it as well.
</P>
<P>
   The June 22 event touted a Republican budget initiative that
would diddle with President Clinton's plan to hire 100,000 teachers
to reduce class size in grades 1 through 3. The initiative instead
would convert $13 billion in education aid to block grants to be
spent as governors wish.
</P>
<P>
   This is a curious turn, since the last Congress approved an
initiative to hire 30,000 teachers. Now the House GOP line is that
states are handcuffed by the class-size initiative and should be
freed to spend the money on teacher training or something else. But
in fact, the current program already allows school districts to
apply for waivers of federal regulations. A case of oafish federal
government with its heel on the necks of local school boards?
Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers worry about what this initiative would mean to
Title 1, the federal program aimed at helping school districts with
the most poverty. It could mean in some states the siphoning of
some federal dollars to the suburbs already rich from siphoning off
urban dollars as they cherry-pick families and students.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it might mean nothing of substance. In that case at
least you've got a photo op.
</P>
<P>
   It's a challenge for some lawmakers who really don't buy into
the concept of public schools to show they care about those
schools.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good reason why vouchers often get trotted out as God's
gift to education reform. It is a perfect match _ policy-makers
whose children wouldn't be caught dead intermingling with all that
social diversity and its baggage suggesting that government make it
possible for others to opt out of the system, just like they did.
</P>
<P>
   Some earnestly believe that vouchers would improve public
schools. But even if that doesn't happen, they can find comfort in
an ideological constituency that is anti-government, quick to blame
public schools for all that ails our world, and is historically
rooted in the quest to keep schools segregated in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Some wrinkles in Texas have served the purpose of getting people
back to bunching in racial groups. Charter schools so serve in some
instances. The George Bush-signed 1995 reform that would allow
``breakaway'' school districts spawned an aborted effort to create
an all-black district in Waco. Four years under that law, no such
breakaway has occurred in all of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other GOP policy positions seek to rub the necks of
those who purchase sanctuary in private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) has made so-called education savings
accounts _ tax-free sums for private education _ his signature
issue. It's portrayed as a way for the starving masses to save up
and achieve private-school nirvana. But you can't save what you
don't have.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, some struggling families would benefit greatly by being
able to tax-shelter accounts to pay for private schooling. But
Coverdell's plan, costing $1.6 billion over 10 years, isn't
means-tested.
</P>
<P>
   A Treasury analysis found that 70 percent of the benefits would
go to the top 20 percent of income earners.
</P>
<P>
   Is that so wrong? Your call. Just don't sell this brand of
education reform as one that helps those children cropped out.

 &HT;    Jaws: The finale
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They were two of stock-car racing's dominant figures
in the early 1970s when Darrell Waltrip first burst on the NASCAR
scene.
</P>
<P>
   But in Indianapolis, where NASCAR prepares for Saturday's
Brickyard 400 and Waltrip announces his yearlong farewell tour
before next year's retirement, Bobby Allison and Cale Yarborough
remember the rivalry with Ol' D.W. in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Yarborough can chuckle about the loudmouthed kid he nicknamed
``Jaws'' some 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a great career, and I think he realizes that it's
time that he do something else,'' said Yarborough, who won his last
NASCAR championship in 1978, when Allison finished second, Waltrip
third. ``He's been a great asset to the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison and Waltrip, however, do not speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darrell Waltrip has had friends and fans along the way. I
don't want to take any of that away from him,'' said Allison, who
lost championships to Waltrip by 53 points (1981) and 72 points
(1982) and beat him by 47 points for the 1983 title.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel like he's hung around way, way too long, because
he's had the advantage of things like provisional starts, which he
had 24 last year. He's had really good sponsors, and he's been able
to be in really, really good cars but hasn't been able to do well
in recent years. Maybe it's time that he should step aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarborough and Waltrip had a different relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came into the sport kind of like nobody else that I've seen
lately, doing a lot of talking,'' Yarborough said. In return,
Waltrip came up with the Cale Scale, measuring the difficulty of a
win.
</P>
<P>
   Their skirmishes apparently didn't produce any lingering hard
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one race in Michigan several years ago where Darrell
and I battled it out most of the day,'' Yarborough said. ``On the
last lap going down the backstretch, we had a battle to the
checkered (flag), and I beat him.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we passed the start-finish line, he made a dive for me
to try to spin me out or try to hit me after the race was over. I
saw him coming, and I avoided him. He went on down and spun out in
the infield. It had been raining the night before, and he got
bogged down in the infield; they had to send a wrecker to get him
out of the mud. I think he was a little embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry with Allison was more intense.
</P>
<P>
   Allison's career ended in 1988 with a crash at Pocono, in Long
Pond, Pa., a wreck that erased a big chunk of memory. He said he
can't remember winning the Daytona 500 that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first racing event that I remembered when I woke up at
Lakeshore Hospital after my Pocono situation, was a race in
Nashville in 1981,'' Allison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remembered I was driving the Hardee's car, and I was leading
the race. We had a caution flag and on the restart, he just drove
right by me, which convinced me that he had left side tires put on
the right side of the car. So I radioed by crew and told my crew
chief to put left side tires on my right side. The crew chief
informed me that if we got caught, I had to pay the fine. I said,
OK, I'll pay the fine, right now we've got to win the race. So they
put the tires on my car the next pit stop and that let me race him,
but he beat me by a fender.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, the first five cars had to go to the gas pumps
and the scales, then the winner went to victory lane. He pulled up
to the gas pump and climbed out of his car and called for Joe
Gassaway, the assistant chief inspector. I climbed out of my car to
see what the situation was. As Joe got there, Darrell said `Joe,
Bobby's got left side tires on the right.' Now, he was first and I
was second, so it wasn't going to move him ahead any that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, the fine was $100 a tire. Ol' Joe stuck his
finger in my face and said, `I'm gonna fine you $1,000 a tire.' I
said, `Joe, he's got 'em on the right, too. With that, Joe turns
his back toward Darrell's car and said, `We ain't looking at him;
we're looking at you.'''
</P>
<P>
   It galls Allison that he is tied for third with Waltrip on the
all-time victory list with 84 wins. Allison said he has never been
given credit for a win in a Mustang in 1971. Waltrip's last victory
came in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But driver Jeremy Mayfield said Waltrip inspired his career.
Mayfield and Waltrip both are natives of Owensboro, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in high school, Darrell came and talked to an
assembly at our school,'' Mayfield said. ``My shop teacher knew how
important racing was to me and how I felt about Darrell, and he
made sure I got the chance to meet him. We didn't talk three
minutes, I bet, but it was probably the biggest three minutes of my
life right then.''
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of Winston Cup drivers might not know the
Waltrip that Allison remembers. To the new kids, he's the witty
one-time champion who needed provisionals to make races the last
several years and usually finished near the rear. But they respect
him for the history he made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the reason Darrell had a little trouble with
the fans at the beginning of his career wasn't because he talked a
lot,'' Sterling Marlin said. ``The thing is, he'd say he was going
to beat all those boys, (Richard) Petty, Allison, (David) Pearson,
Cale, and then he'd go out and do it. And then he'd say he was
going to do it again. In my neck of the woods we have a saying, `It
ain't bragging if you can do it.' ''

   TRAVEL-JAPAN _ TOKYO _ This was my third trip to Japan, where I
go periodically to satisfy my decades-long curiosity about a
culture so different from ours. In fact, I had timed my visit to
coincide with Tokyo's Sanja Festival, intending to watch at least
one day of the three-day event. But participating in the festival's
parade? That was completely unexpected. I found myself in full
traditional costume, hoisting a huge shrine on my sholder, after
signing up for a Japan National Tourist Organzation program in
which more than 1,000 English-speaking families in 14 cities around
Japan open their homes to foreigners. (Gordon, Atlanta

beauty and upscale resort amenities that makes the whole crew fell

even hop up to you and eat out of your hand. A visit to this dude
ranch that's similar to ones in the American West-- except for

Gen. George C. Marshall to figure out that these days Guard and
Reserve troops are a safety valve for politicians and the public.
Using Guard and Reserve personnel to fill in the ranks of the

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ WACO, Texas _ With the 2000 census
near, it was instructive to do a nose count at a recent photo op
touting education reforms by the majority party in Congress. For
this photo, children were assembled. The scene shows House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, surrounded by suits, and by 30-plus kids in
T-shirts. My eye finds every nose in the picture to be white except
for two. Maybe there were more black and brown children at the
event. Maybe they were just cropped out. It's unfair to read too
much into a picture. But he who lives by the photo op shall die by
it as well. (John Young is opinion page editor of the Waco

   COXNET TRAVEL 0803 _ A visit to the misty Ilse of Skye in the
Scottish herbribes, where the scene of Surf-pounded skerries (off
shore rocks), tiny fishing villages and mountian-locked lochs has
barely changed since Robert Louis Stevenson's time. (Hulbert,

   TRAVEL-JAPAN _ TOKYO _ This was my third trip to Japan, where I
go periodically to satisfy my decades-long curiosity about a
culture so different from ours. In fact, I had timed my visit to
coincide with Tokyo's Sanja Festival, intending to watch at least
one day of the three-day event. But participating in the festival's
parade? That was completely unexpected. I found myself in full
traditional costume, hoisting a huge shrine on my sholder, after
signing up for a Japan National Tourist Organzation program in
which more than 1,000 English-speaking families in 14 cities around
Japan open their homes to foreigners. (Gordon, Atlanta

   TRAVEL-SAWGRASS _ PONTE VERDRA BEACH, Fla. _ A visit to Sawgrass
Marriott Resort _ an inviting family vacation spot on Florida's
Northeastern-most coast. Here, among the dunes and sands of Ponte
Vedra Beach, Marriott has engineered a perfect marriage of natural
beauty and upscale resort amenities that makes the whole crew fell
right at home. In that regard, it's a fine alternative to the
better-known coastal resorts of Hilton Hea, Seaside and Destin _
which are only mirginally closer to Atlanta. (Tate, Atlanta

on more important things, like becoming that most elusive of family

   TRAVEL-AUSTRALIA _ ELBOW VALLEY, Australia _ It's a good thing
we're not serious golfers, because the kangaoos think they own the
links at Cherrabah Homestead Resort in Queensland. Kangaroos by the
hundreds live wild at the Australian outback resort, and some will
even hop up to you and eat out of your hand. A visit to this dude
ranch that's similar to ones in the American West-- except for
those jumpy golfers. (Holzer, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)

   GETAWAY _ Officials in Mobile, Ala., are hoping that the nearly

Family of Tsarist Russia'' in the six months it was on display in
Wilmington, Del., will pass through its Civic Center by Nov. 14
when the elaborate presentation closes. The show is is not merely a
display of possessions and architectural recreations. It is a
fascinating story of Russia's last royal family told in their own
words against a background of turbulent history that changed the
modern world forever. (Saunders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

 &HT;    With Photos.

<P>
   ERBIL, Iraq _ Rather than forfeit the land of his ancestral to
land mines, Hassan Hussein Darwish decided to fight the odds and
remove them.
</P>
<P>
   The odds caught up to him. Now, a 29-year-old missing his hands
and eyes, Darwish tells the story of those who landmine experts
call ``village de-miners.''
</P>
<P>
   They risk their lives for land their families need to make a
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come to the mines. The mines came to us,'' says
Darwish, an Iraqi Kurd. ``Of course, you are face-to-face with
death at any moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Iraq, a semi-independent region also called Iraqi
Kurdistan, is one of the most heavily mined regions in the world.

   United Nations officials estimate that more than 20 percent of
the land, in fertile valleys and steep mountainsides, is laden with
up to 10 million landmines. It may take 35 to 70 years to clear
them all.
</P>
<P>
   The mines were laid in complex layers. The Iraqi and Iranian
armies planted the most, during their eight-year war in the 1980s.
Turkish forces have also laid some mines, as have the three main
Kurdish forces, often warring against each other.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, multiple forces laid mines on the same land,
making it especially difficult to find accurate maps of the
explosives beneath the ground.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 people have been injured, including about 2,400
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations de-mining program in Iraqi Kurdistan, which
began in 1997, has more than 900 staff to remove mines and train
locals to remove them. They do it the right way -- with body armor,
mine-sniffing dogs, metal detectors and, above all, with great
care.
</P>
<P>
   That's not how Darwish did the job.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a year and a half after his injury, he has moved from his
mountain village to a squalid block house on the shanty-town edges
of urban Erbil where he tells his story.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man who writes poetry -- he calls himself a ``friend of
the pen'' though he now dictates his poems. He confidently slices
the air with the two pointed stumps of his forearms to make his
point.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting cross-legged on a metal frame bed, he describes life in
the village of Balula, near the Iranian border.
</P>
<P>
   His family planted rice, and other vegetables and fruit on the
land. They lived in mud brick houses without electricity. Due to
wars and uprisings, they spent years as refugees before returning
to the village in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of residents have since been killed by the mines, which
they think were laid by the Iraqi army in order to deter an Iranian
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Darwish starting clearing mines in 1992, picking up the skill
with other villagers from a neighbor who had trained with a
mine-clearing agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were imitating each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Darwish worked full-time at the job and said every family in the
village of 120 homes had a son clearing mines.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Darwish had mine maps to help him. Otherwise, he
just used metal prods to probe the ground. Sometimes, he burned the
brush to make mines easier to spot.
</P>
<P>
   He says he removed more than 2,000 mines over five years,
gingerly lifting them from the ground and disarming them. He
cleared about 20 on the morning he came across a small mine he did
not recognize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had it in my hands and was inspecting it, then it
exploded,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, professional mine removers leave the mines in the
ground and explode them there, rather than risk moving them. It's
one technique they use to make the job safe.
</P>
<P>
   David Edwards, project coordinator for the U.N. mine program in
Iraqi Kurdistan, said no U.N. de-miners in Iraq have been hurt
clearing mines yet. He shakes his head at the village de-miners
like Darwish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire what they do,'' Edwards said. ``It's just bloody
dangerous.''

COMIC DREAM TEAM SUITS UP FOR `MYSTERY MEN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 3 STARS 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ A dream comic ensemble and an almost foolproof
satiric concept gets ``Mystery Men'' through. Sometimes the movie,
about talentless costumed heroes forced by circumstances to quit
dreaming and really fight evil, comes uncomfortably close to
embracing the genre conventions it's supposed to be skewering. But
with a cast of incorrigible smart alecks that includes Ben Stiller,
Janeane Garofalo and Hank Azaria, the action rarely strays far from
Derision City, where it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant idea, based on a strip originated in Flaming
Carrot Comics, is that there are bound to be people who want to
emulate the feats (and cash in on the fame) of real superheroes but
just don't have the chops for it.
</P>
<P>
   For years, apparently, three likable losers _ Mr. Furious
(Stiller), the Shoveler (William H. Macy) and the Blue Raja
(Azaria) _ have grumbled in the shadow of Capt. Amazing (Greg
Kinnear), a crime fighter so genuinely powerful he's neutralized
practically all the villains in his overdesigned metropolis. Of
course, there are good reasons why these lesser lights shine
dimmer: The Raja throws forks at bad guys, Furious just gets real
angry, and the Shoveler, well, shovels.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for them, if not the world, the too-efficient Amazing,
whose uniform boasts more corporate sponsor patches than a NASCAR
driver's, is so concerned that an exploit deficit will be costing
him lucrative endorsement contracts that he engineers the release
of his greatest nemesis from custody. The evil genius Casanova
Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) quickly captures his longtime foe,
leaving the fate of the city up to, well ...
</P>
<P>
   Alarmingly, the Mystery Men aren't the town's worst losers. To
beef up their ranks for the assault on Frankenstein's mansion, they
hold an open-call barbecue. Imposing specimens such as Ballerinaman
answer the call, but eventually the Men get some possibly useful
recruits.
</P>
<P>
   One, Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), an African-American lad who's
been so ignored all his life that he thinks he can actually
disappear, makes for resonant social metaphor. Another, the Bowler
(Garofalo), is refreshingly vengeful only out of obligation. Her
father, the original Bowler, whose skull speaks to her from inside
a mystically powered bowling ball, is the one who wants his killer
punished, after which she intends to return to graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   Smart as these conceits are, it wouldn't be a summer '99 comedy
without a hero like the Spleen (Paul Reubens, wearing lots of
pimples), whose special power is emitted in a variety of
fragrances, including the stealthy but potent SBD.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the movie's humor, fortunately, is sillier than it us
vulgar. The real vulgarity emerges whenever director Kinka Usher, a
veteran of macro-brew and talking Chihuahua commercials, steers the
thing toward the outlandish fight sequences more stolid genre
entries play so tiresomely straight. The idea that these clowns are
somehow real everyguy heroes is exploited with too much sincerity,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   To their great credit, witty costume designer Marilyn Vance and
production designer Kirk M. Petruccelli don't allow anything here
to look cool enough to be taken too seriously. One of the best of
``Mystery Men's'' many great visual gags is a zoom out from the
front of the Shoveler's modest suburban home to reveal a mile-high,
neon-bursting skyline right behind the backyard fence. That would
be considered prime real estate in a ``Batman'' movie, but no one
seeing this would ever want to live there.
</P>
<P>
   It mostly falls to the heroically hilarious actors, though, to
save the movie from succumbing to wicked cliches. From Garofalo's
borderline schizophrenia to Wes Studi's mundane philosophical pep
talks (he plays a clueless mentor inaccurately dubbed the Sphinx)
to Stiller's priceless loss of confidence when he realizes that
there's really nothing super about him at all, the group's sense of
the ridiculous rarely strays off target.
</P>

OUR HOUSES, OURSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've never said these words in this particular order:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do that because I've got to clean the house.''
</P>
<P>
   I've always been proud of that achievement. Since my goal has
been to participate in life at the highest level, I've jumped
aboard the merry-go-round and ridden every horse until I was dizzy.
I have chosen ``yes'' rather than ``no'' at every opportunity and
never let mundane responsibilities stand in my way.
</P>
<P>
   I think that may have been a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   My days have come to resemble a video on MTV; I cut from one
scene to another with no breathing space in between. The result is
that I often arrive exhausted at the end of the day, thinking, Oh,
my God, I didn't get a chance to clear off my desk, straighten out
our bedroom, sort through my piles of paper, or clean off the
counters.
</P>
<P>
   Again!
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, every morning, I wake up with the resolve to get
organized. Every evening I'm puzzled anew by my failure to do so. I
may have planned on using my every free moment to get this house in
some semblance of order, but for another day _ like so many others
_ I somehow didn't manage to find one free moment for housekeeping.
This can go on for weeks. All right, for months. It's got to stop.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the house looks bad. I have a cleaning lady who
keeps the public spaces neat enough so that anyone who drops by has
a place to sit down. It's more that disorganization frazzles my
mind. I'm always looking for things I can't find, starting a new
task on the ruins of an old one, harboring the uneasy feeling that
things are slipping out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The muddles in this house are mirrored in my psychic unease.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor suggests that tension in my neck and shoulders plays
a part in causing my headaches. Some of that tension, I know,
springs from my feeling that there's so much unfinished business at
home that I can never truly relax here. All the hot spots in this
house sink into my brain like little fishhooks as I rush past them
on the way to somewhere else. They tug at my consciousness, they
disturb my rest, they distract me whenever I take time to watch a
video or read a book. They jiggle in my head while I'm trying to
fall asleep, fraying my nerves.
</P>
<P>
   I know if I only had one day, one afternoon, even one hour to
create a more restful environment, I'd feel a lot more peaceful.
I've been waiting for that time to show up on its own for months,
to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   It makes me wonder how I ever managed to write my latest book,
``Family Puzzles.'' I recall a similar struggle to find time to
work on it, until I put it on my calendar. I didn't go out for
lunch, or baby-sit my grandkids, or answer my e-mail on those days
``work on book'' was down in black and white, carrying just as much
weight as any of my other commitments. Perhaps I can solve this
dilemma by taking a pen and writing ``clean house'' here and there
in my schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Oh-oh, it's not that simple. How can I do that when I vowed that
when I got married I'd never become a ``housewife''? When my mother
cleaned up because company was coming, I promised myself I'd never
worry about what other people thought, or be that desperate for
approval. Add to that the Sisyphus factor, the feeling that it's
senseless to commit oneself to a task that can never be completed.
One part of me is convinced that the way to deal with a job that
never ends is to never begin.
</P>
<P>
   I've replaced clearing the decks with wringing my hands.
</P>
<P>
   My house, it seems, has become an extension of myself. As such,
it is worthy of more careful tending. It helps to think of it this
way: My failure to act is cluttering my inner world with a
traumatic accumulation of stuff from my past, preventing me from
being present in the moment. In the end, running away from the
problem isn't an escape; it only makes the problem chronic rather
than acute.
</P>
<P>
   If I commit time to the task of organizing, simplifying, and
paring down, I can change the flow of energy in this house and in
my body. With the help of Jeff Campbell's wonderful book ``Clutter
Control: Putting Your Home on a Diet,'' I know I can soothe myself
by reducing the complexity of everyday living. What better gift
could I give myself?
</P>
<P>
   Here goes. I'm writing down ``C-l-e-a-n h-o-u-s-e.''
</P>
<P>
   Intention and result.
</P>
<P>
   I hope.

HILLARY'S LATEST EXCUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First she blamed it on the malicious rumormongering of a ``vast
right-wing conspiracy.'' If the accusations of rank behavior on her
husband's part ``were proven true,'' Hillary Clinton said, ``I
think that would be a very serious offense. That is not going to be
proven true.''
</P>
<P>
   When that rationalization collapsed, she found a new one. ``I
think a lot of this is prejudice against our state,'' she told a
reporter from the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. ``They wouldn't be
doing this if we were from some other state.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the First Lady offers yet another explanation for Bill
Clinton's scandalous sexual behavior: His mother and grandmother
quarreled when he was a child. From this ``abuse'' grew a powerful
urge to ``please'' women.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so young, barely 4, when he was scarred by abuse,''
Mrs. Clinton told Talk, a new magazine. ``There was terrible
conflict between his mother and grandmother. A psychologist once
told me that for a boy, being in the middle of a conflict between
two women is the worst possible situation. There is always the
desire to please each one.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to read this psycho-twaddle without wincing in
embarrassment for the president's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly why she said it.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary wasn't speaking off the cuff when she served up this
``abuse'' excuse. She was playing her part in a carefully scripted
publicity event, one intended to promote her interests no less than
those of Talk and its celebrity editor, Tina Brown, who has built a
career on her skill at generating excitement and buzz. We may
safely assume that Hillary and her interviewer, Lucinda Franks,
agreed in advance on the subjects to be explored and the questions
to be asked. We may assume this because Franks, who shared a
Pulitzer Prize for reporting 28 years ago and presumably knows
something about how to interview a prominent political figure,
appears to have lobbed only softballs for Hillary to hit.
</P>
<P>
   So if she dwelt on her husband's prurient adventures, it was
because she wanted to. If she finally acknowledged that he had a
history of cheating on her _ something she had previously denied _
it was on purpose. And if she drew attention to the fact that
despite her ``enormous pain, enormous anger,'' she is staying in
her marriage _ well, that was the whole point.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary has learned that the more anguished her private life
seems, the better she does politically. When she is the hard-edged
policy wonk, lecturing Americans on her health-care superscheme,
her favorable poll ratings sink to the 40s. When she is the wronged
but loyal wife, soldiering on despite the humiliating Monica
Lewinsky revelations, her favorables shoot to the high 60s.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to be a senator, but acting senatorial hurts her
chances. In January, when the notion of running for Congress from
New York was first being publicly bruited about, the Marist
Institute polled New Yorkers on a matchup between Hillary and Mayor
Rudy Giuliani. Hillary led by 11 points, 53-42. By April, her lead
was 44-43. By July, when she was conducting her ``listening tour''
of New York, the Marist poll had her down by 6, trailing Giuliani,
47-41. The latest Zogby poll shows her down by 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary is in a Catch-22,'' says Dick Morris, the consultant
who helped engineer many of Bill Clinton's political comebacks, and
himself a New Yorker. ``The more she campaigns in New York, the
more she seems like just another politician hawking her wares. The
more she's here, the less she's welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do? One possibility would be to ignore the polls _
Election Day 2000 is still 15 months away, plenty of time for
public opinion to change. But Hillary Clinton is part of the most
poll-obsessed administration in US history; to ignore survey
numbers is not in her nature. Morris believes the poll data will
persuade her to abandon her Senate run. In the end, maybe they
will. But for now she intends to do what it takes to boost her
numbers back up _ and what it takes is to once again be Hillary the
victim, the long-suffering spouse who won't give up on her husband
despite his rotten ways.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Mrs. Clinton went on ``60 Minutes'' to support her
husband's claim that Gennifer Flowers was lying. ``I'm not ... some
little woman standing by her man like Tammy Wynette,'' Hillary
said. ``I'm sitting here because I love him and I respect him and I
honor ... what we've been through together.'' It was impossible to
know if she really believed Bill Clinton's denial or merely
pretended to believe for the sake of their shared political
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   More than seven years later, she says the same thing.
``Everybody has some dysfunction in their families.... You don't
walk away if you love someone.... I have been with him half my
life, and he is a very, very good man.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gennifer Flowers was not lying in 1992. And her husband is
not ``a very, very good man.'' When it comes to women, he is a
creep. Hillary may find political advantage in being thought of by
New Yorkers as a victim. Let us not forget, however, who Bill
Clinton's real victims were. Paula Jones, who braved ridicule to
tell of being lewdly propositioned in a hotel room. Kathleen
Willey, who described a crude groping in the Oval Office. Juanita
Broaddrick, whose memories of a rape are all too believable.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clinton calls them liars, too. But what they say
about him has the ring of truth. That's more than can be said for
Hillary's latest confection.

PRIVACY LOST AND REGAINED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a story about the way two seemingly innocuous features
of computer technology have combined to violate a lot of people's
privacy. And it's a story of how a cable modem provider nearly made
a huge mistake, but ultimately decided to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year ago, I got a MediaOne cable modem for
my apartment. At the time, MediaOne asked me what I wanted for an
e-mail address. For the past sixteen years I've used the name
``simsong,'' so the folks at MediaOne assigned me the mailbox
``simsong(at)ne.mediaone.net.''
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne also wanted a ``hostname,'' or the name that would be
used to identify my home computer on the Internet. I didn't know
what name I should use, so the person from MediaOne suggested that
I use the name ``simsong.ne.mediaone.net.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what I did.
</P>
<P>
   The second technological feature in this story is called ARP,
the Internet's Address Resolution Protocol. When one computer on a
local area network tries to send a message to another, it uses ARP
to find that computer's address. Unlike other Internet protocols,
ARP messages are broadcast to everyone on your local net. In fact,
there is a popular Unix program called ``arpwatch'' that watches
the network for ARPs and sends an e-mail message whenever it sees a
new computer. The e-mail message includes the person's hostname, IP
address, the precise time that the ARP was seen, and the
manufacturer of the person's Ethernet card.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago I started running the arpwatch program on my
computer that is connected to the MediaOne cable modem. I was
amazed by what I found: within the course of 10 minutes, I had
hostnames of more than 300 different computers on my neighborhood
cable segment. Many of the hostnames were recognizable individuals
_ they were a first name and a last name, or they were a last name
and a first initial. I even recognized a friend of mine who is a
prominent science writer. (He uses a Fast Etherlink XL card in a
Gateway 2000, in case you are interested.)
</P>
<P>
   I left arpwatch running, and over the next week I collected 400
more ARPs. What was particularly interesting about this second
batch is that I could coordinate the time that I saw the hostname
with the time the person turned on his computer. With a little bit
of programming, I could have modified arpwatch to watch all of the
hosts on the network and let me know when they were turned off.
This would let me know, with a high degree of probability, when a
person had left his home for the day and gone to work.
</P>
<P>
   ARPs were pretty innocuous in the university environment in
which the Internet protocols were first developed, but this
information could easily be abused in an urban setting. I could use
this information to target houses for burglary _ just watch for a
house whose cable modem has gone dead for five days, which probably
means the family is on vacation. Or I could call the person up on
the phone and do a pretty good job impersonating a MediaOne
technician. ``Hello, Mr. Smith. I see you are using an Etherlink XL
card in a Gateway 2000. We are running a special deal, in
conjunction with Gateway, for people who pay by credit card. Would
you like to enroll?''
</P>
<P>
   I took my list of 735 MediaOne hostnames, IP addresses, and
Ethernet cards and sent it to Rick Jenkinson, a spokesperson at
MediaOne. I also sent a handful of e-mail messages directly to
people on the list, asking how they felt about the fact that this
information was so easily available. Finally, I asked a bunch of
people from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for their
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the technologists seemed to accept this lack-of-privacy
as an inherent result of the underlying technology. ``I know that I
should be saying something sanctimonious about privacy but frankly
I'm just happy when the network is up,'' responded Philip
Greenspun, a researcher at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science,
who has subscribed to MediaOne for nearly two years. Other people
had similar reactions: they knew nothing was private on cable
modems _ some said I was foolish to have thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one person I contacted sent a complaint to MediaOne
about my contacting him, and included a copy of my e-mail message.
Eight days later, I received a message from Rick Jenkinson, my
MediaOne contact, saying the company ``will be contacting you in
regards to sending unsolicited e-mail as it relates to your
customer service agreement with us.''
</P>
<P>
   I took Jenkinson's message as a veiled threat to stop my
newsgathering activities _ that is, to stop contacting other
customers _ or risk having my cable modem service disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   I hope Jenkinson's e-mail message sets off alarm bells inside
the heads of Massachusetts state regulators. If MediaOne wants to
be the sole cable into our homes, offering television, Internet,
and telephone, it can't make implied threats to people who are
engaged in activities it doesn't like. Regulators certainly
wouldn't tolerate Bell Atlantic sending its Annoyance Call Bureau
after community activists, even if the activists were calling up
every person in the phone book trying to raise money for their
cause. MediaOne needs to realize the responsibility implicit in
being a provider of two-way communications.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I never heard back from MediaOne's complaint
department. Instead, I got an e-mail message on Monday from Rob
Stoddard, MediaOne's vice president of corporate communications.
``MediaOne has changed its policy and will no longer be assigning
host names based on a customer's e-mail address,'' he wrote to me.
Furthermore, he said, any current customers can contact MediaOne to
have their host names changed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the cable modem industry is working on a new
standard, called DOCSIS 1.1, that should eliminate the ARP privacy
problem altogether. The new cable modems screen out ARP messages
that are destined for other subscribers, which makes it a lot
harder to covertly monitor everyone in your network neighborhood.
According to Stoddard, MediaOne will start deploying these new
modems sometime in the coming year.

STUDENT LOANS ENRICHED MIDDLEMAN AT FOUR COLLEGES

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALICE DEMBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- To four small private colleges in Greater Boston, it
was an enticing prospect: Boost enrollment by helping recent
Russian immigrants learn English and keep costs low by contracting
with a local entrepreneur to provide classrooms, deliver students
by the hundreds, and help secure federal and state scholarships to
pay their fees.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last eight years, Fisher, Newbury, Aquinas, and Curry
colleges have established special programs that enrolled nearly
3,000 students. The government paid millions of dollars in
financial aid to the colleges, which funneled a substantial portion
to the middleman, a nonprofit agency called Nefesh.
</P>
<P>
   Now, federal and state authorities, including the FBI, are
investigating Nefesh and the programs amid allegations that many of
the students had too much prior education to be eligible for
scholarships, that some students or program officials falsified aid
applications, that the programs may not have been eligible for aid,
and that Nefesh received head-hunting bonuses in violation of
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Nefesh, the go-between, appears to have collected fees of at
least $2.5 million from just two of the colleges, Newbury and
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, based in the Back Bay, has already agreed to repay the
US Department of Education $2.6 million in Pell grants,
scholarships earmarked for needy students, most of which went to
Russian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Newbury, located in Brookline, has voluntarily returned about
$500,000 in state scholarships, and records show that another $2
million in federal money may be at issue there.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $4 million in state grants to Newbury and Fisher
are being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher acknowledged in a written statement that ``honest errors
may have been made,'' but said the college ``at all times made a
good-faith effort to comply with the letter and the spirit'' of
student aid rules. Officials at Newbury declined comment because of
the pending investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At Aquinas and Curry colleges, officials said they had strictly
adhered to financial aid rules, denying aid to students if there
was any question, despite Nefesh's assurance that nearly all the
students would be eligible. To date, there have been no allegations
of financial aid problems at Curry or Aquinas.
</P>
<P>
   Nefesh officials denied any wrongdoing and said the colleges are
responsible for any problems.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Nefesh, the creation of two rabbis and an
urban planner, prospered until the government moved in.
</P>
<P>
   As Nefesh, a Hebrew word for soul, developed contracts with
colleges, its budget soared from $194,000 to $1.2 million over four
years; so, too, did the salary of its founding executive director,
James Lebowitz. According to records filed with the state, his
salary jumped from $1,890 to $148,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and Newbury officials declined to discuss the program.
But records show Newbury paid Nefesh nearly $1.5 million in an
18-month period in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nefesh received payments from Fisher of as much as $490 per
student each semester, as well as a bonus of $80 per student when
enrollment topped 400, according to a federal review. The report
suggests that Fisher paid Nefesh more than $1 million in all, most
of it drawn from state and federal scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got revenue, but we provided a lot of services,'' said
Lebowitz. ``No one was trying to grab a quick buck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't people getting together to try to engage in any
criminal or fraudulent behavior,'' he said. ``The arrangements were
all fashioned by the . . . colleges and the colleges' lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   But the first approach to the colleges was made in 1991 by
Nefesh's other two founding directors, Rabbi Chaim Zalman Gurkow
and his brother-in-law, Rabbi Avraham Asher Bronstein, two years
before Nefesh was incorporated and Lebowitz took charge.
</P>
<P>
   At Curry College in Milton, academic dean David Fedo said the
rabbis and two New York educators approached the school in 1991
about ``making a buck by Americanizing Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Fedo said they offered references from a similar program at
Molloy College in Rockville Centre, N.Y. ``They said we would be
doing community service and could make some money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Molloy College _ with the help of Jewish community
organizations, including one run by Bronstein's father, Rabbi Zvi
Bronshtein _ was enrolling hundreds of Russian immigrants and
collecting $16 million in federal and state scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview, Bronstein said, ``We thought maybe we
could start such a thing in Boston.'' But he added that his own
role was minimal, and he referred all other questions to Lebowitz
and Gurkow.
</P>
<P>
   Gurkow said that early on they hired a New York agency with
connections to Molloy to run the program here. He said that he
mainly provided outreach to immigrants and that he had no knowledge
of or involvement in the funding or operations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, investigators for New York state and the federal
government found that some students had been recruited to the
Molloy programs with posters advertising a stipend for studying
English. Students allegedly received up to $500 a term as a stipend
while Molloy and the agencies split the rest of the scholarship
money.
</P>
<P>
   In a settlement in 1996, Molloy agreed to repay $2.5 million,
while denying any wrongdoing. None of the organizations that
recruited students or hosted the courses were prosecuted. The
details of the Molloy scheme were reported by New York newspapers
beginning in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fall of 1991, Molloy was effusive about the program,
and Curry decided to set up a small English-language program, in
partnership with the rabbis and the New Yorkers. The college,
however, ended the venture in June 1992 over financial concerns.
Only half the 50 students produced academic records the college
needed to determine if they were eligible for financial aid, Fedo
said, and the college was losing money.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Nefesh's leaders reached out to other colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk University rebuffed the group. ``We felt that there were
some questions as to giving these people Pell grants,'' said
Suffolk vice president Marguerite Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   The Pell grant program is reserved for poor students who do not
have bachelor's degrees. To be eligible, students taking English as
a Second Language, or ESL, classes must be enrolled in a
degree-granting academic program or in a one-year ESL program that
helps them use existing skills to get jobs. Many of the Russians
that Nefesh recruited, part of a wave of immigrants to Boston, were
highly educated, and many were elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Retreating from Suffolk, Nefesh approached Aquinas, a two-year
Catholic women's college in Newton, again citing the agency's
experience with Molloy, another Catholic institution, according to
Sister Marian Batho, who was then president of Aquinas.

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... of Aquinas.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aquinas enrolled about 220 Nefesh students in 1993-94 and paid
Nefesh between $100,000 and $200,000 before deciding the program
``wasn't a good match,'' Sister Batho said.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Batho, who was interviewed by the FBI in January, says
the college rejected about half of student requests for aid,
despite Nefesh's urging ``to push the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nefesh, the rejection by Aquinas had an up side. It pushed
them into a much more lucrative alliance with Fisher College, a
two-year college on Beacon Street in Boston. Fisher eventually
enrolled about 1,500 Nefesh-recruited students before ending the
program abruptly in fall 1996, as federal officials began raising
questions.
</P>
<P>
   At Fisher, as at most of the other colleges, Nefesh supplied the
students and the off-site classrooms and support services, while
Fisher hired faculty. Nefesh's revenues and payroll ballooned.
</P>
<P>
   But the program ran afoul of federal laws and regulations,
according to a review by the US Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   The federal report says Fisher accepted all Nefesh students, but
only charged tuition if they received financial aid. Nefesh's pay
from Fisher was contingent on the amount of financial aid a student
received, the report asserted. For example, if a student got a Pell
award of $1,170 per semester, Fisher got $680 and Nefesh got $490.
If a student got less, Nefesh got less.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, students also appear to have received as much as
$880 a semester for living expenses, while in others they got no
stipend beyond tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Federal reviewers determined that at least $3 million in federal
funds was misspent. After inquiries by the Globe, the state
commissioned a separate audit, still under way, of a $2.5 million
increase in state grants to Fisher during this period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The college's financial arrangement with Nefesh was
specifically prohibited'' because it was tied to financial aid,
according to the federal report.
</P>
<P>
   In written responses to the government, Fisher College has
asserted that its students and programs qualified for aid and that
the payments to Nefesh were reimbursements for Nefesh's costs.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher officials declined to respond to questions from the
Globe, but said they were cooperating fully with authorities. On
July 14, they agreed to repay $2.6 million to the federal
government, while denying any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Newbury College also refused to discuss its involvement, but
released a statement saying that Newbury ran a program for Russian
immigrants, in conjunction with Nefesh, from January 1996 through
December 1997, but halted the program before learning of the
federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Nefesh's Lebowitz said Newbury approached his organization to
set up the program and eventually enrolled about 1,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Newbury College collected $2 million more in
federal scholarship money than in previous years. State records
indicate a $1.6 million jump in Newbury's state scholarship funds,
of which the school has already refunded $512,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lebowitz said Nefesh's second contract with Newbury specifically
absolved Nefesh of any responsibility for financial aid. Lebowitz
also said the government's rules did not apply to Nefesh because it
isn't an educational institution.
</P>
<P>
   However, the FBI has been focusing on Nefesh, and Lebowitz said
the agency last fall subpoenaed Nefesh's files. But, he added,
``I'm 100 percent sure that . . . we're going to be 100 percent
vindicated. No one pocketed that money.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Gurkow wasn't so sure. ``When Nefesh was running . . .
pockets were filling up,'' he said. ``Jamie was drawing quite a
salary.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurkow, who said Lebowitz shut him out of the organization's
decision-making, added that he wasn't aware that Lebowitz's salary
had jumped to nearly $150,000 until the FBI informed him recently.
``I was quite taken aback,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gurkow said he received ``close to $20,000 a year'' to counsel
students until he resigned from the organization in 1996. His name,
however, has continued to appear on official documents. ``If I had
known or had any suspicion of something wrong, I would have pulled
out immediately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lebowitz defended his salary as payment, approved by Gurkow and
Bronstein, for 60-hour work weeks. He also said Nefesh's intentions
were good and the program results were impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lebowitz acknowledged that he had no way to document
it, he said that ``these Russian immigrants have gotten more bang
for their buck from entitlement programs than most.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plenty of students,'' he said, ``went to the program and got
jobs based on their knowledge or pursued education at other
institutions.''

HELPING CHILDREN MOURN A PET 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It has been four years since Matt Prescottano's yellow Lab,
Pups, was hit by a car, but Matt still thinks about her, still
remembers conversations he had with her, and still feels sad,
sometimes even when he's playing with his new dog, Magic, who was
Pups's puppy. He may have been only 8 when she died, but Matt still
remembers how he didn't believe his mother when she gave him the
news and how glad he was that his parents let him see Pups one last
time to say goodbye, even though she was already dead.
</P>
<P>
   His parents remember the day well, too, not just for the loss of
Pups but also for the depth of Matt's sadness.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Edmund, a veterinarian who frequently guides
families through pets' deaths, says it was wrenching to see his son
so distraught. ``As much as you know a pet is important to your
child, you still may not realize just how significant it is,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   What parents also may not realize is that the death of any pet
can be significant, from a goldfish to a gerbil. And while we
typically consider a pet's death a way for children to practice
coping with the death of a person, psychologists urge us to treat
it with respect and ritual for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children of all ages have powerful connections to pets that
sometimes border on magical,'' says veterinarian Myrna Milani,
author of ``Preparing for the Loss of Your Pet'' (Prima Press). How
deeply a child is affected will depend in part on how deep the
connection is, but even when the connection is minimal, we run the
risk of appearing unfeeling and harsh when we throw a dead pet in
the trash or flush fish down the toilet. (Not to mention the havoc
we can wreak on a toddler who is making the connection between
toilets and bodily functions.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If your kids talk to their goldfish like mine do, a death
means more than if the fish are just pretty to look at,'' says
psychologist Genie Ware, a children's grief therapist at the Family
Loss Project in Framingham, Mass. Her family has had six goldfish
funerals, complete with eulogies.
</P>
<P>
   How you help children mourn depends on their stage of cognitive
development. Under 6, for instance, they typically don't grasp that
death is permanent: They expect the pet to reappear. Teens, on the
other hand, are at a developmental stage where they think they are
immortal. ``For them, having a pet die is very difficult,'' says
Milani. ``I bet every vet in the country has a dent in a wall where
a teenage boy put a fist through it from the hopeless, helpless
feeling of being told a pet is dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Children of any age may cry harder and more for a pet than they
did when Grandma or Grandpa died. ``A pet's death is safer for them
to cry about,'' says Ware. ``When Grandpa dies, they're afraid that
if they cry too much, it will make you cry more, which is scary for
them.'' Indeed, a pet's death may stir up a previous loss. Ware
suggests asking, ``I know how sad you are about Fluffy. Are you
thinking about Grandpa, too?''
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, however, that a child is sadder about the
pet than about the grandparent. ``For some children, a pet is a
sibling. They're closer to it than to a relative who is
geographically or emotionally distant,'' Ware says.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as a child is verbal, Ware suggests looking for animal
deaths in nature to get across basic concepts: ``See this dead bug?
Its body doesn't work anymore. It doesn't get hungry or thirsty
anymore. That's what it means to be dead. Once it's dead, it
doesn't come alive again.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the dead skunk in the road isn't just something that
smells bad, it's a learning experience: ``Sometimes animals don't
realize they're wandering onto a road and a driver can't stop in
time. It's sad, but it isn't really the driver's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Tops on Milani's list of how to help children is to think
through a pet's death long before it happens, so that we're
comfortable with what we want to do and why. ``Children have the
hardest time if we're ambivalent,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In one family she knows, parents euthanized an older dog because
it was biting the children, then shifted responsibility to them by
telling people, ``We had to put him down; he was a danger to the
kids.'' More frequently, she sees parents who can't make a decision
put it in the children's hands: ``He's your pet. What do you want
to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Milani is unequivocal. ``This is irresponsible,'' she says. ``It
leaves a child thinking, `If it wasn't for me, Spot would still be
alive.' The decision for euthanasia belongs to adults. Give
children a decision, not a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though talking to our children about ending a pet's life
makes most of us uncomfortable, grief therapist Jen Henry of the
Life Transitions Center in Buffalo recommends honesty. With
toddlers, it's OK to offer a half-truth _ ``Spot died at the
vet's'' _ but for preschoolers she suggests embedding the whole
truth in your family values: `` `In our family, we believe if a pet
is in a lot of pain and the vet can't help anymore, the kindest
thing to do is to end her pain by ending her life.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Donald Wertlieb, director of the Tufts University
Center for Children, offers another explanation: `` `The rules for
pets are different than for people. Pets don't eat at the table or
use the bathroom, and sometimes when we don't have a way to help a
pet get better, the vet has a special medicine that helps her die
in a way that doesn't hurt.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Avoid euphemisms, says Wertlieb: ``Equating death with sleep, as
in `putting the cat to sleep,' is the source of many sleep
disturbances.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry and James Karlson were gently honest with their children,
Mark, 3, and 7-year-old twins Katie and Nicholas, when they learned
last December that Winston, their 10-year-old golden retriever, had
untreatable cancer. ``We pointed out how he wanted to spend all his
time on his dog bed instead of running and playing,'' she says.
That was something they could see.''
</P>
<P>
   When Winston declined faster than they expected, Cherry told the
children that he was very, very sick and in a lot of pain. Because
all three are still in a stage of concrete thinking, their first
question was: ``How can you tell?'' She was able to answer with
equal specificity: ``I spent the night lying next to him, and he
whimpered the whole time because he hurts so much.''
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the vet's, Cherry and James talked about what
would happen, that the doctor would give Winston a shot that would
stop his heart, and then he would be dead. They also gave them the
option of watching. This is a controversial call with children this
young, but Cherry had her reasons. ``I was 17 when my dog was put
down,'' she says. ``I wasn't allowed to be with him and I was
devastated, so I wanted my children to at least have that choice.''
Thankfully, she says, they declined.
</P>
<P>
   Although they didn't have a burial, the Karlsons spent a quiet
family day, looking at photos of Winston and taking their other dog
to Winston's favorite haunts.
</P>
<P>
   Rituals like that are important, says Wertlieb, especially
because they give you a basis to answer questions later on, like,
``Where is Spot?'' ``He's not coming back because his body stopped
working and he died. Remember, we buried him in our backyard and we
planted flowers?''
</P>
<P>
   Most vets and psychologists suggest waiting weeks, if not
months, to replace a pet, even a parakeet:
</P>
<P>
   --Families need time not to repeat past mistakes. When you
replace quickly, you tend to get the same pet, breed, and sex. With
more time to reflect, you may decide that wasn't the best match.
For instance, says Milani, ``Maybe the dog got run over because you
were careless because your lifestyle is too busy.''
</P>
<P>
   --Children need time not to worry. Milani says a common thought
goes something like this: ``If Mom and Dad can replace Spot so
quickly, could they find a new kid, too?''
</P>
<P>
   --They need time to mourn. Quick replacement demeans the
relationship with the previous pet and can make a child feel
disloyal, preventing her from bonding with the new pet.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Prescottano got a puppy very quickly, but only because a
family that had taken one of Pups's pups couldn't keep her. That
took his mind off Pups, but not entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pups was my first dog,'' he says. ``I love this one, but my
first dog was different. She'll always be my most special.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he offers this advice to other kids whose dog dies:
``Make sure everyone at school knows about it. You will have some
very bad days, and it's good if they know why.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --If your children are 10 or older and your pet is aging and
infirm, draw up a living will to decide how far your family is
willing to go if he becomes incapacitated. For instance, who will
wake up with him if it's necessary during the night?
</P>
<P>
   --If a child asks, ``Why did my pet get cancer/get hit by a
car?'' here's a possible answer: ``We don't always understand why
some things happen in life, but there's one thing we know for
certain: You loved Spot and Spot loved you, and we're thankful we
had him in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   --Include children in decision-making about the funeral: ``Where
should we bury him? What kind of service can we have?'' If a burial
isn't possible because the pet is too large or your town forbids
it, have a service.
</P>
<P>
   --Explain cremation to preschoolers very simply: ``The vet has a
special way of disposing of Spot.'' With school-age children, focus
more on the result than on the process: ``Some people bury an
animal, some cremate him in a high-temperature oven and take the
ashes and sprinkle them someplace special, like on his favorite
field. Any ideas where we should do that?''

SMALLER PATIO MEANS LESS MAINTENANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I would like to make a little patio, about 4 by 6 feet, near
my back door. There is simply no more space than 4 by 6 feet. A
basement window is nearby, with a pressure-treated frame on a
concrete sill, within inches of the ground. Do I need to put in a
window well? Rainwater drips from the roof onto the patio 18 to 20
inches from the house.
</P>
<P>
   SHERRIE WEINSTEIN, Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The patio will provide a real tete-a-tete situation for you;
two chairs and a tiny table, with room for a couple of espressos
(espressi?). But that is cool, and even cooler is that you do not
need a window well. You might get a bit of splashing on the window
during rain or from the drip line, but it will be minor. Besides, a
window well will take away some of that vast patio area. Lay down a
bed of brick or any other kind of paver in sand, squeeze in the
furniture and call up a friend for that espresso and tete-a-tete.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the size of the patio is that there is
almost no maintenance. You wil be the envy of your neighbors and
friends with their 24-by-48-foot decks and patios.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. One of the glass panes in my French door broke. How can I
take out the old glass and put in the new?
</P>
<P>
   DAVID CHIN, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It should not be a problem. Most French doors with divided
lights (several individual panes of glass in the door) are glazed
with a wood bead, a flat, plain strip of wood that is inserted
against the glass on one side of door. Simply pry off this wood
bead (there are four, one on each side of the opening), wear heavy
gloves to remove and dispose of the broken glass, clean out the
edges of any dirt or glazing compound, and set in new glass. Before
putting in the glass, line the opening with a thin bead of glazing
compound; this is called bedding putty, and acts as a seal for the
glass as well as a cushion to guard against jarring.
</P>
<P>
   With new glass inserted, nail on the old wood beads. With luck,
you may only have to touch up paint or stain/varnish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have two sets of pocket doors in the 100-year-old house I
just bought. They have been painted, and I would like to strip and
refinish them, but I would like to do that work outdoors. How can I
remove them?
</P>
<P>
   JIM FRECHETTE, Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You should be able to lift them off their tracks. Pull one
out of its pocket so it is completely exposed. You will probably
have to remove some of the trim along the top of the opening, where
the top jamb normally would be, to allow lifting and moving the
door sideways in order for the wheels to clear the track when you
lower it. Do this with a helper; those doors are heavy.
</P>
<P>
   They are also valuable. How valuable is a good question, but
back in 1946, when there was a fire in my parents' house in
Michigan, and one set of oak pocket doors was burned, my mother got
$100 from the insurance company, just for the doors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our new central air conditioning is not cooling quite enough.
I was told to add insulation to the attic floor. There is now one
inch there with old, broken paper. My husband wants to take it out
and start all over again _ put in a separate vapor barrier between
the joists, then add suitable insulation. Would that help keep the
house cooler than it is now? It was also suggested to put more
vents in the attic; there is one vent at each end of the attic now.
</P>
<P>
   CLAUDETTE COTCHIAN, Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Your husband has good instincts and is proposing to do the
right thing, and what he proposes will indeed, make the house
cooler. That old broken paper, full of holes, tears, and cuts, is
no longer a vapor barrier. A vapor barrier is best set directly on
the ceiling below. Then add 12 inches of unbacked fiberglass. If
possible, bring the insulation to the tops of the joists, then add
another 6 inches cross-wise to the joists. The vapor barrier in
conjunction with the insulation will do much better than insulation
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Adding vents to the attic, such as a ridge vent and soffit (the
underpart of the roof overhang) vents, will keep the attic cooler,
further reducing the burden on the a/c.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a full-sized swinging door between my kitchen and
dining room. It swings in both directions, and I can lock it in an
open position. The door swings on pivot hinges, one at the top jamb
and one on the floor. The top bracket is loose and I can't get to
the screws that hold it on. How can I get to the screws? The door
does not easily lift off those pivot hinges.
</P>
<P>
   BOB CLARK, Duxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The ony way you can get to the bracket is to take the door
off, and the ony way to take the door off is to lift it. It may be
hard to lift because the opening for the bottom pivot rod is gunked
up with dirt and oil. Spray a little WD-40 in that section, and
also pry the door up rather than lift it. Put a pry bar under the
door and pry carefully and slowly.

STEAMING UP MOUNT WASHINGTON TO CELEBRATE A CENTENNIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have been atop Mt. Washington in the glistening splendor that
any of the four seasons can bring to its summit. I've also been
there in the midst of lightning storms that sent me scampering to
get below treeline and in the middle of several fierce and howling
winter moments that ended in tragedy for others.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a mountain that has killed more than 200
people in the past century. So it has always seemed an irony to me
that for all the skilled climbing that has gone on there and all
the tragedies that have struck, you can drive a car to its peak, or
take a train there.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen the contrapuntal T-shirts: ``This Car Climbed Mt.
Washington'' and ``This Body Climbed Mt. Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the 138th anniversay of the carriage road up the
mountain _ a carriage road now known as the Mt. Washington Auto
Road _ a twisting, undulating path up the mountain with steep drops
along its edges and a propensity to overheat engines on the way up
and cook brakes on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   This month is also the 100th anniversary of the first ascent of
the mountain by automobile and beginning steam autos will flock to
the mountain and the White Mountain and Great North Woods regions
of New Hampshire to commemorate that first auto climb.
</P>
<P>
   Steam is the auto of choice because it was a steam auto that
wheezed up the mountain on Aug. 31, 1899. And given the nature of
the mountain and what had to have been a far more treacherous road
than what exists today, it is perhaps appropriate that the first
climb was in a rig called a Locomobile.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the Locomobile were Freelan Oscar Stanley and his wife,
Flora, and in wonderful weather they picked their way up the Auto
Road and into history. It is a drive that will be recreated by many
of the more than 80 steam automobiles expected to assemble at the
base of the Auto Road beginning next weekend (Aug. 7-8).
</P>
<P>
   The weekend kicks off seven days of activities, including time
trials on the Auto Road, cookouts, exhibits and steam auto tours
through northern New Hampshire, are sponsored by Maine's Stanley
Museum and the Mt. Washington Summit Road Co.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are coming from Europe, California, and other parts of the
United States, and they include Stanleys, Whites, Locomobiles, a
Doble, a Waltham, and other steamers.
</P>
<P>
   The cars will be on exhibit to the public from 12-4 Sunday and
some may go up the Auto Road that day. On Monday, time trials on
the Auto Road go from 6-9 a.m. and beginning at 10 the road reopens
to the public, whose drivers may find themselves on the road with
steam autos.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the steam celebration, of course, is the Stanley
Steamer, developed by identical twin brothers _ Francis Edgar and
Freelan Oscar Stanley (F. E. and F. O. as they were known) from
Newton. The inventive brothers' steam car had raised a stir at an
1898 exhibition in Cambridge and caught the eye of macadam tycoon
Amzi Lorenzo Barber. The following spring, he bought the Stanley
company and by the summer of 1899 Stanleys had become Locomobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Barber, wanting to prove his cars to be tough and reliable,
looked for a test that would impress the public. He chose the road
up Mt. Washington, 8 miles of what was then among the most
challenging roads in America.
</P>
<P>
   Flora Stanley's account of their climb in Locomobile (NU)93 is
wonderful for its dated writing style, its sometimes understated
tone, and its prescient view of how New Hampshire natives and
Massachusetts tourists would eye each other down the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the twenty-sixth of August, 1899, an unusual expedition
started from Hunnewell Avenue, Newton. . . .'' she wrote. ``Our aim
was a high one since it was Mt. Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   They crossed the Charles River Bridge into Watertown and went
north to Newburyport and then into New Hampshire where, apparently,
little has changed since then. The first obstacle they came to in
the Granite State was a toll booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a toll bridge between Portsmouth and Dover,'' Flora
Stanley wrote, and then explained how the posted tolls included 5
cents for foot passengers and 15 cents for horse and wagon. Two
``rosy-cheeked maidens'' who tended the toll were baffled as to
what to charge for an automobile so they consulted ``Marm,'' who
told the Stanleys that 10 cents was the proper price.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanleys eyed the locals with some sense of superiority and
the locals eyed the rich tourists from Massachusetts with some
suspicion _ as I said, little has changed in New Hampshire since
then.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were a wonder and surprise to the rustic population,
they were a source of amusement to us,'' Flora Stanely wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It took them five days to make the trip from Newton to Mt.
Washington, and the trip up the mountain, after a good night's
rest, was remarkably smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went on and up, up, still up,'' she wrote. ``The continuous
climbing being varied only by a steepness so excessive that as we
looked ahead to it, we felt a sickening anxiety lest each brilliant
dash should be our last . . . our engine, panting and quivering,
never failied us, but pushed us bravely over seemingly impassible
heights.''
</P>
<P>
   The 8-mile climb took 2 hours and 10 minutes, including a stop
for water three-quarters of the way up the mountain. This on a road
that took eight years to build and which horse-drawn stages took
six hours to ascend.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, purists, who wish the road had never been
built, but it was and the Locomobile climbed it and so here we are
today, ready to celebrate that ascent.

 FOR-PROFIT HOSPITALS TIED TO HIGHER HEALTH COSTS
 &HT;    STATISTICS COME UP SHORT ON CHILD-ABUSE DEATHS
 &HT;    HIGH DOSES OF VITAMIN E SHOW HOPE FOR DIABETICS
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX.  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   &UR; For-profit hospitals tied to higher health costs
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When for-profit hospitals dominate a region, total health costs
are higher, researchers at Dartmouth College and the White River
(Vt.) Junction Veteran Affairs Medical Center are reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at total Medicare expenditures around the nation over a
six-year period, the researchers found a clear pattern of higher
total costs in regions with only for-profit hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Total Medicare spending in 1995, for instance, averaged $5,172
per capita in the 208 areas where all hospitals were for-profit. In
the 2,860 regions with only nonprofit institutions, total per
capita spending was $4,440. Mixed areas fell in between. Total
Medicare costs also grew fastest in areas with only for-profit
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   An American Hospital Association official criticized the study
for failing to account for some factors known to drive Medicare
spending, such as regional differences in doctors' practice styles.
But the researchers said they took into account differences in age,
race, geography, HMO enrollment, number of physicians, and other
factors besides for-profit ownership that might have affected
costs. There is no evidence, they said, that for-profit hospitals
provide better care.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all Medicare enrollees had lived in areas served by
not-for-profit hospitals, we estimate that Medicare would have
saved over $5 billion in 1995 alone,'' said Dr. Elaine Silverman,
an author of the study, which appears in the current New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Why might areas with for-profit hospitals have higher spending
for all care, not just hospitalization? ``For outpatient hospital
services and home health care, there are clear financial incentives
to increase utilization, since both types of care have been
reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis with few restrictions,'' the
authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Most for-profit hospitals currently are concentrated in
California and the southeastern states. But Dr. Steffie
Wooldhandler of Cambridge Hospital said for-profit chains may make

<P>
   Official statistics on child-abuse deaths vastly understate the
problem, according to a North Carolina study.
</P>
<P>
   By combing 10 years of records, the North Carolina researchers
discovered that official statistics missed 152 deaths due to child
abuse and correctly identified only 68 _ an underreporting of
almost 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Child abuse accounted for 85 percent of all child homicides in
the state between 1985 and 1994, a period when the rate of
child-abuse fatalities increased 12.3 percent a year. In North
Carolina, homicide among children under 11 years is not attributed
to child abuse unless there is a pattern of battering or other
injury preceding the death.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, found that black children were killed at three
times the rate of whites, most of the probable batterers were men,
and biological parents were to blame for 63 percent of the
child-abuse deaths.

   Vitamin E supplements reduced damage to eyes and kidneys caused

journal Diabetes Care.
</P>
<P>
   After four months on high daily doses of vitamin E _ 1,800
units, or 60 times the recommended daily allowance _ 36 diabetic
patients had significantly increased blood flow to the retina, the
delicate tissue at the back of the eye that registers images.
Kidney function also improved.
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Dr. George L. King and Sven-Erik Bursell, is
the first to demonstrate that vitamin E can normalize blood flow in
the eyes and kidneys of diabetic patients, said Sushil K. Jain in
an accompanying commentary.
</P>
<P>
   The results could have major implications for millions of
diabetics, but Jain said it would be premature to recommend
high-dose vitamin E. Larger and longer trials are needed, involving
both Type I and adult-onset Type II diabetes patients, to see if
vitamin supplements can prevent blindness and kidney failure.

THE MYTHMAKERS BEHIND THE `BLAIR' BUZZ

   It used to be that only films with the word ``Star'' in the
title generated their own off-screen mythology. That all changed
with the Internet, and now obsessive enthusiasts are creating Web
sites to memorialize their favorite films and television shows. But
fans of ``The Blair Witch Project'' have taken the phenomenon a
step further. They will tell you outright that they consider
themselves partly responsible for the online promotion. Who are
they? Why are they doing this?
</P>
<P>
   --Jeff Johnson wants the world to know that he created the first
online fan site last December, when most folks were still focused
on the holiday blockbusters. Johnson, a Cape Cod native who sells
aquatics merchandise in Northern California, became fascinated with
the film after he saw footage on the Independent Film Channel last
summer. ``It sucks you right in,'' says the amateur film director,
whose site is at www0.delphi.com/blairwitch. Many of the other fans
consider Johnson, 33, the ``grandpappy'' of the ``Blair Witch''
bunch; he cheerfully says the fans are ``one big, happy demented
family. I see them as people who want to be involved, like the
proverbial little brother who wants to be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   --Eric Alan Ivins and Abigail Marceluk met in February on the
``Blair Witch'' bulletin board. He's a computer technician, and
she's a film student at Temple University. They started the second
fan site, and after they met in person at the Florida Film Festival
in June, they decided to get married. Ivins says their site (at
http://tbwp.freeservers.com/main.html) gives them ``an online
presence, like a synergy.'' The creepy film hardly inspires
thoughts of cuddling up at the campfire, but you never can tell.
``I met the woman I'm going to spend the rest of my life with
because of this independent film,'' Ivins says. And who said
Internet addicts don't have a life?
</P>
<P>
   --Cecilia Gin's site, called ``The Blair Warner Project'' speaks
for itself. The 27-year old San Francisco consultant made a
connection between ``Blair Witch'' and the well-heeled character in
the television show, ``Facts of Life.'' ``You just do it to be
silly,'' Gin says. The site is at
www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Lounge/3027/Blair.html.
</P>
<P>
   --James Higgins, a computer trainer in New York, had recently
put up a site counting down to his wedding when he heard about
``The Blair Witch Project.'' He thought it would be fun to put up a
countdown to the movie. ``I got a creative charge out of the whole
mythology, and I found myself wanting to make a little contribution
myself,'' Higgins says. His site counted down to the July 30 wide
release opening in days, hours, minutes and seconds. Alas, it's now
obsolete, although the fans are already talking about doing
``promotion'' for the next film by ``Blair Witch'' directors Dan
Myrick and Ed Sanchez, a comedy called ``Heart of Love.'' On the
Internet, the countdown never ceases.

   SENATE _ It has not been an especially good few weeks for
Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan's fledgling bid for U.S. Senate. Reports
out this week show his campaign fund is about $765,000 smaller than
that of his opponent, incumbent Sen. John Ashcroft. And three weeks

   ARMA. World War II was very personal for this tiny southeast
Kansas mining town, even though the fighting was in places many
residents knew little about. The veterans' memorial at the edge of
the city park displays a plaque with the names of 629 young men
from the Arma area who went off to war. For the Varsolona, Kmetz
and Kovacic families, the contribution was extraordinary. Each of
the families sent five sons to the Pacific or Europe. Miraculously,
all 15 men returned safely. Twenty-six young men from Arma weren't
so lucky, and they are being remembered this weekend, Aug. 6-8,
during what Arma residents believe is the nation's oldest annual
celebration of V-J Day (even though V-J Day isn't really until next
weekend). It's a tradition that began in 1946. John Petterson. 27.

`BUREAUCRAT' NOT ALWAYS A FOUR-LETTER WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ Think ``bureaucrat'' and the image that pops
up is that of a robotic motor vehicles minion wrapped tight with
red tape.
</P>
<P>
   Let me introduce you to the antithesis of the stereotypical
bureaucrat, Neil Thomsen, an archives technician at the National
Archives and Records Administration's regional office in San Bruno,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   July 30 was Thomsen's last day in the windowless ``lower bay''
of the federal facility. He retired, at age 56, after 12 years of
work that was, to many Chinese-Americans, heroic. In those dozen
years he helped preserve a significant part of Chinese-American and
Asian-American history.
</P>
<P>
   When Thomsen joined the agency in 1987, the lower bay storeroom
was piled high with cardboard boxes filled with all sorts of
records _ Bureau of Land Management, Navy, Coast Guard, Merchant
Marines, Army Corps of Engineers, National Park Service _ and the
Chinese immigration files from the so-called exclusion era (1882
through the 1940s), files once held by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Records turned over to the Archives have been judged
historically significant and are to be kept for posterity.
</P>
<P>
   His boss told Thomsen and several other workers to start
sorting.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 8 in the morning to 2 in the afternoon, we moved boxes,''
Thomsen said, sitting at his government-issued metal desk the day
before his last. ``It was total chaos down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Thomsen and his colleagues began organizing the files.
</P>
<P>
   Thomsen tackled the Benicia Arsenal records, then the Chinese
immigration files. They had been made permanent after years of
campaigning by the late Paul Chow.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the files was an epiphany for Thomsen, a man who had
known nothing of the Chinese exclusion era despite his master's
degree in history with a specialty in modern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were life stories here. Anyone with feelings has to be
affected by what those stories told,'' he said. ``There was so much
anti-Chinese feelings. There was so much hypocrisy on the part of
government officials toward the Chinese. It was so obvious this was
wrong. Government officials were trying to trick Chinese
immigrants. It was so clear they (officials) felt superior
interviewing inferiors.''
</P>
<P>
   Many files contain detailed interrogations of immigrants by
federal immigration inspectors, whose job it was to enforce the
Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. In his 12 years, Thomsen figures he
has read 150,000 of the 250,000 Chinese files in San Bruno. It
wasn't just laborious paperwork. Chinese-Americans began visiting
the archives, seeking a paper trail to the tangled, secretive, and
frequently fraudulent immigration history of their forbears.
Thomsen went to extraordinary lengths to find a family's file,
something an ordinary bureaucrat would not do.
</P>
<P>
   In his typically modest way, Thomsen said, ``I don't think what
I did was extraordinary. I feel I have had a little bit of a
similar experience as those Chinese immigrants. I've seen things in
my lifetime; I've been beaten down so many times that I have
developed an empathy for victims of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``I admire dignity in human beings. I admire the
dignity of the people in those (Chinese) files. They conducted
themselves with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   So when their family members went to the San Bruno archives with
barely a clue, Thomsen helped them connect with their murky past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very conscious to treat them properly,'' he said. It is
good to know that a bureaucrat earning $30,000 a year can be as
caring as Neil Thomsen.

`WITCH' CRAFT BREWS ON THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mayor of Burkittsville, Md., is having trouble sleeping
these days _ and she hasn't even seen ``The Blair Witch Project,''
the horror film allegedly set in her quiet, one-street town,
population 200. Strangers are converging on the cemetery; the town
sign disappeared; and county police have increased security. It's
all Mayor Joyce Brown can do to keep up with the constant queries:
Is it true? Is the movie true?
</P>
<P>
   For the record, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with it day by day,'' says Brown. ``This is a
Christian community, and we're praying that it all goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly likely. The hype surrounding ``Blair Witch,'' a
film made for $30,000 with a couple of hand-held cameras, has been
building on the Internet for more than a year, long before Mayor
Brown became a celebrity and long before the film shattered box
office records when it opened on 27 screens two weeks ago. The mock
documentary about three film students who disappear in the woods
outside Burkittsville doesn't have any stars, special effects, sex,
or stupid bathroom tricks. But the story itself does have all the
elements that create a sensation on line: a carefully crafted
mythology, a conspiracy theory, and an interactive Web site. There
are more than 30 fan sites, and the official Web site receives 2
million hits a day, with a total of 40 million hits to date.
</P>
<P>
   And now that the film has opened on 1,000 screens nationwide,
the story behind the phenomenon has become the stuff of legend in
its own right, generating its own mythology and its own set of
nagging questions. The film is a landmark in movie marketing, the
first sensation created almost exclusively on line. But how much of
the word of mouth was spread by genuine fans and how much was
fabricated by pals of the filmmakers? And what are the long-term
implications for the movie-industry marketing machinery?
</P>
<P>
   ``People are scrutinizing our movie not on the merits of the
film, but on whether we are moral dudes or not,'' says Dan Myrick,
the Florida filmmaker who codirected ``Blair Witch'' with partner
Eduardo Sanchez. ``It's not like we said, `Hey man, put up a fan
site, and we'll put you on the payroll; you'll be fan number 532.'
We had no money. We encourage the fans, and we love it when it
happens, but even now, we know the hype is out of control. It's
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's no doubt that it's becoming a common practice in
Hollywood for studio flacks to ``leak'' gushing advance reviews to
amateur on-line film forums or to create fake fan sites. ``Plants
are all over the Internet,'' says one studio executive. ``Paramount
did it for `Titanic.' I can't tell you how many times I went into a
chat room and saw `Oh my God, I love Leo DiCaprio,' and it smacked
of a publicist.''
</P>
<P>
   But to this day, the ``Blair Witch'' creators and their
distributors at Artisan swear they didn't fabricate the hype. Yes,
they walked the fine line between fiction and reality, but that's
the whole point of the film, which is designed to be so realistic
it makes the muscles on the back of your neck constrict. And while
the Artisan marketing campaign (which cost under $2 million
initially for print, Internet, and on-campus efforts, and didn't
include television or radio advertising until this week) is
ingenious and offbeat, the filmmakers themselves didn't even know
the basics of marketing when they set out to film the scariest
campfire story of all time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But ever since its early days, the film has created a furious
debate, with some folks questioning the integrity of the makers and
suggesting that their production company, Haxan Films, ought to be
called ``hacks-in-films.'' It all began in the summer of 1997, when
preliminary footage aired on Split Screen, a show produced by John
Pierson on the Independent Film Channel. A second tape was aired in
April 1998, and Pierson played along with the game, telling viewers
he wasn't sure whether the story was fact or fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The Split Screen bulletin board (www.grainypictures.com) was
flooded with queries, some accusing Pierson of being unethical.
``There were so many obvious clues that it was fiction, and maybe
we were just encouraging people to indulge their most paranoid,
wanna-believe inclinations,'' Pierson says.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, the filmmakers set up their own Web site,
www.haxan.com. In the first few days, friends of the filmmakers
traded barbs: Sanchez's sister wrote, ``My brother is scary!!!''
But then outsiders found their way to the site. One of them was
Jeff Johnson, an aquatics merchandiser in Northern California. He
says he scoured the Net for information about the Blair witch
legend, checking out crime sites and government records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most startling thing I had ever seen, and I wanted
more information,'' says Johnson. He became a regular site visitor,
particularly when the filmmakers posted segments from the alleged
diary of one of the ``missing'' students. Johnson didn't care when
the filmmakers finally fessed up and admitted the story wasn't
true. ``I thought the concept was brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were less than thrilled, especially when phony messages
from the nonexistent Blair County Historical Society started
appearing on the site. (Myrick says he doesn't know who posted
those messages, even though some fans suspect Haxan staffers.) The
loyal fans conducted flame wars with the furious skeptics, and
Johnson became such a champion he might as well have been on the
Haxan payroll, even if they didn't have any money at the time. Last
October, he initiated a discussion of the film on the ``Mark and
Brian Show,'' a syndicated radio show in Los Angeles that is
listened to by industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
   After that, there was no stopping the on-line buzz.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the story plays like a film industry fairy tale: The
unknown filmmakers got accepted to the prestigious Sundance Film
Festival, where ``Blair Witch'' was purchased by Artisan for $1
million. Artisan launched a nontraditional marketing campaign,
sending teams of paid interns to college campuses to generate buzz.
``We wanted to create a cult event,'' says Paul Campbell, Artisan's
director of field operations.
</P>
<P>
   Artisan also targeted the youth market on the Internet. The
official Web site, www.blairwitch.com, doesn't offer a shred of
evidence that the film isn't true.
</P>
<P>
   And Artisan released the trailer to Ain't-It-Cool-News, the
controversial fan site that many in the industry say is rampant
with studio plants.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the original fans aren't thrilled with Artisan's
``guerrilla marketing'' tactics; they criticize the distributor for
continuing the myth on its Web site without a disclaimer and for
refusing to let the actors be interviewed when the movie was first
released. ``It's not right to hamper the careers of your stars,''
says fan Eric Alan Ivins.
</P>
<P>
   Ivins himself was recently accused of being a shill for the film
in the on-line magazine Salon. He and his fiancee, Abbie Marceluk,
met on the Haxan bulletin board; they later appeared in the
television documentary ``The Curse of the Blair Witch,'' leaving
the impression that they were in cahoots with the directors. ``It
cracks me up that people think we're studio shills,'' says Ivins.
``Our Web site goes against Artisan's marketing and says the film
isn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real-life controversy only adds to the film's mystique.
``Just dangle a conspiracy theory on the Net, and people will gnaw
on it like a dog on a bone,'' says Gordon Paddison, director of
on-line marketing for New Line Cinema. ``That plays well to an
on-line demographic.''
</P>
<P>
   What doesn't play well is deliberate on-line meddling by
studios. The line between promotion and genuine buzz is getting
blurrier and blurrier. But the ``Blair Witch'' case is unique: You
can't fake the kind of enthusiasm that gets people standing in line
to see a film that's going to scare them to death and, in some
cases, make them sick to their stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   And the directors now realize that hype can be a mixed blessing.
``Ed and I are nervous about too many people talking about it and
expecting too much,'' Myrick says. ``Just chill out. It's a small
movie. It's not going to change your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you're the mayor of Burkittsville. ``We're
waiting to see what the impact really is after it goes out to more
theaters,'' says Brown. She, however, is one of the few people who
won't be checking out the Web site or lining up at the local cinema
this weekend. The mayor of Burkittsville, it turns out, doesn't
have Internet access, and she doesn't like horror films.

CAPITALISM, IDEALISM KNOCK HEADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every once in a while, high-tech idealism collides with
fast-buck capitalism and sparks fly across the on-line world.
</P>
<P>
   But those cases are rarely distilled to such a pure culture
clash like the one playing out this week, as the hot initial public
stock offering of Red Hat Software Inc. comes closer to market. You
probably won't be shocked to discover the Web discourse maintains a
certain hyperbolic standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created the revolution,'' writes C. Scott Ananian, a
graduate student enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's laboratory for computer science. ``We want
recognition. Is that too much to ask?''
</P>
<P>
   Ananian, whose comments appeared last week in the on-line
publication Salon, is hardly alone, and by no means the most
animated person to inject himself into the debate.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of many software code writers who were invited to buy
Red Hat IPO shares, unsolicited recogition of high-minded nerd work
(they would prefer the term ``hacking'') performed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat, which is expected to raise about $60 million by selling
9 percent of the company in its IPO, apparently intended the
special offer as a goodwill gesture to hackers who almost uniformly
cheer for the company.
</P>
<P>
   But the rare ground-level access to a brand-new stock was cut
off in many cases by, of all things, an Internet brokerage, ETrade
Securities. An undetermined number of hackers who helped build an
egalitarian software alternative to the world's most powerful
technology company were told they failed to meet financial
suitability standards.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat is in the odd business of selling something that is
available for free and was invented with the idea of being a
distinctly noncommercial product.
</P>
<P>
   It sells open source software, including a version of the Linux
operating system, that has been written and refined over time by
many different individual contributors like Ananian. Customers buy
a copy of Linux from the likes of Red Hat for reasons of
convenience, technical support, and the attraction to added bells
and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is hot stuff because it is an alternative to Microsoft
Corp.'s Windows computer operating system. Put all the Linux users
together and they are just a speck in an ocean of Windows, but the
operating system poses a real ideological challenge to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The software ``kernel'' that makes Linux work was developed by
Linus Torvalds in Helsinki eight years ago, but much of the
operating system's code comes from the GNU Project championed by
Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation in Cambridge,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   We rang up Stallman this week to ask him about the Red Hat IPO.
He didn't know anything about it and made it clear to us he didn't
much care.
</P>
<P>
   But many others did. They lined up for a small slice of the pie
and opened ETrade accounts, which was a requirement to buy IPO
shares.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, 20 percent of the hackers were rejected from
the ``friends and family'' portion of Red Hat's IPO. ETrade did not
return our calls and Red Hat only called back to say it wasn't
talking.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers who make recommendations to investors must screen their
clientele for suitability according to rules set by the National
Association of Securities Dealers.
</P>
<P>
   On-line brokers usually don't have to worry about suitability
because they don't make recommendations of any kind. But as an
underwriter of an IPO, even an on-line broker is considered to be
making an implicit recommendation, according to people familiar
with the NASD rules.
</P>
<P>
   The financial demographics of the typical open-software hacker
don't necessarily match up well with a highly speculative
investment, which a software IPO is considered.
</P>
<P>
   The hackers howled on Web sites like slashdot, and many insisted
they were turned down by ETrade despite form respones that
suggested wealth and sophistication. On-line coverage from Salon,
Wired, CNet and other sites quickly followed.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted the oddest twist of all last week. ETrade sent
another e-mail message to hackers who had been turned down for the
Red Hat offer, commiserating with their frustration but skipping
over the bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The message also contained a possible solution: maybe IPO
candidates made a mistake when they sent back their forms and would
like to refile new financial information about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our specially-appointed customer service associates
will be happy to assist you in updating your profile,'' ETrade
wrote in the note we saw.
</P>
<P>
   And as anyone will tell you, mistakes can happen.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, come on! $420 is nothing to you. Besides, it's been well
over a year since I last freshened up my home computer, and last
time I paid for it myself. Since then, a whole new generation of
hot hardware has come to market. It's your turn.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I got your money's worth _ a nice, hot processor chip,
a new motherboard to run it, and one of the best 3D graphics
accelerator cards on the market. And since I slapped it all
together myself, and recycled a lot of old gear, think of how much
I saved the Globe on parts and labor. It would have cost you
hundreds more to buy me a box like the one that now sits humming
under my desk at home.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the processor. Just like last year, it boiled down to
a stark choice. Either I could go with another K6 processor from
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., or fall back on old reliable Intel
Corp. and shell out for a Pentium II. Or Pentium III. Or even a
cut-rate Celeron. First-generation Celerons were real mutts; the
current breed are greyhounds, not much slower than the PII chips.
</P>
<P>
   Rival AMD has spent the past year tripping over its own silicon,
losing money even as it gained market share. Its big problem _ an
inability to make enough of its best chips. And while AMD's elite
chips are cheaper than Intel's, and nearly as fast, they're still
not quite as good.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's big falldown is its ``floating-point'' performance.
Floating-point math is the kind kids hate, in which all the numbers
have decimal points. But it's the kind of math that's vital in
computer graphics, and AMD chips have always tended to be second
best in that department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in my determination to save money for the Globe, I went
with AMD. I picked the K6-3 chip with a speed of 400 MHz for $180 _
quite enough power for journalism, right?
</P>
<P>
   Next, a new motherboard. You asked why I didn't save money by
just putting the new processor in the old board? Not that simple.
My previous chip, an older AMD K6, was designed for an older
motherboard with a speed of 66 MHz. Today's new AMD and Intel
processors need a faster connection to the computer's memory to
deliver top performance. The K6-3 will work only with a 100-MHz
motherboard, so of course I had to buy one for $100. Just be
thankful that I paid extra last year for PC-100 memory chips, which
I can reuse because they're compatible with the faster motherboard.
See? I'm still saving you money.
</P>
<P>
   As for your ``what's a Voodoo 3?'' question _ don't you read the
Globe? I just wrote about graphic accelerator cards a few weeks
ago, and the Voodoo 3 2000 from 3Dfx Corp. is one of the best. It's
got a superfast chip devoted to drawing pretty pictures on the
monitor, served by its own private 16-megabyte memory bank and
connected to the motherboard through an Accelerated Graphics Port
custom-designed for superior video performance. It's just the thing
when you're doing lots of . . .
</P>
<P>
   News articles? E-mails? Well, to tell the truth, the Voodoo is
no better for that kind of work than my old Diamond Multimedia
card. Any decent video card can handle such two-dimensional
software. I must admit the Voodoo 3 is there for just one reason _
3-D games. With a Voodoo under the hood, my home box now renders
the latest software shoot'em-ups with extraordinary clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Globe hired me to play word games, not
Mechwarrior 3. So let's compromise. I'll pick up the $130 Voodoo
tab; you cover the rest. That knocks your end down to $290. I'm
still looking out for you.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I saved you hundreds of dollars by keeping my old
hard drives, instead of plumping for one of those hot Ultra DMA/66
drives that move data twice as fast. That would have run around
$250 for the drive and a special controller card. I also kept my
archaic sound card instead of grabbing one of the new ones with 3-D
sound _ another $100 saved. I didn't even get that CD-ROM recorder
I've had my eye on, even though good ones can now be had for around
$200. And why? Because I worry about you. Besides, I'm sure they'll
be making even nicer ones the next time I upgrade.

HAS IMUS LOST HIS EDGE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Imus is trying to make fun of Monday's Talk magazine party,
a gathering of Hollywood and New York swells to celebrate the
launch of Tina Brown's chronicle of contemporary culture.
</P>
<P>
   A bastion of the elitist establishment, Talk magazine is
everything talk radio is supposed to hate. But Imus _ who is
leaving his longtime Boston base at WEEI-AM -- can't feign much
distaste. Even as he groans, ``Geez . . . 30 years in New York, and
I've never been to one of those things,'' he chats up a Talk
reveler, White House aide turned kiss-and-tell pundit George
Stephanopoulos. Here, even the veneer of disdain for Tina's big
bash vanishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens when you get the invitation?'' Imus asks
Stephanopoulous earnestly. ``What's the process?''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Imus is the prototypical Talk partygoer. The
one-time wild-man-turned-syndicated-radio-talkmaster now hosts an
endless salon for political and media bigfeet from Arizona's
Senator John McCain to CNN's Jeff Greenfield. Whether appearing on
``Larry King Live'' or the cover of Newsweek, he is a mainstream
media darling. In the past year, he has shown up 162 times in the
Hotline political newsletter, a repository of Beltway bloviation
designed for an audience that is ``90 percent Washington power
elites,'' according to Hotline editor Craig Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   At 59, and syndicated on 92 stations, Imus may finally be a
victim of his own success. Not only is his insider shmoozefest at
odds with the mood of a country turning away from Washington, it is
out of touch with talk radio _ an angry, populist, anti-mainstream
medium. Add in his preoccupation with his young son, his brother's
business ventures and even his charitable efforts on behalf of sick
children, and some believe Imus has evolved from unpredictable
shockjock into a self-obsessed member of the media elite. (Calls to
the Imus program were not returned.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not outrageous. He's the establishment,'' says cultural
critic Steven Stark, who characterizes Imus's show as `` `This Week
with David Brinkley' with a different host. It's antithetical to
what he was originally about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just totally lost his edge, he's very passive on the
air,'' says Jason Wolfe, program director at WEEI, who points to
Imus's sagging ratings. (According to an industry source, later
this month Imus will move to Greater Boston Radio's smooth jazz
station WSJZ, not its WBOS-FM outlet.)
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you believe, Imus was either dumped from his
morning drive slot at WEEI or he jumped ship for a better deal.
``The person who said he lost his fastball is the person that lost
the negotiation,'' responds Joel Hollander, president and CEO of
Westwood One, which syndicates Imus's show. ``He has been doing the
same show for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollander is not alone in being bullish on the I-man. ``He is
bigger than he's ever been,'' insists Michael Harrison, publisher
of Talkers Magazine. ``Imus has always proven to be smart enough to
stay on the cutting edge.'' More common, however, is the reaction
from this radio executive when asked about Imus's ratings: ``I
guess what's really important is the quality of the audience and
Imus reaches far and away the most upscale audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Imus does bring a high-end listener to advertisers, but he does
not bring a lot of listeners to advertisers. At WEEI, his ratings
in the crucial 25-54-year-old male demographic put him in fifth
place among morning shows in the market. But he hosted the
station's lowest-ranked show and Howard Stern's WBCN-FM morning
program is clobbering him.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Imus's pull among men 25-54 puts him in the bottom
third of that market. Brian Wilson, the program director at Imus's
outlet in Kansas City says, ``from a sales standpoint, they've been
pretty content with it. From a ratings standpoint, we wish it was
doing better.'' At KHTK-AM in Sacramento, Imus is seventh among men
25-54. ``Compared to the rest of the day, he is our lowest-rated
day part,'' says program director Mike Remy.
</P>
<P>
   A recent story in The Washington Post, noting that Imus was tied
for 15th place among men 25-54 in that market, said those numbers
``suggest that his Washington audience consists essentially of the
people who appear on his show and the people they bump into on the
Hill or at Georgetown parties.''
</P>
<P>
   And at WISN-AM in Milwaukee, which dropped Imus last year,
program director Jerry Bott says, ``the true problem is this show
massively underperformed the rest of the radio station. The show
can be brilliant. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it is massively
undisciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   In radio-speak, ``undisicplined'' means the Imus show is too
much about Imus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks about what he wants to talk about,'' says Wolfe. ``He
talks about what makes him comfortable. He talks about his ranch
all the time and his family all the time.'' And though eminently
laudable, the New Mexico ranch that Imus is building for sick
children is a symbol of his growing willingness to foist his own
interests on the public _ whether it be his brother Fred selling
salsa or his favorite charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ranch was such a dominant topic in the program that I
began to get calls from faithful Imus listeners (saying) `just get
him to talk about anything else,' '' says Bott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are two problems with his program,'' says
longtime WBZ-AM talkhost David Brudnoy in Boston. ``The endless
nonsense with Fred and the salsa crap (and) the interviews with a
very select cast of characters.''
</P>
<P>
   That select cast of characters has made Imus very popular with
Hotline editor Crawford. ``The guests he has on tend to be what we
call `Hotline' people,'' he says. But too much hobnobbing with
``Hotline people'' may make Imus a duller boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the basic difference,'' acknowledges Crawford. ``He's
not as dangerous as he once was.''

 &HT;    Wildlife, starry nights keep Down Under dudes hopping
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, August 8.
 &HT;    By Helen Holzer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELBOW VALLEY, Australia _ It's a good thing we're not serious
golfers, because the kangaroos think they own the links at
Cherrabah Homestead Resort in Queensland. Kangaroos by the hundreds
live at the Australian outback resort, and some will even hop up to
you and eat out of your hand.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the kangaroos and the brightly plumed wild parrots,
Cherrabah could be any dude ranch in the Western United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled in the great dividing ranges of central eastern
Australia, and about a three-hour drive from Brisbane, Cherrabah's
seclusion and mountain views provide a welcome respite.
</P>
<P>
   Its lodge sits at an elevation of 2,832 feet, and its 52 cabins
boast seasonal rates of $57 to $70 daily per person, quite a
savings off pricey American dude ranches.
</P>
<P>
   Horseback riding, tennis, golf and three hearty meals a day are
included in that price. Liquor and soft drinks are extra, however.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the 5,000-acre resort fans out into lushly forested
bush country and into higher elevations overlooking a broad valley.
</P>
<P>
   At night, the ranch, far from city lights, provides magnificent
stargazing. Within minutes, we saw a shooting star and caught our
first sight of the Southern Cross.
</P>
<P>
   A naturalist's dream, Cherrabah is home to two types of
eucalyptus. However, three types are necessary for a koala's diet,
so we didn't get to see any of them in their natural habitat. We
did see some wonderfully shady coolabah trees and fig trees, and
there's even supposed to be something called a ``bush lawyer
tree,'' but no one could point one out to us. We could only imagine
what a bush lawyer would look like.
</P>
<P>
   Animal life abounds with kangaroos and wallabies, rabbits and
tropical birds of all colors, and at least one red-bellied black
snake, known to be poisonous but shy _ and also a vigilant guard
over the gate we needed to pass on our trail rides.
</P>
<P>
   Cherrabah's stables cater to all ages and equestrian levels. A
snapshot in the horse barn pictures a spry 93-year-old who mounted
her first horse here in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   One of our horseback rides took us past Balancing Rock, two
heavy boulders perched precariously on a hill overlooking the
ranch. A photo in Cherrabah's lodge of the same boulders in the
1930s shows a couple standing next to a small tree growing between
the two rocks. Today that tree dwarfs the boulders and stands about
50 feet tall, while the rocks do not appear to have moved an inch.
</P>
<P>
   We also rode to the base of a black granite overlook, where we
had to ``park'' our horses and walk. Near the top, mounted into the
rock, is a bronze plaque dedicated to a climber who loved the view
so much he had his ashes strewn over the spot.
</P>
<P>
   For those not adventurous enough to ride one of the ranch's 40
horses, Cherrabah provides motorized tractor train rides around its
property.
</P>
<P>
   Cherrabah's lodge houses a stage and dance floor, two dining
rooms, a game room with ping-pong and billiards, a video room
loaded with movies and a mechanical bull. There are also a
children's program, dance lessons and entertainment. Outside are a
swimming pool, tennis courts, a petting zoo and a pond for
canoeing.
</P>
<P>
   A big difference between Cherrabah and many American dude
ranches is the made-to-order food.
</P>
<P>
   For lunch and dinner we had our choice of fish, beefsteak, pork,
veal or chicken, either grilled or prepared in French or Asian
style, plus salads, soups, vegetable specials and desserts.
</P>
<P>
   Hearty breakfasts consist of eggs, sausage, bacon, baked beans,
cereals, yogurt and toast with jelly or Vegemite toppings. For the
uninitiated, beware of Vegemite, Australia's answer to peanut
butter, because its strong flavor packs a punch.
</P>
<P>
   The wine list offers such local favorites as Seppelts Muroomba
Moselle and Wynnes Coonawarra Riesling, or you can try Australia's
own beers, Fosters, Tooheys and XXXX Gold.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 minutes from the ranch, near the town of Killarney, is
the most famous local attraction, Queen Mary Falls. After driving a
winding mountain road, visitors park and walk through a rain forest
overgrown with orchids and huge ferns. Suddenly you hear chattering
parrots and the gush of water ahead. A wide gorge unexpectedly
appears, and the falls tumble dramatically 130 feet between black
granite cliffs to lookout areas below.
</P>
<P>
   Another local attraction is the lodge's nightly entertainment,
provided by singer (and golf course maintenance expert) Russell
Vitnell, who says he once sang backup for Roy Orbison on an
Australian tour. Vitnell encouraged the audience to close its eyes
and imagine Orbison's voice. Then he revved up his backup tape and
tore into an amazingly accurate rendition of ``Pretty Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Stable manager Sharon Lowthian said the ranch is so large that
she's ridden for hours at a time on horseback and never cleared its
5,000 acres. Cherrabah was a sheep ranch before becoming a guest
ranch in the 1970s, and Lowthian has heard of one old-time shepherd
who spent much of his life trying to find buried treasure hidden
somewhere at the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that in the late 1800s a bushman (highwayman)
named Thunderbolt stole a fortune in Ipswitch, near Brisbane, and
escaped as far as Cherrabah, where he buried the loot before he was
captured and hanged.
</P>
<P>
   As for how Cherrabah got its name, Lowthian suggested that
besides being a sheep ranch, Cherrabah was also once a cherry
orchard. If you combine cherry with a sheep's ``bah'' in an
Australian accent, you get Cherrabah.
</P>
<P>
   Merv Yeoland, Cherrabah's resident manager, laughed at that,
allowing that no one knows where the name originated.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said with a twinkle in his eye, ``it's as good a
story as any, ain't it?''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: For departures through Aug. 31, United, Qantas
and Air New Zealand fly to Brisbane (via Los Angeles and Sydney)

Times Syndicate is offering six excerpts from the book ``Unholy
Wars,'' by John K. Cooley. A veteran foreign correspondent for
ABC-TV News, Cooley has written widely on the Middle East and North
Africa. In 1996 he won the George Polk Memorial Award for more than
40 years of global coverage. He is the author of five other books

IDLE THREATS COULD BRING KOREAN DISASTER The noise level about
North Korea is rising ominously again. The focus now is on whether
or not Pyongyang proceeds with another test of its new long-range
three stage missile. Top U.S. officials, including Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Defence Secretary William Cohen, have
warned of ``serious consequences'' if it does. The crucial dates
are, apparently August 15 - V-J day of World War II - on which
Korea's independence is celebrated, and September 6, birthdate of
the late Kim Il-Sung and also a big holiday which North Korea likes
to mark with something spectacular. By Flora Lewis. 800 words.

MAY NEVER HAVE THE 'TRUTH' ABOUT BREAST CANCER Women with breast
cancer, or who are at high risk of developing it, consider the drug
tamoxifen to be a lifesaver. The drug is able to counter the
cancer-promoting effects of the hormone estrogen, which has been
shown to aid the growth of about half of breast cancers. But a new
study has shown how tamoxifen can reverse its colours and stimulate
the growth of cancer cells after two to five years of use. What is
going on is yet another example of the fact that medicine and
science are a work in progress. By Susan Love. New York Times

   TOKYO _ Every few seconds, wood met bone.
</P>
<P>
   Three thin layers of cotton were all that was separating my
shoulder _ and most of the shoulders of those tightly sandwiched
around me _ from a heavy wooden Japanese shrine that we were
carrying on the second day of the annual Sanja Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Not much padding, considering that the multi-
</P>
<P>
   tiered, multicolored, house-shaped shrine weighed hundreds of
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I was having a spectacularly good time trying to move
compatibly with the 30 or so similarly costumed porters of this
mikoshi as we paraded slowly around the Asakusa district, chanting
all the way.
</P>
<P>
   The light rain had stopped, and night had fallen. Spectators
lined the narrow steets, some chanting and following the shrine,
others watching from balconies.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiastic parade, full of history and culture, seemed
like something out of a film, and it made me marvel even more that
I was here.
</P>
<P>
   Not in Tokyo _ I had planned that meticulously. This was my
third trip to Japan, where I've traveled since the late '70s to
satisfy my decades-long curiosity about a culture so different from
ours. In fact, I had selected mid-May for my trip to coincide with
the festival, intending to watch at least one day of the three-day
event. But participating in this procession? That was completely
unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 minutes earlier on an overcast Saturday afternoon, I
had met the Sakurai family, a meeting I'd ``applied'' for the day
before at the Japan National Tourist Organization. Any tourist can
participate in the Home Visit System, in which more than 1,000
English-speaking families in 14 cities around Japan open their
homes to foreigners. You just fill out a simple form at the JNTO
office and the office staff makes the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour of my application, two visits (a single visit is
the norm) with the Sakurai family had been organized. My hope was
that meeting a family one-on-one would give me a better
understanding of their everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea it would turn into so much more.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I arrived at the family's multipurpose three-room
apartment with a galley kitchen (shoes off at the lower landing, of
course), a party was going on. That was pretty clear in any
language.
</P>
<P>
   I was introduced to a roomful of their Japanese and Western
friends and family, many dressed in traditional costume for the
festival. On the table were plates of food, including a large pot
of fish stew, a curry dish, vegetables and three types of rice. I
was encouraged to eat and immediately felt welcome, with other
guests bringing me into the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   It was getting close to 6 p.m., the appointed time for us to
watch the festival, in which up to 100 portable shrines are paraded
through the working-class neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   At least I thought we were going to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Mieko Sakurai, our hostess, said it was time for me to change my
clothes, indicating that I wasn't going to be standing on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not serious,'' I said to her, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   But she was.
</P>
<P>
   Mieko and one of her guests helped me put on a blue-and-white
patterned blouse, on top of which went a denim work vest with front
pocket that I was tied into, on top of which went a matsuri-hanten,
a special short coat for festivals with a symbol or crest on the
back that indicates the community group. I pulled on form-fitting
three-quarter-length denim pants, which I was also tied into. After
the addition of a hachimaki (headband) and dark blue tabi (foot
coverings), I was pronounced ready.
</P>
<P>
   And that is how I came to find myself a part of the shrine team
in the festival that celebrates nature and includes prayers for a
good harvest.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours, we carried or followed ``our'' intricately gilded
shrine around the streets. I lasted less than a half-hour with the
shrine on my right shoulder. And I confess that I hadn't quite
gotten the bouncy, rhythmic movement down correctly. So I stepped
out of line and another porter quickly took my place. My shoulder
was sore for a week.
</P>
<P>
   When a new group of carriers stepped in en masse, a patterned
clap (three sets of three and a single clap) signaled the change.
The same pattern, called ippon-jime, was done when we passed a
permanent shrine and when the portable mikoshi arrived at its
resting place for the night. (The clap's purpose is to summon the
gods and focus one's mind.)
</P>
<P>
   When we finished, soft drinks, beer and a sealed pouch of cold
fish stew were given to each person in costume. The Sakurai
family's group reassembled in its house for another go at the food
still piled on the table (the sweets were brought out, too) and a
discussion of Sunday's events.
</P>
<P>
   The festival's final day is the most crowded and most important.
It draws almost a million people, all crammed together close to the
Asakusa Shrine. The three largest portable shrines are brought out
for this celebration, each requiring at least 60 men to carry them.
Because of the crowd density, it takes hours to advance the shrines
any distance. And people have been known to lose their lives in the
crush of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It was getting late, and knowing that some of my new friends
would be getting up at 3 a.m. to get to the Asakusa Shrine, I left
for the subway back to my hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, I was back at the Sakurais. The JNTO instructs
visitors to arrive at 7 p.m., expect a sweet and tea, and to leave
within two hours. But we had hit it off Saturday, and I had been
invited for dinner. Amid the festival excitement, there wasn't time
for in-depth talk, and the dinner invitation gave us a better
opportunity to get to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   Mieko, in her 50s, had been a dental assistant for 25 years. She
prepared chicken pieces in teriyaki sauce, tempura onions and
carrots and two types of tangy green vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Our conversation centered mostly on lifestyle. The family was
interested in hearing about Atlanta, my neighborhood and
particularly how much space I had. They wanted to know how
frequently I cleaned my house, especially how often I vacuumed. I
think these questions were prompted by their mental pictures of my
suburban home while we sat in their small living room, which is
also used as a dining room and a bedroom. They also asked where
other members of my family lived, about my other trips to Japan and
what sights I had seen on this visit.
</P>
<P>
   I had brought them postcards, including one of Bulloch Hall in
Roswell, (Ga.), and boxes of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone With the Wind,'' Mieko said immediately when she saw
Bulloch Hall's columns.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese generally are guarded about their privacy, and not
wanting to make any faux pas, I kept my questions simple. I found
the Sakurais open, friendly and interested in Americans and other
Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   Hatsumi, an aerobics instructor and model in her 30s, spoke the
best English. She travels to Los Angeles at least once a year and
she and her mother have visited a pen-pal friend and his family in
Louisville, Ky. Mieko showed me an album of photos from this trip,
which included a jaunt to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Eiji, the father who is in his 60s, is a distributor for a large
Japanese cosmetics company. He didn't say much the entire evening,
but I could tell he understood almost everything that was said. He
and Mieko were readying for a trip to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter Ami, in her late 20s, is taking English lessons. She
used to work for a computer supply company but had quit so she
could travel to India. She was considering a trip to Seoul, South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Tsune, the grandmother, listened to everything but didn't utter
a word. Mieko explained that Tsune's knees were bothering her and
that's why we were not sitting on the floor to eat.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Mammie, their 2-year-old Yorkshire terrier, a
lovingly spoiled bundle of energy. Mammie and her Yorkie friend
Boku attended the festival with us _ in their own appropriate
costumes (Mammie has at least 30).
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, Mieko had another surprise for me: a tea ceremony.
She told Ami to take me upstairs, where Ami and her husband live,
and to dress me in a kimono.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has read ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' the best seller by
Arthur Golden, knows that getting in a kimono is a complicated,
layered process. Ami rummaged through her drawers, pulling out the
necessary underclothing, acting almost as if I were an old friend
over to spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   And then at last, the gorgeous kimono. It had a white
background, and flowers and butterflies in several shades of
orange, red and blue. There are no buttons, zippers or snaps
involved, but a few clasps secure the undergarments. Mieko came up
to help Ami dress me, and about 20 minutes later I had been wrapped
into the kimono, complete with wide obi (sash) tied into a square
in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, I felt no awkwardness as they fussed over me like a
lifesize doll. Though these were women I knew only slightly, I was
totally at ease, and I was fascinated at how expertly they brought
about my transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in this exquisite finery, it wasn't hard to see why
Japanese women in kimonos have beautiful posture: The tightness and
restrictiveness of the costume demands that one stand up straight
and move slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you wear your kimonos often?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only for New Year's and special occasions,'' Mieko said, a
special occasion being defined as a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Back downstairs at the dinner table, Mieko began to heat the
water for the tea ceremony. She had donned an informal yukata, a
cotton robe that Japanese often wear around the house.
</P>
<P>
   And by this time, Mammie was also in a kimono, the same print as
the one I had on.
</P>
<P>
   Using a digital camera, Eiji took my picture with Mammie, and
minutes later I had a souvenir of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Mieko took out the small red lacquered jar in which she stores
her best powdered green tea. She poured the water into a small
bowl, swirled it around to heat it and poured the water out. She
then began to mix the tea and water with a whisklike implement
called a chasen.
</P>
<P>
   When the tea was frothy, she instructed me in tea etiquette.
First the hostess bows to the guest, a gesture the guest returns.
The guest then accepts the bowl with the right hand and places it
in the left. Then the bowl is turned clockwise twice to avoid
drinking from the area that has the most elaborate design. The tea,
slightly bitter, is then supposed to be finished in three long
swallows, and the bowl passed back to the hostess along with
another bow.
</P>
<P>
   The entire ceremony is performed with the utmost grace,
contemplation and serenity. Mieko said she does the ceremony every
Friday, but this was only Tuesday, and I felt particularly honored.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists can pay to attend tea ceremonies at some Tokyo hotels,
but I'll bet they don't wear kimonos or get such personal
attention. And there are three major schools of chanoyu (tea
ceremony), so tourists' experiences might be a bit different.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lot quicker getting out of the kimono, and back into my
clothes. Shortly before I left, the family presented me with a
homemade paper plaque in English that commemorated my visit to
their home. On the back, Tsune had rendered with colored pieces of
paper a scene of a boy with a net in a fenced field trying to catch
flying objects. I couldn't decide if they were birds or
dragonflies.
</P>
<P>
   Long before this, I suspected we had forged a friendship. I was
certain when Mieko invited me to stay with her family on my next
trip to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know when that will be, but I can hardly wait to see
what costume the Sakurais will have ready for me.

 &HT;    Kids out of sight, not out of mind at Sawgrass
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, August 8.
 &HT;    By Nick Tate
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ On a recent weekend visit, we knew
we'd made a good choice before we'd even checked in to the Sawgrass
Marriott Resort.
</P>
<P>
   On the way in, the concierge took one look at my son Josh, 5,
and his 8-year-old brother, Danny, and handed my wife, Jodi, a
``family fun pack'' offering discount coupons on everything from
dinner at the Marriott's in-house restaurants to admission to the
Adventure Landing family fun center in nearby Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it got better.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for our room to be readied, we headed to the cavernous
lobby atrium _ a leafy high-ceilinged jewel box, lush with palm
fronds and goldfish ponds, and fronted by two-story windows
overlooking the Marriott's grounds. While watching the Wimbledon
finals on a big-screen TV, Jodi and I sipped cocktails while our
sons guzzled freshly made tumblers of chocolate milk _ artfully
topped with real whipped cream and cherries.
</P>
<P>
   Refills came unbidden _ along with the first soothing twinges of
vacation-mode release.
</P>
<P>
   The days that followed were a running series of poolside games
with the boys, tennis matches on the Marriott's lighted clay courts
and wave-hopping at the resort's private beach. And even the
toughest choices we had to make all weekend _ beach or pool, tennis
or golf, daiquiri or pina colada _ were blissfully easy to resolve.
That allowed us to focus on more important things, like becoming
that most elusive of family creatures: happy vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you need to know to enjoy your own escape ...
</P>
<P>
   Essentials: Spaciousness is a given at the Sawgrass. The
resort's 324 guest rooms ($120 per night) are spotless and large
enough to accommodate a king-size bed (or two doubles) and two free
roll-away cots. The large open rooms also include a desk, coffee
maker, refrigerator and TV, offering children's films among the
pay-per-view movies. In addition, the Marriott has more than 100
one- and two-bedroom suites and villas (for an additional $25),
with separate sitting areas, bedrooms, kitchenettes and room to
sleep eight.
</P>
<P>
   Guests have five resort eateries to choose from _ ranging from
the casually romantic Ocean View Restaurant at the Marriott's
private beach to the casually elegant Augustine Grille. For
families, the midpriced Cafe on the Green is the most comfortable
place to grab a bite. Here, children's menus double as activity
booklets and offer inexpensive favorites like pancakes, pizza,
burgers and chicken fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Golf: With the PGA Tour headquarters located in Ponte Vedra,
golf may be the city's most popular pastime. The Marriott offers 99
holes, including two 18-hole courses that are part of The Players
Club (TPC) Stadium Course, for which the Sawgrass is the official
hotel. For a $110 greens fee (June to September), plus $25 cart
rental, guests can play the same par-72 course _ including the
famed island green on the 17th hole _ that has challenged Tiger
Woods, Fred Couples and Greg Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the few truly famous holes in golf that is open
to the public,'' said visitor Bill Richer of Alpharetta (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Marriott guests can play four other courses, with greens fees
ranging from $35 to $100, all within three miles of the resort.
Younger duffers also can be carted along to the Sawgrass driving
range.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis: Ponte Vedra is also home to the U.S. Association of
Tennis Professionals (ATP), rivaling Atlanta as a regional tennis
center and featuring a variety of public and private courts.
Marriott guests can play the resort's six lighted clay courts for a
daily charge of $12 per player. And parents don't need to book a
baby sitter; a fenced-in miniature golf course adjoins the courts,
allowing kids to work on their short game while parents take
lessons or volley for bragging rights. That $12 fee grants Marriott
guests access to the nearby ATP Tour international headquarters
(200 ATP Tour Blvd.), which features 11 grass, red-clay and hard
courts _ and frequently hosts pros like MaliVai Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Water sports: The resort itself boasts two large
waterfall-framed pools _ one designated for kids and families, the
other for adults. Poolside, the 100th Hole bar and grill offers
snacks and drinks; and dockside tables overlook the lagoons and
water traps most likely to harbor turtles, duck, small fish and the
occasional gator. Complimentary shuttles also run every 30 minutes
to the resort's Cabana Beach Club, less than a mile away and
straddling a pristine 2.5-mile stretch of private white-sand
Atlantic beach. An Olympic-size pool, Jacuzzi, and bar and grill
are here; a guest credit card, provided at check-in, covers food,
drinks, beach-umbrella rentals and other incidentals.
</P>
<P>
   The great outdoors: Capitalizing on its pristine location, the
Marriott has created several miles of trails for jogging, hiking,
biking and horseback riding (for ages 12 and older). Guests can
also book sailing and fishing day trips for a fee. Still not tired?
Try the resort's full-service health club or, alternatively, pamper
yourself at the spa with a massage ($70-$90), facial ($50-$65) or
makeover ($50 and up).
</P>
<P>
   Kids' stuff: Coloring contests and tie-dye shirt-making on the
pool deck. Pingpong matches by the lagoon. Races, relays and
charades at the pool. They're all part of the Marriott's
``Grasshopper Gang'' day-camp program. It's open 10 a.m.-2 p.m.
daily for kids ages 3-12 ($40 per child, includes lunch). The
nighttime equivalent _ ``Kids' Night Out'' _ keeps kids entertained
with movies, games and dinner in one of the resort's large
conference rooms ($40 per child, 5-9 p.m.). Baby sitters are also
available, by appointment, for $10 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Delta and AirTran offer round-trip flights as
low as $104 to Jacksonville International Airport, on a 14-day
advance purchase. From there, it's a 37-mile drive to the Sawgrass
Marriott Resort. From Atlanta, it's a 370-mile drive. Take I-75
south to I-10 east to I-95 south to Fla. 202 east to Fla. A1A
south. Follow the signs to Sawgrass.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  St. Augustine: Just 30 miles south of Ponte Vedra Beach, St.
Augustine _ America's oldest city _ is worth a quick side trip. The
awe-inspiring Castillo de San Marcos National Monument _ a large
star-shaped limestone fort built by the Spanish in the 17th century
_ should be the focus of any family visit. The fort, at 1 Castillo
Drive (904-829-6506), is open 8:45 a.m.-4:45 p.m. daily. Admission
is free for seniors and children under 16; $4 adults.
</P>
<P>
   Also, make sure to walk St. Georges Street, a narrow pedestrian
way flanked by preserved or re-created 16th and 17th century
buildings _ as well as coffee bars, candy stores, souvenir shops
and more than a few taverns.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Beaching it: The beaches around Sawgrass offer two distinct
experiences. The Jacksonville beaches, just north of Ponte Vedra,
are a funky Floridian take on Coney Island _ built up with surf
shacks, sidewalk vendors and boutiques and flavored with a
bohemian/surfer-dude atmosphere. The sedate Ponte Vedra beaches,
farther south, are more private and naturally beautiful _ well
known for 40-foot dunes that roll into thickets of oak trees and
palmettos. Miles of marshes, lagoons and creeks can also be found
here.
</P>
<P>
   Nature lovers will want to take in the nearby Guana River State
Park, featuring five miles of beach and bordering a 9,600-acre
wildlife management area, just north of St. Augustine.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to eat: There's no shortage of world-class restaurants
or cheap-eats family places from Jacksonville to Ponte Vedra to St.
Augustine. Good mid-priced family restaurants include the Aqua
Grille (950 Sawgrass Village Drive, Ponte Vedra Beach,
904-285-3017) and Barnacle Bill's (14 Castillo Drive, St.
Augustine, 904-824-3663). Both provide terrific seafood specialties
_ fried, grilled and broiled _ and are clued in to the needs of
kids and families.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Downtown Jacksonville: At the mouth of the St. Johns River,
Jacksonville is a 45-minute drive north of Ponte Vedra Beach. The
waterfront city features upscale shopping at Jacksonville Landing
and a 1.25-mile Riverwalk, the well-regarded Jacksonville
Zoological Gardens (8605 Zoo Road, 904-757-4462) and the Museum of
Science and History (1025 Museum Circle Drive, 904-396-7062), which
features well-built dioramas exploring Florida's natural and
cultural history.

 &HT;    Vacation easily becomes family affair at Sawgrass Marriott
Resort
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, August 8.

<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Still as stone, the gator's eyes
barely broke the dark water's surface _ the only clue to its
advancing position on the morning's meal.
</P>
<P>
   In a sudden splash of water and feathers, he snapped his jaws,
scattering two startled ducks and a half-dozen turtles. The crust
of bread vanished without a fight into the gator's jagged maw, as
the ducks and turtles took up safer positions along the water's
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Not 10 feet away, my 5-year-old son, Josh, broke off another
bread crust and cocked his arm like Tom Glavine. ``Did you see
that?'' he asked, tossing another morsel to the gator from the
relative dockside safety of his father's arms. ``He took it right
out of that turtle's mouth!''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing for the turtle _ and my son _ that this gator prefers
fresh bread to fresh meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wally,'' as we nicknamed him, is something of a mascot at the
Sawgrass Marriott Resort _ an inviting family vacation spot on
Florida's northeasternmost coast. Here, among the dunes and sands
of Ponte Vedra Beach, the Marriott has engineered a perfect
marriage of natural beauty and upscale resort amenities that makes
the whole crew feel right at home. In that regard, it's a fine
alternative to the better-known coastal resorts of Hilton Head,
Seaside and Destin, which are only marginally closer to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Blue heron and white egret perform elegant water ballet in and
around the water traps of the Marriott's highly rated golf courses.
Osprey, with their majestic 5-foot wingspans, soar overhead,
lending a grandeur to the resort's manicured gardens and hiking
trails. Red-tailed foxes roam the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Every detail of the 4,800-acre resort seems designed with
families in mind _ from the spacious one- and two-bedroom
efficiency villas and rooms (all of which feature balconies with
high safety walls) to the kid-friendly restaurants, sports
facilities and day-camp activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place has terrific kids' programs,'' notes Bill Richer,
39, an Alpharetta (Ga.) software consultant who visited on business
and was so taken with the Marriott children's day camp and night
programs that he plans to return with his family Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While Sawgrass has no direct beach access, complimentary
shuttles run every 30 minutes to the resort's private Cabana Beach
Club, less than a mile away, on the Atlantic.

you'll find a list of free publications and general information.
</P>
<P>
   Also, get a good guidebook. I used ``Tokyo'' ($14.95) from the
Lonely Planet series.
</P>

   Delta offers one daily, 13 1/2-hour nonstop to Tokyo. With a
seven-day advance purchase, round-trip fares are $1,100 for midweek
departures Nov. 1-Dec. 16 and Jan. 3-March 23; $1,200, Aug. 30-Oct.
31; and from $1,400, through Aug. 29 or Dec. 17-Dec. 26. American,
United, Continental, Northwest, JAL, Korean and Singapore airlines
fly to Tokyo, but with a stop (and typically a plane change) in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   I had a travel agent buy my ticket from a consolidator, Pacifico
Creative Service (www.jalpak.com,
</P>

   1-888-352-5725), and paid $556 round trip for my Delta flight.
</P>
<P>
   Home Visit System: A JNTO office in the lower level of the Tokyo
International Forum (a 10-minute walk from the Ginza shopping area)
is where I ``applied'' for a visit. The form asks name, age,
address, nationality, occupation, hobbies and where you are
staying.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, an official had set up my visit with my hosts,
given me written directions and an identification badge.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Tokyo, families in Kyoto, Osaka and Kobe, among other
cities, also participate.
</P>
<P>
   Festivals: They are plentiful throughout the year all over the
country. Almost all involve colorful costumes and processions. The
JNTO guide has a list and your guidebook should, too. Participation
is welcome in most.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING AROUND
</P>
<P>
   Your guidebook or the materials from JNTO will probably have
routes for the subway and trains. If not, they're available at the
stations and some hotels. The subway and trains run frequently, are
safe and clean (no grafitti anywhere), inexpensive and easy to
navigate. And they were not as crowded, even at rush hour, as I
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The trickiest thing about the subways is that in the larger
stations, there can be many exits. Look for the big yellow signs on
the walls after you exit the turnstiles. They will list the main
streets and attractions. Taking the wrong exit will result in an
indirect route to your destination. I found that only the major
streets were marked on my Tokyo map, and only the major street
signs were in English. Plus, there were some streets that curve and
change names.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  LANGUAGE
</P>
<P>
   It would be misleading to say that English is widely spoken, but
in the places you need it, it's there. All subway and train
stations have their names in English, and at Narita International
Airport there are enough signs in English and enough
English-speaking employees to help you on your way. Most hotels
that cater to tourists also have English-speaking front-desk help.
</P>
<P>
   Several times I had stopped to consult my map or subway routes
and was asked if I needed help. So there is no need to be afraid of
setting off by yourself in this metro area of almost 12 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  FOOD
</P>
<P>
   I don't like most fish or seafood, which is very popular in
Japan, but there are so many other choices that it wasn't a
problem. And there is no need to spend large amounts of money in a
restaurant for every meal.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants: You are never very far from an American fast-food
chain or the Japanese equivalent, and small Japanese restaurants
serving dishes heavy on noodles are inexpensive and abundant. Many
restaurants have plastic renditions of their dishes in the front
window, so if worse comes to worse, you can take your waiter
outside and point.
</P>
<P>
   Vending machines are on almost every street. Soft drinks and
bottled water cost 120 yen, which during my trip was about $1. The
machines also sell sports drinks, beer and wine, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   Stores: All the big department stores have a huge selection of
food, usually at basement level and below. You can buy everything
from sushi to deli meats and salads to French pastries and
chocolate. So most of my meals were picnics in a park. And what
you've heard about prices for fruit is true. Two cantaloupes: about
$140.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MUSEUMS, ATTRACTIONS, MARKETS
</P>
<P>
   Fish market: On the edge of Tokyo Bay and south of the Ginza
shopping area, the sprawling, wholesale Tsukiji Central Fish Market
was built in 1923. It covers 56 acres and features 1,600
wholesalers. Get there early, say around 7 a.m. There will have
been a daily auction before you arrive to which visitors generally
aren't welcome. The market sells 2,500 tons of fish a day.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin tuna were easily 6 or 7 feet long and several
hundred pounds. There were octopuses, squid, crabs, oysters, clams,
sea urchins and some things I couldn't identify as I walked up and
down the narrow, bustling aisles.
</P>
<P>
   And the smell wasn't bad. The fish and seafood are expertly and
quickly cut down to size (the length and heft of the knives will
impress you) and iced. Some fish await their fate in tubs of water.
</P>
<P>
   A word of caution: Wear old shoes and watch where you step. The
floor is wet everywhere (and in some places bloody) and motorized
carts dart quickly down the rows. There is also a produce market
that's worth a look and an external market where you can pick up
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Open-air museum of Japanese folk houses: The collection of 24
buildings of traditional architecture that constitute Nihon
Minka-en has been brought from all over Honshu (the main island,
home to Tokyo) and reassembled in Kawasaki, about an hour west of
downtown. Some buildings date to the 1600s. The project began in
1965 and the upkeep is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings range from an inn for horse traders to a village
chief's house to a merchant's. Some of the houses that were moved
from western Japan have roofs that are sharply inclined to keep the
snow from accumulating and collapsing the house.
</P>
<P>
   You can walk on the ground floor of some buildings, but as in
all Japanese residences, take off your shoes first.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo National Museum: If you're interested in antique kimonos,
samurai swords and armor, sculpture, pottery and calligraphy,
Japan's oldest and largest museum is the place. It's set in the
northern end of Ueno Park and is really three buildings: one for
Japanese arts, another for Oriental antiquities and the third
housing Japanese archaeological objects.
</P>
<P>
   Edo-Tokyo Museum: This building, opened in 1993, traces the
history of Tokyo from the days of the Tokugawa shoguns (1603-1867)
to postwar reconstruction. There are life-size replicas of a kabuki
theater, split-row houses and other buildings.

HISTORIAN OFFERS INVITING ACCOUNT OF TEA PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE SHOEMAKER AND THE TEA PARTY 
Memory and the American Revolution 
By Alfred F. Young 
Beacon, 262 pp., illustrated, $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boston Tea Party may be the most easily apprehended of all
the events in Boston that led up to the Revolution. An easily told
story, it also makes for easy reenactment. No need to trot out a
squad of musket-toting Redcoats (as for the Boston Massacre or the
skirmishes at Lexington and Concord); just some face paint, some
old clothes, and a styrofoam box or two to toss off the Tea Party
ship into the Fort Point Channel.
</P>
<P>
   But as historian Alfred F. Young details in this fine account of
one of the participants and of how the event was remembered, it did
not become the ``Tea Party'' _ with that ``faintly comic and
irreverent'' connotation _ until close to a half century later.
When it was remembered at all during that half century (which was
rarely), it was as ``the destruction of the tea,'' the more
``serious and reverential'' term that appears on Charles Bulfinch's
1790 monument to the Revolution standing (in an 1898
reconstruction) behind the State House.
</P>
<P>
   Young's shoemaker is George Robert Twelves Hewes (the curious
``Twelves'' was apparently a family name) who was born in Boston in
1742. His cobbler's shop was on the waterfront, near Griffin's
Wharf, where the Tea Party occurred. He moved to New York State
after serving in the Revolution and ``remained a poor man'' until
his death in 1840.
</P>
<P>
   Hewes was one of the young artisans and mechanics who dumped tea
from three British merchant ships on the night of December 16,
1773; he was given a leadership position because of his well-known
talent for whistling, which was useful in summoning his team. He
was a witness to the Boston Massacre in 1770 and a witness or
participant in other ``mobbish'' actions. He was one of the
veterans of the Revolution whose ``discovery'' in the 1830s
coincided with the restoration of the Tea Party and other radical
events into the Revolutionary canon.
</P>
<P>
   Two biographies of Hewes appeared in 1834 and 1835, about the
time he returned to Boston _ and had his portrait (now in the
Bostonian Society) painted as a ``Centenarian.'' They were the
first books to use the term ``tea party'' in the title, the first
to focus on the event itself, and the first biographies of any
participant. As Young notes, ``Hewes and the term `tea party'
emerge in print culture at the same time _ or so it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shoemaker and the Tea Party'' is actually two separate
essays. The first, a masterful bringing to life of an obscure
participant in a historic and iconic event, was originally
published in 1981 in the William and Mary Quarterly. Young, a
senior research fellow at the Newberry Library in Chicago, explains
that in the succeeding two decades ``there has been a revolution in
the study of personal memory . . . along with an explosion in
scholarship about public memory'' among historians.
</P>
<P>
   In the second essay, Young addresses the intriguing question of
why the Tea Party was virtually forgotten for close to a half
century _ and why it was then ``rediscovered.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decades after the Revolution, Young writes, Boston was
``an overwhelmingly Federalist town'' and focused its celebrations
on the ``safe, conservative'' Fourth of July. And in those
``orderly and hierarchical'' celebrations, there was no room for
remembrances of events that might reignite the fires of public
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Tea Party stood as ``the most revolutionary
act'' of the decade preceeding 1775, Young writes, a
``quasi-military action'' organized during a series of ``palpably
illegal'' meetings and involving the most radical in its planning
and execution. In addition, its ``carnivalesque'' atmosphere was
``a wild reversal of the traditional order.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1830s, several things had changed. There were
Lafayette's visits to Boston in 1824 and 1825 (the latter one
included laying the cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument),
which, writes Young, ``watered the Liberty Tree.'' At the same
time, veterans were being ``discovered,'' often as petitioners for
public welfare, but calling forth ``a sense of loss of the last
links to the Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In weaving together the stories of Hewes and the Tea Party,
Young has made a major contribution to an understanding of the role
of ordinary people in important events, and of the way in which
even seemingly well-known events can be forgotten and remembered,
interpreted and reinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, though, this is a book for Boston. As Young notes,
``Boston has to be the most bestatued city in the country'' _ and
while he correctly notes that ``the sway of past conservative
public memory is strong,'' the more radical and ``mobbish'' events
are now also commemorated. But the restored and venerated ``sites
are quiet,'' he writes, while ``the Revolution was noisy.''
</P>
<P>
   His question of ``how, amid the skyscraper caverns of a bustling
downtown, could you convey the picketing boys, the massive funeral
processions of men and women, the hanging of effigies, the tarring
and feathering _ the stuff of the popular revolution'' is a
challenge to consider.

IDLE THREATS COULD BRING KOREAN DISASTER The noise level about
North Korea is rising ominously again. The focus now is on whether
or not Pyongyang proceeds with another test of its new long-range
three stage missile. Top U.S. officials, including Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Defence Secretary William Cohen, have
warned of ``serious consequences'' if it does. The crucial dates
are, apparently August 15 - V-J day of World War II - on which
Korea's independence is celebrated, and September 6, birthdate of
the late Kim Il-Sung and also a big holiday which North Korea likes
to mark with something spectacular. By Flora Lewis. 800 words.

MAY NEVER HAVE THE 'TRUTH' ABOUT BREAST CANCER Women with breast
cancer, or who are at high risk of developing it, consider the drug
tamoxifen to be a lifesaver. The drug is able to counter the
cancer-promoting effects of the hormone estrogen, which has been
shown to aid the growth of about half of breast cancers. But a new
study has shown how tamoxifen can reverse its colours and stimulate
the growth of cancer cells after two to five years of use. What is
going on is yet another example of the fact that medicine and
science are a work in progress. By Susan Love. New York Times

ADD FLOWER POWER TO YOUR REPAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ ``I don't know what I expected a sunflower to
taste like,'' said a colleague, ``but that wasn't it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a zinger.
</P>
<P>
   Edible flowers actually taste like something. They are
ingredients. And just because they're pretty doesn't mean you can
go sprinkling them over everything willy nilly like a flower girl
at a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Kelly, the award-winning chef at the Old Chatham
Sheepherding Co. Inn, uses flowers on almost every dish that leaves
the kitchen. But she does it carefully. ``They each have individual
flavors and I try to match the flowers with the dish,'' Kelly says.
``Some marigolds are savory. Pansies tend to be more fragrant. I
usually try and balance a dish. For instance, I wouldn't put a
sweet floral flower on a sweet entree. But I would use one on
dessert because that's sweet all around and that's what you're
looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   The grounds at Old Chatham include extensive gardens and a
greenhouse where the flowers are grown. But those not blessed with
a full-time gardener can serve flowers, too. Chances are, you may
be growing a few edible varieties already.
</P>
<P>
   Nasturtiums, geraniums, day lilies, sunflowers, Johnny-jump-ups
and roses are all edible, providing they haven't been exposed to
harmful chemicals. If you have a lawn service, spray your plants
for pests or have a neighbor who does, skip grazing in your garden
and buy edible flowers from stores. Boxes of them are frequently
stocked with the herbs in larger grocery stores and gourmet
markets. Also avoid picking edible flowers from roadsides where
exhaust fumes, road salt and other contaminants tend to accumulate.
</P>
<P>
   And don't limit your edible flowers to garden beauties. Kelly
says she uses blossoms from herbs as well as flowers from sweet
pea, squash and other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Squash blossoms go well battered and fried and served atop a
squash salad. It's a little of the flower and a little of the
fruit,'' Kelly says.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelly has one caution for those new to serving flowers:
``Don't just pick, you have to know what you're putting in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep a copy of `Peterson's Field Guide for Edible Foods'
just so I know that what I'm picking really is edible,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Kelly, executive chef at the Old Chatham Sheepherding
Co. Inn, uses this recipe with lobster dishes. ``The peppery flavor
of the nasturtiums counterbalances the sweetness of the lobster,''
she says.
</P>

<P>
   FOOD TIP: When serving edible flowers, it's best to remove the
stamens and pistils (the male and female parts in the center of the
blossom) before serving, advises a Web site from the University of
Illinois Cooperative Extension Service and Cathy Barash, editor of
Edible Flowers. Of course with daisies and sunflowers that have
more pistils than petals, it's easier to remove the petals and
discard the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The site also notes that wild roses taste better than cultivated
ones, but it is best to remove the lower part of the rose petals to
reduce bitterness. No mention of what color roses are the most
flavorful.

STEAMING UP MOUNT WASHINGTON TO CELEBRATE A CENTENNIAL 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have been atop Mt. Washington in the glistening splendor that
any of the four seasons can bring to its summit. I've also been
there in the midst of lightning storms that sent me scampering to
get below treeline and in the middle of several fierce and howling
winter moments that ended in tragedy for others.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a mountain that has killed more than 200
people in the past century. So it has always seemed an irony to me
that for all the skilled climbing that has gone on there and all
the tragedies that have struck, you can drive a car to its peak, or
take a train there.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen the contrapuntal T-shirts: ``This Car Climbed Mt.
Washington'' and ``This Body Climbed Mt. Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the 138th anniversay of the carriage road up the
mountain _ a carriage road now known as the Mt. Washington Auto
Road _ a twisting, undulating path up the mountain with steep drops
along its edges and a propensity to overheat engines on the way up
and cook brakes on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   This month is also the 100th anniversary of the first ascent of
the mountain by automobile and beginning steam autos will flock to
the mountain and the White Mountain and Great North Woods regions
of New Hampshire to commemorate that first auto climb.
</P>
<P>
   Steam is the auto of choice because it was a steam auto that
wheezed up the mountain on Aug. 31, 1899. And given the nature of
the mountain and what had to have been a far more treacherous road
than what exists today, it is perhaps appropriate that the first
climb was in a rig called a Locomobile.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the Locomobile were Freelan Oscar Stanley and his wife,
Flora, and in wonderful weather they picked their way up the Auto
Road and into history. It is a drive that will be recreated by many
of the more than 80 steam automobiles expected to assemble at the
base of the Auto Road beginning next weekend (Aug. 7-8).
</P>
<P>
   The weekend kicks off seven days of activities, including time
trials on the Auto Road, cookouts, exhibits and steam auto tours
through northern New Hampshire, are sponsored by Maine's Stanley
Museum and the Mt. Washington Summit Road Co.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are coming from Europe, California, and other parts of the
United States, and they include Stanleys, Whites, Locomobiles, a
Doble, a Waltham, and other steamers.
</P>
<P>
   The cars will be on exhibit to the public from 12-4 Sunday and
some may go up the Auto Road that day. On Monday, time trials on
the Auto Road go from 6-9 a.m. and beginning at 10 the road reopens
to the public, whose drivers may find themselves on the road with
steam autos.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the steam celebration, of course, is the Stanley
Steamer, developed by identical twin brothers _ Francis Edgar and
Freelan Oscar Stanley (F. E. and F. O. as they were known) from
Newton. The inventive brothers' steam car had raised a stir at an
1898 exhibition in Cambridge and caught the eye of macadam tycoon
Amzi Lorenzo Barber. The following spring, he bought the Stanley
company and by the summer of 1899 Stanleys had become Locomobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Barber, wanting to prove his cars to be tough and reliable,
looked for a test that would impress the public. He chose the road
up Mt. Washington, 8 miles of what was then among the most
challenging roads in America.
</P>
<P>
   Flora Stanley's account of their climb in Locomobile (NU)93 is
wonderful for its dated writing style, its sometimes understated
tone, and its prescient view of how New Hampshire natives and
Massachusetts tourists would eye each other down the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the twenty-sixth of August, 1899, an unusual expedition
started from Hunnewell Avenue, Newton. . . .'' she wrote. ``Our aim
was a high one since it was Mt. Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   They crossed the Charles River Bridge into Watertown and went
north to Newburyport and then into New Hampshire where, apparently,
little has changed since then. The first obstacle they came to in
the Granite State was a toll booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a toll bridge between Portsmouth and Dover,'' Flora
Stanley wrote, and then explained how the posted tolls included 5
cents for foot passengers and 15 cents for horse and wagon. Two
``rosy-cheeked maidens'' who tended the toll were baffled as to
what to charge for an automobile so they consulted ``Marm,'' who
told the Stanleys that 10 cents was the proper price.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanleys eyed the locals with some sense of superiority and
the locals eyed the rich tourists from Massachusetts with some
suspicion _ as I said, little has changed in New Hampshire since
then.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were a wonder and surprise to the rustic population,
they were a source of amusement to us,'' Flora Stanely wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It took them five days to make the trip from Newton to Mt.
Washington, and the trip up the mountain, after a good night's
rest, was remarkably smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went on and up, up, still up,'' she wrote. ``The continuous
climbing being varied only by a steepness so excessive that as we
looked ahead to it, we felt a sickening anxiety lest each brilliant
dash should be our last . . . our engine, panting and quivering,
never failied us, but pushed us bravely over seemingly impassible
heights.''
</P>
<P>
   The 8-mile climb took 2 hours and 10 minutes, including a stop
for water three-quarters of the way up the mountain. This on a road
that took eight years to build and which horse-drawn stages took
six hours to ascend.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, purists, who wish the road had never been
built, but it was and the Locomobile climbed it and so here we are
today, ready to celebrate that ascent.

REVOLUTION STILL NOT FULL STRENGTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They'll get Joe-Max Moore and John Harkes back in time
for Friday night's road game against the Colorado Rapids, and
that's the good news for the New England Revolution as they try to
break a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   But then there's the reality that defender Dan Calichman is
still hobbling a bit with hip and groin problems and may have to
sit this one out, coupled with the continued absence of forward
Giovanni Savarese, who practiced Wednesday but will not make the
trip because his knee is not 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the return of one of their best scorers in Moore and
midfield catalyst Harkes from the US Confederations Cup team, the
Revolution will have their work cut out after being outscored,
11-3, during their slump, and will be facing the cream of the
Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've still got a sore groin,'' said Calichman, who played just
the first half of last Saturday's 4-1 loss at Tampa Bay. ``I'd like
to be able to go 90 (minutes), but maybe I need to rest it a little
to be able to do it . . . so we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Calichman said ending the losing streak is pressure enough, but
the big picture is even more important. The team is still in the
playoff hunt in fourth place in the Eastern Conference, ``and so
there's even more pressure on to get that `W' and three points.
Right now, we're in a dogfight. It's simple. We need to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Calichman said the team's problems have boiled down to ``a few
little things. We seem to lose our concentration, we've given up
easy goals early, and that has put us in a hole right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, said Calichman, the Revolution would be in better
shape with all of their top players on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we have the players who can get the job done, but we've
played poorly over the last three weeks and we have no one to blame
but ourselves,'' added captain Mike Burns. ``From a coaching
standpoint, for Walter (Zenga) and Bepe (Galderisi), it would be
nice to get the same lineup to play some consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're a better team than what we showed, but there's a
long way to go. Even a month ago, when everyone was saying we were
so much better _ which I think we are _ we still hadn't proven
anything. We've run into a bad spell, but we'll get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's last win was July 4, a 3-2 decision in
Foxborough over the MetroStars. Injuries and the loss of Moore and
Harkes to the third-place US team in Mexico have kept the roster in
a state of flux.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month seems like a year when you haven't won and when you're
playing every game in 100-degree weather. This summer has been
brutal across the country,'' said Burns. ``I can't wait for
September. It's been tough physically to play in this kind of
weather _ but it's the same for every team. I've talked to some of
the guys from teams in Florida and the Midwest and West and they've
had to practice at 9 in the morning because it's been so hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soccer players, we're in good shape, but still, you've
heard the news when they tell you to stay inside, and we're out
there running around.''
</P>
<P>
   The altitude in Denver may also pose a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different theories about that. It affects some
players more than others,'' said Burns. ``Regardless, Colorado is a
solid team. They're not giving up a lot of goals and they're
scoring goals on the chances they're creating. They're playing with
a lot of confidence right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Savarese, meanwhile, expressed disappointment about not being
able to return, but said that by staying home and taking more
treatment, he hopes to be ready for next Thursday's home game
against San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling much better. I was able to train today and it was
my first day back,'' he said. ``I felt good, but I'm not 100
percent and I don't want to come back until I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating. I want to be a part of helping us. It's
difficult just to watch. But when all of us are back and healthy, I
think we can be a very good team.''

DOORSTOPS PROVIDE FUNCTION, DECORATIVE FLAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Don't be frustrated by doors that keep swinging
shut when you're trying to keep more than one door open for
cross-ventilation. Sit down, relax and keep unruly doors open with
a doorstop.
</P>
<P>
   These old-fashioned functional stops, also known as door
porters, are about 6 to 12 inches high. They are made of cast iron
to keep them from toppling over.
</P>
<P>
   They are also decorative and whimsical in nature. The designs
and shapes are endless, from fauna to flora and famous people, from
early presidents to other historical figures.
</P>
<P>
   Early doorstops were mostly likely a rock, stick of wood, brick
or chair propped up against the door to keep it open. The first
doorstops were manufactured in England in the second half of the
18th century. They were cast in molds in earthenware, and later
made of marble, bronze, wood, brass and glass.
</P>
<P>
   Early doorstops came outfitted with a handle or straight rod,
which allowed the user to place or remove them without bending
down. Since 1810, the molded shapes provided easy grips, doing away
with handles.
</P>
<P>
   Victorian doorstops looked like baskets of flowers or fruit,
scenic images, buildings and allegorical and biblical images. Many
are colorfully painted on only the three-dimensional side. Designs
varied between manufacturers, who often competed with each other.
</P>
<P>
   According to an article in Country Living, cast-iron doorstops
were manufactured in America between 1910 and 1940, with the Albany
Foundry in Albany being one of the most prolific producers. The
company, which also produced a catalog, discontinued its line in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their weight and size, doorstops can also double as
bookends or as a simple piece of sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Although many fine examples of antique doorstops from the 19th
and 20th centuries can be found in antiques shops, new versions and
reproductions are easy to find. Costs can range from approximately
$40 to hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Like any antique, the value of a historic doorstop is based on
its untouched original paint finish. Antique doorstops also weigh
more. Later doorstops are made with less iron, to cut down on
production costs.
</P>
<P>
   Doorstops, which fell out of favor when rooms were
air-conditioned in the later part of the 20th century, can be
researched in Jeanne Bertoia's 1985 book ``Doorstops:
Identification and Values'' ($9.95 Collector Books).

BATTLING DIABETES, MCGANN IS ON COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUTTON, Mass. _ You see the power and fluidity in her swing, how
the ball soars off the tee when she attacks it, and you know it is
just matter of time. You probably haven't heard much about Michelle
McGann in recent months; battles with diabetes have hampered her
golf game and put her confidence in a sand trap.
</P>
<P>
   That could be changing soon.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving at Pleasant Valley Country Club for this week's
areaWEB.com Challenge, McGann was told you couldn't hit driver well
on the course. She kept that in mind as she took the course for
Wednesday's ``Cuz'' Mingolla Memorial Pro-Am _ then took her driver
and proceeded to smack little white balls around the fairways as if
they had insulted her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting there,'' said McGann, 29, about her steady
improvement. ``I'm feeling good about it and it's a great golf
course, so you can just stand up here and hit away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Singer Island, Fla., resident was once one of the hottest
players on the LPGA Tour. In 1995, she finished the season ranked
eighth after posting two of her seven career tournament victories,
the Sara Lee Classic and the Youngstown-Warren Classic. A year
later she finished eighth and posted $498,561 in earnings, a career
high.
</P>
<P>
   The success came despite medication struggles in her battle with
diabetes, which was diagnosed when McGann was 13. Eventually the
illness took its toll. Her earnings dropped to a seven-year low of
$152,280 last year and her ranking dipped to a seven-year low of
45.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been struggling a bit,'' said McGann, who is currently
ranked 83d after earning $70,775. In 19 events, she has failed to
make the cut eight times, including last week's du Maurier Classic,
an LPGA major.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997, I played all right then in 1998 I was on some blood
pressure medicine that wasn't agreeing with me. That took about
three months to figure out,'' said McGann, who had taken
experimental drugs for five years after being initially diagnosed,
then stopped after it was discovered the drug was toxic to the
kidneys. ``You work hard, you practice hard, but if your body
insides aren't right what good is it? In 1998, I practiced hard and
I went out there the first couple of weeks, and I could tell my
emotions were affected by the way my blood sugars were elevated and
dropping.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the last six months, McGann has been using an insulin
pump called the Mini-Med. The pager-sized pump attaches to the
abdomen and delivers insulin as programmed by the wearer, reducing
the need for injections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pump is mimicking a pancreas,'' added McGann. ``It gives
you insulin 24 hours a day, but you have to figure out what you
need, everyone is different. Based on the amount of carbohydrates
you eat, that's how much insulin you give yourself at that time to
cover that amount of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you're just trying to keep your blood sugars level at all
times because you're having a constant flow of insulin, whereas
when you're on shots two or three times a day, it's a little harder
to keep that steady flow. So you don't have to take shots every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the pump, McGann said she has learned more about her game,
and how much it is affected by the disease. ``I'm finally getting
adjusted to it,'' said McGann about the Mini-Med. ``I haven't been
hitting the ball that bad, but I haven't been scoring real well.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case last week at the du Maurier, when McGann fired
a 1-over-par 73 the first day but shot a 5-over 77 the next day to
miss the cut by two strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to ever blame anything,'' she said, ``but if you're
not healthy, it's a bit of a struggle. I hit the ball really good
and one bad hole hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGann knows it might take a while for her game to be back to
1996 form, but she believes the insulin pump gives her the
opportunity to be successful again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through all that your body goes through a lot and this game is
very demanding anyway,'' she said. ``I kind of lost a lot of my
confidence in myself and my game. So you just have try to keep
rebuilding. I'm feeling good and that was the main priority, to
start feeling better and taking care of myself. It will come
back.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A &UR;  &LR; year ago, Asia's currencies seemed to be sliding into the
sea. Russia's cobbled economic system was breaking apart, and
Brazil began to quake. The world's troubles brushed even Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the United States powered ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The US economy expanded by almost 3.5 percent in the first half
of 1999 and has been a singular and dominant force in stabilizing _
even repairing _ a fragile global economy in the months since the
fallout last year, international economists say. Although financial
and currency crises also jeopardized the US financial system last
year, bold moves by the Federal Reserve to drop interest rates
saved the day.
</P>
<P>
   Now, amid expectations the central bank may raise rates to cool
an overheated economy or, worse, fears the nation could flip from
boom to bust, the fate of the United States, the globe's biggest
economy, has become more important than ever to a world still on
the mend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, of course, how long this can go on,'' said
Flemming Larsen, deputy director of economic research for the
International Monetary Fund. ``A relatively soft landing would be
much better for the world. If we see an abrupt (US) slowdown, that
would be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   According to IMF estimates, the global growth rate slowed in
1998 to 2.5 percent, after expanding in 1997 at a 4 percent clip
amid the first outbreak of financial contagion that raged through
southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But 1999 looks brighter. Due to a combination of US strength and
unexpected improvement abroad, the IMF in May raised its projection
of 1999 growth from 2.2 percent to 2.3 percent. Many emerging
countries _ including Thailand, Indonesia and Brazil _ were among
those with better prospects this year, according to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US economy has been critically important in allowing the
world economy to avoid a much broader and deeper recession,'' said
Larsen. ``The relationship is a mutually beneficial one.''
</P>
<P>
   America's most obvious contribution overseas is its importing of
goods. Insatiable consumers, their pockets stuffed with strong US
dollars, have soaked up bargains all over the world, pushing the US
trade deficit to a record $21 billion in May.
</P>
<P>
   Low-cost imports have also helped keep US inflation in check and
continue the US expansion. But American buying has risen most in
countries where currencies plummeted most _ it is the natural
recalibration that helps those economies hit hardest, such as
Malaysia and South Korea. Should US spending slow, countries
relying on those exports to America would suffer.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, government officials moved decisively to stem
fallout from their sliding currency, the won, and stanched the
damage to their banks and economy. Today, economists say South
Korea is farthest on the road to recovery; it is expected to grow
4.5 percent this year after shrinking nearly 6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery has been helped by a 19 percent increase in South
Korea's exports to the United States, which purchased $11.24
billion of its goods in the first five months of 1999. Export
growth in Korea far outpaces growth for the region overall.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Asia's stability has helped Japan, which relies
heavily on its Pacific Rim trading partners, said Akinari Horii, a
general manager for the Bank of Japan in its New York office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the demand from the West, Asian economies would be in
deeper trouble, which would've posed a bigger problem on Japan's
economy,'' Horii said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan faces a long road out of its economic abyss. The world's
second-biggest industrial country has been mired in recession or
stalled since the early 1990s and contracted 2.8 percent last year.
Its deterioration accelerated amid turmoil in the region, as banks
were closed or sold.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan had a surprising spike in first-quarter growth this
year. Though that pace is not expected to continue, Japan's economy
has clearly ``stopped declining,'' Horii said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has taken center stage at a time when Japan is
struggling and European nations are frustrated that they have been
unable to achieve the kind of expansion witnessed here.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, policy makers are running out of tools with which to
create growth. With interest rates scraping near 0 percent, Bank of
Japan is unable to fuel growth through monetary policy. Tax cuts
boosted the economy, but economists said the key to the country's
recovery is in fixing its financial system.
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal world, the United States would keep growing at a
sustainable pace, said Alan Sinai, chief economist for Primark
Decision Economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is _ I think it probably will happen this way _ that
the damaged and devastated parts of the world economy will reverse
and pick up and move into a self-sustaining recovery before the US
has to slow down its economy,'' Sinai said.
</P>
<P>
   That would also help Europe, where Italy and Germany are trying
to shake off negative growth at the end of last year. Europe's
growth is expected to slow to 1.9 percent for 1999, from 2.6
percent last year, according to Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe has not been the other engine of growth in the global
economy,'' said Nariman Behravesh, international economist at
Standard &AMP; Poor's/DRI, a Lexington economics consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   With Europe's economy weak, the Continent is unable to play its
traditional role as an engine of world growth and is trying to jump
on the US locomotive, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   US strength also benefits overseas economies through direct
investment and acquisitions by US corporations. The bulk of US
direct investment goes to industrial regions, such as Europe,
Canada, and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the foreign economies are going up,'' said Ray Mataloni,
economist for the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis, ``US
corporations tend to reinvest that money.''
</P>
<P>
   US-based companies, putting their record profits to work,
invested $121.64 billion last year in plants, offices, equipment,
and other goods necessary to operate abroad, according to the BEA.
That's a 44 percent increase from just two years ago. This year is
on target to surpass that. (BEA data exclude investments in
overseas stocks and bonds.)
</P>
<P>
   Kem Stokes, an economist for the International Trade
Administration under the US Department of Commerce, said exports
are Europe's best route to faster growth. A plunge in the unified
currency, the euro, has boosted US imports from the European Union
by 10 percent in 1999, compared with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to grow a bit more rapidly than they have been,''
said Stokes, who said European nations are constrained by the
Maastricht Treaty from using government spending to boost their
economies. Trade, he said, ``is their only option.''
</P>
<P>
   While the US economy shows no signs of weakness yet, there are
risks on the horizon. The current account deficit _ a measure of
money flowing into and out of the country _ ballooned to $233
billion in 1998 and is expected to exceed $310 billion this year.
The effect is that the United States has become a vacuum sucking in
borrowed money from investors around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a limit,'' Stokes said, ``to how much support you can
give'' the world economy.

AUGUST GIVES FLIGHT TO FLOWERY THOUGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   August is the lazy season in the backyard garden, a time to
muse, to dream, to sit with a cool drink and a fan, and just
vegetate. The famous philosopher Rene Descartes said, ``I think,
therefore I am.'' But in summer I just am, therefore I think.
</P>
<P>
   So some thoughts born of the August heat follow. A few may be
useful, a few informative, but most are just the rambling
cogitations of our all too human self-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever wondered why the best balcony gardens belong to
little old ladies who live in apartment buildings in southern
Italy? The reason is that they watch their plants every day. They
water just so. They pick spent blooms. They fertilize. They tend.
And the Italian sun shines and shines on their works.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the secret of great gardens. A garden only
thrives as long as there is a gardener in the sun. Mother Nature
doesn't garden. She just sits, waits, and watches as the fittest
survive, and cares not who they be.
</P>
<P>
   For in gardens there is a never-ending war among the plants for
space. What we human gardeners do is decide who fills it. Will it
be flowers? Vegetables? Trees? A perfect green lawn? Whatever
strikes our fancy we can plant, for every garden is the creation of
a human mind in search of beauty and a space of one's own desires.
</P>
<P>
   Forget what the garden magazines and TV shows, Scott's grass
seed, and especially Disneyland, tout as today's style. Design is
infinite, and your idea of beauty is as good as any one's.
</P>
<P>
   So how about eating some of that beauty? Well, it's very
possible, and in these days of gourmet competition in the kitchen,
you can wow your picky friends and family with flower-embellished
food.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers are easiest used as garnish on salads or as you would
use fresh herbs on hot dishes. Some blossoms have a mild taste,
some are spicy, some mimic herbs. Most people are adventurous
enough to taste at least one blossom.
</P>
<P>
   Squash blossoms, rose petals, pansy, borage, violets, and
hollyhock have a mild taste. For a more spicy flavor consider
marigold, stock, nasturtium (a bit like horseradish), geranium (all
different, nibble one first), dianthus (peppery-cloves), daisy,
calendula, and chrysanthemum.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers of commonly used herbs, chives, thyme, sage, and
rosemary, work well, too, if you catch them young. Lavender
blossoms are another possibility, maybe sprinkled on vanilla ice
cream, for fragrance is an important part of taste perception.
</P>
<P>
   I must confess I have not tasted all of these, but for the
adventurous palate, they are safe to eat as long as they have not
been sprayed with any pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The August garden always looks bare unless one had the spring
foresight to plant lots of annuals in full sun. Some perennial
gardens may be blessed with asters and chrysanthemums (which are
hard to overwinter well). Easier late-season blooming perennials
are Sedum spectabilis, old-fashioned late phlox, or Hosta
plantaginea `Grandiflora.'
</P>
<P>
   You can add any or all of these to the bare spots now. But for
quick color until frost, consider that old standby impatiens, the
soft-leafed variety for shade, the New Guinea for sun. Hydrangeas
can help, too, though the blue and pink ones are not winter hardy.
</P>
<P>
   Going on vacation and worried about how to keep flower pots and
hanging plants watered? Try a variation on ``pillow planting'' (for
unglazed clay pots only). Get a bag of moist peat moss. Cut some
X-shaped holes in the top. Fill the peat with water until it is
thoroughly and completely soaked, which takes about two days of
filling it up with water, waiting until it is absorbed, then
filling it up again. Then punch a couple of small drain holes in
the bottom. This will stay moist for about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Finally sink clay flower pots into the holes in the top of the
wet peat moss bag, covering the rims but not the plants. Works for
sphagnum-lined baskets, too. Water is absorbed from the peat right
through the clay or moss.
</P>
<P>
   Or one can try this variation on a commercial tree-planting
system. Start with a large plastic bag, such as a garbage bag. Fill
it with water and tie the top. Make one tiny, tiny pin hole in the
bottom so it will take several days to drip out. It's tricky to
calibrate correctly. The bag can be stabilized in a flowerpot or
box and placed just next to the plant that needs vacation watering.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to water while away is to use a thick cotton wick
(often braided). One end is buried in the soil, the other in a big
jar of water, which is usually at the same height or higher than
the flower pot. When properly set up, the water wicks out of the
jar by capillary action and into the soil. Test it first because it
doesn't always work as planned.
</P>
<P>
   But let's be honest, a neighbor boy with a bucket is the easiest
thing, assuming he won't forget in the heat of this sultry summer.

ONE ISLAND, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE . . . 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My heart went out to the people of Nantucket when I read a story
in Monday's Globe about Joyce and Michel Berruet, proprietors of
the island's L'Isle de France, subtitled The French General Store.
Perhaps you read the story too, on the front of the Metro section.
It was difficult to miss, illustrated as it was with a photograph
of the Berruets looking as though they had barely survived some
unspeakable tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   It was a complicated story, but the bottom line for Nantucket is
simple and stark. Because of continuing trade disputes between the
European Union and the United States, the World Trade Organization
has approved 100 percent tariffs on some European goods. These
include certain French products that are mainstays at the French
General Store, items such as duck mousse pate and bread baked in
Paris one afternoon by ``famous French artisan baker Lionel
Poilane'' and delivered to Nantucket the following morning.
</P>
<P>
   The shipments from Poilane have stopped. There is no authentic
French bread to be had on the entire island. To make matters worse,
the French pate company's permission to export has been
provisonally suspended. When will the madness end?
</P>
<P>
   Of course Nantucketers are not the only people who suffer. In
country clubs and exclusive watering places across the continent
the cry has gone up, ``What, no pate?'' Somehow, though, the
situation seems more poignant on Nantucket, so beautiful, so
remote, so rich.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Nantucket should secede from the United States and
become a sovereign nation. Then it could negotiate its own trade
agreements with foreign powers and remove the prohibitive tariffs
on imported French bread and pate and other necessities of island
life.
</P>
<P>
   I make this suggestion to atone for a column I wrote a couple of
years ago in which I made some rash generalizations about rising
prices and declining civility on the island. A number of Nantucket
residents responded to that column, and soon made me see the error
of my ways. They explained that the island isn't for ordinary
tourists who want to spend a day or a week or two soaking up
Nantucket charm. It's a kind of preserve, where people with plenty
of money are able to band together for mutual protection from
people who don't understand their way of life. People like me, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   The last few years have seen the level of consumption on
Nantucket escalate sharply. In June, Joe Kahn reported on this page
about the startling changes wrought on the island by ``new money,''
people who throw up multimillion-dollar ``cottages'' and fly in on
their private jets. A story in Sunday's New York Times reported on
the escalating pace of building and development that, some
Nantucket old-timers believe, threatens the island's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   From these and other reports it seems clear that Nantucket is
well on the way to becoming a community strictly of and for the
very rich. Why not make the most of it? If the island declared its
independence it could become a tax haven, like Monaco. A sovereign
Nantucket could restrict the flow of the hoi polloi, all those
day-trippers and short-term visitors. It could put import tariffs
where they belong, on the sorts of things the nonrich consume. Taco
chips. Wonder Bread. Budweiser. In the unlikely event someone on
the island wanted a jug of Gallo, he'd have to pay big time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, perhaps mainland sympathizers should organize a food
drive to aid the beleaguered citizens of Nantucket. Let them eat
cake? Forget it. Let them eat Velveeta and Triscuits. If we hurry,
we can organize a mercy flight before the weekend parties get under
way.

 &HT;    Mobile hosts treasures of Russia's last czar and his family
 &HT;    By Tinah Saunders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. _ There's nothing like a tale of star-crossed
lovers, incredible wealth, ultimate power, intrigue, treachery and
murder to draw a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 600,000 people toured ``Nicholas &AMP; Alexandra: The Last
Imperial Family of Tsarist Russia'' during the six months it was on
display in Wilmington, Del. And Mobile officials are counting on at
least that number to pass through its Civic Center by Nov. 14, when
the elaborate presentation closes there. But crowds were sparse
during our visit over the July Fourth weekend, three weeks after
the exhibit opened June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Arnold, spokeswoman for the Mobile Convention &AMP; Visitors
Corp., attributed the lack of visitors to the last-minute timing of
the exhibit. In two weeks, Mobile raised $1 million in donations
from individuals and local businesses to stage the traveling
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't have the time to publicize it properly before
it opened,'' Arnold said. She expects numbers to increase as word
of the quality of the show gets out.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit organizer Broughton International is headed by James E.
Broughton, who initiated the successful ``WONDERS: The Memphis
International Cultural Series,'' which opened in 1987 with
``Ramesses the Great.'' ``Nicholas &AMP; Alexandra'' is the ninth such
presentation that Broughton has produced.
</P>
<P>
   This one is certainly crowdworthy. More personal than the 1996
``Palaces of the Czars'' show in Jackson, Miss., ``Nicholas &AMP;
Alexandra'' is not merely a display of possessions and
architectural re-creations, but a fascinating story of Russia's
last royal family told in their own words.
</P>
<P>
   Many people once thought that all traces of the Russian royal
family were obliterated after the Bolshevik Revolution. But a
surprising number of royal treasures, personal mementos and
official documents survived 80 years of Communist rule. There are
700 objects on display in the 14 galleries carved out of Mobile's
cavernous civic center, many of them never seen in public before
this exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   There's something for everyone: elegant ball gowns worn by the
czarina and her court; the gilded coach that carried Alexandra to
her coronation; jeweled bibelots crafted by some of Europe's finest
artisans, including a miniature, diamond-encrusted set of the
imperial regalia created by Karl Faberge for the 1900 World
Exhibition in Paris. There are love letters from ``Alix'' to her
``Darling Niki,'' diaries and old photographs of the family, which
was connected by birth or marriage to almost every European monarch
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   And there are grim reminders of the family's fate, such as the
bayonet that finished what a squad of gunmen could not in the
basement of a house in isolated Ekaterinburg. Also on display:
fragments of blood-spattered wallpaper and stoneware jugs that
contained the acid used to disfigure the bodies after death.
</P>
<P>
   Catching eyes is a 190-foot-long watercolor painting, a panorama
of Moscow at the coronation of Nicholas and Alexandra in 1896, that
was unrolled for the first time in this century especially for this
exhibition. The painting depicts a sophisticated city, made festive
with millions of electric lights at a time when electric light was
still rare in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most poignant display is the series of drawings done
by the royal children for their mother _ the kind that mothers
everywhere display proudly on refrigerator doors today. The
drawings point out better than anything else in the exhibition the
incredible ordinariness of the last of the Romanovs. It was an
admirable characteristic, but one that did not endear them to their
people and helped isolate them from those who might have rallied to
their aid.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas and Alexandra had been born to rule. Nicholas' family
had reigned over Russia for 300 years, and Alexandra was the
favorite granddaughter of Britain's Queen Victoria, who took the
child under her wing when her mother died. But Nicholas' father,
Czar Alexander, had refused to teach him about affairs of state,
and when Alexander died unexpectedly, Nicholas was thrust into a
position he was not prepared to assume.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra was shy and reclusive. She did not approve of Russia's
sophisticated court society, over which Nicholas' mother reigned.
Not long after her wedding, Alexandra had a falling out with her
mother-in-law and retreated into a private world that revolved
around her husband and children. Although the couple were devoted
to each other and to their children, the exclusive nature of their
relationship helped create an enmity in the court and with the
Russian people. They were, in their naivete, their own worst
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Such a personal look at one of the century's most tragic
families takes time. There are 25,000 square feet of exhibit space,
as well as an extensive gift shop and bookstore. Visitors are
advised to allow at least two hours to tour the exhibit, but we
were surprised to find, when we checked our watches as we left,
that we had spent four hours there. Tickets are sold by reservation
for specific times, the latest being 6 p.m. The exhibit closes at 8
p.m. Don't rush yourself.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Mobile is a five-hour drive from Atlanta. Take
I-85 South to Montgomery, then I-65 South. Follow the signs to
downtown Mobile and watch for signs to the exhibit. The Civic

(334-438-4000), overlooking Mobile Bay, is offering special room
and ticket packages.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to eat: Mobile is famous for its seafood restaurants.
One of the oldest and best-known is Wintzell's Oyster House
(334-432-4605) on Dauphin Street, where you can enjoy some of the
area's freshest catches or even try your luck at breaking the
oyster-eating record. A branch of the famous Dreamland Bar-B-Que
restaurant (334-479-9898) is located on Old Shell Road just off
I-65. Justine's Courtyard and Carriageway (334-438-4535), in the
historic district, offers a champagne brunch on Sundays.

IDLE THREATS COULD BRING KOREAN DISASTER The noise level about
North Korea is rising ominously again. The focus now is on whether
or not Pyongyang proceeds with another test of its new long-range
three stage missile. Top U.S. officials, including Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Defence Secretary William Cohen, have
warned of ``serious consequences'' if it does. The crucial dates
are, apparently August 15 - V-J day of World War II - on which
Korea's independence is celebrated, and September 6, birthdate of
the late Kim Il-Sung and also a big holiday which North Korea likes
to mark with something spectacular. By Flora Lewis. 800 words.

MAY NEVER HAVE THE 'TRUTH' ABOUT BREAST CANCER Women with breast
cancer, or who are at high risk of developing it, consider the drug
tamoxifen to be a lifesaver. The drug is able to counter the
cancer-promoting effects of the hormone estrogen, which has been
shown to aid the growth of about half of breast cancers. But a new
study has shown how tamoxifen can reverse its colours and stimulate
the growth of cancer cells after two to five years of use. What is
going on is yet another example of the fact that medicine and
science are a work in progress. By Susan Love. New York Times
Op-Ed. 800 words

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ While the city of Boston was joining its symphony
orchestra in celebrating Seiji Ozawa's 25 seasons as music director
last fall, Ozawa himself was holding quiet conversations with his
wife, Vera, about when the right time to leave would come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking with my wife about how I wanted to teach,''
Ozawa said in an interview in his home near Tanglewood a week ago.
``I want to help the Saito Kinen Orchestra and Festival grow in
Japan, and I want to guest-conduct instead of attending all the
meetings a music director has to go to. Every year in Boston, my
contract is renewed for another three years; I thought maybe this
September, or a year from this September, would be a good time to
say I would plan to leave in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's decision to accept the music directorship of the Vienna
State Opera came as a surprise to everyone in Symphony Hall, and it
came as a surprise to him _ Ozawa was not looking for another
full-time job. ``I went to Vienna to conduct Tchaikovsky's
`Pique-Dame' right after the Boston Symphony Orchestra tour last
spring. I went on to China, but the orchestra didn't, because the
end of the tour was canceled because of the bombing of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade. While I was in Vienna, I was approached about
the job, and my first reaction was to say no. But then they changed
many things in order to suit me. As I said, I would never think of
going to another orchestra after the Boston OZAWA, Page N13 &QL; 
Symphony. But before I die, I want to taste more opera, so this
seemed like a not so bad idea after all. It all happened within two
or three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's unpretentious home in the Berkshires was the scene of
many family-oriented activities during his tenure as music
director; his children grew up alongside the Boston Symphony, and
Tanglewood was one of the family's favorite parts of the job. Son
Yukyoshi, 24, was born after Ozawa became music director; he is now
a popular actor in Japan, where he's busy promoting his first
movie, which has just been released.
</P>
<P>
   Yukyoshi's basketball court at the end of the driveway here was
looking a little folorn, but the nearby gardens were flourishing.
Ozawa's daughter Seira, 26, did pop downstairs for a moment;
working toward a career as a stage director in opera, she is also a
writer and journalist whose current assignment is to write a story
for a leading Japanese magazine _ the subject is Tanglewood. Ozawa
settled down on a corner of the white living room couch and poured
tea, avoiding the fresh lemon-rind cookies until his interviewer
had seriously diminished the supply.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa was thoroughly well trained in music before he left Japan
for the first time to participate in the Besancon conducting
competition in France in 1959 _ the event that brought him into the
orbit of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, because one of the judges
was BSO music director Charles Munch, who invited him to enter the
conducting program at Tanglewood.
</P>
<P>
   Opera, however, represented a whole new world to Ozawa when he
arrived in Europe. ``Opera is something we did not have in Japan.
The first opera I ever saw was in Vienna in 1959, `The Marriage of
Figaro,' conducted by Maestro von Karajan. I remember he also
played the recitatives at the keyboard. I was the guest of a very
distinguisehd Japanese lady who had been a friend of my teacher,
Hideo Saito, and she also took me to the Opera Ball. I had to rent
everything I wore, including the white gloves, which I hated. I
didn't even have shoes _ I was riding around Europe on my
motorscooter.''
</P>
<P>
   The first opera Ozawa conducted was Verdi's ``Rigoletto'' in a
concert performance by the Toronto Symphony, during the early years
of his first music directorship (1965-69); he remembers that Reri
Grist and George Shirley were in the cast. His first staged opera
was Mozart's ``Cosi fan tutte'' at the Salzburg Festival a little
later.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Sleepy Seiji'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that because Herbert von Karajan asked me to, but I was
crazy to try it. The previous summer I had been his assistant on a
production of `Don Giovanni' in Salzburg _ Mirella Freni and
Nicolai Ghiaurov were both in it, and that was when they met; later
they got married. I played the piano for the singers and even
conducted in rehearsals because Maestro von Karajan was staging the
opera and couldn't stop directing and working on the lighting. I
did not know how the opera house worked at all. I couldn't see
anything at all because I would spend the morning playing tennis in
the sun and then go into the production, which was so dark. One day
I must have drunk some beer at lunchtime, and everyone was talking
in German and it was dark and cool, so I just feel asleep and
missed a cue. My nickname that summer became `Sleepy Seiji' _
Mirella still remembers that and teases me about it. Maestro von
Karajan was furious with me, but he did ask me to conduct `Cosi fan
tutte' the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa remembers that the cast included Walter Berry and that
Teresa Stratas sang Despina; Jean-Pierre Ponnelle directed. ``This
was the beginning of my life in the opera, and at the first
performance I made a terrible mistake _ I forgot to give the
orchestra a bow, and the orchestra committee came and paid a formal
call on me to complain. I am surprised that they did not fire me.
Some of the players from that time are still in the orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Ozawa made another important debut, at La Scala,
conducting his first ``Tosca.'' Karajan, who had encouraged him
with ``Cosi,'' knew the pitfalls of Puccini's opera, and thought
Ozawa was crazy _ he even called Ozawa's manager and said, ``What
are you thinking of?'' The manager replied, ``Where do you want him
to learn Italian opera _ in Germany?'' ``I did this,'' Ozawa
recalls, ``because Luciano Pavarotti said to me, `Seiji, you do.'
But Maestro von Karajan said, `Seiji, you are going to be cooked.'
Raina Kabaivanska, who was a very prima donna then, was supposed to
be Tosca, and she was going to wear Maria Callas's costume at the
opening performance, which was on television. But she got sick
during rehearsals, so Eva Marton sang. Kabaivanska showed up for
the telecast, saying `This performance is mine,' only nobody told
me _ I found out when I heard a new voice singing `Mario, Mario'
offstage. Everything in the performance was different from what I
had rehearsed with the other soprano. At the end, I was booed for
the first time in my life. My mother, who had come to cook for me,
thought it was another Italian way of saying `Bravo.' But the
orchestra played fantastic for me, and by the third performance we
had a triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa has conducted opera since then in Paris, Vienna, and in
Japan, and in 1980 he inaugurated a regular series of semistaged
opera productions at Tanglewood and in Symphony Hall _ among the
works he has conducted with the Boston Symphony are Gluck's
``Orfeo,'' Beethoven's ``Fidelio,'' Puccini's ``Tosca'' and
``Madama Butterfly,'' Mozart's ``Idomeneo,'' Berg's ``Wozzeck,''
Strauss's ``Salome'' and ``Elektra,'' Stravinsky's ``The Rake's
Progress,'' Tchaikovsky's ``Eugen Onegin'' and ``Pique-Dame,''
Honegger's ``Jeanne d'Arc au Bucher,'' and Verdi's ``Falstaff.'' At
the Tanglewood Music Center he conducted Poulenc's ``Les Mamelles
de Tiresias'' and great performances of Britten's ``Peter Grimes.''

 (Repeating for all needing.)  
 LENOX, Mass.: ... ``Peter Grimes.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The BSO ``Elektra'' and ``Pique-Dame'' were released on CDs, and
Ozawa has conducted recorded performances with other orchestras of
``Salome'' and ``Carmen'' with Jessye Norman and Offenbach's ``Les
Contes d'Hoffmann.'' Some of these works have also been seen at the
Saito Kinen Festival, where Ozawa led Poulenc's ``Les Dialogues des
Carmelites'' and a famous televised production of Stravinsky's
``Oedipus Rex'' that was designed by Julie Taymor.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Ozawa has also conducted other works not associated
with him in Europe or America, in an annual series of operas with
the New Japan Philharmonic sponsored by Hennessey cognac _ there he
has led such works as ``The Barber of Seville,'' ``Manon Lescaut,''
``The Magic Flute,'' and ``Der fliegende Hollaender.''
</P>
<P>
   What has eluded Ozawa are some of the major works of Mozart,
Verdi, and Wagner; conductors these days are often typecast _ no
one would think of asking Ozawa to conduct ``Peter Grimes,'' a work
he led more convincingly than some of the British conductors who
specialize in Britten. None of the Vienna repertory has been set
for Ozawa yet, but there are definitely things he wants to do. ``I
have never conducted Berg's `Wozzeck' in the theater, but we did it
in Boston, and Hildegard Behrens, who sang Marie, says it was the
best `Wozzeck' she was ever in. I have learned Berg's `Lulu' and
never conducted it, and I once spent five months learning
Schoenberg's `Moses und Aron' for a production that was canceled.
My car was broken into then, and the only thing that was taken was
my score to `Moses und Aron'! I was once offered Wagner's `Ring'
Cycle, but I couldn't make that commitment of time over a period of
three years, but now I want very much to do it. ''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the subject of his departure from Boston in 2002,
Ozawa says, ``I didn't want to go down; everything in Boston must
always be going up. Until my very last day I want to be the music
director here, and I must be very strong; the first thing I am
asking of myself and of the orchestra is that these next three
years must be the very best of our time together. We are also
behind in commissioning new works, so I must give that a kick.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa says the decision to leave was ``difficult and sad. Both
for my family and for me Boston and Tanglewood have been a major
part of our lives. I know my feelings about this orchestra will
never change. I used to say that the relationship between a music
director and an orchestra was like a marriage, and forever, but now
I think the relationship is more like that of a family, which is
permanent and important in a different way. I think the orchestra
and I understand each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa bridles at the suggestion by some out-of-town critics that
the orchestra is currently in a state of disarray. ``We have some
wonderful new players now, a new first viola, a new first horn, a
new first flute, and they have changed the whole situation. There
are so many young strong players in the orchestra now, and I think
the orchestra is wonderful. I do not conduct so many orchestras
now, but I do conduct the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna
Philharmonic, and I think the Boston standard holds up _ this
orchestra has character, the way those do, and the character of the
Boston Symphony is something that I love. Boston has its own color,
and it never pushes; the musicians never become rough _ they hear
well and they blend well. Of course, like every orchestra we are
sometimes up, sometimes down, but it never comes down below Boston
Symphony standard. Only the greatest orchestras can do what the
Boston Symphony does at its best, as it did in our big tour
performances of Mahler's Third and Sixth symphonies. We can't do
that every day, but that's impossible. If people do not agree,
that's OK, but I don't understand what they are talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also surprised by the amount of covert and even overt
anti-Asian condescension that surfaced in some of the commentary
greeting the announcement of his departure. ``In the beginning,
yes, I was very aware of this problem, but it is something I have
not felt for many years, especially when I conduct in Berlin or
Vienna. But I know it will not stop until I die; I know I am a test
case. Everyone wonders how much I can learn, how much I can
understand. But the problems I have had have always ended in a
positive way. I have always enjoyed learning, and I still do.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Changes at Tanglewood
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa has few regrets about the major controversy that has
dominated the last few years, the changes he has implemented at the
Tanglewood Music Center. ``It was my responsibility to do this.
There was some hot stuff to take, but I'm glad I did it, and now I
still have time, three years more, to drive the Music Center along
toward new levels. The school has started a whole new era, and
needs all the energy I can give to it. I hope I can continue a
relationship with the school, but I cannot invite myself, and I
don't want to be a Tanglewood ghost. If the music director invites
me, I will happy to do anything he asks me to.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of gratitude to his own mentors, Ozawa has become profoundly
committed to teaching. ``Conducting is not so easy, you know. You
have to be a good musician to begin with, and then you need the
tools to become a conductor _ and that's not something you can
learn in a room by yourself. When I was studying with Hideo Saito,
I was his only student, and I conducted every single week from the
time I was 16 or 17, starting with a string quartet playing
symphonies by Haydn and Mozart and later pieces like the
Tchaikovsky `Serenade for Strings.' I was so lucky. These days
there is not much chance for a young conductor to have the kind of
training I did, anywhere in the world. To be fair to the next
generation, I want to create this kind of chance for young people.
Today they all find the CD and listen to it, but to be a conductor
you have to understand things inside of you; you have to find the
next level within yourself. Music is this really big thing, and you
have to come up to it.''

</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, after months of tortuous negotiations, an American
TV news team managed to establish contact and to interview Osama
bin Laden _ in a mountain hideaway in Afghanistan, guarded by the
Taliban. He was considered by the U.S. government and many allies
to be the most dangerous international terrorist at large.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, bin Laden called for the murder of
Americans and Jews, wherever they might be, castigating Americans
as ``the biggest thieves in the world and the (worst) terrorists.''
He praised, and sometimes implied personal responsibility for, the
World Trade Center bombing in New York in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed a desire to drive Western, especially American,
influence and interests from the Arab and Muslim worlds. He vowed
to drive the Saudi royal family from power and destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the name Osama bin Laden was unfamiliar to many in
the West. News reports sparsely recounted how he built his vast
fortune as a Saudi Arabian citizen and became a leader and
financier of a complex global terrorist network that grew out of
the bloody Afghan ``jihad,'' or holy war.
</P>
<P>
   The truth about how bin Laden achieved his wealth and what his
activities actually have been over the years is still largely
untold.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Laden, had a
rags-to-riches story: He founded a formidable construction dynasty
after emigrating in the mid-1940s to Saudi Arabia from Yemen as a
very young man. Poor but industrious, he got a job as a bricklayer
for Aramco, the Arabian-American Oil Co., and earned one Saudi
riyal _ the equivalent of about 20 U.S. cents _ per day.
</P>
<P>
   Like other immigrants from his region, the Yemeni coastal
province of Hadhramaut, east of the big seaport of Aden, bin Laden
deposited his riyals in a tin box and spent frugally on himself.
</P>
<P>
   In past centuries, the trading ships of the Hadrami Arabs had
voyaged out to Indonesia and China, bringing back spices, incense,
myrrh and frankincense from the Far East and the Indian
subcontinent. That was generations before the merchants of England
and Salem, Mass., made their fortunes in the China trade of the
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Even before independence, when Britain gave up its colonial grip
on Aden and South Arabia in 1967, Hadrami merchants, clerks and
moneychangers had migrated north to seek their fortunes in Saudi
Arabia. These fortunes _ earned by dint of hard work and good luck
combined _ built or contributed to Saudi business and banking
dynasties. Today some of them also finance radical Islamic causes
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Once the elder bin Laden had saved enough to go into business
for himself, he founded a construction firm and started modestly
with small jobs. By the early 1950s he had moved into building
palaces for the House of Saud in Riyadh. Eventually, bin Laden won
the highly lucrative contract for a Medina-to-Jeddah highway in the
holy province of Hejaz, after a foreign contractor had withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the bin Laden name was legendary in Arab construction _
especially in the Saudi kingdom and in Jordan _ for every sort of
major road, airport and other infrastructure project. The firm
attracted engineering talent from all over the world and amassed a
huge fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Mohammed, as he came to be called, developed a reputation
for piety as well as wealth, jetting from one Arab construction
site to another. He once had the unique experience of saying, in
one day, morning prayers in East Jerusalem (before Israel's 1967
conquest of the holy city), noon prayers in Medina and evening
prayers in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, his reputation for piety rubbed off on the firm. By
1966, when his aircraft crashed and he was killed, bin Laden had
developed a conglomerate of companies and was the biggest private
contractor of this type in the world, owning 90 of the largest
Caterpillar excavators then in existence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its religious credentials _ useful later when it would
become a financier of the Afghan jihad _ the firm was short on
management knowhow. For a time, Saudi King Faisal appointed the
owner of a smaller construction company to watch over the financial
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the Islamic tradition of polygamy, bin Laden
fathered no fewer than 52 children with various wives. One of his
sons, Osama, had already attracted the attention of the Saudi royal
family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, at age 23, Osama bin Laden was finishing studies in
economics and marketing at Jeddah University. He already had a
close friendship with Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud, who shared
his fervent ideas about the decline and decadence of Islam and
Islamic political dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   Osama appreciated Prince Turki's honesty and antipathy to
corruption _ qualities he believed were not always found in the
Arab world's royalty or rulers. And, for his part, the prince seems
to have regarded Osama as an ernest young man who burned with a
pure, hard flame of devotion to religious principles.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, Osama bin Laden was running much of the elite
construction business that his father had built from scratch. Under
his guidance, the company expanded its reputation for professional
excellence and a ``can-do'' spirit in major projects. His
inheritance from the family fortune was soon augmented by the huge
business earnings.
</P>
<P>
   It was a politically tumultuous time. In neighboring
Afghanistan, a fierce 1978 revolution had resulted in a Marxist
government and brought a sizeable amount of Soviet aid. But
non-stop in-fighting among the parties and protest demonstrations
among the devout Muslim citizenry were followed by a Soviet
invasion. This was an outrage to bin Laden, who seized the
opportunity to join forces against the ``godless'' Red Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was enraged and went there at once,'' he said in a 1993
interview with Robert Fisk of the London Independent, one of the
first journalists to spot bin Laden as a key mover in the Afghan
holy war and, perhaps more significantly, in the larger jihad
against America that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Turki sent bin Laden to Peshawar, Pakistan, to scout out
the possibilities of raising an Arab volunteer army. Soon bin Laden
set up a base for the Afghan warriors, within easy reach of
Pakistan's powerful intelligence and security service, the
Interservices Intelligence Directorate _ known as ISI _ but
apparently not supervised by them.
</P>
<P>
   As the war rolled on, bin Laden was organizer, financier,
fighter and Islamic role model. He eagerly imported bulldozers and
other heavy equipment to cut new roads and tunnels. Operating out
of Karachi, Pakistan and Afghanistan, he agreed to build bases and
training camps, as well as landing strips for the private jets of
warlords and Muslim and Arab dignitaries. He built deeply buried
bunkers and tunnels in the mountains for command posts and
telecommunications centers to secure the communications against the
radio traffic analysts and codebreakers of the Red Army.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, bin Laden quickly became acquainted with Abdullah
Azzam, a charismatic Palestinian leader, who had made a name for
himself with fiery sermons in Zarqa, Jordan, addressed to
Palestinians fleeing the Jordanian army's crackdown in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Azzam, later a founder of the Hamas Islamic resistance movement
in Gaza and the West Bank, had rejected the authority of Yassir
Arafat's mainstream Palestine Liberation Organization and other
smaller groups as too Marxist and not Islamic enough. He believed
they depended too much on the Soviet ``Great Satan,'' the usurper
of Muslim Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In liaison with the generals running Pakistan's ISI, Azzam
outlined his need for weapons, transportation and incomes. Bin
Laden promised to be generous with financing and began fundraising
and organizational journeys throughout the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the bin Laden financial and construction empire
strengthened its ties with the Saudi royal family, winning a $3
billion ``contract of the century'': the full restoration and
reconstruction of the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
   Also proving to be a brave foot soldier, bin Laden suffered a
shoulder wound in combat near Jalalabad. Under the approving eye of
Pakistan's ISI officers, he cultivated and guarded his good
relations with the two main ethnic Afghan warlords: Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar and Ahmad Shah Massoud.
</P>
<P>
   Even more crucial for his later global enterprise in private
terrorism, bin Laden used as a regional power base in Pakistan the
Binoori mosque in Karachi's Newton district. The prayer leader
there was a certain Mullah Mohammed Omar, then an unknown young
cleric, but by 1998 the leader of the Taliban and the most powerful
man in Afghanistan.

</P>
<P>
   It could be called a strange love affair that went disastrously
wrong: the alliance, during the Afghan war, between the United
States and some of the most fanatical followers of radical Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Four a quarter century after the onset of the Cold War in 1946,
the Soviet Union was perceived to be the principal threat to
American interests in the Middle East, as elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, decided by a tiny
coterie in the Leonid Brezhnev-era politburo, jolted President
Jimmy Carter in the White House and his foreign-policy team. They
perceived the foolhardy invasion not only as a major international
threat, but also as a rare opportunity to undermine the already
tottering Soviet empire lying north of Afghanistan, in Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In cooperation with Pakistan's Interservices Intelligence
Directorate (ISI), Saudi financing and Pakistani logistical
support, the CIA managed the program to send into battle a
mercenary army of Islamic volunteers. The tacit consensus was that
the Muslim religion, fundamentally anti-Communist, if translated
into politics, could be harnessed as a mighty force to oppose
Moscow in the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   This impetus to support the anti-Soviet ``jihad,'' or holy war,
was amplified by President Ronald Reagan's men _ especially his
director of Central Intelligence, William Casey. By 1981, when new
sources of secret financing were needed for the Afghan campaign,
the bin Laden enterprises were on a short list of possible donors.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Sultan bin Abdul Azziz, the powerful Saudi defense and
aviation minister, told a high-level American business and
investors' delegation that the bin Laden firms had done great
things for the kingdom. To both Saudi intelligence and the CIA,
Osama bin Laden, through his personal reputation as an astute
businessman and a pious Muslim, seemed an ideal figure to play a
leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden would pay, with his own and company funds, for the
recruitment, transportation and training of the volunteers who
flocked in, first to Peshawar, Pakistan, and then to Afghanistan,
from the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, parts of Europe and
America. He collected enough millions from his family and corporate
holdings and from donations by rich Arab Persian Gulf merchant
families, to organize Al Qaeda, the Islamic Salvation Foundation,
to support the jihad.
</P>
<P>
   He established a network of Al Qaeda centers in Saudi Arabia,
Egypt and Pakistan, through which he recruited, enlisted and
sheltered thousands of Arab volunteers. It is this large fraternity
of Al Qaeda alumni which is still internationally active _ not as
freedom fighters, but as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those bin Laden recruited turned out to be zealous
Muslims like himself, and brave soldiers. Some, however, were
criminals, who emerged from places such as Algerian or Tunisian
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Girardet, one of the most perceptive journalists covering
the war, estimated in summer 1983 that already there were between
80,000 and 150,000 full-time guerrilla fighters. Their pay had to
compete with what some had earned, or might earn, in more peaceful
civilian callings. The figures for ``regulars'' did not include
hundreds of thousands of Afghan and Pakistani civilians who
functioned as part-time fighters.
</P>
<P>
   After several long visits to different fronts, Girardet
determined that the resistance movement was operating, with varying
efficiency, in as many as 300 different regions throughout
Afghanistan's 28 provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, through an ISI-managed logistical framework, tried to
supply and pay the guerrillas; in practice, pay and equipment in
the field often had to come directly from outside donors such as
bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   During the peak period for foreign volunteers _ which spawned
bin Laden's Al Qaeda and various lesser foreign terrorist networks
_ up to 5,000 non-Afghan fighters streamed into the Peshawar area.
Easily 10 times that number would train or fight; others rested,
trafficked in drugs and arms or led the good life in Peshawar.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them, as an Egyptian newsman who visited his compatriots
remarked, were drawn by the adventure and religious prestige,
involving a kind of emotional ``high, attached to feeling part of
the jihad.'' Some were university undergraduates or, like the
Taliban who appeared in 1993, students of Islamic colleges, known
as ``madrassas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the young men, from poorer Arab countries such as Yemen
or Sudan, had been working in the wealthy Persian Gulf oil emirates
and were ripe for recruitment there. They had grown tired of being
reduced, with their non-Arab, Asian colleagues, to proletarian
status. Others were self-financed or backed _ a notable example was
Egypt's cleric, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman _ by tight-knit communities
of followers.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who took up arms, the ideological core group were
believers who were politically, as well as emotionally or
materially, engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike training, recruiting for the jihad in the United States
was not handled directly by the CIA, despite its overall management
role. Various local cover groups, often legitimate Muslim charities
and mosque communities in cities such as New York, Detroit, Los
Angeles and other large centers of Arab-American population,
shielded the agency.
</P>
<P>
   If directly run by the men from Langley, Va., such activities _
as well as the weapons training in America _ would have been a
flagrant violation of the CIA's charter.
</P>
<P>
   The sites for induction and initial indoctrination of the future
holy warriors were modest and humdrum. One was in New York's Arab
district, in Brooklyn, on Atlantic Avenue. Another was a private
rifle club in affluent Naugutuck, Conn. There were similar
locations within the large Arab immigrant and Arab-American
districts in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area, Detroit and
Dearborn, Mich.,
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, the Alkifah Refugee Center was also known to the
Arabs, Arab-Americans and Muslim travelers from abroad who met and
worked there as the ``Al-Jihad'' center. This was because both
recruiting and fund-raising for the Afghanistan jihad went on
there.
</P>
<P>
   The funding came from charitable donations for Afghan refugee
relief in the United States. Most probably, there were also
hard-to-trace monies from the World Muslim League and other
missionary and charitable organizations located in Pakistan, such
as the Tablighi Jamaat, a vast international Islamic missionary
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Among the key figures in the Brooklyn operation was bin Laden's
old friend, Abdullah Azzam, a fiery speaker and founder of Hamas.
In the early and mid-'80s, he toured the United States recruiting
for Afghanistan. But he was probably also raising funds for Hamas
and its post-1987 Palestinian revolt against Israel in the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
   Azzam was killed by a still-mysterious car bomb in Pakistan in
1987 _ it greatly upset bin Laden. Suspects included Israel's
Mossad intelligence agency; the Soviet KGB or its Afghan adjunct,
the Communist Afghan KHAD; the Pakistani ISI; and even the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The blind Egyptian prayer leader, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, also
had been a recruiter, sending his sons to fight in Afghanistan.
Later, with other suspects, he was convicted in the 1993 World
Trade Center bombing and an aborted conspiracy to bomb the United
Nations headquarters, along New York's East River, as well as
traffic tunnels, bridges, FBI headquarters and government offices.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman and the others frequented the Atlantic Avenue
headquarters and often prayed in nearby mosques. An investigation
on ABC's July 12, 1993, ``Day One'' magazine program aired details
of Azzam's recruiting activities in no fewer than 26 American
states.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Brooklyn jihad workers, including El Sayyid Nosair _
he later was convicted of the 1990 murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the
Jewish Defense League leader _ trained as gunmen at a shooting
range in Naugutuck, just west of the highway from Bridgeport to
Waterbury.
</P>
<P>
   Recruits for Afghanistan, according to later New York court
documents, also trained in rifle shooting there. Nosair's course on
the AK-47 assault rifle _ the standard, Soviet-made weapon used by
the mujahedeen _ was held as late as the summer of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Afghan war was nearly over, but as Pakistan's
former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto remarked on the ``Day One''
broadcast, the dispersal of the fighters had begun toward new
target countries. ``They are all over the world,'' she said.

</P>
<P>
   As John Collins, senior American military analyst at the
Congressional Research Services, noted in 1987, it takes little
expertise to pour epoxy on movable machinery or sugar into gas
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Quite another matter, however, is strategic sabotage, which
requires activists and organizers who can mobilize people and
coordinate their actions in demonstrations, strikes, riots,
boycotts, production delays and in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   The zealous young men of the Afghan ``jihad'' would develop an
expertise in sabotage and various martial and murderous skills _
methods that were used successfully in Afghanistan, and also after
1989 in violent actions against their own Third World governments
and in anti-Western terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, as seen from CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., the
program to ``train the trainers'' of the holy warriors followed the
principle of elevating combat into an expression of religious
fervor.
</P>
<P>
   In a pyramidal training scheme, the CIA was the overall manager;
U.S. special-ops forces and a coalition of assorted allied
specialists were the main instructors. Pakistani officers were the
students who would experience tough courses in endurance, weapons
use, sabotage, killing techniques, battle communications and other
skills. Later, in the schools and camps of Pakistan and
Afghanistan, they would impart these skills to the scores of
thousands of fighters _ the mujahedeen _ and send them into battle.
Often, though not always, the same kind of process applied to the
use and distribution of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Selected officers of the Green Berets _ officially the U.S. Army
Special Forces _ many of them seasoned veterans of Vietnam, took
draconian secrecy oaths and then began the covert assignments for
the war in Afghanistan: training native, or indigenous, guerrillas
to fight the Communist foe.
</P>
<P>
   A few men of the Green Berets and the British Special Air
Service (SAS), elected to go beyond the role of trainers. They
volunteered for scouting and back-up roles with the warriors they,
or their colleagues, had trained.
</P>
<P>
   Many Green Berets were already familiar with one of their most
important training sites, Fort Bragg, N.C., the base of the U.S.
Army's 82nd Airborne Division and the site of the John F. Kennedy
Special Warfare Center, a school of guerrilla and counter-guerrilla
warfare which the author, as a newspaper correspondent covering the
Pentagon, visited shortly before the ill-fated 1980 Iranian hostage
rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   There Col. Charles (``Chargin' Charlie'') Beckwith began
training his elite Delta Force to free the Americans held captive
in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. At that point, much of the adventure
in Afghanistan was still in the planning stages. Soon, however,
Beckwith decided to move his training to a smaller and more secure
area.
</P>
<P>
   That area, which Beckwith called ``Camp Smokey,'' was actually
the CIA's Camp Peary. It too would soon play a central role in
training for the Afghan war. Camp Peary, nicknamed ``The Farm'' in
the American spy world, was and probably still is the CIA's main
place of training for spies, infiltrators and covert operators. Its
very existence was a classified secret until various visitors
discovered it and began to write about it in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Farm is a parcel of land about 25 square miles in area, just
northeast of Williamsburg, Va., running between U.S. Route 64 and
the James River. Some of the future Afghan warrior-trainers,
chiefly Pakistanis sent by their country's Interservices
Intelligence Directorate (ISI), were probably able to see Beckwith
and his men train for the Iranian mission on a model of the
occupied U.S. Embassy compound, rehearsing all their hypothetical
moves once they got over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Peary was also where members of the CIA Career Training
Program, many of them officers seeking advancement and new
assignments in covert action in Afghanistan and elsewhere, studied
and worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Paramilitary training also went on at another CIA-used Army
Special Forces site, Harvey Point, N.C., and at another Virginia
site, Fort A.P. Hill, off the Washington-Richmond interstate
highway. Like Fort Lee, Va., it had an authorized area for
parachute jumping. There, pilots and other personnel were supposed
to practice CARP (Computerized Airborne Point Release Flying) _ a
skill that misfired in the operation on the Caribbean island of
Grenada in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But it was apparently used effectively for supply drops to the
Afghan fighters against the Red Army, as well as very effectively
in the 1991 Operation Desert Storm to free Kuwait from Saddam
Hussein's occupying Iraqi troops.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort A.P. Hill and also at Camp Pickett, Va., the Green
Berets and U.S. Navy Seals instructed key Pakistani officers and,
occasionally, visiting senior mujahedeen of Afghan or Pakistani
origin, in infiltration techniques and ways of extracting
``friendly wounded,'' enemy prisoners or captured weapons from
behind enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
   The more successful aspiring guerrillas being trained were
inculcated with the Cold War principle that ``brainpower replaces
firepower'' as the foremost fighting implement. They were also
taught the tenet of Sun Tzu, the classical Chinese theoretician of
the art of war: ``to subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme
of skill.'' In other words, use deception, ruse and evasion as much
as possible to defeat him, rather than conventional, frontal-style
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Along with courses in surveillance and counter-surveillance; how
to write reports according to CIA standards; how to shoot various
weapons; and the running of counterterrorism, counter-narcotics and
paramilitary operations, there was classroom instruction in the
all-important subject of recruiting new agents, couriers and
assorted helpers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the training given to the holy warriors in such
techniques as how to stab an enemy sentry from behind or strangle
him with a garrote, the fact was that murder and assassination _ of
senior enemy leaders, at least _ were forbidden to the CIA by law.
Indeed, on Dec. 4, 1981, President Reagan signed executive Order
No. 12333. ``No person,'' the order stated, ``employed by or acting
on behalf of the U.S. government shall engage in, or conspire to
engage in, assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   This confirmed and solidified a ban on political assassination
passed by Congress after a surge of CIA scandals in the 1970s,
involving such bizarre measures as trying to murder Fidel Castro
with poison or exploding cigars.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the wording contradicted the curricula for
the Afghan trainees, or at least limited the targets of the lethal
methods _ acts such as strangulation, murderous karate chops and
how to use a sniper's rifle with telescopic sights to eliminate a
designated enemy officer.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the holy warriors often brought traditional
techniques to the table. For example, the time-honored Afghan
method of throat-cutting needed no CIA or U.S. congressional
authorization. It terrified Russian personnel met on the
battlefield or captured as hostages, many of whom preferred an
instant conversion to Islam over death by a dagger drawn across the
throat. The technique was also later exported, notably to Algeria,
and used there to sinister effect against the military and some
foreigners as well.
</P>
<P>
   One subject learned from the foreign instructors was indirect
sabotage. In the context of the Afghan war, this meant destroying
crops belonging to a tribe or village committed to the Soviets or
otherwise reducing or degrading the production at facilities
controlled by the Communist regime in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '90s, however, it became a favorite export of some
of the holy warriors, who, for example, tried to apply it to
destroy industrial enterprises _ especially those connected with
oil and natural gas _ benefiting foreign investors or the military
regime in Algeria, albeit without notable success.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition and arson was probably the most prized craft acquired
during the training for Afghanistan. This required detailed
knowledge about explosives and incendiary devices _ what kind, how
much, where placed, how triggered. It encompassed the making and/or
use of sophisticated fuses, timers and explosives; the creation of
fuel-and-fertilizer and other unconventional bombs; and
remote-control devices for triggering bombs and mines. These
capabilities were later transferred to the volunteers' home
countries; evidence of their mastery would crop up repeatedly in
actions against the Israelis in occupied Arab territory such as
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, under the U.S. presidency of George Bush, the CIA drank
champagne to celebrate victory of the anti-Soviet jihad. Indeed,
the Red Army had been defeated and ultimately sent home humiliated
by a volunteer army of religious believers who were disciplined
into a powerful force.
</P>
<P>
   But in the light of the next decade, that ``victory'' would come
into harsh question. The experience of the jihad _ and allying with
one another _ left indelible marks not only on the spirit of the
dying Soviet superpower, but also on the destinies of several
thriving nations.

</P>
<P>
   In August 1990, when Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces invaded
Kuwait, Osama bin Laden was shocked by the decision of King Fahd to
invite Americans to defend the Saudi kingdom. To him, it qualified
as treason.
</P>
<P>
   During the Afghan holy war, bin Laden had worked with Americans
to expel the Soviet ``Great Satan.'' But already he and his
acolytes had begun to prepare for far larger jihads to come _
targeted against impious Arab governments overly beholden to the
corrupt and satanic West.
</P>
<P>
   After the Soviet defeat in 1989, bin Laden left the Afghan
scene, without being drawn into the bloody struggles between rival
clan warlords. He returned to Saudi Arabia to tend to the family
construction business at its Jeddah head office. Reportedly, Prince
Turki bin Faisal al-Saud urged him to keep bankrolling the
mercenary volunteers based in Pakistan _ this to ensure survival of
a mobile strike force that could be used to fight Islamic causes
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, the scope of bin Laden's purposes likely very
much exceeded Turki's. Bin Laden was reorienting the training of
men in his Al Qaeda organization to specialize in urban guerrilla
warfare, aimed at destabilizing Western societies and governments.
And he was backing Islamic militants who had begun to challenge the
governments in Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, the Philippines and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Prince Turki reportedly reassured bin Laden that U.S.
troops would all withdraw from the kingdom as soon as Saddam
Hussein was defeated _ and they would not be stationed near the
Muslim holy places.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, when U.S. troops did not entirely leave, bin Laden
revolted against the royal family. Saudi security, already highly
uneasy about his activities, had held onto bin Laden's passport
during the 1989-91 period, hoping to prevent or at least discourage
his contacts with exiled Saudi dissidents, accusing the kingdom of
police corruption and abuse of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, along with a number of Afghan war veterans, bin Laden
moved to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, and was welcomed by Hassan
al-Turabi, the leader of Sudan's National Islamic Front (NIF).
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, bin Laden and his business associates had
been watching for investment opportunities in Sudan. Now, one of
his companies, Al-Hijrah for Construction and Development, Ltd.,
contracted to build a modern airport for Port Sudan, on the Red
Sea, and a highway link to Khartoum. His trading company, Wadi
al-Aqiq, Ltd., operating with his Taba Investment Co., obtained a
near monopoly over Sudan's main agricultural exports: gum arabica,
corn, and sunflower and sesame products.
</P>
<P>
   So too, his Al-Themar al-Mubarakah Agriculture Co., Ltd.
acquired large tracts of land near Khartoum and in eastern Sudan.
Together with affluent NIF members, bin Laden invested $50 million,
a controlling interest, in an Islamic bank.
</P>
<P>
   His work force included hundreds, perhaps thousands, of militant
veterans of the Afghan ``jihad,'' or holy war. By January 1994,
according to U.S. intelligence reports, bin Laden was financing at
least three guerrilla or terrorist training camps for Egyptian,
Algerian, Tunisian and Palestinian rebels, in cooperation with the
NIF.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his assets and construction projects, bin Laden
helped his hosts by facilitating purchases of Saudi oil for
cash-poor Sudanese at subsidized prices. He took a large house on
Al Mashal Street, in a suburban quarter of Khartoum, located near
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Following his arrival, messages flowed regularly between
Washington, Riyadh and Khartoum, asking Sudan's opposition leaders
to scale down and end, if possible, bin Laden's support of armed
guerrillas abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 bin Laden began to focus on the ancient and troubled
Arab country of Yemen, his father's birthplace. He began to channel
money, weapons and trained Afghan war veterans into North Yemen,
which was embroiled in a serious territorial dispute with Saudi
Arabia. The Saudi royal regime was supporting the secular-minded
South Yemenis in Aden against the North Yemenis in Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's Yemeni activities during this general period,
according to U.S. government reports, included financing a group of
insurgents who, in December 1992, attempted bombing attacks against
about 100 U.S. servicemen in Aden. The troops were billeted there
to support U.N. relief operations in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's followers began to work with other Saudi dissident
groups against the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia and the
gulf region, and against the Saudi royal family. His followers in
the kingdom would mingle and travel with pilgrims making the
``haj,'' or holy passage, to Mecca and Medina, especially those
returning to Egypt or Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden issued false passports and identity papers, as well as
work contacts, to facilitate travel of the ``Afghanis,'' as the
veterans came to be called. In 1993, for example, he paid for the
travel to Sudan of up to 400 loyal veterans, who were threatened
with a crackdown by Pakistan, now under pressure from Egypt,
Algeria and other countries they were targeting.
</P>
<P>
   A branch of Al Qaeda _ the organization of exiled radical
Islamic leaders bin Laden had founded in the early '80s _ grew up
in Sudan to shelter and accommodate the new immigrants. Bin Laden
continued to finance them and to extend the training many had
already begun in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian intelligence, which had been concentrating on keeping
the Afghanis out, by maintaining tight checks on the Sudanese and
Libyan borders, realized that actually the leaks were coming from
Saudi Arabia. In April 1993, President Mubarak of Egypt made a
special visit to Riyadh to complain about bin Laden's support for
Egyptian subversives.
</P>
<P>
   In the same year, the Peshawar-based Islamic terrorist groups in
Egypt increased their attacks on policemen, judges, Coptic
Christians, foreign tourists and other human targets. At the end of
May 1993, the Egyptian Interior Ministry, announcing the arrest of
more than 800 suspects and the dismantling of a major terrorist
network, added that bin Laden was financing a new group called
``Belonging to the Jihad.''
</P>
<P>
   In another investigation, conducted with the Saudi authorities,
the Egyptians disclosed that the bin Laden companies were
channeling money to Egyptian rebels to buy printing presses,
weapons and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Saudi royal family decided to yield to the urgent
strictures of President Mubarak and the Americans. On April 7,
1994, after a special visit by President Mubarak to complain about
bin Laden to King Fahd, and a reported request to Interpol, the
International Police Organization, by Yemen for assistance in
apprehending bin Laden, the Saudi royal family went public.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah clearly proclaimed that hard-core Islamic
elements, preaching violence and linked to Egypt's covert groups,
were no longer welcome. King Fahd announced that bin Laden was
being stripped of citizenship ``because of his irresponsible
behavior that contradicts the interests of Saudi Arabia and harms
sisterly countries, and his refusal to obey instructions issued to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, 1994, Youssef M. Ibrahim of The New York Times
reported that Saudi officials had also moved to freeze bin Laden's
assets inside the kingdom, though he was ``believed to control
millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts.'' The Times' report
added that the decision against bin Laden appeared to signal to
other less visible Saudi financial tycoons to cut their ties with
militants in Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Such support, Ibrahim wrote, frequently takes the guise of
Islamic charity works, the building of mosques or the starting of
businesses that are used as channels to pump money into the
militants' war chests.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these funds, already flowing into Pakistan and
Afghanistan since the decade of the jihad, were still being used as
late as 1997 to finance the terrorist and guerrilla training camps
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after King Fahd's action against bin Laden, some
newsmen covering the Middle East, including the author, received a
fax message originating in London. It announced that Mr. Osama bin
Laden had opened an office there. The fax bore his signature in
English and Arabic, and that of a man designated in London as his
office manager.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, bin Laden was linked to the ``Committee for Advice
and Reform,'' a London-based Saudi opposition network which, in the
later 1990s, issued more than 1,000 pamphlets and tracts attacking
the royal government and the House of Saud, often in violent terms.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden never publicly responded to the condemnation by his
eldest brother, Bakr bin Laden, who expressed in the Saudi media
his family's ``regret, denunciation and condemnation'' of his
younger brother's extremist activities.
</P>
<P>
   Until forced to depart from Sudan under American and Saudi
pressure in 1996, bin Laden expanded his wealth and global network
of political, banking and terrorist contacts.

</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, the U.S. State Department issued a
standard and rather tardy fact sheet on Osama bin Laden. It
provided many interesting details about his career as a master of
Islamic extremism and anti-American terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But it omitted the background facts that help to explain his
early and close connections to the United States, which had
enlisted his talents and fortune to aid the attack on Communist
invaders in the Afghan holy war.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, bin Laden met with at least four senior
radical Islamic leaders: Ayman el-Zawahri, chief of Egypt's
Al-Gihad; Abdul Salem Mohammed, chief of an extremist group in
Bangladesh; Fadi Errahmane Khalil, emir of the Pakistani Harakat
Ansar; and the Egyptian exile Abu Yassir Ahmed Taha, representing
Islamic groups in Arab North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   These men and some aides set up an ``International Islamic
Struggle Front'' dedicated to fighting ``the Jews'' _ i.e., Israel
and all its friends and allies. They issued a ``fatwa,'' or death
sentence, declaring it to be legitimate to kill any American,
civilian or military.
</P>
<P>
   That spring, a horrified Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud, a
close boyhood friend of bin Laden, flew to Afghanistan to see
Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban chief. He asked Omar to arrange a
meeting with bin Laden, who was installed near the village of
Khost, by the Pakistan border. There, Prince Turki reminded bin
Laden that although he had been deprived of Saudi citizenship, no
steps had been taken against his family in Saudi Arabia, and surely
it was time for a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   But the prince returned to Riyadh empty-handed, except for the
assurance from Omar that he would try to calm his guest. Indeed,
bin Laden offered to leave Afghanistan, if his presence was
bothering the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' Omar is said to have responded. ``You are one of us,
and you will stay with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the real assault on America would begin. On
the morning of Aug. 7, 1998, truck bombs devastated the area around
the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
The bombs killed 224 people and injured more than 4,500. As the
world watched, the injured lay traumatized by shock, in pools of
blood. Nairobi's hospitals were crammed beyond capacity with
emergency cases: men, women and children, blinded, and mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, which were perceived almost immediately to bear the
signature of Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda organization, founded
in Afghanistan in the early '80s, should not have been a surprise
to the U.S. intelligence establishment.
</P>
<P>
   A few insiders and some journalists had noted a warning that was
broadcast widely only about 24 hours before the attacks. It was not
signed by bin Laden, or Al Qaeda, or the ``International Islamic
Struggle Front,'' created months earlier for the purpose of an
anti-American jihad.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Egypt's Al-Gihad, the extremist organization
responsible for President Anwar al-Sadat's murder in 1981 and much
terrorism inside Egypt, cautioned that it was about to take
reprisals against the United States. The reason, it said, was that
the CIA had aided in the arrest in Albania of several Egyptian
Islamic militants, some of whom were already condemned to death.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, where President Clinton was under heavy fire for
his affair with a former White House intern and perjury accusations
against him by independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr, the U.S.
administration was suddenly galvanized.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 FBI agents and other intelligence teams and
military units, including medical rescue teams, and even Israeli
troops from Israel, were airborne for East Africa within hours.
Reports were coming in of threats to other U.S. embassies,
including those in Kampala and Tirana, Albania. Later, these and a
number of other U.S. diplomatic missions were temporarily
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days, two suspects, a naturalized Kenyan of
Palestinian birth named Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohammed Rashed
Daoud al-Owhali, a Yemeni, were apprehended. Odeh was arrested in
Pakistan after flying out of Nairobi, and was returned quickly
after confessing a degree of guilt to Pakistani police. Al-Owhali
was seized in Kenya. Both were packed off in handcuffs on military
aircraft to New York, where they were charged with murder,
complicity in murder, use of munitions of massive power and
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Also soon arrested was Abdullah Mohammed Fadhul, from the
Comoros, a republic of islands off East Africa. He, as did the
others, admitted belonging to bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the Aug. 7 bombings, Clinton summoned his national
security advisor, Sandy Berger, and called back from Italy
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had been attending the
gala wedding of CNN's chief international correspondent, Christiane
Amanpour, and State Department spokesman James Rubin. Defense
Secretary William Cohen, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. Hugh
Shelton, and the latest of a long series of rapidly changing CIA
directors, George Tenet, were also called to join the crisis
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Clinton decided to strike back at two places
regarded as strongholds of bin Laden, implicated as the originator
of the embassy attacks by the suspect Odeh. The first strike would
be in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was in the protective custody of
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   It was decided not to risk any American personnel or aircraft,
but to use the weapon already fired against Saddam Hussein in Iraq
during the Persian Gulf War: the remotely-guided Tomahawk cruise
missile.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 would be launched, from U.S. Navy ships in the Red Sea
and the Indian Ocean, at three of bin Laden's camps near Khost.
There was a base camp, a support camp and a terrorist training
camp, all named Zhawar Kili Al-Badr, arranged in a rough isosceles
triangle a few miles inside Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Eerily, these were some of the same facilities planned and
designed by the CIA and Pakistan's Interservices Intelligence
Directorate (ISI) to be used for training the holy warriors back in
the Afghan war.
</P>
<P>
   The second target for the missiles was the al-Shifa
pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, Sudan. Administration spokesmen
claimed they had firm evidence it was under bin Laden's influence,
if not financial control. They said it was cooperating with the
Iraqi chemical-weapons program and producing ethyl
methylphosphothionate, an important ingredient of VX nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   Codenamed ``Infinite Reach,'' the cruise-missile strike was
launched on Aug. 20, with varied reports back about the casualties
and damage. According to Taliban accounts, about 20 guerrilla
fighters were killed in the camps, not including bin Laden, who was
absent.
</P>
<P>
   Some Washington sources said the United States was aware of his
absence, through its overhead satellite surveillance and electronic
monitoring of his radio-telephone traffic. Many agreed that a dead
bin Laden would be far more dangerous, rising to the status of a
martyr and stirring supporters to more frenzied acts of vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   After the al-Shifa raid, Sudan's government and the factory
owners unanimously and vehemently denied that the plant was used to
manufacture anything other than prescription medicines, vitamins
and other pharmaceuticals badly needed in Sudan's impoverished
society. They also denied that bin Laden had a controlling
financial interest in the plant.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later The New York Times, The Washington Post and
some Washington officials who had fed them news leaks began to back
off the story. They acknowledged that a dreadful error might have
been made in the attack on Khartoum, although Washington staunchly
resisted Sudan's demand for an on-the-spot investigation by U.N.
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1999, Salih Idris, the Saudi businessman who
owned the al-Shifa plant, was suing the U.S. government in the
Federal Court of Claims for $30 million in compensation for
destruction of his property.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, by late July, 17 people had been charged with roles
in the embassy bombings. Five were being held in New York for
trial; three in Britain; nine, including bin Laden, were fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, was extradited from
Germany to the United States, and charged with murder, conspiracy
and use of a weapon of mass destruction. Salim's arrest added a
nuclear aspect to the pattern of international conspiracy being
woven around bin Laden. Salim, described as a founding member of Al
Qaeda, was arrested on Sept. 16 at a car dealership outside Munich
on a tip from Interpol in Washington. He was identified as a
financial advisor and weapons procurer for bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   According to New York court documents, a group including Salim
had tried to obtain components for nuclear weapons, including
enriched uranium, to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   It also emerged that the bin Laden organization apparently had
tentacles into the U.S. armed forces. A former Army sergeant, Ali
A. Mohamed, was secretly arrested in September and held in the
Manhattan Metropolitan Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ali left the U.S. Army after a three-year term in 1989. He had
earned a Parachute Badge and an expert M-16 rifleman's badge, and
taught soldiers in the U.S. Special Forces at Fort Bragg, N.C.,
about Muslim culture. Earlier, in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sudan,
he trained members of Al Qaeda in urban and guerilla fighting.
</P>
<P>
   On July 12, 1999, Ibrahim Hussein Eidarous, 42, and Adel
Mohammed Abdul Bary, 39 _ two of bin Laden's Egyptian followers _
were rounded up and appeared in court in London. A British
magistrate said originals of faxes to three news organizations,
which claimed responsibility for the embassy blasts and bore the
men's fingerprints, were found at the London offices of a Saudi
dissident group.
</P>
<P>
   Another suspect arrested in London, Khalid al-Fawwaz, a Saudi
national, allegedly agreed with bin Laden and others to kill
Americans anywhere in the world, especially diplomats and military
men.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Clinton administration officials have ordered special
alerts at U.S. installations around the world for Aug. 7, 1999, the
one-year anniversary of the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   On July 30, 1999, the Afghan Islamic News Agency announced that
bin Laden, who was said to fear a Pakistan-based raid by U.S.
commando troops to capture or kill him, would leave Afghanistan for
any friendly Muslim country that would receive him.
</P>
<P>
   The question facing the world was: What ruler or government
would be intrepid enough to offer protection or asylum to such a
dangerous guest?

<P>
   On Sept. 3, 1998, a month after the U.S. Embassy bombings in
East Africa, FBI director Louis J. Freeh gave, in congressional
testimony, both a retrospective and a preview of official U.S.
government views about the Afghan war veterans' terrorist assault
against America.
</P>
<P>
   As lead anti-terrorist agency since 1995, the FBI was now
actively working with its new Counterterrorism Center, and a number
of other U.S. military and civilian intelligence and security
agencies, in a new permanent consultative committee operating under
tight security wraps in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Freeh cited the trend in anti-American
terrorist attacks ``toward large-scale incidents designed for
maximum destruction, terror and impact.'' He recalled how the
threat of ``jihad'' in America had finally been made real by the
February 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that although there were no American victims in the
November '97 attack on foreign tourists at the Temple of Luxor, in
Egypt, still there were signs that the assault was meant to force
the release of the blind cleric, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, from
prison in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh recalled that Rahman and his associates, aside from a role
in plotting the World Trade Center bombing, had been convicted in
1995 for plotting to murder President Mubarak during a visit to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The same group was caught red-handed mixing fertilizer and fuel
oil _ one of the old reliable recipes from the CIA manuals for
training in Afghanistan _ to make a lethal, do-it-yourself,
home-grown bomb of great power. Their goal was to destroy United
Nations buildings, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels and police and
FBI headquarters, among other targets in New York. Freeh might have
added, but didn't, that they also had discussed assassinating some
leading pro-Israel congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also failed to mention the Afghanistan connection, a
subject generally taboo. Indeed, during a 1993 television
broadcast, New York's regional FBI director, Robert Fox, had
mentioned the CIA's earlier training of several of the World Trade
Center bombers _ and, by coincidence, found himself transferred
several weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   As for missions inside the United States, Freeh dealt with
another category of terrorism _ by ``autonomous, generally
transnational'' organizations. These have their own personnel,
financing and training facilities and are able to plan and mount
operations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh noted that Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah (the Party of
God), Egypt's al-Gania'a and the Palestinian Hamas all had
supporters within the United States. Hezbollah, he recalled, had
been behind the 1983 truck bombings of the U.S. Embassy and Marine
barracks in Lebanon and the bombing of a second U.S. Embassy in
East Beirut in 1984, as well as detention of U.S. hostages in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's next category of terrorism was ``locally affiliated,''
although global in scope. Such terrorists might pose, Freeh said,
the most urgent threat because they ``are often organized on an ad
hoc, temporary basis, making them difficult for law enforcement to
infiltrate or track. They can also exploit the mobility that
technology and the lack of a rigorous base structure offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, Freeh recalled, the FBI had investigated
leading ``extra-territorial'' cases of terrorism. These included
the June 25, 1996 truck-bombing of the U.S. servicemen's Khobar
Towers apartment complex in Saudi Arabia and, finally, the East
African bombings of August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Khobar Towers truck-bombing, which killed 19 American airmen
and wounded about 500 people, forced the relocation of Air Force
personnel still living there, in their capacity to service
overflights of Iraq and other air operations, from the Saudi
Dhahran Air Base to distant al-Kharj.
</P>
<P>
   That case remains unsolved. However, the Saudis executed four
men, who confessed to blowing up a Saudi-U.S. joint military office
facility in Riyadh on Nov. 13, 1995, killing three U.S. civilians
and two soldiers, and wounding about 60 other people including
civilian passers-by. Three of the four executed culprits, the
Saudis announced, had confessed their adherence to Osama bin
Laden's network.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also referred to terrorist ``renditions,'' by which he
meant those captured abroad and returned to the United States for
trial. He cited the case of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, an Afghan war
veteran, who ordered the chemicals for the World Trade Center
Bombing. Yousef was seized in a bin Laden-owned hotel in Pakistan
by U.S. and Pakistani agents. On Feb. 7, 1995, he was extradited to
New York for trial and later sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also cited the case of Mir Amal Kansi, 33, yet another
Afghan war veteran, who shot and killed two CIA employees outside
CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., a month before the World Trade
Center bombing. Tracked down by the FBI and probably other U.S.
services, Kansi was seized in Pakistan _ touching off reprisal
killings of several Americans in Karachi a short time later. He was
flown to the United States for trial on June 17, 1995 and sentenced
to death in Virginia, the scene of his crime. Kansi's case was
pending appeal in late July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, having finally recognized the threat
of the ``Afghanis'' _ or what some prefer to call the ``blowback''
of U.S. involvement in the Afghan war _ moved to appoint a new
anti-terrorism ``czar'' in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In early September 1998, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
swore in William Crowe, the former ambassador to Britain, as
chairman of two Accountability Review Boards, loaded with senior
specialists in anti-terrorism, to investigate the embassy bombings.
In a report he and Albright publicized on Jan. 8, 1999, Crowe found
no fault with U.S. security personnel, but said the United States
was correcting serious security deficiencies at U.S. embassies
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government of Pakistan, through whose airspace
the attacking U.S. Tomahawk missiles had passed on Aug. 20, fired
its intelligence chief. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government
had lost face by having to retract a false report that at least one
missile landed near a Pakistani nuclear site.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the blowback from Afghanistan was the
financing of the jihad, and its export, by the cultivation,
processing and traffic of drugs. By the late 1990s, a vast tide of
drugs flowing out of Afghanistan and Pakistan to Europe, the
Americas and the Far East _ opium, morphine base and even refined
heroin, to say nothing of marijuana in various forms _ had reached
truly epic proportions. Its impact was felt from the inner cities
of America and Europe to the once-rich ``Tiger'' economies of the
Far East, as well as in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the victorious Afghan leaders, who turned to
slaughtering one another after the Soviet withdrawal, had built a
huge international drug network in the 1980s. This turned the
opium-producing Golden Crescent countries _ Afghanistan, Iran and
Pakistan _ into an Aladdin's cave of riches.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the expanding wealth helped to finance guerrilla wars and
terrorist actions in Algeria, Bosnia, Egypt, Kashmir, the
Philippines and other places. Second, it assured a handful of the
post-1990 terrorist leaders _ the generals and tycoons of world
terrorism _ that they'd have fabulous incomes and luxurious
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the sale and resale of U.S.-made weapons, from
rifles to Stinger missiles, and other commodities of all
descriptions, initially sent free to the Afghan holy warriors via
their Pakistani sponsors, but often reaching private arms dealers.
</P>
<P>
   American weapons and munitions were diverted and abused on a
massive scale _ sold to raise funds for insurgents' field supplies,
or simply for personal profit. Even casual visitors to the bazaars
in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier province keep finding these
weapons, for sale to any buyer with the necessary cash.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, rather than creating gratitude, the American
support for the war in Afghanistan led to aroused hatred toward
U.S. policies and fueled the assault on America led by bin Laden
and his disciples. The holy alliance of the Americans and the
Islamic forces against the Soviets would precede a series of unholy
wars and epidemics of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-fated Soviet invasion of 1979 would be one final error
of a dying superpower. It gave America an opening for a crusade,
conducted by Muslim mercenaries who then turned on their
benefactors and employers. But tragically, the world will continue
to experience this blowback well into the 21st century. And there
will be devastating consequences for world peace.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps future governments, whether in the United States, Great
Britain, Russia or less powerful nations, will take to heart an
important lesson of late-20th-century history: When you decide to
go to war against your main enemy, take a good look at the allies,
friends or mercenary fighters behind you. Look well to see whether
they already have unsheathed their knives _ and are pointing them
at your back.

Ariz., developer to clear a section four times as big so that

   MARKET (New York) _ Stocks fell sharply this morning after the
Labor Department reported that labor costs rose in the second
quarter at their fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 1997.
Productivity growth rose at a 1.3 percent annual rate, a sharper
slowdown than expected. By early afternoon stocks had recovered,
with the Dow up 46 points, the S&AMP;P 500 and NASDAQ little changed.
The 30-year Treasury bond was yielding 6.08 percent. European
markets were lower, with London down 2.22 percent and Frankfurt
down 2.78 percent. Tokyo stocks closed down 1.85 percent, and in

   DATA-STARTUPS (Eatontown, N.J.) _ Spurred on by the voracious
global appetite for advanced data services, dozens, perhaps
hundreds, of start-up companies like Tachion Networks are seeking
to supply the new technologies underlying the communications
revolution. What's unusual about the emergence of companies like
Tachion is that unlike Web companies, which have drawn its
management strength from established financial and commercial
enterprises, communications start-ups have had a harder time
drawing from the industry's behemoths. That lack of industry
pollination has been particularly striking in New Jersey, home to
Bell Labs, AT&AMP;T and the Science Applications International
Corporation's Telcordia unit. Should Tachion, based in Eatontown
and with a core of former Bell Labs engineers, be successful, all
that might change. By Seth Schiesel.

   SAFRICA-EMPOWERMENT (Johannesburg) _ New Africa Investments
Ltd., South Africa's oldest and largest ``black empowerment

<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ Woodstock '99 concertgoers, outraged at the
behavior of the few hundred who burned and destroyed the venue last
week, are now getting back at them.
</P>
<P>
   As the New York State Police continues to investigate the
crimes, hundreds of people have called or e-mailed tips to the
police about the identity of some of the perpetrators. The police
now have so many leads they've doubled the number of investigators
to 10, are questioning suspects in Virginia and Maryland, and are
considering trips to Pennsylvania, Vermont and parts of New York
state as well.
</P>
<P>
   The police had received 155 tips by e-mail as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten many possible leads,'' said State Police Capt.
John Wood. ``We're going to do what we can to make an arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood also said a third person died Sunday from medical problems
that occurred during Woodstock, the musical festival that took
place at a former Air Force base in upstate New York the weekend of
July 23-25. Frank Cooper, 31, of St. Petersburg, Fla., was
hospitalized July 24, and died from complications of both diabetes
and heat-related hyperthermia.
</P>
<P>
   Rioters caused several million dollars in damage at the end of
the three-day Woodstock festival in Rome by tearing down speakers,
setting fire to 12 tractor-trailer rigs and looting vendor booths.
Authorities say less than 500 of the 250,000 concertgoers actually
took part in the mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Explanations for their behavior have ranged from the heavy music
to the heat, from the high prices of food and water to the three
days worth of garbage that filled the venue.
</P>
<P>
   Since the riot, the police posted 14 photographs on their
Website. More than 4,200 people have logged on to the site,
``www.troopers.state.ny.us.''
</P>
<P>
   The pictures that have generated the most responses are the
clearest _ those that show people breaking into Ace Hardware Store
tractor-trailers, two people smashing and reaching into an ATM
machine and a man trying to break into a pay telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Perpetrators could face charges from misdemeanor larceny charges
to felonies like arson. How serious the charges are would depend on
whether authorities would decide to try to extradite the suspect
from another state, Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have somebody in California who committed an arson that
caused $1.5 million in damage,'' he said, ``I'm quite sure we'll go
out to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Many concertgoers were angered by the riots. On an Internet
site, discussion of the riot has generated hundreds of responses,
with many of them criticizing the few hundred who took part in the
destruction. When one woman wrote to take credit for setting one of
the fires, another responded that he had forwarded her letter to
the police _ a response applauded by others.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the State Police Internal Affairs is still
investigating allegations that state troopers posed with nude
female concertgoers during the riots. So far, one supervisor has
been suspended. No other officers have so far been implicated, said
Lt. Jamie Mills, a spokeswoman for the police.
</P>
<P>
   Also, cleanup of the Woodstock site continues, with help from
some 20 refugees from the Mohawk Valley Resource Center for
Refugees.

INVESTORS PUMP MONEY INTO NEW INTERNET VENTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The recent Internet stock woes do not seem to be
slowing down private investors, who are pouring an unprecedented
amount of cash into new Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to VentureOne, a venture capital research company in
San Francisco, 565 Internet startups raked in $6.3 billion in
venture capital during the first six months of this year. Venture
capital firms raise and invest money in budding companies in
exchange for stock or other ownership interests. They've been the
major supporters of the burgeoning Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   The six-month amount exceeded the $5.7 billion invested in
on-line companies during all of 1998. It also topped the amount
that venture capital firms pumped into Internet startups in 1997
and 1996 combined.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of investment continues despite the shaky performance
of stocks of Internet companies, highlighted by this week's
lackluster market debut of four on-line ventures:
1-800-Flowers.com, BigStar Entertainment, Splitrock Services and
Quotesmith.com. All finished their first trading days below their
offering prices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stock sag, ``it's full steam ahead on the Internet
as far as venture capitalists are concerned,'' said Rolf Selvig,
director of Business Development at VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
   Selvig said that Internet companies specializing in
business-to-business services were ``very hot'' with venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   According to the VentureOne survey, new on-line companies
accounted for $2.2 billion of the $6.3 billion raised during the
first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists, Selvig added, are unfazed by the current
Internet stock market slouch because they are focusing on the
future, not on an individual company's historical performance.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Golden, a partner in the Palo Alto-based Accel Partners
venture capital firm, said the astounding rate of investment
indicates that, despite a market downturn, the Internet still has a
very bright future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bet is over the long term,'' Golden said. ``We look at
on-line opportunities independent of market cycles. We don't take
one-dimensional snapshots. We look out over the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   The flow of venture capital money into Internet startups was
especially heavy in the second quarter, totally $3.8 billion. That
represented a 170 percent increase over the second quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The VentureOne survey also pointed out how the Internet was
gobbling up private investor dollars. During 1995, $6.3 billion in
venture capital was invested into all U.S. startups. At that time,
Internet companies accounted for only 15 percent of that total.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, startup funding had increased to $13 billion,
and 44 percent went to Internet companies. During the first half of
this year, Internet startups grabbed 55 percent of the $11.4
billion invested in newly public companies.

   OUTDOOR-THEATER (New York) _ On Monday night, like generations
of actors before me, I played a fairy. Not just any fairy, mind
you, but Fairy No. 6, one of the midnight sprites, a bit player in
the sultriest Shakespeare comedy, ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' As
such, I joined the members of the city's acting fraternity who
spill out of theaters and into the great outdoors every summer,
tossing aside their fine-tuned elocution and 10-step relaxation
exercises in exchange for the big gestures and shouting over
traffic noise, which are the hallmarks of open-air theater. By

   ART-IN-WASHINGTON (Washington) _ For out-of-town visitors,
summer in Washington can mean many things: monuments and documents,
a babel of regional accents, First Family photo ops (though these
are rare), and the sight of local office workers jogging at
lunchtime on the National Mall _ up and down, up and down _ no
matter how hot the weather. But summer also means art, and plenty
of it. Washington is a serious museum city. There's the National
Gallery of Art, of course. And the Smithsonian Institution covers a
wealth of cultural bases. The nation's collections of African,
African-American and Asian art are under its auspices, as is the
Hirshhorn Museum, a showcase for contemporary work. That's just a
partial list. Throw in privately financed outfits like the Corcoran
Gallery and the table is set for a feast. By Holland Cotter.

summer, festival organizers mount an ambitious schedule of new

 &HT;    CONGRESSMEN TRIED TO SCUTTLE MY LAI TRIALS, PROSECUTOR SAYS
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic leaders of the House Armed Services
Committee tried to scuttle military trials so no American soldiers
would be tried for war crimes in the 1968 My Lai massacre during
the Vietnam War, a former Army prosecutor said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The late Reps. F. Edward Hebert of Louisiana and L. Mendel
Rivers of South Carolina ``decided these trials were detrimental to
the interests of the United States'' and ``calculatingly'' sought
``to sabotage them,'' said William Eckhardt, a retired Army colonel
who served as a prosecutor in several cases stemming from My Lai.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhardt spoke at a publication press conference for ``The
Forgotten Hero of My Lai,'' a biography of Hugh Thompson, the Army
helicopter pilot who, with his crew, has belatedly been credited
with stopping the infamous military operation that killed 504
Vietnamese civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The book details how Hebert and Rivers called virtually everyone
involved in the My Lai incident before their investigating
subcommittee and then classified the testimony. By refusing to
release the accounts of over 100 witnesses to defense attorneys,
the congressmen provided potential grounds for dismissal of charges
against the five soldiers who were court-martialed, Eckhardt
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The legal maneuver failed, but only First Lt. William Calley, a
platoon leader, was convicted. Many Americans considered Calley a
scapegoat and his sentence was eventually reduced to about three
years under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In their efforts to thwart a trial, the two congressmen also
tried to discredit Thompson, who landed his helicopter between
American soldiers and Vietnamese civilians to stop the killing, the
book says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another key to sabotaging the prosecution was to get Hugh
Thompson,'' Eckhardt recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal case became intertwined with ``a cultural civil
war'' being waged over the Vietnam War, said Eckhardt. The antiwar
movement believed massacres such as My Lai were everyday
occurrences _ which Eckhardt called ``malarkey'' _ and
conservatives such as Rivers and Hebert wrongly assumed American
soldiers would not commit such atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   The 248-page biography, written by Trent Angers, a veteran
Louisiana journalist, traces Thompson's life from his birth in
Atlanta in 1943 through his adolescence in Stone Mountain, Ga., and
his 20-year Army career.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades after the massacre, Thompson and his gunner, Larry
Colburn, received the Soldier's Medal for heroism at a ceremony at
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. The other gunner on
the helicopter, Glenn Andreotta, was honored posthumously. He was
killed in Vietnam three weeks after the My Lai incident.
</P>
<P>
   The book concludes that the My Lai killings were only the first
stage of a chilling operation that would have left many more
civilians dead had not Thompson raised a ruckus upon his return to
headquarters that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game plan of Task Force Barker was to permanently get rid
of the Viet Cong from a large area of Quang Ngai Province. My Lai-4
was only the starting point. It was but one subhamlet of one hamlet
in one village in the target area,'' Anger wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going from village to village to village to clear it
out. There were no provisions for prisoners of war,'' the author
said at the press conference. ``The orders were to kill
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is an authorized biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the story of my life,'' said Thompson, who joked that
``it even tells some things I didn't want brought out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Forgotten Hero of My Lai: The Hugh Thompson Story'' is
published by Acadian House Publishing of Lafayette, La.

 WANTED: ANAKIN SKYWALKER _ AND OTHER PROBLEMS CASTING `STAR WARS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., AUG. 16, 1999) 
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Jake Lloyd
with Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor in ``Star Wars: The Phantom
Menace.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    So, how did Anakin Skywalker end up on that godforsaken planet,
Tatooine?
 &HT;    Beats us. But how Jake Lloyd wound up there, playing Anakin ...
well, that would be on account of Robin Gurland.
 &HT;    ``It was my job to find all the cast, from the principals down
to the smallest speaking role,'' casting director Gurland says by
telephone from her northern-California office. ``I generally work
with the writer, producer and director _ and in this case they were
one person, George Lucas, which made it very pleasant.
 &HT;    ``My task was to creatively come up with who I felt would be
appropriate for each role,'' she continues. ``After that, it
flipped to the business side of casting, which was dealing with
contract negotiations, scheduling and finalizing the cast.''
 &HT;    Gurland, a veteran casting director, came aboard ``Star Wars:
The Phantom Menace'' as an independent contractor in July 1995. She
remained with the project until April 1999, collaborating with
Lucas through principal photography and the looping process.
 &HT;    Watching the finished film in a theater, Gurland recalls, was a
surreal experience.
 &HT;    ``I usually don't watch films I cast,'' she says, ``because I
come with such a history that it's hard to have an objective eye
when the actors are on screen. Because this film was so
all-encompassing and took a couple of years, I felt like a mother
hen, very protective of my cast and proud of them.''
 &HT;    In casting Qui-Gon, Gurland originally contemplated selecting an
American actor to play a role that needed ``someone like Liam
Neeson.'' But she and Lucas started to focus on Neeson himself,
coincidentally, just as he mentioned in an interview that he was
interested in the project.
 &HT;    Natalie Portman was the first and only choice as Queen Amidala,
Gurland reports, but choosing an Obi-Wan Kenobi was far trickier.
 &HT;    ``Alec Guinness put his imprint on the character,'' Gurland
says. ``We didn't want a spot-on mimic of Guinness. The actor
needed to play Obi-Wan as a young man who will have 30 years of
experience under his belt by the time the films match up.
 &HT;    ``I'd been watching Ewan for a while, and met him even before
`Trainspotting,''' she says. ``He's an amazing actor. He had to
create someone who'd grow into Obi-Wan, and I think Ewan did that
beautifully.''
 &HT;    The most controversial choices were Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks
and Lloyd as Anakin. Many fans and most critics detested the Jar
Jar character and were underwhelmed by Lloyd's performance.
 &HT;    ``I think Ahmed brought such life to Jar Jar,'' Gurland says.
``Initially, I was ... not defensive, but I was quite astounded by
the reaction and how people put their own perceptions onto the
film. And how wrong they were.
 &HT;    ``After a couple of months I realized that it was ridiculous,''
she adds, ``that people have to take the film for what it is, and
that I can't worry about what everybody reads into it.
 &HT;    ``I had to let it go and realize what good work was done by
Ahmed within the context of the film,'' she concludes. ``Jar Jar is
a comic-relief character geared to kids, and both in movement and
nuance Ahmed gave him life.''
 &HT;    Gurland discovered Lloyd when he was 5 years old.
 &HT;    ``Jake is breathtakingly beautiful and has an impish, whimsical
quality,'' she says. ``You'd believe he had mechanical skills. He
was just spot-on the character.''
 &HT;    She naturally disagrees with the critics of Lloyd, whom one wag
dubbed ``Mannequin Skywalker.''
 &HT;    ``You're asking the wrong person,'' Gurland replies. ``I'd, of
course, say they're unfair because I brought him into the fold. I
just don't understand what people were looking for and what, beyond
Jake's performance, there could be.
 &HT;    ``To me, with the criticism of the film, I see it as a bigger
issue of how we tend to bring things up just to knock them down,''
she says. ``That sounds cliche and trite, but this film has again
proved that theory.''
 &HT;    Lucas obviously appreciated Gurland's efforts, as she's already
signed to handle the casting for the next two episodes. She expects
to begin sometime in September, after Lucas finishes the next
script.
 &HT;    Lloyd will not be back as Anakin, because the second episode
picks up 10 years after ``Phantom Menace,'' setting up the most
controversial casting search since Scarlett O'Hara.
 &HT;    ``I get about 20 calls a day now,'' Gurland says, laughing.
``I've got people saying, `I've never acted before, and I want to
be your new Anakin.'
 &HT;    ``I'm just now starting to get some agent calls, but I'm telling
everybody that nothing is being done until at least September.''
 &HT;    So those pesky rumors about James Van Der Beek or Leonardo
DiCaprio aren't true?
 &HT;    ``I just shake my head at them,'' Gurland says. ``At first it
would bother me, and I'd want to set the record straight. Now I
just think, `Whatever ... '''

 c.1999 The Chicago Sun-Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   With the exception of the late John Kennedy Jr., Tina Brown is
the most famous magazine editor the world has known in the last few
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is such a pop icon that she was the partial inspiration
for the Kristin Scott-Thomas character in ``The Horse Whisperer,''
the sun-dappled, nine-hour classic in which Robert Redford,
Scott-Thomas and the troubled horse all had the same tasteful
blonde highlights in their respective manes.
</P>
<P>
   She's British. She's fabulous. She's famous. From the New Yorker
to Vanity Fair to the mega-hyped Talk magazine, Brown has displayed
an uncanny genius for promoting herself and her product.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent buzz is, for the most part, warranted. When you
debut your publication with an interview in which a delusional
Hillary Clinton traces her husband's serial philandering to
shouting matches between his mom and grandmama more than four
decades ago, you've got yourself one heckuva ``get.'' (I mean, who
gave Hillary that strategy, Eleanor Roosevelt?)
</P>
<P>
   So everybody is talking about Talk magazine. Dozens of columns,
hundreds of stories, thousands of sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm not sure that most of the people who have been
talking about Talk magazine have actually read Talk magazine _ even
though reading, I believe, is still the basic point of a print
publication, even in this age of multimedia symmetry.
</P>
<P>
   The reason most people haven't read it is because it's not
available in 95 percent of the country. In fact it won't be on
newsstands in Chicago until the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but why wait. I'll be glad to share my copy with you.
</P>
<P>
   No need to dwell on the interview with Mrs. Clinton, other than
to suggest that she stop invoking ``vast right-wing conspiracies''
and kitchen table screaming fights from 1952 when rationalizing her
husband's tendency to drop his trousers at the slightest hint of
possible action. How about saying, ``He screwed around but I still
love him, and beyond that it's nobody's business and I'm never
talking about it again''? Real-world voters would appreciate
something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Clinton feature is only the second-most fascinating
article in the premiere issue. The most insanely intriguing piece
is the profile of the grief-stricken and apparently bonkers
Mohammed Al Fayed, who has become obsessed with solving the
``murder'' of his son Dodi and Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   According to Al Fayed, the car accident was no accident at all _
it was a carefully orchestrated assassination masterminded by the
``Nazi sympathizer'' Prince Philip and carried out by M16, the
British international intelligence agency, with the help of the
CIA, who provided a built-to-order Fiat that played a key role in
the deadly mission.
</P>
<P>
   Right. Either that, or a drunken limo driver crashed in a tunnel
while trying to avoid a pack of reckless paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of Talk's debut include a chilling report about
the murders of several young girls in a Mexican border town; yet
another profile of the overexposed George W. Bush; several funny
essays; a collection of photos of the young JFK Jr., taken by
renowned photographer Peter Beard in the early 1970s; and lots of
pictures of movie stars, including a two-page color shot of
America's sweetheart, Academy Award winner Gwyneth Paltrow,
fondling a riding crop while wearing a skimpy leather bikini, her
hair swept up in some sort of bizarre
David-Bowie-circa-Ziggy-Stardust deal. (Paltrow's ``Shakespeare in
Love'' was a Miramax film; Miramax is part-owner of Talk. So there
you go.)
</P>
<P>
   Big-name veterans and sharp young talents abound. Tom Stoppard,
Peter Maass, Michael Korda, Christopher Buckley, Martin Amis.
</P>
<P>
   But patience and tenacity are required just to reach the
articles. I waded through nearly 50 pages of advertisements and
mastheads before finally reaching the first feature _ a nearly
incomprehensible photo essay about what to wear ringside at a
championship boxing match. It was another 10 pages of gunk before
``the conversation,'' an opening collection of snippets ``exploring
news and investigating pleasure,'' as the magazine puts it.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the editorial content of Talk is well worth the $2.95
cover price _ even if the supposed European texture and style is
also reminiscent of an old issue of Look _ that is, if Look had
been plagued by overzealous layout artists.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the biggest problem for the debut issue may be too
much Talk too soon. Why blast the world with news of your big scoop
nearly two weeks before most people can buy the thing? By the time
Talk is available worldwide to the very people who will have to buy
it on a regular basis in order for it to survive, we might all be
talking about something else.

OVERHAUL OF NEW YORK DRUG LAWS IS CRITICIZED AS INADEQUATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARA JAKES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY. N.Y. _ Jumpstarting the stalled overhaul of New York's
landmark drug laws, the state Senate has approved a bill to scale
back the harsh sentencing mandates only slightly while eliminating
parole for all felons.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, echoed by a chorus of
advocates, scoffingly charged Wednesday that the changes _ first
proposed by Gov. George Pataki in April _ fall short of real reform
to the 26-year-old laws that bear the name of the governor, Nelson
Rockefeller, who enacted them.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, R-Brunswick, called the
bill a ``first step'' toward further changes. Silver has so far
refused to allow a vote on Rockefeller reforms in the Assembly this
session, resurrecting memories of the fight over passage of Jenna's
Law in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do that bill because we believe it's a start in
the right direction, and we think it's better to start than to not
do anything at all,'' Bruno said. ``And I'm still disappointed that
the Assembly is refusing to get engaged in doing anything about
reforming the Rockefeller Drug Laws. So we think this is the right
message that we pass this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would allow a mid-level appeals court to review and
reduce mandatory sentences by one-third for first-time offenders
who are caught possessing or transporting drugs. It is part of a
massive bill that would require for all felony offenders to serve
at least six-sevenths of their prison terms, effectively
eliminating early release by the Parole Board.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno later said that he is open to linking the drug law reforms
to another criminal justice issue, such as passage of a felons DNA
database, in order to separate it from the so-called ``truth in
sentencing'' measure _ the legislative road block preventing
Assembly action.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller reforms and determinate sentencing mandates
passed the GOP-controlled Senate after a lengthy debate by a vote
of 52-4 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller Drug Laws mandate minimum prison terms of 15
years to life for relatively small amounts of narcotics possessed
and sold. They were enacted in 1973 by Rockefeller in, by all
accounts, an unsuccessful attempt to curb the drug trade in New
York. No other state in the nation has such harsh drug laws, nor
does the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic-led Assembly for years has pushed for changes to
the Rockefeller laws. This year, however, Silver has pulled back
from endorsing any reforms because of what his spokeswoman said was
a concern that his membership would appear soft on crime in the
November 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   With its mandatory link to the determinate sentencing clause,
Silver testily maintained Wednesday that the Senate bill offered no
true reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suggest to you that when the governor puts real reform
out, that has no poison pill, no strings attached, this house will
be very receptive to that kind of legislation,'' Silver said. ``We
are in the last day of a very lengthy session, and a one-house
(bill) exercise is totally irrelevant at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   But members of Silver's leadership team suggested the speaker
should be more willing to discuss reforms with Pataki, a
Republican, and Bruno, and should at least pass a one-house bill to
give the Assembly starting ground from which to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's refusal to address Rockefeller reforms throughout the
1999 session has conjured comparisons of his stonewalling Jenna's
Law last summer. That bill, which limits parole for violent felons
and was named after a murdered Albany nursing student, was blocked
by Silver until late summer, when his membership demanded its
passage during a special session.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Jeffrion Aubry, D-Queens, who chairs the chamber's
corrections committee, said Silver could at least attempt to
compromise with the governor's plan. Aubry is sponsor of a bill
that would repeal the prison terms set under the Rockefeller laws
and give trial judges more discretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my hope _ and we've communicated that to the speaker _
that there would be a process established that would at least see
if we could come to some agreement,'' Aubry said Wednesday. ``I
don't guarantee that an agreement is possible; it's just a sign
that you want an agreement. We're still looking for that sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many lawmakers and most reform advocates were less than
pleased with the Senate bill, charging it does not go far enough to
scale back the laws that often are described as ``draconian.'' The
bill passed Wednesday, if enacted, would only affect about 300
inmates of the more than 9,200 incarcerated on Rockefeller drug
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this bill does nothing,'' said David Mickenberg,
spokesman for the Lindesmith Center, a leading advocate for
Rockefeller reforms. ``If this is a first salvo in a series of
negotiations, then that's a good thing. But of this is where it
ends, then we're not satisfied.''

`SIXTH SENSE' IS CHILLING, CAPTIVATING, AND BEST SEEN WITHOUT
EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's getting harder and harder to be surprised by a movie these
days. By the time it gets in the theaters, we tend to know
everything about it _ from the millions spent on advertising,
underground word-of-mouth and previews that insist on telling us
every beat of the story.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great things about being a critic, however, is that
you often see movies weeks or even months in advance, and can
actually be surprised by a film, often pleasantly. This definitely
happened to me with the Bruce Willis occult thriller, ``The Sixth
Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be that by the time you see it, all its surprises and its
punch line will be common knowledge, and it simply won't grab you
the way it did me. But, coming in cold, I haven't been so
captivated, chilled and surprised by a movie in years. It strikes
me as the best movie so far in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So my advice (which I tend to give for only one or two movies a
year) is don't read anything about it or have any expectations one
way or the other. Just go see it, and experience it with as fresh a
perspective as possible under the impossible circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But, if you must know, it's the story of an acclaimed
Philadelphia child psychologist (Willis) who, in the presence of
his wife (Olivia Williams), is accosted by a now-grown, former
patient he barely remembers, and shot in the stomach just before
the attacker commits suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to the next fall and the doctor, who has not psychologically
recovered from the experience, is now taking on the case of an
eight-year-old boy (Haley Joel Osment) whose symptoms and
alienation are striking similar to that of his attacker _ the
patient he so obviously failed.
</P>
<P>
   So the film is about the doctor seizing a second change, and
trying to find personal redemption by helping a terrified child who
believes he's being visited by ``dead people'' _ ghosts of the
recently deceased who just won't leave him alone.
</P>
<P>
   It's a somber, non-exploitative drama that plays it perfectly
straight, never goes for a cheap thrill, and uncannily creates its
own world _ both the disjointed, impotent world of the doctor, and
the horror-filled, interior world of the traumatized little boy.
</P>
<P>
   Without trying to be, it manages to be an extraordinary chilling
movie. The skill with which it communicates the child's terror and
vulnerability at the hands of his ``ghosts'' is truly eerie. There
are moments in which the hair stood up on the back of my neck, that
actually gave me goosebumps.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of 11-year-old Haley Joel Osment could well be
the most convincingly tortured by a child actor since Patty Duke in
``The Miracle Worker;'' and Willis is almost as good, devoid of his
usual mannerisms, his body slumped in defeat, heartbreakingly
believable.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is so original, and so effective that I was shocked to
find it was directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the young director
whose first Hollywood film, ``Wide Awake,'' struck me as completely
phony, one of the worst films of 1998. It only proves that
directors, like child psychologists, deserve a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixth Sense. Directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan.
Cast: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia
Williams. Hollywood Pictures. 107 minutes. Rated PG-13 for
emotionally intense scenes.

`THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR' MAY BE RENE RUSSO'S BEST WORK EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Die-hard fans of the 1969 caper-romance, ``The Thomas Crown
Affair,'' will probably have little use with this 1999 remake,
which lacks the movie-star presence of Steve McQueen as its spark
plug and the original's distinctive blend of voluptuous charm and
'60s cool.
</P>
<P>
   But non-cultists should enjoy what is an engaging and well-acted
retread _ a film that develops its own charm as it goes along, and
ends up being a surprisingly strong star vehicle for Rene Russo,
perhaps even her career best.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 version of Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) is a Wall
Street billionaire so bored by his big success that he embarks on a
secret life of crime _ specifically, the theft of an Impressionist
painting in a caper so complicated it takes up the first 25 minutes
of screen time.
</P>
<P>
   His nemesis is a sexy insurance investigator (Russo) who figures
out straight away that Crown is the mastermind behind the theft,
and spends the movie getting close to him, trying to psyche him
out, lifting the keys to his apartment, looking for evidence, and
so forth.
</P>
<P>
   So the plot is essentially a cat-and-mouse game between this
pair of attractive, perfectly matched opponents, which, of course,
gradually turns into a steamy sexual attraction which inevitably
presents them with a big moral dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   As it does, the weakest link is Brosnan (who also co-produced).
He's a good actor, and he has his own distinctive charm that works
well in the neo-James Bond series. But he's almost too good at
communicating the stiff, suffocating smugness of this arrogant
tycoon character.
</P>
<P>
   Director John McTiernan (``Die Hard'') also lacks any real flair
for the romantic, the appearance of original star Faye Dunaway in
an extended cameo (as Crown's shrink) is clumsy, and the use of the
original's Oscar-winning song, ``Windmills of Your Mind,'' as
background music just makes us want more of it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film essentially works, and it's the kind of movie
that's become virtually extinct in the '90s: a thriller that tries
to be less a nail-biting action piece as a more leisurely, sexy,
movie-star romance with exotic locations and glamorous settings.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Thomas Crown Affair'' also manages to be a striking
vehicle for Russo. Constantly employed in movies of the last
decade, the ex-supermodel tends to be competent but lackluster.
Here, as the film's confident, single-minded power woman, she
finally comes into her charismatic own.
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas Crown Affair. Directed by John McTiernan. Screenplay
by Leslie Dixon &AMP; Kurt Wimmer. Cast: Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo,
Denis Leary, Ben Gazarra, Faye Dunaway. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 114
minutes. Rated R for sexual situations and some nudity.

ALL WORK, LITTLE PAY, BUT STAGE CELEBRITIES LOVE WILLIAMSTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL ECK  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ Gwyneth Paltrow isn't the only big star
strutting across the lawn of the Adams Memorial Theatre this season
_ not by a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Hawke opened the summer in ``Camino Real,'' which also
boasted Blair Brown, Jeffrey Jones and rising star Hope Davis. Bebe
Neuwirth followed suit, lighting up ``The Taming of the Shrew''
along with old ``Cheers'' co-star Roger Rees. And ``Friends'' hunk
David Schwimmer left Ross at home for a chance to put Warren
Leight's latest play, ``The Glimmer Brothers,'' on the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Williamstown, a bucolic college town in western Massachusetts,
has long been a celebrity hang-out, but this summer things feel a
bit different. It feels, perhaps for the first time, as if
Hollywood might be encroaching just a little bit on this quiet gem.
</P>
<P>
   The Festival feels it too, and producer Michael Ritchie says
that he's had to turn down more than a few media requests from
glitzy outfits like ``Entertainment Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This year,'' Ritchie says, ``quite simply because of having
Gwyneth here and her having won the Oscar, there was a lot of
attention that was thrown at us. All of those people did in fact
call and ask to cover the show and do interviews, and we turned
down all those requests because we don't want to send that kind of
image out. For us it's about the quality of the work and not the
notoriety of the talent we have here.''
</P>
<P>
   The work is what draws actors _ established stars and unknown
hopefuls _ to the festival. Broadway star Karen Ziemba loves the
fact that she can even catch a show in the morning at Williamstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much going on here,'' Ziemba says, ``from
rehearsals to readings of new plays, from the Mainstage productions
to the cabaret evenings. It's a theatrical oasis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie says that each performer finds his or her own reason for
heading to the festival. For Paltrow, Williamstown feels like a
second home. Her parents, actress Blythe Danner and director Bruce
Paltrow, have been associated with the festival for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gwyneth grew up here,'' Ritchie says. ``She has an automatic
attachment to the place. This is where she first started acting, so
it's not a big surprise that she would choose to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwimmer, like many, was enchanted by the idea of doing good
work, but getting it done quickly. ``David,'' Ritchie says, ``is a
perfect example of someone who has a limited window of opportunity
to do something that's not on his TV series. Now he could do a
movie, but there are few places that he could do a play where he'd
be able to do the caliber of work that he does and have only a
five-week commitment. Broadway is six months, Off-Broadway is six
months. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Hawke was simply pleased to find a venue so willing to take on a
production as big as ``Camino,'' which required 45 actors and a
running crew of the same size. ``Here you can do something that's
very expensive, has a huge cast and which isn't very commercial,''
Hawke says. ``In New York, `Camino' would cost so much money that
they'd never do it. They couldn't make their money back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At Williamstown we've got all the creative freedom we want
without the hassle of New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hot director Scott Ellis (who is helming ``Glimmer Brothers''
and ``The Waverly Gallery'' this season) said in an interview last
year that he likes to get away to the ``beautiful'' Berkshire
Mountains and appreciates the chance to get out of New York during
the dog days.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't hurt,'' Ritchie says. ``It's one of the reasons I
started coming here as a stage manager with my family. ... My wife
(actress and Festival regular Kate Burton) and I literally started
turning down Broadway jobs so that we could take Williamstown jobs
because of what it meant to us as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, though, the work at Williamstown comes cheap. All
performers sign a stock contract, and Ritchie assures that just
about anyone of note takes a pay cut to appear on the illustrious
Adams Memorial stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesssss,'' he elongates, ``I can guarantee that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the art that gets made every summer is enough of an
attraction in itself _ for everyone from the biggest marquee names
to those in the festival's many training programs (which Ritchie
stresses are a large part of what Williamstown is all about).
</P>
<P>
   Eric Stoltz, who was interviewed when he opened the 1998 season
as Tom in Tennessee Williams' ``The Glass Menagerie,'' waxed
rhapsodic about the festival. ``I love this place,'' Stoltz said.
``If I didn't, I wouldn't be here, and I could be out actually
earning a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Viola Davis, who played Ruth in the just-finished ``A Raisin In
The Sun,'' came for the attitude instead of the paycheck. ``It's a
place where artists can take risks,'' Davis says, ``and still be
supported and nurtured, which is what the creative environment
should be.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie brought a pretty impressive Rolodex with him to the
producer's desk, but he's not the only one knocking on doors. Many
of the performers knock on his first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Kind (of television's `Spin City') is a perfect
example'' Ritchie says. ``He picked up the phone last year and
called me and said, `Look, we've never met, but I want you to know
I want to be involved with Williamstown; I've always wanted to be
there.' It was easy for me to say, `Yes, I want you here,' and
luckily I had parts for him. The same thing happened with David
Schwimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Williamstown's best talents _ Paltrow among them _ are
found right within the festival's own ranks. Sam Breslin Wright, a
bright comic actor who nearly stole ``Shrew'' from Neuwirth and
Rees with a bravo-winning monologue, worked his way up through the
training programs, eventually getting his Actor's Equity card from
the company just this season. Ritchie says that even the biggest
names get a kick out of helping upstarts like Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that are new to the festival, I think, find it
surprising. You get a great a sense of responsibility to the young
actors, a sense of passing on the knowledge of the craft. ``It's
surprising how little ego is shown here when there could be a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie firmly believes that the festival could get by on that
new talent alone if it had to, but luckily it doesn't. He says the
smaller Nikos Stage sells out on its own power. The Mainstage stays
close to capacity on strength of reputation and choice of material
as well. Star power, he figures, is like the beautiful Berkshire
ambience _ it doesn't hurt.

`MY LIFE SO FAR' A FORMULAIC COMING-OF-AGE DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most noteworthy thing about ``My Life So Far'' is that it's
a reunion effort by director Hugh Hudson and producer David Puttnam
_ the filmmaking team that gave us ``Chariots of Fire'' in 1981,
and once seemed the great hope of British Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, it's a fairly standard coming-of-age drama,
delicately acted by its well-chosen ensemble cast, rich with 1920s
and '30s period Highland Scottish detail and nicely crafted in
every technical department, but without a huge emotional impact.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the family memoir, ``Son of Adam,'' by television
executive (and Puttnam friend) Sir Denis Forman, it's narrated by
Fraser (Robert Norman), a young boy growing up on an idyllic family
estate in rural Scotland run by his kindly but firmly-in-control
maternal grandmother (Rosemary Harris).
</P>
<P>
   But the main character is Fraser's life-force of a father,
Edward (Colin Firth): a big dreamer, a lover of Beethoven, an
incorrigible inventor, the owner of the only moss factory in
Europe, and, more paradoxically, a fundamentalist Christian,
without much tolerance for differing opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble comes for Edward and the entire family when his 60-ish
millionaire brother-in-law Morris (Malcolm McDowell), who
disapproves of Edward and his plans for the estate, turns up with a
beautiful young French bride, Heloise (Irene Jacob).
</P>
<P>
   The plot basically traces what happens when Edward falls madly
in love with Heloise and the effect this one-sided affair has on
Fraser, his long-suffering mother (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio),
and his older sister (Kelly MacDonald).
</P>
<P>
   As we might expect from Puttnam/Hudson, it's a quality
production all around, with a nostalgic glow that never turns into
overt sentimentality, a loving feel for place (it was shot on
location in Argyll, Scotland) and a keen sense of the special joys
of family life.
</P>
<P>
   Though the script is not good at establishing the various
relationship of one character to another, the characters are
individually multidimensional, constantly go against expectation,
and are well-acted, especially by Firth, a wonderful actor who
rarely gets a part this big to show his stuff.
</P>
<P>
   My only criticism is that, while the film is enjoyable, it never
comes together to be anything truly special or memorable. It almost
makes you wonder if Hudson and Puttnam have been to the movies very
often in the 20 years since their heyday. If they had, surely
they'd know how formuliac and familiar this kind of coming-of-age
material has become.
</P>
<P>
   My Life So Far. Directed by Hugh Hudson. Screenplay by Simon
Donald. Cast: Colin Firth, Rosemary Harris, Irene Jacob, Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Malcolm McDowell, Robert Norman. Miramax.
93 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual references.

`THE DINNER GUEST' ISN'T CINEMA MAGIC BUT IT STILL WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his two Gerard Depardieu-Pierre Richard teamings, ``La
Chevre'' (1982) and ``Les Comperes'' (1983), French writer-director
Francis Veber found a near-perfect star chemistry and scored two of
the funniest mismatched buddy comedies of the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   In his new film, ``The Dinner Game,'' he tries to recreate some
of that same distinctive chemistry with two new actors, Thierry
Lhmerette and Jacques Villeret. Not surprisingly, lightning doesn't
strike twice in the same place, but the results are passably
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opened the last Seattle International Film
Festival and moves into a regular run on Friday, is about Pierre
(Lhmeritte), a shallow Parisian publisher trying to find a guest to
bring to a dinner that's actually a secret contest by his friends
to see who can find the biggest ``idiot'' _ so they can laugh at
him.
</P>
<P>
   And the despicable yuppie seems to find the perfect fool in
Francois (Villeret), a sweet-spirited but impossibly naive and
clutzy tax accountant whose avocation is building scale models of
famous buildings and monuments with matchsticks.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner has Pierre snared this perfect dinner guest than
everything goes wrong. Not only does an injury keep him from the
dinner, he can't get rid of Francois, and his meddling steadily
creates havoc in Pierre's well-ordered life: alienating both his
wife and mistress, even triggering a tax audit.
</P>
<P>
   From the first scene, it's clear that Veber is out to recerate
his early-'80s successes by once again teaming a hunky, attractive
leading man (Lhhmeritte instead of Depardieu) with a knockabout
physical comedian (Villeret standing in for Richard), and letting
the sparks fly.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't completely work. Barely 78 minutes long, the film
seems incorrigibly slight for a feature, Lhmeritte never quite
works his way into the likable range, Villeret is almost too
bumbling to be believable, and the pair never really click as a
comedy team.
</P>
<P>
   But if not cinema magic, ``The Dinner Game'' is still a workable
screwball comedy of frustration. Veber builds and sustains an
enjoyably frantic pace, his physical gags are clever and
imaginative, and the formula works to the extent that it's always
fun to watch an arrogant smartie get his comeuppance at the hands
of the lovable fool.
</P>
<P>
   The Dinner Game. Directed and written by Francis Veber. Produced
by Alain Poire. Cast: Thierry Lhermitte, Jacques Villeret, Francis
Huster, Daniel Prevost, Catherine Frot. Lions Gate. 78 minutes. In
French with English subtitles. Rated PG-13 for sexual references.

`MYSTERY MEN' INCORRIGIBLY JUVENILE AND WAY TOO LONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many movies derived from comic books and aiming for a state
of inspired silliness, ``Mystery Men'' must have seemed magically
goofy on storyboards, but has somehow turned into an unappealing
mush by the time it made it to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a Dark Horse comic series, it's a farce about a band of
incompetent, wannabe superheroes who finally get their chance at
the big time when Champion City's ace crime fighter, Captain
Amazing (Greg Kinnear), is kidnapped by the arch villain, Casanova
Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush).
</P>
<P>
   The would-be rescuers includes The Shoveler (William H. Macy),
who dispatches baddies with dirt shovels; The Blue Raja (Hank
Azaria), who wears a turban and hurls forks through the air; and
The Furious (Ben Stiller), whose seething rage is his empowering
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting more personnel for the big fight, they add The Bowler
(Janeane Garofalo), who wields a deadly bowling ball; The Spleen
(Paul Reubens), a master of debilitating flatulence; and Invisible
Boy (Kel Mitchell), who is only invisible if no one looks at him.
</P>
<P>
   And when they find a guru in advanced crime-fighting techniques
in the form of The Sphinx (Wes Studi), and take on an arsenal of
secret weapons given them by eccentric inventor Dr. Heller (Tom
Waits), they become the Magnificent Seven of superheroes.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by first-time filmmaker Kinka Usher, the proceedings
are filled with special effects, over-the-top performances,
future-noirish visuals and one campy situation after another that
combine to take the themed-crimefighter idea to its ultimate absurd
extreme.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes a special flair to make a souffle like this rise _
the kind of touch Tim Burton gave the first ``Batman,'' for
instance _ and Usher (whose background is in TV commercials)
apparently doesn't have the gift: His movie just seems incorrigibly
juvenile and way, way too long.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery Men. Directed by Kinka Usher. Written by Neil Cuthbert.
Cast: Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria, William H. Macy, Geoffrey Rush,
Greg Kinnear, Paul Reubens, Janeane Garofalo, Tom Waits, Kel

`TRICK' BELONGS ON NEXT TIER OF GAY-THEMED MOVIES THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally _ a trick that's an infectiously engaging treat.
</P>
<P>
   We've been privvy to some good, gay-themed coming-of-age movies
this year. ``Edge Of 17'' and ``Get Real'' provided a positive
platform for gentle, non-threatening but edgy comedies that don't
shirk responsibility to their protagonists' personal voyages of
self-discovery because of sexual preference. But they don't push
too many safety buttons either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trick'' belongs on the next tier. Its sweet, idealistic hero
is already ``out.'' He's a reluctant musician living in one of
those nasty, scum-crusted studio flats in downtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is, his gayness isn't a problem for anybody but him.
For Gabriel (Christian Campbell, the sweet-faced look-alike brother
of ``Scream'' queen Neve Campbell), being gay seems to mean being
doomed to live life alone. He's tired of sleeping in the hall when
his shallow heterosexual roommate gets lucky. One night, after Gabe
auditions some of his Andrew Lloyd Webber-type songs with his best
friend, aspiring actress and ex-girlfriend Katherine (Tori
Spelling), his previously dismal luck suddenly shifts.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment of loneliness, Gabe hits a local gay bar. Dancing on
the counter is gorgeous go-go boy, Mark (J.P. Pitoc). The spark is
instantaneous. And in the next eight hours, Gabe will suffer from
inadequacy, anger, jealousy, fear, happiness and peace in Mark's
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jim Fall, who has worked primarily on the New York
stage, ingeniously weaves his panorama of gay and straight
characters, resulting in the running joke that no matter where Gabe
and Mark turn in a city as huge as Manhattan, they can't find a
place where they can be alone. Will they or won't they? Who cares
... the spark they strike incites everyone around them to reunite,
break up, sleep, wake up and tell the truth for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Trick. Directed by Jim Fall. Written by Jason Schafer. Cast:
Christian Campbell, John Paul Pitoc, Tori Spelling. Fine Line
Features. 90 minutes. Rated R for language, nudity, sexual content.

 (Repeating for all needing.)  
 LENOX, Mass.: ... ``Peter Grimes.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The BSO ``Elektra'' and ``Pique-Dame'' were released on CDs, and
Ozawa has conducted recorded performances with other orchestras of
``Salome'' and ``Carmen'' with Jessye Norman and Offenbach's ``Les
Contes d'Hoffmann.'' Some of these works have also been seen at the
Saito Kinen Festival, where Ozawa led Poulenc's ``Les Dialogues des
Carmelites'' and a famous televised production of Stravinsky's
``Oedipus Rex'' that was designed by Julie Taymor.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Ozawa has also conducted other works not associated
with him in Europe or America, in an annual series of operas with
the New Japan Philharmonic sponsored by Hennessey cognac _ there he
has led such works as ``The Barber of Seville,'' ``Manon Lescaut,''
``The Magic Flute,'' and ``Der fliegende Hollaender.''
</P>
<P>
   What has eluded Ozawa are some of the major works of Mozart,
Verdi, and Wagner; conductors these days are often typecast _ no
one would think of asking Ozawa to conduct ``Peter Grimes,'' a work
he led more convincingly than some of the British conductors who
specialize in Britten. None of the Vienna repertory has been set
for Ozawa yet, but there are definitely things he wants to do. ``I
have never conducted Berg's `Wozzeck' in the theater, but we did it
in Boston, and Hildegard Behrens, who sang Marie, says it was the
best `Wozzeck' she was ever in. I have learned Berg's `Lulu' and
never conducted it, and I once spent five months learning
Schoenberg's `Moses und Aron' for a production that was canceled.
My car was broken into then, and the only thing that was taken was
my score to `Moses und Aron'! I was once offered Wagner's `Ring'
Cycle, but I couldn't make that commitment of time over a period of
three years, but now I want very much to do it. ''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the subject of his departure from Boston in 2002,
Ozawa says, ``I didn't want to go down; everything in Boston must
always be going up. Until my very last day I want to be the music
director here, and I must be very strong; the first thing I am
asking of myself and of the orchestra is that these next three
years must be the very best of our time together. We are also
behind in commissioning new works, so I must give that a kick.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa says the decision to leave was ``difficult and sad. Both
for my family and for me Boston and Tanglewood have been a major
part of our lives. I know my feelings about this orchestra will
never change. I used to say that the relationship between a music
director and an orchestra was like a marriage, and forever, but now
I think the relationship is more like that of a family, which is
permanent and important in a different way. I think the orchestra
and I understand each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa bridles at the suggestion by some out-of-town critics that
the orchestra is currently in a state of disarray. ``We have some
wonderful new players now, a new first viola, a new first horn, a
new first flute, and they have changed the whole situation. There
are so many young strong players in the orchestra now, and I think
the orchestra is wonderful. I do not conduct so many orchestras
now, but I do conduct the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna
Philharmonic, and I think the Boston standard holds up _ this
orchestra has character, the way those do, and the character of the
Boston Symphony is something that I love. Boston has its own color,
and it never pushes; the musicians never become rough _ they hear
well and they blend well. Of course, like every orchestra we are
sometimes up, sometimes down, but it never comes down below Boston
Symphony standard. Only the greatest orchestras can do what the
Boston Symphony does at its best, as it did in our big tour
performances of Mahler's Third and Sixth symphonies. We can't do
that every day, but that's impossible. If people do not agree,
that's OK, but I don't understand what they are talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also surprised by the amount of covert and even overt
anti-Asian condescension that surfaced in some of the commentary
greeting the announcement of his departure. ``In the beginning,
yes, I was very aware of this problem, but it is something I have
not felt for many years, especially when I conduct in Berlin or
Vienna. But I know it will not stop until I die; I know I am a test
case. Everyone wonders how much I can learn, how much I can
understand. But the problems I have had have always ended in a
positive way. I have always enjoyed learning, and I still do.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Changes at Tanglewood
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa has few regrets about the major controversy that has
dominated the last few years, the changes he has implemented at the
Tanglewood Music Center. ``It was my responsibility to do this.
There was some hot stuff to take, but I'm glad I did it, and now I
still have time, three years more, to drive the Music Center along
toward new levels. The school has started a whole new era, and
needs all the energy I can give to it. I hope I can continue a
relationship with the school, but I cannot invite myself, and I
don't want to be a Tanglewood ghost. If the music director invites
me, I will happy to do anything he asks me to.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of gratitude to his own mentors, Ozawa has become profoundly
committed to teaching. ``Conducting is not so easy, you know. You
have to be a good musician to begin with, and then you need the
tools to become a conductor _ and that's not something you can
learn in a room by yourself. When I was studying with Hideo Saito,
I was his only student, and I conducted every single week from the
time I was 16 or 17, starting with a string quartet playing
symphonies by Haydn and Mozart and later pieces like the
Tchaikovsky `Serenade for Strings.' I was so lucky. These days
there is not much chance for a young conductor to have the kind of
training I did, anywhere in the world. To be fair to the next
generation, I want to create this kind of chance for young people.
Today they all find the CD and listen to it, but to be a conductor
you have to understand things inside of you; you have to find the
next level within yourself. Music is this really big thing, and you
have to come up to it.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ While the city of Boston was joining its symphony
orchestra in celebrating Seiji Ozawa's 25 seasons as music director
last fall, Ozawa himself was holding quiet conversations with his
wife, Vera, about when the right time to leave would come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking with my wife about how I wanted to teach,''
Ozawa said in an interview in his home near Tanglewood a week ago.
``I want to help the Saito Kinen Orchestra and Festival grow in
Japan, and I want to guest-conduct instead of attending all the
meetings a music director has to go to. Every year in Boston, my
contract is renewed for another three years; I thought maybe this
September, or a year from this September, would be a good time to
say I would plan to leave in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's decision to accept the music directorship of the Vienna
State Opera came as a surprise to everyone in Symphony Hall, and it
came as a surprise to him _ Ozawa was not looking for another
full-time job. ``I went to Vienna to conduct Tchaikovsky's
`Pique-Dame' right after the Boston Symphony Orchestra tour last
spring. I went on to China, but the orchestra didn't, because the
end of the tour was canceled because of the bombing of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade. While I was in Vienna, I was approached about
the job, and my first reaction was to say no. But then they changed
many things in order to suit me. As I said, I would never think of
going to another orchestra after the Boston OZAWA, Page N13 &QL; 
Symphony. But before I die, I want to taste more opera, so this
seemed like a not so bad idea after all. It all happened within two
or three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's unpretentious home in the Berkshires was the scene of
many family-oriented activities during his tenure as music
director; his children grew up alongside the Boston Symphony, and
Tanglewood was one of the family's favorite parts of the job. Son
Yukyoshi, 24, was born after Ozawa became music director; he is now
a popular actor in Japan, where he's busy promoting his first
movie, which has just been released.
</P>
<P>
   Yukyoshi's basketball court at the end of the driveway here was
looking a little folorn, but the nearby gardens were flourishing.
Ozawa's daughter Seira, 26, did pop downstairs for a moment;
working toward a career as a stage director in opera, she is also a
writer and journalist whose current assignment is to write a story
for a leading Japanese magazine _ the subject is Tanglewood. Ozawa
settled down on a corner of the white living room couch and poured
tea, avoiding the fresh lemon-rind cookies until his interviewer
had seriously diminished the supply.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa was thoroughly well trained in music before he left Japan
for the first time to participate in the Besancon conducting
competition in France in 1959 _ the event that brought him into the
orbit of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, because one of the judges
was BSO music director Charles Munch, who invited him to enter the
conducting program at Tanglewood.
</P>
<P>
   Opera, however, represented a whole new world to Ozawa when he
arrived in Europe. ``Opera is something we did not have in Japan.
The first opera I ever saw was in Vienna in 1959, `The Marriage of
Figaro,' conducted by Maestro von Karajan. I remember he also
played the recitatives at the keyboard. I was the guest of a very
distinguisehd Japanese lady who had been a friend of my teacher,
Hideo Saito, and she also took me to the Opera Ball. I had to rent
everything I wore, including the white gloves, which I hated. I
didn't even have shoes _ I was riding around Europe on my
motorscooter.''
</P>
<P>
   The first opera Ozawa conducted was Verdi's ``Rigoletto'' in a
concert performance by the Toronto Symphony, during the early years
of his first music directorship (1965-69); he remembers that Reri
Grist and George Shirley were in the cast. His first staged opera
was Mozart's ``Cosi fan tutte'' at the Salzburg Festival a little
later.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Sleepy Seiji'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that because Herbert von Karajan asked me to, but I was
crazy to try it. The previous summer I had been his assistant on a
production of `Don Giovanni' in Salzburg _ Mirella Freni and
Nicolai Ghiaurov were both in it, and that was when they met; later
they got married. I played the piano for the singers and even
conducted in rehearsals because Maestro von Karajan was staging the
opera and couldn't stop directing and working on the lighting. I
did not know how the opera house worked at all. I couldn't see
anything at all because I would spend the morning playing tennis in
the sun and then go into the production, which was so dark. One day
I must have drunk some beer at lunchtime, and everyone was talking
in German and it was dark and cool, so I just feel asleep and
missed a cue. My nickname that summer became `Sleepy Seiji' _
Mirella still remembers that and teases me about it. Maestro von
Karajan was furious with me, but he did ask me to conduct `Cosi fan
tutte' the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa remembers that the cast included Walter Berry and that
Teresa Stratas sang Despina; Jean-Pierre Ponnelle directed. ``This
was the beginning of my life in the opera, and at the first
performance I made a terrible mistake _ I forgot to give the
orchestra a bow, and the orchestra committee came and paid a formal
call on me to complain. I am surprised that they did not fire me.
Some of the players from that time are still in the orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Ozawa made another important debut, at La Scala,
conducting his first ``Tosca.'' Karajan, who had encouraged him
with ``Cosi,'' knew the pitfalls of Puccini's opera, and thought
Ozawa was crazy _ he even called Ozawa's manager and said, ``What
are you thinking of?'' The manager replied, ``Where do you want him
to learn Italian opera _ in Germany?'' ``I did this,'' Ozawa
recalls, ``because Luciano Pavarotti said to me, `Seiji, you do.'
But Maestro von Karajan said, `Seiji, you are going to be cooked.'
Raina Kabaivanska, who was a very prima donna then, was supposed to
be Tosca, and she was going to wear Maria Callas's costume at the
opening performance, which was on television. But she got sick
during rehearsals, so Eva Marton sang. Kabaivanska showed up for
the telecast, saying `This performance is mine,' only nobody told
me _ I found out when I heard a new voice singing `Mario, Mario'
offstage. Everything in the performance was different from what I
had rehearsed with the other soprano. At the end, I was booed for
the first time in my life. My mother, who had come to cook for me,
thought it was another Italian way of saying `Bravo.' But the
orchestra played fantastic for me, and by the third performance we
had a triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa has conducted opera since then in Paris, Vienna, and in
Japan, and in 1980 he inaugurated a regular series of semistaged
opera productions at Tanglewood and in Symphony Hall _ among the
works he has conducted with the Boston Symphony are Gluck's
``Orfeo,'' Beethoven's ``Fidelio,'' Puccini's ``Tosca'' and
``Madama Butterfly,'' Mozart's ``Idomeneo,'' Berg's ``Wozzeck,''
Strauss's ``Salome'' and ``Elektra,'' Stravinsky's ``The Rake's
Progress,'' Tchaikovsky's ``Eugen Onegin'' and ``Pique-Dame,''
Honegger's ``Jeanne d'Arc au Bucher,'' and Verdi's ``Falstaff.'' At
the Tanglewood Music Center he conducted Poulenc's ``Les Mamelles
de Tiresias'' and great performances of Britten's ``Peter Grimes.''

 &HT;    Pioneer, Presley the winning touch
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Matthiessen's novel about infamous Florida pioneer Edgar
J. Watson and Peter Guralnick's biography of Elvis Presley are this
year's winners of the Southern Book Awards presented by the
Southern Book Critics Circle.
</P>
<P>
   The fiction winner, ``Bone by Bone'' (Random House, $26.95), is
the final volume in a trilogy about a real-life desperado that
began with ``Killing Mr. Watson'' and continued with ``Lost Man's
River.'' Drawing on a few sketchy facts about the real Watson, a
back-country South Carolina farmer who became a legend on the
lawless frontier of turn-of-the-century Florida, Matthiessen
created a compelling and at times horrifying portrait of a
cold-blooded killer.
</P>
<P>
   Matthiessen, who lives on Long Island, is the author of more
than two dozen works of fiction and nonfiction, including ``At Play
in the Fields of the Lord'' and ``The Snow Leopard,'' which won the
National Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick's ``Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley''
(Little, Brown &AMP; Co., $27.95), a sequel to the 1994 biography
``Last Train to Memphis,'' chronicles the last half of the singer's
career. The Boston writer and music historian is the author of
``Lost Highway'' and ``Sweet Soul Music.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Book Critics Circle, a group of book editors and
reviewers at newspapers and magazines in the South, also will honor
writer Eudora Welty with its Distinguished Achievement Award.
Awards will be presented Oct. 8 at the Southern Festival of Books
in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Film rights: The big book-to-film deal this year is Dino De
Laurentiis' $10 million purchase of Thomas Harris' novel
``Hannibal,'' but other literary works are headed for the big
screen as well. Robert Altman is at work on the film version of
musician Artie Shaw's autobiography; Oprah Winfrey is ready to
begin filming Janet Fitch's ``White Oleander''; John Boorman, who
brought ``Deliverance'' to the screen, is planning a new version of
Jack London's ``The Sea Wolf''; and ``Fargo'' directors Joel and
Ethan Coen are exploring the possibility of a dialogue-free
adaptation of James Dickey's novel ``To the White Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the works: ``Les Miserables'' producer Cameron Mackintosh
plans to make a musical from John Updike's novel ``The Witches of
Eastwick.'' The debut would be in London next spring, according to
Publishers Weekly. ... Cary Stayner confessed to the Yosemite
murders on July 26, and already there's a true crime book scheduled
for September. Author Carlton Smith signed the deal with St.
Martin's Press. ... Hyperion Books has bought two more celebrity
books: Country singer Loretta Lynn will do a sequel to
``Coalminer's Daughter'' and comedian Bill Cosby will give his
views on the changing nature of families in ``Now What?'' ... With
``'Tis,'' Frank McCourt's sequel to ``Angela's Ashes,'' hitting the
stores in September, brother Malachy McCourt has sold ``Singing Him
His Song,'' his sequel to ``A Monk Swimming,'' to HarperCollins for
a mid-six figures.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On the Web: Atlanta native Mark Pendergrast will be featured
at 1 p.m. Tuesday on CNN's recently launched interactive Web site,
CNN.com/chat. Pendergrast, the author of ``For God, Country and
Coca-Cola'' (1993), tackles another favorite beverage in his latest
book, ``Uncommon Grounds: The History of Coffee and How It
Transformed the World'' (Basic Books, $27.50). In addition to
Pendergrast, a dozen other authors in five different genres are
available to answer questions on an ongoing basis at
CNN.com/Asktheauthor. Among those are horror novelist Lois Duncan
(``I Know What You Did Last Summer'') and mystery novelists Walter
Sorrells (``Cry for Justice'') and Ridley Pearson (``Pied Piper'').

 &HT;    As the nation copes with gun violence, Brad Bird's `The Iron
Giant' examines the struggle of good and evil
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he started work on his film in late 1996, director Brad
Bird couldn't know that ``The Iron Giant'' would have such
unexpected resonance by the time it hit screens today.
</P>
<P>
   Adapting the tale of a huge robot from outer space, Bird changed
the story line of Ted Hughes' children's book to ask a question
that's both childlike and adult: What if a gun had a soul?
</P>
<P>
   That's a climactic struggle in Bird's stylish, PG-rated film, as
the big metal man struggles between his pre-programmed warfare
impulses and his wish to be a peace-loving hero like Superman.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's anti-gun stance arrives in the shellshocked days
following spree shootings in Colorado, Conyers and, only a week
ago, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think no one anticipates these kinds of horrifying specific
things,'' Bird says during a visit here only a day after the
shootings in Buckhead. He adds that his movie is less about gun
control than a consideration of the human struggle between good and
evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of whether or not to act upon your darker
instincts goes back to the beginning of time,'' he says. ``People
lock onto the gun aspect of the movie, but I think really what
you're dealing with is whether to use your own power to destroy
things or to heal them. We all have tremendous potential to affect
things in a negative way. That's a curse of having a brain.''
</P>
<P>
   In case ``Iron Giant'' sounds like a heavy, moralizing movie,
don't worry, it's not. Deviating from the familiar Disney formula
(``five songs and a story we've heard 5,000 times,'' in Bird's
words), the stylish, witty Warner Bros. movie takes place in 1950s
Maine, where Cold War fears and ``duck and cover'' nuclear attack
drills are in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   In creating the jazzy visual of the picture, Bird and his
animators looked at Norman Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post covers,
Thomas Hart Benton paintings and 1950s magazine illustrations and
comic books. ``I wish I could say it was a superintellectual
process,'' he says. ``It wasn't. We had to move very quickly. We
had about half the time and about a third of the money that our
friends at DreamWorks and Disney have.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside of those limitations was a freedom to take creative
risks, while at the same time trying to make the movie look as good
as possible. ``We didn't want our limited resources to be an excuse
for not doing a big film,'' he says. ``We killed ourselves to get
every last dime up on the screen and make it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing to go from our budget was sleep. If you cut
sleep, you can be quite efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   While still a high schooler, Bird was mentored by Milt Kahl, one
of Disney's famous band of animators known as the Nine Old Men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Disney deserves every ounce of success they've had,''
he says. ``They worked hard to develop their (animation) teams
through successes and failures, and their commitment to animation
is deep. But I don't think Disney films are the only way to make
them, and a lot of bad animated films have been made trying to
chase Disney's tail.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Iron Giant,'' Bird says he hopes to show that there's
more than one formula for animation. ``I'm anxious not only to
widen the notion that every animated feature has to be fine for
your 5-year-old, but I'm also hoping we can do quality films that
go in new directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, he came up with the idea that turned into
the ``Family Dog'' animated segments on Steven Spielberg's
``Amazing Stories,'' and went on to be creative consultant on ``The
Simpsons'' and ``King of the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 42, the filmmaker takes time to acknowledge the executives
at Warner Bros., who didn't try to pull the plug on ``Iron Giant''
when they saw that it didn't have Disney-style songs and comic
sidekicks. ``Usually with a studio, every time you try to do
something different they flinch,'' he says. ``They always say
they're looking for something new, but when you give it to them
they start whining, `You didn't tell me you were gonna do something
new.'''

 &HT;    With smart story and a distinctive look, animated `Iron Giant'
stands tall
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Family films have been looking up of late. ``October Sky'' had a
soaring script about young rocketeers, and Disney's ``Tarzan''
portrayed the tree-swinging ape-man with the greatest of glee. Now
comes the animated, early-space-age flick ``The Iron Giant.'' It's
another swell kids' movie with enough smarts to keep parents fixed
in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Appealingly filmed by animator Brad Bird, whose resume runs the
gamut from Disney to ``The Simpsons,'' ``Iron Giant'' is an unusual
yet eye-filling mix of 1950s Disney, '60s Astro-Boy and a dash of
'90s Japanimation. It works.
</P>
<P>
   The time is 1957. Sputnik is puttering around in space while,
back on Earth, children are being told that, in the case of a
nuclear attack, they should ``duck and cover.'' One starry night, a
UFO crashes in rural Maine. It turns out to be a gigantic iron
robot that eats metal. Almost electrocuted when he stumbles into
some power lines, the giant is saved by _ and subsequently
befriended by _ 9-year-old Hogarth Hughes (voiced by Eli
Marienthal).
</P>
<P>
   But his trail of munched-on tractors, trucks and grain silos
hasn't gone unnoticed. A paranoid government agent _ the kind of
false-hearted guy who insists on calling Hogarth ``champ'' or
``chief'' or ``slugger'' _ is soon snooping around and causing
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant,'' based on a book by the late Ted Hughes
(named Britain's poet laureate in 1984 and husband of poet Sylvia
Plath), has many things going for it besides its distinctive
animation style.
</P>
<P>
   For one, it achieves what last year's mega-hyped ``Godzilla''
got across only in its trailers: namely, an awe-inspiring sense of
size. Using perspective and a bright palette of autumn colors, Bird
shows us his giant towering over the surrounding countryside. This
thing isn't just big; it's humongous.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bird's humor, especially his lighthearted depiction of
the era's ``duck and cover'' instructions, is laugh-out-loud funny.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the vocal talent is well-cast. Along with Marienthal
(who has a distinctive ``Babe''-like crack in his voice), we hear
Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's beleaguered single mother, Vin Diesel
as the Iron Giant and Harry Connick Jr. as a beatnik with seductive
Elvis eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a heartwarming trip far, far away from the embarrassingly
funny escapades of those potty-mouthed ``South Park'' tykes.
</P>
<P>
   One tip for '90s parents: There's a kind of
``Bambi''/``Starman'' moment, but kids can probably handle it. Just
be aware.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr.
Directed by Brad Bird. Rated PG for mild violence. At metro
theaters. 1 hour, 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Nice story for kids, nifty look for adults.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this IMAX film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' R (sexuality, sexual dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a raunchy, throwaway, pre-adult, R-rated high school
sexcapade with dirty dialogue and more than one risque encounter
between students that's broadcast over the Internet. There's also
the grossest joke involving a beer you're likely ever to see on
film. Little in ``American Pie'' deserves honest laughs. (Bob
Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Arlington Road'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack
</P>
<P>
   and Jeff Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's marred by patches of obviousness, ``Arlington Road''
arrives in theaters with a sharp sense of timing. It's a variation
of Alfred Hitchcock's chilling 1943 film ``Shadow of a Doubt,''
hot-wired to a national nervous system that's already jolted by
heavily armed teenage
</P>
<P>
   commandos and Midwestern spree shooters. (SM) 1 hour, 57
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy
</P>
<P>
   Who Shagged Me'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mike Myers
</P>
<P>
   and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's fave dentally impaired British superspy, Mike
Myers goes back to the '60s to save his mojo from Dr. Evil and a
giant slob in a kilt (Myers and Myers, respectively). Shaggy but
still shagadelic, this worthy sequel also stars Heather Graham as a
curvy CIA operative, Seth Green as Dr. Evil's brooding son Scott
and Jerry Springer (don't ask). (SM) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler
</P>
<P>
   and Joey Lauren Adams.
</P>
<P>
   It's Adam Sandler's latest moneymaker. ``Big Daddy'' ties
together elements from his successful date movie ``The Wedding
Singer'' (boyish innocence and charm to woo the women in the
audience) and his even more successful yukfest ``The Waterboy''
(scatological scatting just for the boys). Throw in an itty-bitty
kid for Sandler to pal around with and you've got the makings of a
mack-daddy movie. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Heather Donahue,
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey into the kind of terror that comes from trying to
glimpse something in the shadows just beyond the campfire. Three
students head into the woods to document an 18th-century witch
tale, then disappear. The movie wrings chills out of the slightest
effects _ odd twiglike contraptions hanging from trees, a pile of
stones, strange noises in the night _ but its power comes from
psychological intensity. (SM)1 hour, 27 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Blue Sea'' R (excessive gore, dismemberment)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   There is precious little that is original about this movie. It
really doesn't matter, though. When the plot kicks in and the
killer shark starts prowling and munching, the film delivers all
the thrills, explosive action and sheer gore that audiences have
come to expect from the shark genre. (Hap Erstein, Cox News
Service)1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick'' PG-13 (profanity, drug content,
</P>
<P>
   sex-related humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst,
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Williams
</P>
<P>
   and Dan Hedaya.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams play teen girls who
unwittingly bring down Richard Nixon's White House in this mix of
``Clueless'' and ``Forrest Gump.'' Too bad the movie's target
audience won't get most of the Watergate jokes, and that the
movie's first half has a dangerously uncertain tone. (SM)1 hour, 30
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' PG-13 (profanity, sex-related material,
</P>
<P>
   crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst,
</P>
<P>
   Denise Richards, Kirstie Alley
</P>
<P>
   and Ellen Barkin.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cheerfully mean-spirited spoof of beauty pageants.
Remember 1975's ``Smile''? Except for a switch from cheerleading to
beauty pageants, the plot here is much the same as the 1993 cable
flick ``The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas
Cheerleader-Murdering Mom.'' ``Gorgeous'' stoops to obvious sight
gags and even broader performances than in ``Mom.'' (SM) 1 hour, 37
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' R (profanity, sexual content, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   drug-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   The late Stanley Kubrick's final film is a letdown _ an often
frustrating peephole view at jealousy and sexual obsession that
confronts a rich New York couple (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman).
While it has its moments, its much-touted centerpiece orgy doesn't
work. What you get resembles Cirque du Soleil as performed by the
cast of ``Showgirls.'' (SM)2 hours, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The General's Daughter'' R (profanity, violence, rape,
</P>
<P>
   sadomasochism)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta,
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Stowe and James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   As a warrant officer investigating the mysterious slaying of a
female captain, John Travolta bolts on screen, barking his lines
and spitting his machismo all over the place. Somebody's got to
turn this mess into a movie. Shot in Savannah and disguised as an
A-grade film, ``General's Daughter'' is an over-directed,
overwritten and ultimately underwhelming whodunit B-grade thriller.
(Bob Longino) At metro theaters. 1 hour, 55 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunting'' PG-13 (intense horror sequences)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Scary in all the worst ways. ``The Haunting'' is a Hollywood
debacle, an overpriced mess with only one scare in it. That scare
is of the old-fashioned ``boo'' variety. It has nothing to do with
the over-the-top computer effects that make this less a remake of
the 1963 classic than a theme park in search of a script. (SM)1
hour, 53 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' PG-13 (brief nudity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rupert Everett,
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett, Jeremy Northam
</P>
<P>
   and Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   A less-than-ideal adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play. In 1895
London, a respected politician's public and private lives are
threatened by a blackmailer who knows a secret from his past. The
fine cast is stymied by director Oliver Parker's literal-minded
approach. What remains is a well-acted, very well-appointed period
piece that becomes more stifling and less engaging as it goes
along. (ERG)1 hour, 37 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' PG (wacky violence, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The best gag is the first one in Disney's big-screen version of
TV's popular animated part-human, part-machine, mucho-gizmo lawman.
Matthew Broderick is perfectly cast as Gadget. Rupert Everett goes
over the top as bad man Sanford Solex. Kids will enjoy watching
them both. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 20 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' PG (mild violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Anniston and Harry Connick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Nice story for kids, nifty look for adults. In 1957, a giant
metal-eating robot crash-lands on Earth and is befriended by
9-year-old Hogarth. But the robot's trail of munched-on trucks and
grain silos attracts a super-paranoid government agent. The
interesting mix of voice talent in this animated film includes
Jennifer Anniston as Hogarth's mom and Harry Connick Jr. as a
beatnik with seductive Elvis eyes. (ERG) 1 hour, 24 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Placid'' R (profanity, violent creature attacks,
</P>
<P>
   gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Pullman,
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Fonda and Oliver Platt.
</P>
<P>
   In this sometimes watchable, underpopulated ``Jaws'' retread
about a giant crocodile, the croc attacks are predictable and
rudimentary. This is the sort of movie in which no one but bit
players get their heads bitten off. Pity. The scares aren't scary,
the laughs aren't funny, and poor Bridget Fonda has to keep falling
off moving vehicles directly into the path of the monster croc,
like some 1940s hapless heroine. (SM) 1 hour, 22 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Muppets From Space'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring The Great Gonzo,
</P>
<P>
   Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.
</P>
<P>
   Beam us up, Gonzo. The Great Gonzo goes searching for his roots
and discovers he may have extraterrestrial family ties. It's the
same Muppet mania that's always worked _ a mix of vaudeville
shtick, kid-friendly slapstick and hilarious movie in-jokes to
tickle their parents. A perfect choice for families who may not be
quite ready to test ``South Park'' waters, but appreciate a blend
of sweetness and wit. (ERG)1 hour, 22 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery Men'' PG-13 (comic action violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller,
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Rush, Hank Azaria
</P>
<P>
   and Janeane Garofalo.
</P>
<P>
   It's a spoof! It's an adventure! No, it's an amiable mess! Ben
Stiller and Janeane Garofalo headline a ragmuffin team of superhero
wannabes. But the movie is mostly like its hapless heroes _ kind of
clumsy and good intentioned but with none of the knack it takes to
save the day, or itself. (SM)2 hours, 1 minute. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant
</P>
<P>
   and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Boy gets movie star, boy loses movie star, etc. Hugh Grant plays
a decent London bookseller and Julia Roberts a version of herself
(worldwide movie star) in this romantic comedy. The latest from the
writer of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' is old-fashioned hokum,
short on surprise but very long on charm. (SM) 2 hours, 4 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin'' Not rated, but contains
</P>
<P>
   nudity and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Girard's centuries-spanning saga follows the fortunes
and misfortunes of those who come in contact with the so-called Red
Violin, carved in 1681 by an Italian master. Holding the different
stories together is a present-day auction during which violin
expert Samuel L. Jackson struggles to unravel the instrument's
tragic secret. (ERG)2 hours, 10 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax ... It's Just Sex''(Unrated, but contains profanity,
nudity,
</P>
<P>
   violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mitchell Anderson
</P>
<P>
   and Jennifer Tilly.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Anderson, Jennifer Tilly and Lori Petty star in this
big ensemble comedy-drama about a group of gay and straight friends
in Los Angeles, falling in and out of love. The repartee and
observations are often sharp and witty, but midway through the
movie loses its center and its focus. (SM) 1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Run Lola Run'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Franka Potente
</P>
<P>
   and Moritz Bleibtreu.
</P>
<P>
   A pyrotechnic celebration of style over substance, this
adrenalin-fueled German flick is the big-screen love child of every
video game and MTV quick-cut editing trick of the past 10 years.
Franka Potente plays the flame-haired woman who has 20 minutes to
run through Berlin in search of 100,000 marks, or lose her lover.
In German with English subtitles. (SM) 1 hour, 21 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' PG (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, alas, doesn't strike twice in this reunion of
``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. However, the
film isn't a fiasco and it does well by its intended audience,
i.e., anyone who wants to see Roberts galloping on horseback in
full wedding regalia. She's a bride who's already choked at the
altar three times and is about to try again. He's a cynical
journalist who's betting she'll run. (ERG) 1 hour, 56 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense''PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis,
</P>
<P>
   Haley Joel Osment
</P>
<P>
   and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) At metro
theaters. 1 hour, 47 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger,
</P>
<P>
   Longer &AMP; Uncut'' R (profanity, gross-out humor, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Trey Parker,
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stone and Mary Kay Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   It offers what you expect: crude animation, cruder humor. It's
probably the most offensive (and also funniest) bit of celluloid to
ever make moviegoers shell out $7. But in its timely, sly,
self-referential way, the movie is more than that. It's a witty

   Is George Lucas' new movie visually amazing? Yes. Exciting?

   Disney's animated ``Tarzan'' really swings. This long-haired
dude confidently surfs through Africa's immense rain forest. He
glides barefoot on never-ending, moss-covered tree limbs like the
coolest Rollerblader you've ever seen. His feet never fail him. His
movie doesn't either. Both a little scary and a lot funny, kids
will no doubt lap up this movie. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 28 minutes.

   Known in 1930s Florence as ``the scorpioni,'' thanks to their

   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, but
lots of other gimmicks from the 1968 original have been excised.
That's good. This remake is a guilt-free summer diversion. Pierce
Brosnan is an appealing billionaire gentleman rogue, stealing
priceless paintings. But it's really Rene Russo's film. As the solo
investigator hot on his trail, she prowls the screen savoring a
smart, sexed-up character. (SM)1 hour, 45 minutes. B

<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)

   Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Avengers'' last summer, this tale of 1800s agent
James West, based on the old TV show, is a bizarre mix of
overproduced camp, sloppy pacing and tepid scripting. Will Smith
and Kevin Kline have zero sparks of buddy chemistry. ``Wild Wild
West'' is anything but wild. It's a washout. (SM) 1 hour, 47
minutes. D+

   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.

 &HT;    `Mystery Men' could use a clue
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mystery about ``Mystery Men'' is why so many sharp actors
signed on for a movie that needed several more rewrites. It's now a
familiar Hollywood spectacle. After all, this is the summer of
``Wild Wild West'' and ``The Haunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those two other juggernauts, ``Men'' at least provides
some giggles. It's unpretentious and goofy. Like ``South Park,'' it
never underestimates the crowd-pleasing power of potty humor. And
the presence of the masterfully deadpan Janeane Garofalo elevates
any party.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bowler, she shows up halfway through ``Men,'' just in
time to give the movie a sardonic jolt. She joins the titular gang
of superhero wannabes, including:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Shoveler (William H. Macy), whose weapon of choice is ...
guess.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), a mama's boy with a turban, a
fake British accent and unpredictable skills as a fork thrower.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Furious (Ben Stiller), a hothead with a volcanic temper
but zero fighting skills.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal is to win some of the crime-fighting glory enjoyed by
Champion City's Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear, in fine sneering
mode). Amazing's actions have nothing to do with civic duty and
everything to do with lucrative product endorsements. Hoping to
boost his earnings with more save-the-world stunts, he seeks a
worthy adversary, springing master criminal Casanova Frankenstein
(Geoffrey Rush) from prison. When his plan backfires, the city's
safety rests with the Mystery Men. Their number swells to include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), whose power works only when no
one is looking at him.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Spleen (Paul Reubens), who can trigger his stinky talents
with a pull of the finger.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Sphinx (Wes Studi), a shaman whose pseudo-mystical sayings
sound like something Grasshopper would have laughed at in
``Kung-Fu.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Mystery Men'' doesn't seem to know when it's
mocking other superhero flicks and when it's mocking itself. It's a
comedy in search of a real target and consistent rules. (The
movie's mixture of slapstick realism and arbitrary supernatural
powers never gels.) Kinka Usher, a commercial directing whiz making
his feature film debut, kicks off ``Men'' with a clumsy opening
scene and never finds a shape for the movie (or for many scenes).
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery Men'' is like its hapless heroes. It's a wannabe that
has the best intentions _ including a pronounced anti-gun stance _
but none of the knack it takes to save the day, or itself. And its
running time of more than two hours is the least funny thing about
it. Like the Furious, it's all buildup, followed by fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery Men''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C +
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Geoffrey Rush, Hank
Azaria and Janeane Garofalo. Rated PG-13 for comic action violence
and crude humor. 2 hours,
</P>
<P>
   1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: It's a spoof! It's an adventure! No, it's an
amiable mess.

 &HT;    Russo steals the spotlight in sexy `Thomas Crown'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, in
subdued jazz mode. But the big hats, the seductive chess game, and
even the bank are gone from the remake of ``The Thomas Crown
Affair.'' Good riddance.
</P>
<P>
   The revamp from director John McTiernan (``Die Hard'') appraises
the 1968 Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway caper flick for what it was: a
lively, sexy piece of junk whose main purpose was to give
moviegoers a taste of livin' large. Thirty-one years later,
McTiernan and his screenwriters know it's the same thing. Sure, we
want to find out if billionaire Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) will
get away with his part-time hobby of stealing priceless
impressionist paintings, or if solo investigator Catherine Banning
(Rene Russo) will pin the theft on him, before, during or after
their extended sex scene in his lavish townhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But really, that townhouse is the real reason for the movie. Oh,
yeah, and the tropical island getaway he whisks Catherine to. And
that sheer, no-underwear dress Catherine wears to the black-tie
ball. (Likewise, last year's ``A Perfect Murder'' gave equal
attention to the villain's motives and to his Fifth Avenue bathroom
fixtures and collection of modern art.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Crown'' is a guilt-free pleasure, a way to waste a couple of
hours happily at the theater without encountering
computer-generated monsters or teenagers losing their virginity.
The movie's most brazen notion is its faith that anyone over 30
goes to the movies. And that anyone over 40 can still be a sex
symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes almost too discreet for the movie's sense of big-label
fun, Brosnan still makes an appealing gentleman rogue. But the
movie really belongs to Russo, whose pleasure is almost palpable as
she prowls around the screen savoring a smart, sexed-up character
who's not above sunbathing nude for the audience's prurient
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Only purists of 1960s melancholy chic will mind that the remake
noodles with the original's ending. But there's campy compensation
in a supporting role by Dunaway as Crown's therapist, chortling her
way through the film (and through a very thick filter on the lens).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan and Rene
</P>
<P>
   Russo. Rated R for sexuality and language. 1 hour, 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A guilt-free summer diversion.

   CHINA-SECT (Beijing) _ The crackdown on the Falun Gong sect is
turning out to be far less severe than it first looked, with more

forest land south of the Grand Canyon. They have two final choices:
a conservative plan that would cut out only 50 acres for federal
housing and community facilities, and a proposal by a Scottsdale,
Ariz., developer to clear a section four times as big so that
hotels and retail space can be added. Both would also provide 60
acres for a transit center where a new light rail will pick up
canyon-bound visitors. (Summary from wires) By Michael Janofsky.

   MARKET (New York) _ Stocks fell sharply this morning after the
Labor Department reported that labor costs rose in the second
quarter at their fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 1997.
Productivity growth rose at a 1.3 percent annual rate, a sharper
slowdown than expected. By early afternoon stocks had recovered,
with the Dow up 46 points, the S&AMP;P 500 and NASDAQ little changed.
The 30-year Treasury bond was yielding 6.08 percent. European
markets were lower, with London down 2.22 percent and Frankfurt
down 2.78 percent. Tokyo stocks closed down 1.85 percent, and in
Hong Kong, the Hang Seng was down 2.48 percent. (Story will

   DATA-STARTUPS (Eatontown, N.J.) _ Spurred on by the voracious
global appetite for advanced data services, dozens, perhaps
hundreds, of start-up companies like Tachion Networks are seeking
to supply the new technologies underlying the communications
revolution. What's unusual about the emergence of companies like
Tachion is that unlike Web companies, which have drawn its
management strength from established financial and commercial
enterprises, communications start-ups have had a harder time
drawing from the industry's behemoths. That lack of industry
pollination has been particularly striking in New Jersey, home to
Bell Labs, AT&AMP;T and the Science Applications International
Corporation's Telcordia unit. Should Tachion, based in Eatontown
and with a core of former Bell Labs engineers, be successful, all
that might change. By Seth Schiesel.

SERVICES EMERGE TO PROTECT ON-LINE COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBY McGILL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mirroring the explosion of electronic commerce
nationwide, there has been a growth of organizations specializing
in on-line consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Washington-based Internet Fraud Watch, the
number of fraud complaints about Internet commerce jumped from
1,280 in 1997 to 7,752 last year. While the Federal Trade
Commission has acknowledged the problem, the agency says Internet
fraud is not among its top complaints. This makes on-line consumer
groups an important alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Bojana Fazarinc heads the San Francisco chapter of the Better
Business Bureau Online (www.bbb.org). BBBO, based in Arlington,
Va., follows the same model established by its parent, the
87-year-old Better Business Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The BBBO says its mission is to ``promote trust and confidence
on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Fazarinc says the primary challenge facing the BBBO is the
relative anonymity of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (on-line businesses) can put up their shingle without any
ability for the customer to confirm that they really exist and that
they will be there when there is a problem with a product or a
service,'' Fazarinc said.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications, a New York-based research group,
estimates that e-commerce sales will approach $12 billion for all
of 1999 compared with $7.1 billion in 1998. Jupiter predicts that
e-commerce sales will mushroom to $41.1 million by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russ Bodoff, senior vice president and chief
operating officer of the BBBO, businesses eager to get a slice of
the huge market can gain credibility among consumers by joining his
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Members must adhere to a code of business practices set forth by
the BBBO, such as truth in advertising and full disclosure of
privacy policies. If a company disregards its policies as stated to
the customer, it forfeits the right to display the BBBO seal of
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Member companies have to pay BBBO to be listed. Bodoff said that
annual memberships range from ``a few hundred dollars'' for small
businesses, to as high as $5,000 for larger corporate members.
</P>
<P>
   Bodoff said the organization has about 3,600 member businesses,
including industry giants Microsoft, AT&AMP;T and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   BBBO is not the only cop on the e-commerce beat. Others include:
</P>
<P>
   _ FlimFlam.com (www.flimflam.com), a nonprofit Web site that
monitors on-line scams and distributes the information to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   _ ICAB (www.isitsafe.com) allows consumers to submit a company's
URL for approval. If the URL is not listed, ICAB will research the
company and post the result.

 &HT;    Fresh fruit . a little imagination needed to create splendid
summer desserts.
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mangoes drop like red-orange bombs in the back yard.
Passionfruits and lychees are ripe for the picking.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes a chef with a cool dessert in mind. In this case,
it's Mike Perrin, chef-owner of 11 Maple Street in Jensen Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Add his organic herb garden and intuitive creativity, and you
have a sweet, tropical ending for a meal.
</P>
<P>
   Take his coconut sorbet, set among the petals of a sliced
medjool date. He scents it with lemon balm, and perches it atop a
macadamia nut crumble. A few strawberry-infused tuiles add crunch
and color, while a drizzle of maple syrup tops off this tower of
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you have a backyard Eden in full fruit, or you buy your
fruits from a roadside stand, you can follow Perrin's lead and turn
them into cool, refreshing desserts that make you forget the heat.
(Save those heavy chocolate concoctions for cooler weather.) Many
of the summer fruits or berries will work; they don't have to be
tropical.
</P>
<P>
   The chef's one lament about the seasonal fruits is having no
fresh figs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't be in for a few weeks,'' Perrin said. ``I'd prefer
those instead of the dates, but the dates are nice and have a good
texture contrast for the sorbet.''
</P>
<P>
   But substituting figs for dates is just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   You can lose the strawberry and add lemon to the tuiles _ or use
lemon instead of coconut in the sorbet. Or make a passionfruit
coulis instead
</P>
<P>
   In Perrin's tropical pancakes and passionfruit with mango
mousse, the coconut is used in the crepe-like pancakes.
Passionfruits perch atop them, and are filled with the creamy mango
mousse. Passionfruit is in the coulis here for color, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fruits really are versatile,'' Perrin said. ``They have a
lot of distinctive flavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Home cooks can use all or only a few of his ideas. For instance,
you can make the coconut sorbet, and use it to fill a sponge
jellyroll. Serve the pinwheel-like slices with a mango sauce or
chutney.
</P>
<P>
   Take the coconut pancakes and roll them around a fresh fruit
medley of mangoes (use peaches or even apples if you don't have
mangoes). Top with dollops of icy sorbet _ lemon would be good here
_ and drizzle a flaming rum sauce over all for an elegant
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Cheesecake is another natural cool base for the fruits. Judy
Pertnoy at Sweet Endings commercial bakery in West Palm Beach uses
several fruits in her popular tropical passion cheesecake. It's
full of mangoes and passionfruit, and studded with mandarin
oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Her desserts are sold to chefs around the state and throughout
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a couple of tropical things. The reason is that we
do a lot with the islands and Key West. People come down to Florida
and expect something tropical besides Key lime pie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She adapted the recipe for her popular cheesecake for our home
cooks. A mango cheesecake has a coconut crumb crust. She suggests a
passionfruit sauce for color. ``You could toast more coconut and
sprinkle it on top of the coulis; that would be really pretty,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leave yourself open to ideas and mix and match from the
following recipes for a cool, tropical end to a meal.

   WASHINGTON _ While Jan. 1 will not bring widespread power
outages or bank failures, the day may be difficult for thousands of
local governments, small hospitals, school districts and small
businesses, the Clinton administration said Thursday in its latest
overview of the year 2000 software problem.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Y2K bug'' is a programming flaw that can cause some older
computers and electronic equipment to misread the date 2000 as
1900, potentially causing malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic infrastructure of the country will hold,'' said John
Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion. He said enough work has been done at banks, utilities,
stock exchanges and federal agencies to ensure ``we're not going to
have a national catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the administration is worried about the many local
governments, small businesses, school districts and colleges that
have been taking a ``wait-and-see'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern is the lack of preparation being done by
the 911 call centers operated by local governments. Koskinen said
that as of June, only 37 percent of emergency call centers had
cleared their systems of computer bugs.
</P>
<P>
   He urged cities, counties, hospitals and businesses to develop
contingency plans for coping with possible system failures _ for
example, assigning police officers to major intersections at
midnight in case computer-controlled traffic lights malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Contingency plans also are needed for school districts, most of
which are woefully unprepared for computer problems. Only 28
percent of more than 3,500 school systems reported being ready for
the date change, he said. Possible problems for schools include the
loss of computer systems that control bus schedules, report cards,
transcripts and payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K report, which was the third quarterly assessment issued
by the president's council, forecast no significant problems with
the nation's grocery stores, banks, electrical and water utilities
and phone companies, except for international calls.
</P>
<P>
   While Koskinen was generally upbeat about the United States'
ability to handle Y2K disruptions, the White House was less
optimistic about other countries. The report noted that while
foreign preparations have increased in recent months, many
governments lack information about the readiness of their
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen also said the outlook for computers that regulate
international maritime traffic were mixed, noting that many
questions still surround the preparedness of many ports and
foreign-flagged ships.

EPA SAYS HUDSON POSES HEALTH RISKS TO HUMANS, WILDLIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DINA CAPPIELLO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ An Environmental Protection Agency study says
eating fish from the northern sections of the Hudson River
increases the risk of cancer and other health problems because of
PCB contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's conclusions are the latest addition to a chronic
debate over the impact of PCBs in the river _ and how to remove
them _ particularly in the section north of the Troy dam.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne M. Fox, the federal agency's regional administrator, said
the study advanced the EPA's evaluation of the Hudson River and
ways to protect the environment and the people who use it. The
study was released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The General Electric Co. used PCBs, or polychlorinated
biphenyls, for about three decades as an insulator in electric
capacitors. The company legally discharged more than one million
pounds of the chemicals into the river before the chemicals were
banned in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on whether to dredge the upper river _ a multimillion
dollar project that GE could be forced to fund _ is due in 2001. GE
says it has spent $150 million to remove some of the PCBs it
discharged.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the government study came two days after Rep.
John Sweeney, R-N.Y., called on the General Accounting Office to
evaluate EPA science. Sweeney, who is among the most vocal
opponents to dredging, also said Monday that he doubts a link
between PCBs and human illness but suspects there could be ``a
greater risk if PCBs are dredged from the river and we have direct
contact with them.''
</P>
<P>
   PCBs are listed as a probable human carcinogen by the EPA
because research showed they cause cancer in laboratory rats.
</P>
<P>
   In people, a risk of cancer 10 times the highest level allowed
under the federal Superfund law occurs when they eat an
above-average amount of fish, said Alison Hess, a program manager
for the Hudson River Reassessment Project. Some 200 miles of the
Hudson are contaminated with PCBs, making it the largest Superfund
toxic-waste site in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Health problems other than cancer are a threat for people who
eat an average amount of fish from the Upper Hudson, the EPA study
concluded. One meal a week raises the chance of reproductive,
development, immune system and learning problems higher than the
federal ``level of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   GE maintains that PCBs are entombed naturally by sediment, that
the levels in fish have dropped by 90 percent and that dredging is
not needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most effective way to reduce PCB levels in fish, which is
our goal, is to continue the cleanup GE has been doing for 20
years. And that is, shutting off PCB sources into the river,'' said
Mark Behan, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized the study for extrapolating the effects and
exposure to PCBs from previous research rather than actual data
from the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Although eating all fish from the upper Hudson remains
prohibited and a state Health Department study this year found
widespread compliance with the regulation, many people still rely
on its fish for their diet, environmental activists contend.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how much a person eats, the health risk varies. The
EPA estimates that three additional cases of cancer for every
100,000 people occur when six meals are eaten every year. That risk
jumps to 100 additional cases per 100,000 people when 51 meals are
consumed each year. In addition to eating fish, which store PCBs in
their fatty tissues, people are exposed to the chemicals by
inhaling them from the air and coming into contact with them in
water and sediment. The study found these other pathways less
hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   A second EPA report released Wednesday showed that the
contamination poses risks to river wildlife _ bald eagles,
largemouth bass, striped bass, belted kingfishers, great blue
herons, minks and otters.
</P>
<P>
   Although the EPA studies assume that no cleanup measures will be
taken, matching numbers to human health is likely to be used to
strengthen the case for dredging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health risks associated with PCBs make a case for
cleanup,'' said Cara Lee of the Poughkeepsie-based Scenic Hudson
environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who has vowed to make sure
GE takes financial responsibility for a cleanup, issued a statement
Wednesday expressing confidence in the EPA. He said the reports
again confirmed that PCBs have ``ravaged the Hudson River
ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   Although PCB concentrations drop further downstream where the
consumption of some fish is allowed, they still pose risks,
according to the EPA. The agency said studies on the health and
ecological effects on the mid-and lower Hudson River will be
released later this year.

<P>
   ERBIL, Iraq _ Rather than forfeit the land of his ancestors to
land mines, Hassan Hussein Darwish decided to fight the odds and
remove them.
</P>
<P>
   The odds caught up to him. Now, a 29-year-old missing his hands
and eyes, Darwish tells the story of those who landmine experts
call ``village de-miners.''
</P>
<P>
   They risk their lives for land their families need to make a
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come to the mines. The mines came to us,'' says
Darwish, an Iraqi Kurd. ``Of course, you are face-to-face with
death at any moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Iraq, a semi-independent region also called Iraqi
Kurdistan, is one of the most heavily mined regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations officials estimate that more than 20 percent of
the land, in fertile valleys and steep mountainsides, is laden with
up to 10 million landmines. It may take 35 to 70 years to clear
them all.
</P>
<P>
   The mines were laid in complex layers. The Iraqi and Iranian
armies planted the most, during their eight-year war in the 1980s.
Turkish forces have also laid some mines, as have the three main
Kurdish forces, often warring against each other.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, multiple forces laid mines on the same land,
making it especially difficult to find accurate maps of the
explosives beneath the ground.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 people have been injured, including about 2,400
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations de-mining program in Iraqi Kurdistan, which
began in 1997, has more than 900 staff to remove mines and train
locals to remove them. They do it the right way -- with body armor,
mine-sniffing dogs, metal detectors and, above all, with great
care.
</P>
<P>
   That's not how Darwish did the job.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a year and a half after his injury, he has moved from his
mountain village to a squalid block house on the shanty-town edges
of urban Erbil where he tells his story.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man who writes poetry -- he calls himself a ``friend of
the pen'' though he now dictates his poems. He confidently slices
the air with the two pointed stumps of his forearms to make his
point.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting cross-legged on a metal frame bed, he describes life in
the village of Balula, near the Iranian border.
</P>
<P>
   His family planted rice, and other vegetables and fruit on the
land. They lived in mud brick houses without electricity. Due to
wars and uprisings, they spent years as refugees before returning
to the village in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of residents have since been killed by the mines, which
they think were laid by the Iraqi army in order to deter an Iranian
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Darwish starting clearing mines in 1992, picking up the skill
with other villagers from a neighbor who had trained with a
mine-clearing agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were imitating each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Darwish worked full-time at the job and said every family in the
village of 120 homes had a son clearing mines.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Darwish had mine maps to help him. Otherwise, he
just used metal prods to probe the ground. Sometimes, he burned the
brush to make mines easier to spot.
</P>
<P>
   He says he removed more than 2,000 mines over five years,
gingerly lifting them from the ground and disarming them. He
cleared about 20 on the morning he came across a small mine he did
not recognize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had it in my hands and was inspecting it, then it
exploded,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, professional mine removers leave the mines in the
ground and explode them there, rather than risk moving them. It's
one technique they use to make the job safe.
</P>
<P>
   David Edwards, project coordinator for the U.N. mine program in
Iraqi Kurdistan, said no U.N. de-miners in Iraq have been hurt
clearing mines yet. He shakes his head at the village de-miners
like Darwish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire what they do,'' Edwards said. ``It's just bloody
dangerous.''

SUPERHERO SATIRE FLESHES OUT COMIC BOOK CHARACTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tired of overdesigned, underimagined and utterly
soulless superhero movies?
</P>
<P>
   So were the makers of ``Mystery Men.'' Though based on a
long-running set of supporting characters in Dark Horse Comics'
``Flaming Carrot'' series that satirized the absurdities of that
sturdiest of comic book genres, the $70 million movie production
had to do more than just take obvious shots at broad targets.
</P>
<P>
   After all, wasn't the last ``Batman'' sequel such an
unintentional self-parody that it probably couldn't be topped?
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than the original `Batman' movie, which Tim Burton did
and I thought was great, superhero films became too overly
produced, too gadget-oriented, and you started to lose the
characters,'' says Kinka Usher, an award-winning commercials
director (Miller Lite, Taco Bell, ``Got Milk?'') who makes his
feature debut with ``Mystery Men.'' ``Something we tried very hard
to do with this was preserve the characters as the most important
element of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing ``Mystery Men'' does have going for it is characters.
Boy, are they characters.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Burden, the cartoonist who created this kind of
bargain-basement Justice League, saw them as the guys who really
want to be crimefighters but just don't have the powers to get the
job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a world with Batman in it, in that world there's
got to be guys who sit in a diner somewhere and complain that, if
they only had the right break, they'd get the attention he does,''
notes Mike Richardson, the founder of Dark Horse Comics who has
produced ``The Mask,'' ``Barb Wire'' and several other movies based
on his company's publications. ``I liken it to playing basketball
on playgrounds with the guy who's always there that says, `I'd be
playing in the NBA if I'd gotten a break.' Of course, everybody
knows there's not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's our guys. They're not superheroes but they want
to be in the worst way. That's their dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of some 40 costumed wanna-bes who have popped up over the
years in the ``Mystery Men'' strips, a core of seven deemed, um,
most relatable to the average guy were chosen for screen
immortality.
</P>
<P>
   The three principal pretenders are Mr. Furious, a junkyard
worker with no particular power but who can get very, very mad,
played by ``There's Something About Mary's'' Ben Stiller; the
Shoveler (William H. Macy), a working-class family man who truly
believes that his incredible dexterity with, well, a shovel has to
be used for the public good; And the Blue Raja _ played with a fake
English accent by ``Simpsons'' voice wiz Hank Azaria _ who still
lives with his mom and has mastered the art of hurling silverware _
though he refuses to fling knives.
</P>
<P>
   These likable losers have been overshadowed their whole
non-careers by Champion City's star, corporate-sponsored superhero,
Capt. Amazing (Greg Kinnear). But when he's captured by evil genius
Casanova Frankenstein (``Shine's'' Geoffrey Rush), our guys are
forced to beef up their ranks with even more pathetic specimens to
save the day.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new recruits are the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo),
daughter of the original Bowler, whose still-powerful skull has
been preserved inside a deadly accurate round hunk of lucite; the
Invisible Boy (Nickelodeon's Kel Mitchell), a kid so accustomed to
being overlooked that he's actually developed the power to turn
invisible _ as long as nobody's watching; the Spleen (erstwhile
Pee-wee Herman Paul Reubens), master of incapacitating body odors;
and the mysterious Sphinx (Wes Studi), who actually has some neat
powers but bores everybody stiff with his Yoda-like platitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Funny stuff. But pitching it right was tricky. Satire, as the
show-biz truism goes, is what closes on Saturday night, and in
order to properly parody the gigantism the genre's grown into, more
money had to be spent on ``Mystery Men'' than on your average,
catchall spoof film of the ``Airplane!''/``Hot Shots!'' variety.
But to try to earn that investment back, it was decided, audiences
needed something more to latch onto than scattershot snide jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge of this movie was walking a fine line between
satire and being pretty sincere at the same time, sort of having it
both ways,'' says Lloyd Levin, who produced the film with partner
Lawrence Gordon (``Die Hard,'' ``Predator'') and Dark Horse's
Richardson. ``To me, some of the funniest stuff is when it's at its
most sincere as well.''
</P>
<P>
   To pull this off, the producers knew they needed funny actors,
but ones who were capable of bringing some humanity back to the
genre as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal was to cast people who would never be cast in some
of the more constipated versions of superhero stories,'' Levin
says, not joking.
</P>
<P>
   And the players took their assignment to heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, I loved reading Marvel comics at camp,''
Blue Raja Azaria recalls. ``My idea was, what if you actually tried
to live out your childhood fantasy of being a superhero. So, I
viewed him as a guy who just did not grow up. I felt, why not carry
it far enough that a guy actually changes his voice and his persona
to be a superhero character, playing with the idea of an alter ego
a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my original ideas was to actually play the character
like an 8-year-old,'' Azaria adds. ``That seemed like going a
little too far, but I always felt kind of like an 8-year-old
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo, whose sophisticated, dry wit has been praised in such
films as ``Clay Pigeons'' and ``The Truth About Cats and Dogs,''
never read superhero comics. But she has opinions about the general
state of costumed crimefighter movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a big franchise with Batman, and there's talk
about making a Spider-Man movie and all of those things, but they
tend to take themselves too seriously,'' she observes. ``Even when
they claim to be poking fun and winking at the audience, to me they
still seem very overblown, overbudgeted, A-list actored.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this one, I'd say the only thing we've got is the giant
budget,'' she adds with a chuckle. ``But what hopefully has been
accomplished is the spectacle-type film with attention to dialogue,
which tend not to go hand-in-hand. The hope was that these
characters were invested with actual personalities and not
one-dimensional, flashy figures.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the Mystery Men came from an improvisational
comedy background, the shovel-slinging William H. Macy is a veteran
of playwright David Mamet's crack dramatic ensemble. He struggled
to bring a convincing earnestness to his performance, which proved
a somewhat quixotic mission among this group of cutups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't lie to you; the relationship that Hank, Ben and I had
on screen, we had off screen,'' Macy, who earned an Oscar
nomination for his work in ``Fargo,'' reveals. ``I was constantly
bickering with them, saying, `Yeah, enough with the jokes, but
isn't this a scene where...' But working with all of these people
who were so improvisatory was good for me, because I either had to
duke it out or lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy shares most of the ``Mystery'' crew's disappointment with
what superhero films have mutated into.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all became about the special effects, the explosions, and
I'm just bored with that stuff,'' he says. ``All an explosion can
be now is a little bigger than the last one. It doesn't appeal to
me. What appeals to me is a story that has something to do with my
life. Even if it takes place on Mars or in the Old West or in a
comic book, there's got to be a dilemma that I can relate to.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why this script appealed to me,'' Macy adds, waxing
Shoveleric. ``It's about everyday people with everyday foibles we
can all identify with, who are not prepared to fight the villain.
They don't have the tools they need, they're the last guys in the
world who should be given this job, but there ain't nobody else,
and it's gotta be us.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the stories that just make me weep, the everyday
schmo who must rise to the occasion. It strikes me as a singularly
American story, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Very American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we all want Capt. Amazing's endorsements and
fame,'' Macy notes. And indeed, the film's take on superheroes also
serves as a not-so-disguised joshing of show biz and celebrity in
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally an actor's story,'' Azaria notes. ``Or like guys
forming a rock band, very similar vibe. My character's adoration of
Capt. Amazing would be like the way you'd bother Mel Gibson or
somebody like that if you saw them.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the little guy's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the great Jenifer Lewis, who plays my wife in the movie,
says, `Honey, you've been doing this for 15 years, isn't it time to
give it up'... Well, we all know that speech, don't we?'' Macy
adds.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, ``Mystery Men,'' the movie, will become a notch
of bankability in the utility belts of everyone who was involved
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're exactly `Austin Powers' or `Big Daddy' or
`American Pie' kind of comedy, and I don't think that we're the
traditional superhero movie,'' producer Levin acknowledges. ``I
just hope that it's refreshing enough that people like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a gigantic audience that finds the superhero genre
appealing and has been kind of disappointed in what they've been
seeing in those movies recently,'' Levin adds. ``They might
appreciate a movie in which the characters are as intelligent as
they are.'' &UR;  &QL;

`LOCK, STOCK' AND BARRELS OF SHADY CHARACTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Along with the razzle-dazzle that British
writer-director Guy Ritchie brought to his first feature, the crime
comedy ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' was some true grit
in the form of real-life criminals. Ritchie says he estimates that
about half the cast has criminal records while another 25 percent
probably hasn't been caught yet.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, despite critical raves here and big box-office
numbers in England, the film did little business in America when it
was released in March. This may have been because U.S. audiences
were put off by the thick cockney accents. Too bad, because it's
one of the best films so far this year, especially when you
consider many of the dismal efforts that have come out this summer.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, ``Lock'' hits video stores, and, thanks to the
rewind button, you won't miss the film's wacky dialogue that gives
the caper story such a fun, offbeat flavor. It's basically the
story of four lads who live on the edge of the criminal world and
spot a chance to make a big score by ripping off a drug dealer. But
they are a gang that couldn't shoot straight _ or actually, at all;
so, things quickly and hilariously go awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're armed,'' says Eddie (Nick Moran), when the gang
unexpectedly runs into its foes. ``Armed? Armed with what?'' asks
Soap (Dexter Fletcher). ``Feather dusters, colorful language. What
do you think? Guns, you twit!''
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie, who got his start directing commercials and music
videos, keeps the action-and-laugh quota high while giving the
modestly budgeted film (it cost $1.6 million) a pop visual style
without being gratuitous in an MTV sort of way, which is an
irritating fault of many recent first-time directors.
</P>
<P>
   Though you might not recognize the faces _ rock star Sting, who
plays a small role, is the biggest name _ ``Lock'' is rollicking
good fun, and Ritchie is a director to watch.
</P>
<P>
   LOVE THAT BARD: ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which also comes out on
Tuesday, doesn't have as many guns as ``Lock,'' but it has lots of
swordplay _ in both senses of the way the Bard of Avon used it in
his plays. The Oscar-winning film is overrated in cinematic terms
but nevertheless is quite charming and highly entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   It also boasts some wonderful performances. While Gwyneth
Paltrow and Judi Dench picked up Academy Awards for best actress
and best supporting actress, respectively, the men shouldn't be
overlooked. Joseph Fiennes as Shakespeare imbues his Bard with the
strong will he needs to pull off his dual pursuit of Viola
(Paltrow) and theatrical success, while Geoffrey Rush is
delightfully daffy as in-debt theater impresario Philip Henslowe.
</P>
<P>
   Like Shakespeare's own plays, ``Shakespeare'' is filled with
mistaken or hidden identities, pratfalls, raucous puns, tragedy
and, of course, love's labors lost.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay by Marc Normand and Tom Stoppard is quite clever
in interweaving historical events and Shakespearean themes into a
story that feels as up to date as it is Elizabethan.
</P>
<P>
   Deftly directed by John Madden, ``Shakespeare'' is an appealing
souffle, even for guys who like smoking guns.
</P>
<P>
   SOMETHING MORE ABOUT `MARY': Flipping radio dials recently, I
landed on ``Build Me Up Buttercup,'' a song I hated until last
year's hit film ``There's Something About Mary.'' It's funny how a
good movie can change you. Now, despite my critical tastes, I find
myself singing along. Earlier this week, Fox released a ``Special
Edition'' DVD that features an extra video that is a sort of
sing-along of the song plus about seven minutes of outtakes. This
may not make the DVD really special, but the film _ which is
destined to be a comedy classic _ alone is worth it, and the
additional material is a bonus. &QL;

98 DEGREES MOVING BEYOND POP IDOL STATUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The heat is still on for Ohio-born pop foursome 98
Degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But the Grammy-nominated boy band, which scored smash singles
(``The Hardest Thing,'' ``Because of You'') along with its album
(``98 Degrees and Rising''), is targeting a wider audience than
just the teen-age girls who screamed during the quartet's
performance at the KIIS-FM (102.7) fest at Dodger Stadium in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're musicians who sing,'' said Jeff Timmons, 25, of the
harmony-driven group, which also includes Justin Jeffre and
brothers Nick and Drew Lachey. ``Hopefully, we offer a variety of
things for people. We're not just going for the pop phenomenon
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   With lyrics that go beyond the usual teen-magnet interests and a
live show that focuses on singing rather than flashy choreography,
98 Degrees seem less tailored than Five, C-Note and 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   ``We model ourselves after Boyz II Men, and that's what we're
known for,'' said the New York-based Timmons. ``Expect uptempo
material from us. We don't mind being compared to the Backstreet
Boys, but once you see our show and hear our records, you'll see
we're not the best dancers in the world but we do care about
singing. That's our main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is, 98 Degrees' audience ranges from teens to
middle-aged women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ballads are definitely our thing,'' Timmons said. ``It's
something that comes naturally to us.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ON THE SCENE:
</P>
<P>
   Still-sealed vinyl jazz on the Blue Note label will be among the
attractions at the Universal Record Show on Sunday at the Beverly
Garland Hotel (4222 Vineland Ave., North Hollywood). In addition,
Viper Room DJ Mike Vague will join more than 40 other music vendors
at the event, which runs from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. ... Dixie Chicks'
new album, ``Fly,'' is due Aug. 31. ... John Hiatt has been named
the new host of public TV's music series ``Sessions at West 54th.''
Guests for the new season include Los Lobos, Mandy Barnett, Ruben
Blades, Diana Krall, Sheryl Crow and Macy Gray. ... Paul McCartney
has two albums out in October. ``Run Devil Run'' is a collection of
rock 'n' roll covers and ``Working Classical'' features chamber
music versions of Beatles and Wings songs along with orchestral
readings of McCartney's classical pieces.

`THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR': WINDMILLS OF TWO MINDS  
(PRODUCTION NOTES AT END)
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This is an elegant crime done by an elegant person,'' somebody
in the very '90s remake of ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' says _ none
too elegantly _ about an art heist committed by the title
character. What that apparently means is that Crown stays natty
even when sliding under a museum's security gate, that he is heard
calmly betting $100,000 on a golf shot, that his house on a
tropical island is atop the highest hill and that he and this
story's heroine share their most honestly amorous moment when they
go clothes shopping a deux. If the film had been shot in 3-D Imax,
it would be dangling price tags that the audience could reach out
and almost touch.
</P>
<P>
   The movie and its dapper stars, Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo,
glide by glossily enough to give it the earmarks of a guilty
pleasure. But guilty is the key word, since this papier-mache
romance seems to think that cupidity and Cupid are interrelated.
That's not a new idea in Hollywood, but it sure is a crass one when
the leading characters fan their peacock feathers better than they
flirt. For an allegedly steamy love story, ``The Thomas Crown
Affair'' works best (as ``Notting Hill'' did) as proof that sex can
be in the head: the film editor's head. In the midst of a boudoir
montage, one would-be erotic shot finds the stars simply stretched
out nude on their stomachs, like stacked bearskin rugs.
</P>
<P>
   John McTiernan, better known for the action in ``Predator,''
``The Hunt for Red October'' and the ``Die Hard'' movies than for
the tender feelings expressed therein, has remade the once-stylish
original 1968 ``Thomas Crown Affair'' into a film so Janus-like
that it divides screenwriting responsibilities. With Leslie Dixon
(``Outrageous Fortune'') apparently supplying the romance and Kurt
Wimmer (``Sphere'') in charge of Crown's larceny, it's
understandable that the film has an uncertain tone. And that it is
more comfortable with well-plotted scams, like a nifty one
featuring a horde of Magritte figures as decoys than with what
might happen between a wily billionaire thief-artiste and the
glamorous insurance investigator in whom he meets his match.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Russo's Catherine Banning, easily the most relentless and
fashionable insurance investigator since three months ago (when
Catherine Zeta-Jones played a similar role in ``Entrapment''),
makes her entrance in the film by flashing a garter while on the
trail of a stolen Monet. Having watched Brosnan's Thomas Crown make
off with it in a cleverly elaborate early sequence, the audience is
already poised to watch a battle of wits between these two. And
because the movie drips sophistication (the characters order
``vodka rocks, twist'' and ``scotch neat'' when they drink), it
promises a round of chesslike gamesmanship as they balance
self-interest with love.
</P>
<P>
   Love wins on paper. But on the screen, it's dueling egos all the
way. To a Martian with the bad luck to be monitoring lavish
Hollywood movies this summer, it would be hard to believe that real
emotion was involved anywhere in this story, even if Catherine and
Thomas are seen suffering over matters of love and trust. It must
be said that Ms. Russo, who has the more assertive role and also
the greater potential for heartbreak, does her considerable best to
make this credible while modeling a sleek new costume in every
scene. She basks in the role and in its potential for topless
abandon, even if this is the sort of film in which a technician is
credited with designing her hair.
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan seems more comfortably Bondian here than he does in 007
films (and there's a Catamaran Coordinator for the scene in which
he playfully capsizes a new-looking vessel, just because Crown
can). He moves smoothly through the film and brings suave
credibility to its caper scenes, if not to its more intimate
moments. Denis Leary is snappishly effective as the police
investigator who oversees the Monet investigation and otherwise
knows the lay of the land. ``From Brooklyn to Greenwich in one
generation,'' he says of the billionaire art connoisseur. ``You've
got to have the paintings to match.''
</P>
<P>
   Among notable footnotes to this tale of big-ticket love are
appearances by Faye Dunaway, star of the original with Steve
McQueen, as Crown's psychiatrist, and by the entry of the New York
Public Library as the filmmakers' closest approximation of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. (The Met was not wholeheartedly behind
a film about outsmarting its security systems.) Synergy-wise,
Lucent Technologies let its offices be used as Crown's and has
products plugged in the film, as does the jeweler Bulgari. A lovely
if forged art collection decorates the background. So, briefly,
does the soulfully pouty model Esther Canadas, who plays a svelte
mystery woman in Crown's life. Stick around for the last reel, when
her totally improbable function in the story is revealed.

`FREE ENTERPRISE': CAPTAIN KIRK AND FRIENDS GROUNDED IN NEVERLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prolonged adolescence of the sort built on inextinguishable
obsession with ``Star Trek,'' ``Star Wars,'' ``The Brady Bunch,''
Stephen King novels, mini-series like ``The Winds of War,'' comic
books, movie posters and action figures finds its justification in
the slight, bright, clever romantic comedy ``Free Enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Written by Mark A. Altman and Robert Meyer Burnett and directed
and edited by Burnett, this film tells the tale of two friends
named Robert and Mark. Shaped in childhood by ``Star Trek,'' they
are working in Los Angeles and coming up fast on 30, which, as
aficionados of the futuristic 1976 thriller ``Logan's Run,'' they
know to be the end of life. They are also hoping to find lasting
love and thrilled to become friends with their idol, William
Shatner, playing Bill, who proves to be a far cry from their idol,
Captain Kirk, commander of the Starship Enterprise in ``Star
Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   The fun of ``Free Enterprise,'' which occasionally runs a bit
thin but is mostly sustained by the filmmakers' verve and wit, lies
in its many visual and verbal references to popular culture trivia,
its knowing, gleeful sendups of movies and the movie business and
the good humor and willing feet of clay that Shatner brings to his
role.
</P>
<P>
   Like the high-spirited, irresponsible Robert (Rafer Weigel) and
the serious, Spock-like Mark (Eric McCormack), the hard-drinking,
stogie-smoking Bill is without a steady woman in his life. Like
Mark, who when first met is pitching a proposal for a horror film
called ``Bradykiller,'' Bill has his own dream movie project: a
musical version of ``Julius Caesar'' in which he will play all the
roles except Calpurnia. He is saving that for Sharon Stone or
Heather Locklear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free Enterprise'' brims with jokes of that sort. When Robert
finally meets the woman of his dreams, Claire (Audie England), over
a graphic novel in Golden Apple Comics, his friends don't employ
ordinary language to lament his ensuing absence from their life.
They compare him to Claude Rains in ``The Invisible Man.'' Action
across a pool table becomes a ``Color of Money'' moment. A great
idea for a birthday celebration would be to get together with
friends and go out to a theater playing ``Star Trek: The Wrath of
Khan.''
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as no surprise that ``Free Enterprise'' has a
Hollywood ending, with love ascendant, Shatner delivering a rap
rendition of Shakespeare, and final credits peppered with
references fit for a trivia contest.

 &HT;    BILL WOULD ALLOW INSURANCE RESERVE FOR MAJOR DISASTERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JONATHAN HALL
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Worried that a major natural disaster could
bankrupt insurers and leave thousands of consumers without
coverage, a bipartisan group of lawmakers Thursday unveiled a bill
to let the insurance industry insure itself.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., insurers would
direct some of their policy holders' premiums into a tax-deferred
reserve fund devoted only to covering claims associated with
natural disasters. Federal law now prohibits such a fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we cannot predict nor prevent natural disasters from
occurring, we can prepare for them,'' Foley said at a Capitol Hill
news conference. ``This is a common-sense measure ensuring that
home and business owners who suffer one tragedy don't suffer
another'' if an overexposed insurer went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   After Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992, 10 insurance
companies were unable to pay all of their affected policy holders.
It's believed that if Andrew had come closer to Miami, roughly
one-third of the insurance companies in Florida would have become
insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the disaster fund would be phased in gradually
over 20 years and held in a special tax-deferred account until
needed to pay claims to policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $16 billion reserve fund would be built within the
first 10 years, costing the government about $500 million per year
in deferred taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal tax law allows insurers to make reserves only
against losses that have already occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed bill ``will directly address and solve this problem
in the tax law,'' said the National Taxpayers Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taxpayers will be much better served. The insurance
companies can remedy the claims, remain solvent, remain in business
and not come up with the constant government solutions for the
(disaster) problems,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated efforts to adopt similar bills over several years have
failed to win congressional approval.

 &HT;    RILEY, COLLEGES SQUABBLE OVER Y2K-BUGS IN STUDENT LOANS
 &HT;    With Y2K.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Education Secretary Richard Riley irritated top
officials of the nation's colleges and universities Thursday by
scolding them for their delays in conducting Y2K-bug tests of the
data systems that funnel more than $40 billion a year in federal
loans and grants to their students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the (Education) Department's systems and data
exchanges have been tested internally, we all need the reassurance
that can only be provided by live testing of the data exchanges''
with the schools, Riley said. ``So far, only 22 of the over 5,800
U.S. institutions in the student aid programs have successfully
tested.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug is a software flaw that can cause some older
computers and electronic equipment to misread the date 2000 as
1900, potentially causing them to malfunction. If federal computers
don't mesh correctly with school computers, student aid could be
lost, delayed or incorrectly provided.
</P>
<P>
   The department's test period, originally set for July 8 to Aug.
20, will be extended to the end of August in hopes that more
schools will test their federal-aid links.
</P>
<P>
   Riley included two thinly veiled threats in a letter he sent to
each president or chancellor of an American public, private or
for-profit post-secondary school:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hinting at a bureaucratic crackdown, he said he is
``considering'' a proposal by his department's inspector general
that the government require, rather than merely encourage, data
exchange testing by schools whose students obtain federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hinting at bad publicity for schools, he said that ``negative
assumptions are likely'' for presidents and chancellors who fail to
spell out details of their progress in the Y2K conversion process
to the public through the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Leftwich, vice president of the Career College
Association, which consists of privately owned vocational schools,
said the Education Department's data must be inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would confidently say that the (federal aid software) in 85
to 90 percent of our more than 700 members is Y2K-compliant,''
Leftwich said. ``Our members know that student aid is is their
lifeblood, and they're not in business if that gets cut off.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Elmendorf, vice president for government policy at the
American Association of State Colleges and Universities, criticized
the ``exaggeration'' in Riley's letter, and noted that the data
exchanges are optional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 426 members we had at our most recent board meeting in
July, every single president had a committee or other effort under
way, not only to make their own institution Y2K-ready, but also
their their vendors,'' Elmendorf said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Education Department is only one of our vendors, and I'm
sure our members will eventually test data exchanges with it when
they are ready,'' Elmendorf said. Meantime, he said, many are
giving a higher priority to tests of their links with vendors who
handle faculty payrolls and with foundations and other large
funders, he said.

`THE ACID HOUSE': SHORT STORIES, NASTY AND BRUTISH, OF LIFE IN
EDINBURGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The operating philosophy of the Scottish slum dwellers who
growl, spit, curse and brawl through Paul McGuigan's nastily
amusing film, ``The Acid House,'' could be boiled down to a single
acerbic slogan: it's kind to be cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming inured at an early age to the human savagery at the
bottom of the social ladder is the only way to survive the meanness
and degradation so flamboyantly exhibited in these three vignettes
evoking the lower depths of North Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the short stories of Irvine Welsh, the author of
``Trainspotting,'' ``The Acid House'' covers the same milieu and
has a similar excremental view of humans as hyper-stimulated vermin
scuttling avidly through the trash heap of life.
</P>
<P>
   With a screenplay by Welsh, the new movie strains even harder
than its forerunner to be shocking, repulsive and funny all at
once.
</P>
<P>
   If not for its nihilistic humor and carnival surrealism, ``The
Acid House'' could have been nicknamed ``Last Exit to Edinburgh.''
But where Hubert Selby Jr.'s end-of-the-line portrait of the
Brooklyn waterfront slums was steeped in romantic despair, the
characters in Welsh's north Edinburgh wasteland react to
frustration with a high-spirited rage. Violence and revenge aren't
merely cathartic, they're a hoot, and we're encouraged to join in
the laughter.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening vignette, ``The Granton Star Cause,'' Boab Coyle
(Stephen McCole), a shiftless, soccer-obsessed slob who lives with
his parents and works at a dead-end job in a furniture removal
company, has the grimy rug of his existence suddenly pulled out
from under him. In a matter of hours, he is arrested and viciously
beaten up by a policeman, dismissed from his job, dumped by his
girlfriend and tossed out of the house by his parents, who are
desperate to resume their grotesquely kinky sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Moping self-pityingly in a bar, Boab is approached by a scuffy
stranger claiming to be God (Maurice Roeves), who berates him for
his wasted life and exacts final judgment by turning him into a
house fly. As Boab buzzes noisily through his previous haunts,
where he is sometimes recognized, he takes poisonous revenge
against his persecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The second vignette, ``A Soft Touch,'' follows the disastrous
marriage of Johnny (Kevin McKidd) and his pregnant, slatternly
wife, Catriona (Michelle Gomez), who has slept with most of the
male guests at their wedding. When a cocky new neighbor, Larry
(Gary McCormack) moves in next door to the newlyweds in their ratty
tenement, he initiates a flagrant affair with the voracious
Catriona, leaving Johnny to tend to his daughter Chantal while
Catriona and Larry make loud screaming love upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   The vignette views Johnny with the same sadistic scorn as
Catriona and Larry, who in the story's most sickening scene beat up
the poor sap just for kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the goofy title story, about an exchange of
souls between Coco Bryce (Ewen Bremner) an LSD-imbibing layabout,
and the newborn baby of a middle-class couple, Rory (Martin Clunes)
and Jenny (Jemma Redgrave). The cosmic transfer takes place during
a thunderstorm when Coco is struck by lightning while reeling
crazily from an LSD overdose.
</P>
<P>
   As Coco languishes in a state of pre-natal idiocy tended by his
doting fiancee, Kirsty (Arlene Cockburn), the lascivious demon
child inside Jenny's newborn baby curses and chortles as she
tenderly suckles him.
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Acid House,'' which opens Friday in Manhattan, is as
flashy a piece of work as ``Trainspotting,'' it lacks its
forerunner's sociological depth. With a cackling nihilistic glee,
the movie rubs our faces in the stinking, screaming muck of raw
human appetite and insists that that's all there is.
</P>
<P>
   Sex is violent and sadomasochistic, childbirth a living hell and
any sort of tenderness a ludicrous self-deluded sentimentality.
Maybe so. But the movie overplays its hand. Once you get the joke,
about a third of the way through, the joke is gotten.

 &HT;    BILL WOULD ALLOW INSURANCE RESERVE FOR MAJOR DISASTERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JONATHAN HALL
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Worried that a major natural disaster could
bankrupt insurers and leave thousands of consumers without
coverage, a bipartisan group of lawmakers Thursday unveiled a bill
to let the insurance industry insure itself.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., insurers would
direct some of their policy holders' premiums into a tax-deferred
reserve fund devoted only to covering claims associated with
natural disasters. Federal law now prohibits such a fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we cannot predict nor prevent natural disasters from
occurring, we can prepare for them,'' Foley said at a Capitol Hill
news conference. ``This is a common-sense measure ensuring that
home and business owners who suffer one tragedy don't suffer
another'' if an overexposed insurer went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   After Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992, 10 insurance
companies were unable to pay all of their affected policy holders.
It's believed that if Andrew had come closer to Miami, roughly
one-third of the insurance companies in Florida would have become
insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the disaster fund would be phased in gradually
over 20 years and held in a special tax-deferred account until
needed to pay claims to policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $16 billion reserve fund would be built within the
first 10 years, costing the government about $500 million per year
in deferred taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal tax law allows insurers to make reserves only
against losses that have already occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed bill ``will directly address and solve this problem
in the tax law,'' said the National Taxpayers Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taxpayers will be much better served. The insurance
companies can remedy the claims, remain solvent, remain in business
and not come up with the constant government solutions for the
(disaster) problems,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated efforts to adopt similar bills over several years have
failed to win congressional approval.

`MYSTERY MEN': SUPERMEN, CARTOON CHARACTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Austin Powers, the self-styled superheroes of ``Mystery
Men'' have only the dimmest suspicions that they are anything short
of cool. The way they see it, the world was running out of
superheroes, and, well, it was a dirty job but somebody had to do
it. Even somebody armed with forks, a shovel, a bad temper or a
bowling ball. The kind of paragon who might solemnly intone, as
William H. Macy's Shoveler does: ``We've got a blind date with
Destiny _ and it looks like she's ordered the lobster.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, these aspiring supermen (and one superwoman, played by
Janeane Garofalo armed with one weird bowling ball) have been
reading too many comic books. And this crafty tongue-in-cheek
satire hopes that its audience has, too. This witty if eventually
overblown movie is based on the Dark Horse series created by Bob
Burden, and it plays off the conventions of the genre at their most
absurd. When the Shoveler is told that the stellar Captain Amazing
(Greg Kinnear with one hilariously quizzical raised eyebrow) is
actually mild-mannered Lance Hunt, he notes in bewilderment that
Lance wears glasses but the Captain does not. ``That's
ridiculous,'' surmises the Shoveler, in a fine display of logic a
la Spinal Tap. ``He wouldn't be able to see!''
</P>
<P>
   With a terrific offbeat cast operating on one shared, loony
wavelength, ``Mystery Men'' introduces Hank Azaria as the Blue
Raja, who actually wears green, fakes an effete English accent and
tosses dinner forks as his special skill. (Yes, there's a bold cry
of ``May the forks be with you!'' heard here.) Ben Stiller plays
the self-proclaimed powder keg whose weapon would be his temper if
it actually scared anyone, and Macy totes his shovel with great
deadpan aplomb. They are late joined by Paul Reubens, whose
exaggerated pimples and carefully deployed flatulence do wear out
their welcome, and Wes Studi of ``Dances With Wolves'' as The
Sphinx, the compleat know-nothing sage. The Sphinx is just about
unstoppable when he starts delivering such pearls as ``To learn my
teachings, I must first teach you how to learn.'' And: ``You must
lash out with every limb, like the octopus who plays the drums.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by Kinka Usher with a little too much of the
same special-effects silliness that it mocks, locks its hapless
good guys in battle with Casanova Frankenstein, played by Geoffrey
Rush in another sneakily funny turn. Casanova is abetted by the
Disco Boys, who lurk in their lair to the accompaniment of the Bee
Gees and manage to mimic John Travolta's famous ``Saturday Night
Fever'' pose when they go into the fray. Also cropping up in small
roles are Tom Waits as a weapons designer, in a movie where talk of
things like ``a heat-seeking anthrax projection dart'' comes cheap;
Louise Lasser as the mom who wonders if her Blue Raja isn't ``on
the marijuana''; Claire Forlani and Lena Olin in small but sharp
roles, and Jenifer Lewis as the exasperated Mrs. Shoveler.
</P>
<P>
   The jokes are smart in the screenplay by Neil Cuthbert, but they
are allowed to wear thin despite the brief running time. And the
look of ``Mystery Men,'' in which businesses like wholesale fish
and tire shops are well represented, is droll yet overly cluttered.
The requisite air of futuristic grunge and global reach is conveyed
by what look like signs for Chinese restaurants in the film's
nighttime street scenes.

`THE ADVENTURES OF SEBASTIAN COLE': GROWING PAINS OF A SUBURBAN
YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has endured the frustration and growing pains of a
suburban adolescence should identify with the angst and uncertainty
besetting the 17-year-old title character of Tod Williams' film
``The Adventures of Sebastian Cole.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1983 in Dutchess County, New York, the movie gets deeply
under the skin of Sebastian (Adrian Grenier), a bright, attractive,
energetic high school student reacting badly to the seismic jolts
when his family unexpectedly comes apart.
</P>
<P>
   The opening scene finds Sebastian squirming during one of those
excruciating family dinners at which various branches sprung from
divorce put on a painfully uncomfortable show of solidarity for the
sake of children on whom nothing is lost. Among those present are
Sebastian's biological father, Hartley (John Shea), a smug yuppie
architect, and his new trophy wife; Sebastian's sister, Jessica
(Marni Lustig), who is bound for Stanford; his high- strung mother,
Joan (Margaret Colin), and his shaggy-haired stepfather, Hank
(Clark Gregg).
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, it is obvious that Hank, who exhibits a
stern but loving attitude toward his stepson, is much more caring
toward Sebastian than Hartley ever was. Therefore it comes as an
awful shock, not long after the dinner, when Hank gathers his wife
and stepchildren together for a meeting at which he bluntly
announces that he has decided to go through the process of sexual
reassignment and become a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The family's initial shock is followed by fury. Although Hank
insists that he would like to stay married to Joan, she is
devastated. The family flies apart, with Joan returning to her
native England and Jessica fleeing to California with her
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian briefly joins his mother abroad, but is miserable, and
returns to upstate New York to live with Hank, who now calls
himself Henrietta and has begun wearing dresses, makeup and
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   At this critical turning point, ``The Adventures of Sebastian
Cole'' admirably steers away from becoming a transgendered update
of ``The Odd Couple.'' Instead of dwelling on the obvious social
and sexual tensions inherent in the living arrangement, the movie
becomes an richly detailed, episodic study of Sebastian's troubled
adolescence, with a performance by Grenier that beautifully
captures his character's precarious balance of naivete and bravado,
self-destructiveness and self-invention.
</P>
<P>
   Churning with an inchoate anger, Sebastian, who dreams of
becoming a writer, does poorly in high school and bungles his first
serious relationship with a girl (Aleksa Palladino). One evening he
nearly poisons himself to death in a show-off drinking binge.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to New York he narrowly escapes being beaten up by the
pimp of a teen-age prostitute he foolishly tries to rescue. He
rides a motorcycle down his high school hallways. In the funniest
scene, Sebastian, threatened with nongraduation for having cut
physical education, fools his teachers into giving him credit for
the missed classes by putting on a bogus but flashy karate
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   In in its handling of Hank's sexual change the movie is so
matter-of-fact that it seems evasive. The movie never delves into
Hank's psyche and only cursorily deals with the effects of his
decision on his stepson and the reaction of the community. One
scene, in which he punches out a man who calls him ``faggot,'' is
just not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Once Hank has become Henrietta, there is no visible change, from
hormone therapy or electrolysis, between the two except for the
character's donning of frumpy dresses, makeup and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg's Henrietta never looks or acts like anything less
masculine than a big hairy lug comically lumbering around in an
ill-fitting frock. And although Gregg's performance has plenty of
heart, his character seems too saintly to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Through all his changes, he remains an ideal, caring parent to
Sebastian, setting boundaries and offering just the right amounts
of tough love when the situation demands. That's why the movie, for
all its audacity and attention to rituals and moods of teen-age
life, finally feels incomplete.
</P>

`A LITTLE BIT OF SOUL': DEVILISH CHICKENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're going to make a movie about upper-class Australian
Satan worshipers, it is pretty daring not to reveal or even mention
Satanism until half an hour before the end. It is also pretty
self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers who happen onto ``A Little Bit of Soul'' without
advance research can be forgiven for thinking that the movie is a
comedy about a nerdy scientist who lives with chickens. That would
be Dr. Richard Shorkinghorn (David Wenham), seen reading ``A Brief
History of Time'' on the train and arriving for a country weekend
with a lot of luggage and two cages of live poultry. To his horror,
his nubile former assistant, Kate Haslett (Frances O'Connor), has
been invited on the same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Their hosts are Godfrey Usher, the federal treasurer, played by
Geoffrey Rush, who looks extremely uncomfortable trying to rise
above this film, and his wife, Grace Michael (Heather Mitchell).
Grace joins Kate in laughing hysterically at Richard but soon
throws herself into his arms. ``It's so long since I've been held
by a real man,'' she sighs. Meanwhile, the soundtrack is booming
with all-too-specific folksy American numbers like ``Open the Door,
Richard'' and ``Nobody Here but Us Chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   It's only after another weekend guest has died (killed herself,
say the hosts, explaining the blood-drenched bathroom) that Kate
and Richard _ and the audience _ learn about the hosts' demonic
hobby. ``Why the Devil, Grace?'' Kate asks gently. Kate shrugs and
says, ``Oh, it's a family thing.'' Then she explains her real
motivation: ``I'm going to be 39 next birthday.'' Seems the movie
is also about the search for eternal youth. Who knew? Richard and
Kate have both been doing research on ``the key to the body clock''
and are making lots of progress. So is Godfrey, who soon becomes
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Making a completely boring film about the Devil, the fountain of
youth and government figures making fools of themselves is quite an
accomplishment, especially from a filmmaker with promise. Peter
Duncan, the writer and director, made his feature film debut two
years ago with ``Children of the Revolution,'' an offbeat but
well-received comedy about Stalin's love child. Sometimes the risks
pay off; sometimes they don't.

   LOS LOBOS/``THIS TIME'' (Hollywood)
</P>
<P>
   Los Lobos' second album of new songs since 1992's acclaimed
``Kiko'' finds the band again collaborating with avant-garde
alchemists Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake. This time around,
though, Lobos return to less experimental, familiar ground with the
Colombian soundscape of ``Cumbia Raza,'' along with r&AMP;b-fueled
winners like the easygoing New Orleans groove of the War tribute,
``Oh, Yeah,'' a swampy ``Viking'' and the sweetly soulful title
track. With its enjoyable mix of blues, rock, soul and rootsy folk,
``This Time'' offers a multicultural musical road map for a new
era. 3 stars

   SOUNDTRACK/``SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER &AMP; UNCUT'' (Atlantic)
</P>
<P>
   The musical companion to the outrageous animated comedy deserves
to win an Oscar for best movie score of the year, even if we can't
spell out all the song titles in a family newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Arranged and partially penned by Academy Award-nominated
composer Marc Shaiman, the soundtrack features such memorably fully
realized show-tune parodies as ``Blame Canada,'' ``What Would Brian
Boitano Do?'' ``Eyes of a Child'' (performed by Michael McDonald)
and ``I Can Change,'' hilariously sung by a cartoon Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   To stretch out the disc's dozen film tracks, there are eight
less successful interpretations by an eclectic lineup, notably Kid
Rock, RuPaul and the Violent Femmes. 3 stars

<P>
   TIN HAT TRIO/``MEMORY IS AN ELEPHANT'' (Angel)
</P>
<P>
   The playfully inverted title here hints at the scrambled yet
sophisticated sensibility within. Suavely compressing Cajun,
klezmer, tango, bluegrass and bossa nova into soulfully cerebral
chamber jazz, this Bay Area trio sounds like what you might get if
David Grisman, Bill Frisell, Astor Piazzolla and Samuel Barber were
somehow to form a Left Bank busker group.
</P>
<P>
   Never lapsing into mere pastiche, Tin Hat Trio fuses the
structural incisiveness of classical with the sensual fluidity of
jazz, offset by probing, avant-garde atonalities. Rob Burger
establishes the almost-cinematic !ital!mis-en-scene with richly
melancholic overlays of accordion, piano and pump organ, while
Carla Kihlstedt's elegantly austere violin and viola playing
jostles dramatically with Mark Orton's earthy guitar, mandolin and
banjo rumblings. This is cosmopolitan ``roots'' music of a very
rare order. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Reed Johnson
</P>
<P>
   PACO DE LUCIA/``LUZIA'' (Blue Thumb)
</P>
<P>
   After collaborating with jazzers such as Chick Corea, John
McLaughlin and Al DiMeola, innovative flamenco guitar icon de Lucia
offers an engaging solo work that recalls ``Siroco,'' his serene
1989 tribute to traditional flamenco forms. The difference here are
the eight original pieces focusing on unusual harmonies and
tempered by an intimate backing of mandolin, bass and percussion.
As always, the spotlight is on de Lucia's dazzling fretwork, even
when taking the lead vocals on the title track and ``Camaron,''
dedicated to the late flamenco singer Camaron de la Isla. 3 1/2
stars
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ETTA JAMES/``HEART OF A WOMAN'' (Private Music)
</P>
<P>
   On her new album, James tackles a set of popular standards,
including songs by immortals like Duke Ellington, Sammy Cahn and
Irving Berlin. The disc kicks off with a swinging rendition of the
melancholy ``You Don't Know What Love Is,'' followed by the bluesy
``Good Morning Heartache.'' James' bossa nova spin on the classic
``My Old Flame'' works well, while the Stevie Wonder-inspired horns
on Berlin's ``Say It Isn't So'' is an instant highlight. Also worth
checking out is a reworked version of James' 1961 smash, ``At
Last,'' bolstered by a snazzy Hammond organ solo. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster
</P>
<P>
   BETH HART/``SCREAMIN' FOR MY SUPPER'' (143/Lava/Atlantic)
</P>
<P>
   After her surprisingly fully formed debut several years ago,
singer-songwriter Hart's jinxed sophomore effort veers up a
driveway called mediocrity. Problem is, the seething Hart has
apparently lost her identity and isn't sure whether she's Janis
Joplin or Sheryl Crow. On an album that could easily be filed under
metal-lite, she screeches her way through much of the proceedings,
stopping briefly to ape Crow on the painfully obvious ballad ``L.A.
Song.'' 1 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster
</P>
<P>
   FREEDY JOHNSTON/``BLUE DAYS, BLACK NIGHTS'' (Elektra)
</P>
<P>
   It was the idiosyncratic Johnston's 1994 major label debut,
``This Perfect World,'' that garnered a streak of critical praise
and a bona fide radio hit with ``Bad Reputation.'' On his latest
nicely unpolished T-Bone Burnett-produced disc, the Kansas-bred
singer-songwriter turns down the volume for a biting set of
delicately arranged songs cut almost entirely live in the studio.
Johnston's songs look into life's dark little corners and his usual
theme, as evidenced by such standouts as ``While I Wait for You''
and ``The Farthest Lights,'' is loneliness. Feeling bad has never
felt so good. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster
</P>
<P>
   G. LOVE &AMP; SPECIAL SAUCE/``PHILADELPHONIC'' (OKeh/550 Music)
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop bluesman Love's fourth platter finds the Philly native
running out of steam _ and ideas. Where his previous disc, ``Yeah,
It's That Easy,'' used four different lineups to lend the mostly
wonderful tracks a variety of sound and energy to spare,
``Philadelphonic'' unfortunately features the return of Love's
usual lo-fi backing crew. The slurred and lazy results, even with
the hip-hop-oriented use of loops and samples, is uninspired and
often self-indulgent. 2 stars

`THE SIXTH SENSE': A BOY WHO SEES THE DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   And this year's ``Touched by an Angel'' award for gaggingly
mawkish supernatural kitsch goes to Bruce Willis' newest film,
``The Sixth Sense.'' The star, who plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a
gifted child psychologist in Philadelphia, also earns the Robin
Williams-manque award for ineffable, twinkling, half-smiling
misty-eyed empathy with adorable tots.
</P>
<P>
   But since Willis has only one basic facial expression in all his
films, it isn't his icky smirk that telegraphs the doctor's
extra-special sensitivity. (Willis wears exactly the same smirk
when he's about to shoot someone in the face.)
</P>
<P>
   No, it is the movie's treacly soundtrack by James Newton Howard,
the Hollywood maestro du jour for smearing on goo whenever it's
time to clench back tears.
</P>
<P>
   In its first hour, ``The Sixth Sense,'' which was written and
directed by M. Night Shyamalan, half-heartedly poses as a horror
film about to erupt into gore. Its opening scene finds the doctor
and his wife, Anna (Olivia Williams), tipsily celebrating his award
from the city of Philadelphia for outstanding something-or-other.
</P>
<P>
   As the Crowes, flushed from imbibing a $100 bottle of wine, are
about to tumble into bed, they discover an intruder in their
bathroom. The uninvited guest turns out to be Vincent Gray (Donnie
Wahlberg), a former child patient of the doctor's, now grown up and
in full maniacal froth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You failed me!'' he screams and pulls out a gun and shoots the
doctor in the stomach before turning the weapon on himself.
</P>
<P>
   We jump ahead several months. The doctor has apparently
recovered from his wounds, but his spirit is broken. Still haunted
by his ``failure,'' he takes on a new patient, Cole Sear (Haley
Joel Osment), a waifish 9-year-old boy who lives with his divorced
mother, Lynn (Toni Collette), and whose severe psychological
problems are uncannily reminiscent of the young Vincent Gray's.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the doctor vows to himself, he won't fail his
patient. And after much game-playing and hanging out with Cole (the
doctor seems to have nothing better to do all day than follow Cole
around, smirking empathetically), the boy reveals his secret. He
claims he can see the dead.
</P>
<P>
   And every so often, the movie gives us creepy little glimpses of
the corpse-strewn world as it appears through Cole's tormented
vision. At first, the doctor doesn't believe the boy. But then,
well, let's not take the story any further lest its colossally
sentimental payoff be compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Because it unfolds like a garish hybrid of ``Simon Birch'' and
``What Dreams May Come,'' with some horror-movie touches thrown in
to keep us from nodding off, ``The Sixth Sense'' appears to have
been concocted at exactly the moment Hollywood was betting on
supernatural schmaltz.
</P>
<P>
   For Willis, the movie continues the unpromising track he took
with ``Mercury Rising,'' in which his character goes through hell
to save the life of an autistic child.
</P>
<P>
   For Shyamalan, ``The Sixth Sense'' is a slight improvement over
last year's ``Wide Awake.'' But that isn't saying much. That
insufferably coy drama of another wee Philadelphian searching for
proof of God's existence barely registered at the box office. The
Willis name should insure that ``The Sixth Sense'' stays around a
little bit longer.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN PIE,' starring Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Natasha
Lyonne, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Eugene
Levy. Directed by Paul Weitz (R, 100 minutes). The snickering
teen-age comedy about four boys, all seniors in the same Michigan
high school, who make a pact to lose their virginity by the end of
the school year, serves up a new gross-out joke every five minutes.
The movie obviously wants to outdo ``There's Something About Mary''
in raunchy guffaws, but it lacks the antic spirit of its
forerunner. More like an upper-middle-class ``Porky's,'' it parades
its dirty jokes as crassly as an old-time burlesque show (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `ARLINGTON ROAD,' starring Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Hope
Davis, Robert Gossett and Joan Cusack. Directed by Mark Pellington
(R, 117 minutes). In a smart, stylish thriller that recalls the
paranoid classics of the '70s, Bridges plays a history professor
who begins to suspect that his smiling suburban neighbors are not
what they seem. Tracking down clues to an anti-government terrorist
network, he also engages in a battle of wits with Robbins' cryptic
character, and these fine actors square off to gripping effect.
Swift and pulse-quickening, this thriller has more than its share
of surprising twists, including a whopper at the finale. All in
all, a welcome change of pace from the season's dopey blockbusters
(Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME,' starring Mike Myers,
Heather Graham and Elizabeth Hurley. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13,
95 minutes). There may come a time when even Austin Powers tires of
the words ``Oh, behave!'' But it isn't here yet. Although the
sequel with the fab title is several love beads short of its
predecessor and more than a few scenes play like outtakes, this is
still a crafty, intermittently hilarious comedy. Myers' neo-Sellers
multiple-personality act is fine even when the material is less so,
and this sequel makes the most of Dr. Evil, his most inspired
creation. A scatological Scotsman, the film's walking id and
bathroom joke, is more of an acquired taste. Costumes and pop
references are still a hoot, as is the adorably benighted Austin.
Ms. Graham makes terrific eye candy but doesn't share Ms. Hurley's
quick-witted air of being in on the joke (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AUTUMN TALE,' starring Beatrice Romand, Marie Riviere, Didier
Sandre, Alain Libolt and Alexia Portal. Directed by Eric Rohmer
(PG, 110 minutes; in French with English subtitles). The final
chapter of the director's ``Tales of the Four Seasons'' is as
sublimely warming an experience as the autumn sun that shines
benevolently on the Rhone Valley vineyard owned by the central
character, Magali (Ms. Romand). The movie follows the adventures of
this wiry and vital but lonely widowed mother of two after she
allows two friends to play matchmaker. The film's plot, like that
of other Rohmer movies, is mathematically schematic as the
characters indulge in exquisitely verbalized soul-searching. As
sensuously gratifying as it is civilized, with a wonderful central
performance by Ms. Romand, it reaches a happy ending that feels
entirely earned (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BIG DADDY,' starring Adam Sandler, Cole and Dylan Sprouse and
Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart and Leslie Mann. Directed by Dennis
Dugan (PG-13, 95 minutes). It's awfully early in the career of Adam
Sandler to find him sharing the screen with a scene-stealing
6-year-old (actually the Sprouse twins). Besides, the cute kid in
Sandler's movies is usually the star himself. But he's in a
position to do whatever he likes, even if it's a flimsy sentimental
comedy with more product plugs and fewer laughs than might have
been hoped for. Having greatly expanded his following with the
romantic comedy and '80s kitsch of ``The Wedding Singer,'' not to
mention the inspired rustic lunacy of ``The Waterboy,'' he falls
back on much less inventive material this time. And the barrage of
brand-name junk food is enough to make skin break out in the
audience (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT,' starring Heather Donahue, Michael
Williams and Joshua Leonard. Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez (R, 87 minutes). A horror film shot outdoors by its actors,
who play three scared filmmakers at work on a spooky documentary,
this is a fine example of how to make something out of nothing _
nothing but terrific imagination and a game plan so enterprising it
should elevate its creators to pin-up status at film schools
everywhere. With tentacles including a hit Web site, an elaborate
fake witch mythology, a book tie-in, a special on the Sci-Fi
Channel and much more, this clever little indie is at the center of
a new form of synergy and an inspired multimedia blitz (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `DEEP BLUE SEA,' starring Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, LL Cool
J, Jacqueline McKenzie, Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgard and
Samuel L. Jackson, Directed by Renny Harlin (R, 100 minutes).
Better not mess with Mother Nature. That's the familiar message of
this man-against-shark horror film in which the research team of a
floating ocean laboratory is stalked by three 8,000-pound
genetically ``improved'' mako sharks. Ms. Burrows is the chilly,
anything-for-science marine biologist behind the research, and Jane
the hunky shark-wrangler who tends these razor-toothed killing
machines. ``Titanic'' meets ``Jaws,'' without romance, history,
myth or credible characters, only nonstop action and half an ocean
full of crimson, blood-thickened water (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `DICK,' starring Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams. Directed
by Andrew Fleming (PG-13, 90 minutes). Now we know the identity of
Deep Throat, the confidential source who gave the journalists Bob
Woodward and Carl Bernstein the inside dish about Richard Nixon's
role in the Watergate scandal and helped bring down his presidency.
``Dick'' reveals the snitches to have been two giggly 15-year-old
girls, Betsy (Ms. Dunst) and Arlene (Ms. Williams), whom Nixon had
appointed his official dog walkers. In remembering the good old
days of plumbers and White House tape recordings, this extended,
wildly funny ``Saturday Night Live''-style sketch spares no one.
Dan Hedaya's shifty-eyed, hunch-shouldered Nixon caricature is the
hilarious embodiment of paranoid guilt (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `DROP DEAD GORGEOUS,' starring Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards
and Kirstie Alley. Directed by Michael Patrick Jann (PG-13, 97
minutes). In the guise of sending up beauty pageants, this
mean-spirited, clunky satire manages to load up on stereotypes,
sneer at Minnesota, stage a scene in which beauty contestants vomit
en masse and make its audience wince through what must be a record
number of miserably unfunny jokes. Ms. Dunst and Ms. Richards show
some stellar appeal despite the dreary circumstances. And Allison
Janney makes the most of a supporting role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `EYES WIDE SHUT,' starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Directed by Stanley Kubrick (R, 145 minutes). This last cryptic,
spellbinding addition to the Kubrick canon provides a stunning
epiphany for the summer of the dirty joke. It's a dead-serious film
about eros and mortality, one that flirts with the ridiculous but
sustains its fundamental eeriness and gravity throughout. Cruise,
as a doctor caught up in a nighttime sexual odyssey of strange,
dreamlike clarity, and Ms. Kidman, as the wife who sparks his
jealousy by speaking frankly of her own libido, give themselves
over body and soul to the filmmaker's meticulous and delicately
balanced scheme. Given the dark themes and explicit nudity found
here, the R rating (achieved by digital alterations to 65 seconds'
worth of film) is a joke (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER,' starring John Travolta, Madeleine
Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton and James Woods. Directed by
Simon West (R, 118 minutes). Murder on a military base was once
enough of a pretext for a detective thriller, but nowadays it takes
more. The prevailing sleaze quotient calls for kinks, and this
galling adaptation of a Nelson DeMille best seller is happy to
oblige. So the title character, a pretty young officer who the film
thinks has no place in the military, is the victim of a lurid
crime. Travolta and Ms. Stowe affably investigate whodunit, though
the unraveling of the crime is laughably arbitrary. The real point
of their ponderous investigation is that the victim asked for what
she got (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HAUNTING,' starring Liam Neeson, Lili Taylor, Catherine
Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jan De Bont (PG-13, 117
minutes). In a wildly overdone haunted house with a Gothic Nouveau
Riche look, walls warp, statues morph and things go bump in the
night. The special effects are piled on so relentlessly that after
a while the sight of the flying cow from De Bont's ``Twister ``
would not be amiss. Firmly committed to the idea that more is more,
this is a remake of a 1963 black-and-white film that left much more
to the imagination. But the cast is good; Neeson plays the doctor
who leads the other three principals to Hill House for a psychology
experiment that goes really, really wrong (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AN IDEAL HUSBAND,' starring Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver,
Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore and Jeremy Northam. Written and
directed by Oliver Parker (PG-13, 97 minutes). The best thing about
Parker's likable but diluted screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde's
1895 comedy of politics and Victorian morality is Everett's
portrayal of Wilde's elegantly epigrammatic alter ego Lord Arthur
Goring. In underplaying this seemingly incorrigible (but actually
wise, witty and caring) rake, Everett makes him all the more
charming. Northam and Ms. Blanchett are well cast as a politician
and his priggish wife, but Ms. Moore and Ms. Driver miss hitting
the right notes in a screenplay that streamlines Wilde into a
quasi-contemporary style, keeping some but not all of the
playwright's scintillating bons mots. The settings are so lavish
they're almost edible (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `INSPECTOR GADGET,' starring Matthew Broderick and Rupert
Everett. Directed by David Kellogg (PG, 85 minutes). The midmorning
midden of children's cartoons that yielded a vein of cinematic gold
with ``George of the Jungle'' has now been mined for this clinker.
Too bad, because this Disney comedy wastes good talent. Broderick
brings an endearing combination of intelligence, wit and naivete to
his portrayal of a security guard who is transformed into the human
gizmo, Inspector Gadget, after being blown up in an effort to
capture a megalomaniacal magnate (Everett). But even Broderick can
go only so far with the film's noisy, childish material. Watching
this movie is like watching a human Swiss Army knife for nearly an
hour and a half. It's a remarkable device, but do you really want
to spend a lot of time with a not-too-bright hardware store
Frankenstein creation that can light cigars with his thumb, shoot a
grappling hook to the top of a skyscraper and produce a helicopter
from his head? (Lawrence Van Gelder). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `LAKE PLACID,' starring Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver
Platt and Brendan Gleeson. Written by David E. Kelley and directed
by Steve Miner (R, 88 minutes). Despite the DOA nature of the genre
it tacitly sends up, this ``Jaws''-minded demon crocodile movie
finds a fair amount to work with in newly reptile-plagued Maine. A
good cast is given the challenge of keeping straight faces. (``Any
recent bear attacks?'' ``This was no bear. Bears don't attack
people underwater.'') And the horror effects can be divinely
cheesy, like the apparent underwater sprinkler hose whose churning
effect is described as ``scared perch.'' Trouble is, this story
also has to go through the motions of a totally familiar monster
plot. There's no way to make that seem anything but tired (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MY LIFE SO FAR,' starring Colin Firth, Rosemary Harris, Irene
Jacob, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Malcolm McDowell and Robert
Norman. Directed by Hugh Hudson (PG-13, 93 minutes). A steady
``Masterpiece Theater''-like glow warms ``My Life So Far,'' a boy's
reverie of growing up in the misty Scottish highlands of Argyll in
the late 1920s. Frisky little Fraser (Norman), who narrates the
story, recalls a year in the life of the mildly troubled Macintosh
clan. What strife there is mostly involves his father, Edward
(Firth), an eccentric fiery-eyed inventor, and his Uncle Morris
(McDowell), who brings home a beautiful French wife (Ms. Jacob)
with whom Edward falls in love. If the story is slight, it is
smoothly told and well acted (especially by Firth) and the
nostalgic atmosphere is beguiling (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE RED VIOLIN,' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Flemying,
Greta Scacchi and Don McKellar. Directed by Francois Girard (not
rated, 130 minutes). ``The Red Violin'' follows the colorful
300-plus-year journey of a priceless violin from its construction
in an Italian workshop in 1681 to a contemporary auction in
Montreal. As it makes its way from Vienna to England to China, the
instrument becomes the inspiration for some richly photographed
historical tableaux. If the movie's narrative energy is undermined
by a plodding screenplay and wooden acting, the music, composed by
John Corigliano and played by Joshua Bell and the London
Philharmonia Orchestra, is sublime (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `RUNAWAY BRIDE,' starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.
Directed by Garry Marshall (PG, 110 minutes). When the stars and
director first collaborated, on ``Pretty Woman,'' Ms. Roberts was
cast as an adorable Los Angeles streetwalker. Nine years later,
she's as far as she can get from Rodeo Drive, geographically and
otherwise. Playing the stern proprietor of a small-town Maryland
hardware store, she takes an awfully long while to slip from
scowling into flirtatious romantic-comedy mode. And when the sparks
start flying between her character and Gere's likably stubborn
newspaper columnist, they fly on cue. Funny minor characters and
one-liners offset the not-so-pretty story of a woman who habitually
jilts her men (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT,' with the voices of Trey
Parker, Matt Stone and Mary Kay Bergman. Directed by Parker (R, 88
minutes). The movie spinoff from the outrageous Comedy Central
cartoon series following the adventures of some potty-mouthed
third-grade boys in South Park, Colo., is extremely funny and
jubilantly obscene, with several sewers' worth of bathroom humor.
It is also a smart, pointed satire that demolishes the hypocrisy of
a conservative culture that allows almost unlimited violence and
gore in movies and on television but goes ballistic at the prospect
of children being exposed to dirty language and sexual
explicitness. When a group of tykes sneak into a Canadian movie
filled with obscenities and come home spewing smut, their parents
raise such a ruckus that the United States declares war on Canada.
Armageddon looms when the Devil, who has been having a troubled
affair with the recently deceased Saddam Hussein, decides to put in
an appearance. Contributing to the madness are 15 clever songs
spoofing everything from Rodgers and Hammerstein to ``Les
Miserables'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,' starring Liam
Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd. Directed by
George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of hype and breathless
expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a happy surprise:
It's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and
offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions
that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of
``Jurassic Park.'' While the human stars here are indeed reduced to
playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and
hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in
Lucas is given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier
and scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TARZAN,' with the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Rosie
O'Donnell and Nigel Hawthorne. Directed by Kevin Lima and Chris
Buck (G, 88 minutes). No need to wonder how this animated Tarzan
movie could improve on the 47 others that preceded it. Disney
animation turns the hero into a supple, long-haired hunk, lets the
apes talk to him and whooshes through lush jungle settings with
exultant agility. This ``Tarzan'' is sprightly and likable in ways
that are hard to resist, with lively vocal performances, excitingly
kinetic animation and Phil Collins singing tunefully in the
background. Parents will stay awake, and children will be charmed
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TRICK,' starring Christian Campbell and John Paul Pitoc.
Directed by Jim Fall (R, 90 minutes). This engaging, tenderhearted
boy-meets-boy story features two handsome, doe-eyed actors in the
story of a romantic one-night stand. As in the Doris Day-era sex
comedies that are recalled here, the story is filled with obstacles
to the affair, the most noxious of them Tori Spelling in the role
of an incorrigible nuisance. Fall gives a small-town coziness to
his film's Greenwich Village settings and makes this a quaintly
likable date movie for audiences of any persuasion (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TWIN FALLS IDAHO,' starring Michael and Mark Polish and Michele
Hicks. Directed by Michael Polish (R, 100 minutes). This eerily
effective film carries the real-life closeness of twin brothers
into the realm of haunting fantasy. The look-alike Polish siblings
play conjoined twins whose delicately balanced interdependence
yields a rare brand of tension. With a bleak, lonely look and a
strain of black humor (in their three-legged suit, the film's Falls
brothers impress everyone on Halloween), the film introduces a
wild, gorgeous young woman into their lives and watches what
happens when one twin starts to court her. The story is intensely
rendered, without gimmicks (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `WILD WILD WEST,' starring Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth
Branagh and Salma Hayek. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (PG-13, 107
minutes). Another big, lavish movie with no there there. This
post-Civil War James Bondish contraption-happy sci-fi film is hard
to categorize, a quality not to be confused with originality.
Directed by Sonnenfeld without the deadpan-alien sensibility that
worked for ``Men in Black,'' this stylistic grab bag is similarly
kinky but a lot more chaotic, however heroically Smith, as a newly
hunky and debonair action hero, tries to save the day. Good-looking
but dopey, with an emphasis on toylike but vaguely ghoulish special
effects. A movie with that much potential kiddie appeal didn't have
to start in a bordello, either (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   `TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT.' Preparing to begin an 18-month survey of
its 17,000-title collection in October as part of the museumwide
exhibition ``MOMA 2000,'' the Museum of Modern Art is running a
77-film series that amounts to a wish list of films the museum
hopes to add to its collection. The series consists of films
regarded as significant in the development of cinema as a modern
art, including documentaries, experimental work and narrative
fiction films ranging from musicals to melodramas. This weekend's
attractions include the Scottish-born director Bill Forsyth's
comedy ``Local Hero'' (1983), with Burt Lancaster and Peter
Riegert, at 2 p.m. Saturday, followed at 5 p.m. by Martin
Scorsese's ``Goodfellas'' (1990), based on Nick Pileggi's book
``Wiseguy,'' about the life of a Mafioso. Continuing through Sept.
14 at New York's Museum of Modern Art, the series is free with
museum admission: $10 for adults, $6.50 for students and people 65
or older; free for visitors under 16 accompanied by an adult. Pay
what you wish on Fridays from 4:30 to 8:15 p.m. Screening

STYLISH, SHALLOW REMAKE REMINDS AUDIENCE THERE WASN'T MUCH TO
STEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new version of ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' directed with
steely aplomb by John McTiernan (''Die Hard,'' ``The Hunt for Red
October'') provides the filmmaker with a chance to show off
dazzling men-at-work-on-high-tech-scenarios during a museum
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody stages no-nonsense setups better than McTiernan; he has a
feel for labor-and-machinery-intense prologue unmatched by any
working director. And his love for the retro genre known as the
caper film, a mainstay of the 1960s, gives the new ``Crown'' a
sheen like one found an antique owner's proudly polished vintage
car. He's smart enough to avoid the missteps made earlier this year
by ``Entrapment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the effort expended here provokes a question. Is there a
reason to remake 1968's ``The Thomas Crown Affair''? So many of the
elements that made the original work _ such as the young woman
(Faye Dunaway) working as a stylish and lethally amoral insurance
investigator, and the rough-hewn Method School bad-boy Steve
McQueen shedding his denim and leather to play a bored Boston
Brahmin who resorts to bank heists to keep himself interested in
life _ were a fresh air of counterculture back in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Crown,'' however, is swank and anonymous. The cast _
Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo and Denis Leary _ probably could have
been assembled for a Lifetime version of this picture about five
years ago. In the update, Brosnan's Crown is a self-made
billionaire who steals a Monet _ which he folds, that can't be good
for a masterpiece _ from a well-guarded museum, not because he's
bored, but because he has something to prove. (He reveals this to
Faye Dunaway, who has a cameo as a psychiatrist whose makeup job
makes her look like a museum piece.)
</P>
<P>
   The super-smart Russo takes on Crown to rouse herself from
routine investigations; she's been given the McQueen excuse for
motivation. This time around, hunter and hunted eye each other with
serious intent, and seriously manipulate each other, too. This is
unlike the original ``Crown'' in which the two protagonists toyed
with each other and took nothing seriously, a pair of indulgent
opportunists playing a game of chess. (Yes, they actually sat down
at a chessboard.)
</P>
<P>
   Much of this current ``Crown'' is built on Brosnan's turning his
image on its ear. (He produced the project.) He's doing some
Bond-trading, playing against type, against the perception of him
as effete, landed gentry. The protagonists being roughly the same
age this time _ in their mid-40s _ gives the remake an earthiness
that makes the proceedings slightly more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   That's ever so slightly: no man _ unless he were participating
in a Duran Duran reunion tour _ would sport sarongs on white sand
beaches as often as Brosnan. And Russo, who looks fabulous, is
given to laughing and throwing her head back a little too
desperately to show that she has a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, this remake of ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' with
the stars slipping out of their beautiful clothes _ and Russo has a
reason to be proud of her body _ is as much about appearances as
the original, which was a shallow classic. Only nowadays everything
is boastful about its insignificance, which makes the new ``Crown''
even more meaningless.

 &HT;    MUTATED GENE MAY PLAY ROLE IN NARCOLEPSY
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Narcolepsy, a strange disorder that plagues an
estimated 125,000 Americans with brief but uncontrollable episodes
of sleep, is apparently the work of a mutated gene _ at least when
it occurs in dogs and mice.
</P>
<P>
   In separate studies made public Thursday, scientists at Stanford
University's Center for Narcolepsy and the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center reported tracing narcolepsy to faulty
communications between brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   A genetic study of the Stanford center's population of
narcoleptic dogs shows the brain cells fail to make proper
connections because of a defect in the gene that carries the
genetic building plans for the ``hypocretin2 receptor.''
</P>
<P>
   The mutated receptor is like a lock with a flaw that keeps the
key that is made for it _ in this case, the hormone hypocretin2 _
from fitting properly, said Stanford narcolepsy researcher and
Emmanuel Mignot, who also treats patients with the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The proper binding of the hormone and the receptor appear to
promote wakefulness.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Mignot said in a telephone interview Thursday that
the condition in humans may not result from genetically induced
flaws in the receptors.
</P>
<P>
   Some research suggests that in humans narcolepsy is actually an
autoimmune disorder that could have disrupted the production of the
hormone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think trying to give people small amounts of the hormones
themselves is something that should be tried, whether I do that or
someone else,'' Dr. Mignot said. Officials of the National
Institutes of Health, which funded the research, hailed the
findings as a possible opening to eventual treatment of the
sometimes disabling condition.
</P>
<P>
   Besides falling abruptly into deep dream sleep, people and other
creatures with narcolepsy experience weird episodes of
``cataplexy,'' in which they remain conscious but become limp and
cannot move for several seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The results of a search by Mignot and his fellow researchers for
the gene responsible for what was already viewed as an inherited
condition were startling because hypocretin2 and its receptor were
thought to control only eating behavior. The hormone was discovered
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the data that we have on food needs to be reconsidered
in light of these findings,'' Dr. Mignot said, ``because what were
seen as food effects may be an indirect result of the sleep
effects. Obviously, you don't eat when you sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the journal Cell, Mignot and fellow researchers said
either of two different flaws in the gene for the hypocretin2
receptor can cause narcolepsy in dogs. One, in which a piece of the
protein is missing, causes the condition in Doberman pinschers and
another, in which the protein has an extra piece, causes it in
Labrador retrievers.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued jointly by the directors of the the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said the Stanford group's
discovery ``opens the door to identification of the narcolepsy gene
in humans and to development of new treatment approaches and
possibly a cure for this disabling sleep disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   In a second article, scheduled to appear in the same scientific
journal on Aug. 20, researchers at the Texas Southwestern Medical
Center in Dallas reported accidentally creating narcolepsy in mice
by removing the gene for hypocretin2 _ the key, rather than the
lock.
</P>
<P>
   Masashi Yanagisawa, professor of molecular genetics, said he and
other researchers at the Texas center were studying ways
hypocretin2 and hypocretin1, also known as orexin-A and orexin-B,
fit their respective receptors to stimulate food consumption.
</P>
<P>
   However, they soon found that mice that do not have the two
brain hormones were unexpectedly falling asleep in the middle of
high activity.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of brain wave patterns produced readings that matched
those of humans experiencing narcoleptic sleep, Yanagisawa said.

ARTISTIC METHOD GIVES EXHIBIT DIFFERENT DIMENSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Jackson Pollock first dribbled paint onto a
bare canvas, he unleashed the idea that art could be as much about
means as about ends.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock's methods dramatized how the artist's choice of
materials, and the way he or she manipulated them, could either
liberate or stifle the innate potential of an artwork. Even today,
Pollock's abstract expressionist masterpieces suggest a dynamic
interplay between randomness and precision, anarchic impulse and
painstaking process.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock's unusual procedures _ to say nothing of his prodigious
talents _ influenced a whole generation of young American artists
who came of age in the 1960s and '70s. While these artists later
splintered into many genres _ performance art, conceptual art,
earth art, feminist art _ they continued to share an interest in
artistic process for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler and more intellectualized than the abstract
expressionists, or even the pop artists, these art school-trained
20- and 30-somethings began making art the subject of which was the
making of art itself.
</P>
<P>
   Subjective feelings and personal obsessions were purged from
this new equation. This was art as a branch of mathematics, art as
science (or pseudo-science), art as a kind of visual architecture
that could be mapped out if you just followed the blueprint.
Drawings, when combined with other materials and carefully labeled
and explained to the viewer, were transformed into a new kind of
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   In some of these works, art became a virtual instruction manual,
a how-to list of steps that documented and deconstructed how the
work was made. So much for the Romantic ideal of art as an
inscrutable, semi-religious undertaking and the artist as a
mystical visionary.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown Los Angeles
investigates this period and the artists who contributed to it in
the exhibition ``Afterimage: Drawing Through Process.'' Consisting
of more than 160 works on paper by 24 American artists, the show
focuses on the years 1966 through 1974.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fascinating, if highly cerebral show, impossible to rush
through and perhaps best appreciated upon reflection several hours
later. But you'll have to hurry: ``Afterimage'' closes Aug. 22
before moving on to Houston, Seattle and other national venues.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by MOCA associate curator Cornelia H. Butler, the
exhibition moves forward by grouping together similar uses of
materials and overlapping artistic strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The first group of galleries are dominated by Richard Tuttle's
series of ``Wire Pieces'' from 1972-99. In these dramatic
compositions, pieces of wire pop loose from the outlines of wall
pencil drawings like busted guitar strings. It's as if they'd
broken free from the ghostly outlines of their former selves.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite wall, Joel Shapiro's series of finger prints
ironically combines the ultimate symbol of human individuality with
the same process of machinelike reproduction that Andy Warhol used
in his serial prints of Mao and Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Hesse's ink washes on cardboard challenge Renaissance ideas
about visual perception and the way the eye organizes and
subdivides space.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, several samples of Sol LeWitt's ``Folded
Drawings'' of the early 1970s derive their patterns not from actual
``drawings'' but from the lines of the paper folds.
</P>
<P>
   The title of one of these origami-like works has the same ring
of scientific objectivity as a Dutch still life: ``Folded Drawing
(From midpoint of the top side to a point halfway between the
midpoint of the bottom side and the lower right corner, March 23,
1975).'' Only LeWitt isn't representing life; he's documenting
intent.
</P>
<P>
   The middle galleries deal more directly with the idea that
artistic manipulation itself can be the true art object.
Particularly noteworthy are the avant-garde/feminist filmmaker
Yvonne Rainer's ``Dance Scores'' and other documentation of her
performance pieces from the early 1960s. There's a wry, vaguely
subversive humor in this annotated choreography, which demonstrates
how arabesques, plies and other dance movements can be mapped out
and diagrammed to form designs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pomona-born artist Marcia Hafif gives a similar concept
surprisingly visceral form in ``One Hour Twenty Minutes,'' in which
hundreds of tiny pencil marks represent the seconds ticking off
Hafif's life on Nov. 20, 1972. Despite its seemingly detached
measuring of a random block of time, the work inevitably inspires
thoughts of how we mete out our existence.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by the time you reach the final galleries, pent-up
emotion has begun to bleed back into the exhibition, or sneak in at
the margins. From a distance, Nancy Grossman's ``Tough Life Diary''
(1973) looks as densely threaded as a computer circuit board. On
closer inspection, it reveals doodlings and marginalia about the
artist's hectic routines, with squiggles and blotted-out writing
forming a swirling maze of highly personal symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   With Grossman's diary, the exhibition comes full circle: No
matter how much you try to control art, it seems, chaos always
breaks out in the end. Pollock, who plunged in and created, would
approve. &QL;

SLOW-MOVING PSYCHOLOGICAL DRAMA HAS SURPRISINGLY SATISFYING ENDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be the season of the witch, the ``Blair Witch'' that is,
but Hollywood still has a few spooky tricks up its sleeve. Take
``The Sixth Sense.'' On the surface, it's a bloated, plodding
psychological drama that doesn't get warmed up until it's almost
halfway over. But for the patient viewer, there are some genuine
chills, intense performances and one of the best
rug-yanked-from-under-you endings of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis is devoted child psychologist Malcolm Crowe, maybe
too devoted for his wife's (Olivia Williams') tastes. Haunted by
his failure to save a former patient from suicide, Willis becomes
obsessed with a quiet youngster named Cole (Haley Joel Osment, in a
grippingly convincing performance) who appears to have a similar
affliction.
</P>
<P>
   After an excruciatingly tedious getting-to-know-you period, we
finally learn that the boy has a ``gift'' for communicating with
the dead. The unhappy, restless souls he encounters daily are
hardly of the Casper variety, and Cole's spirit-inflicted scratches
and bruises cast aspersions on his fiercely devoted mother (Toni
Collette). As the boy struggles to discover what the dead want from
him, Willis learns how to resolve his own marital problems at home,
and together they uncover more secrets than either of them had
bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   Director M. Night Shyamalan (whose previous picture ``Wide
Awake'' didn't bode well for this project) shows a firm grasp of
mood. Once the spooky business finally gets rolling, the chills
come fast and furious, aided by Osment's compelling depiction of
terror. Osment, remembered as the young ``Forrest Gump,'' has the
precocious, haunting speaking style of a channeling medium, and he
alone brings home some of the movie's most powerful moments.
</P>
<P>
   Willis isn't bad either, proving that his more soft-spoken,
introspective moments do more for his credibility as an actor than
dodging gunfire or blowing up buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But the film is ultimately done in by its frighteningly sluggish
pacing. It's loaded with great ideas, but crams most of them after
the halfway mark where most viewers will have either dozed off or
sneaked into the house next door to catch the last half of
``Mystery Men.''
</P>
<P>
   And missing the ending would be tragic, because ``Sixth Sense''
has one of the most surprisingly satisfying payoffs this year. It's
the perfect antidote for those put off by ``Blair Witch's''
deliberate vaguery. A little patience pays off. I promise.

National Park in Arizona that environmentalists are hailing as a

investigation into the brokerage firm's role in the 1996 failure of
A.R. Baron, a small, New York brokerage firm that defrauded

   TV-STATION-OWNERSHIP (Undated) _ The FCC on Thursday voted to

ANTIQUES: ANCIENT ART FASHIONED OF FEATHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Try to imagine Ellsworth Kelly, Josef Albers and Mark Rothko
working 2,500 years ago in Peru. They would be using the same
lexicon of abstract art _ concentric circles, stripes, squares and
triangles _ but working entirely with exotic feathers instead of
paint.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine that their finest creations had been placed in
burial tombs, only to be discovered in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   You now understand the impact that ancient Peruvian feather art
has had on today's sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, an exhibition opens in Bonn that features some feather
work. The show, at KAH, the Art and Exhibition Hall of the Federal
Republic of Germany, is called ``Orinoco-Parima, Indian Societies
in Venezuela: The Cisneros Collection'' and runs through Feb. 27,
2000. It includes weapons, baskets, musical instruments, ceremonial
artifacts and feather art collected by Gustavo and Patricia
Cisneros of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Feather art was used in many ancient societies in South America,
but most of what has survived comes from pre-Columbian Peru.
Several spectacular antique feather wall hangings from Peru are on
view in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, most of them
donations by Nelson A. Rockefeller. The colors are dramatic, and
the workmanship is exquisite. One has a large checkerboard
composition of four rectangular color-field panels, two of
brilliant blue feathers and two of bright yellow.
</P>
<P>
   They are testimony to the truth of Jean Renoir's comment that
masterpieces are made by artisans, not artists.
</P>
<P>
   These anonymous, magical works were made long before 1532, when
Francisco Pizarro and the Spanish conquistadors began their
conquest of Peru.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, by 1550, the Spanish religious authorities were so
worried about the shamanistic powers of feather textiles that they
ordered them destroyed; luckily they were not always obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   Feather textiles from Peru, Chile and Bolivia can go back 2,500
years. Most examples show the feathers arranged in dense,
overlapping rows. They were stitched onto horizontal threads called
hileras, which were then affixed to a natural or dyed woven cloth
ground. They are found on tunics, shirts, loincloths, belts,
headdresses and saddlebags, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The cloth is either cotton or wool taken from South American
alpacas, llamas and vicunas.
</P>
<P>
   Why were these pieces made?
</P>
<P>
   James Reid, whose book ``Magic Feathers'' (Textile and Art
Publications, London) will be published in mid-2000, offered an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the great fashion style for the elite: the hereditary
nobility, the military, the priests and local governors and
chiefs,'' he said. ``You can see these pieces from 100 yards; my
theory is that feather work was a kind of propaganda for the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid said that feathered clothing was ``a way in which
authorities could disseminate messages.'' For a people who had no
written language, the textiles would be as readable as the
stained-glass windows in a Gothic cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feather textiles were also clearly a religious form of tribute
to the deities,'' Reid continued. ``They paid homage to the gods up
above, to the sun, the rain, storms and snow, to the gods of this
earth, and to the gods of the underworld.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancient Peruvians were buried with feather works, which ``were
found in underground burial sites, in caves, in pyramids and in
above- ground burial areas,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   He gave this explanation for why Peruvian feather textiles have
survived more often than those from other cultures: ``That they
have survived so often in pristine condition is the consequence of
an elaborate burial and storage tradition, and of the felicitous
climatic condition of the dry, desert Pacific coast. It's one of
the driest areas in the world. It is particularly conducive to the
preservation of cloth and feather objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Feathers can retain their brilliant color for thousands of
years, and indeed, feather works are remarkable for their vivid
hues. Those who know tropical birds can identify the plumage of the
scarlet macaw, the flamingo, the Paradise tanager, the multicolored
mealy parrot, the parakeet, the pink roseate spoonbill, the white
hawk, the great egret and the Muscovy duck, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Some feathers were imported into Peru; others came from pet
birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feathers came from a variety of coastal, highland and jungle
birds,'' Reid said. ``There was a trade in feathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Those of brilliant red, chartreuse green, chrome yellow and
iridescent blue were prized. Gail Martin, a New York dealer who
specializes in textiles, has a pectoral from the Nazca people of
Peru that depicts what she calls her ``Keith Haring man.''
</P>
<P>
   It is covered in black, white, orange, green and blue feathers
and was made between A.D. 200 and 600. The price is $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   Feather designs can be as striking as their colors. The
iconography includes many figurative motifs: stylized
representations of humans, animals real and mythological and
deities.
</P>
<P>
   Some look like pictographs or geometrized humans like Ms.
Martin's ``Keith Haring man.'' Some animals, like the cameloids and
the monkeys, are easily identifiable. Others, like two-headed
snakes, represent deities.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the nonfigurative motifs: the square, the circle,
the zigzag and the triangle. Reid said the triangle might represent
a pyramid, and the zigzag might stand for a mountain peak in the
soaring Andes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mountain peaks were revered both for being sacred places as
well as for being associated with the source of water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other pre-Columbian motifs include a curvilinear wave, a Grecian
fret and a cross, all prevalent long before contact with Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ancient people of Peru arrived, through a universal
subconscious, at an esthetic beauty,'' Reid said. ``These feather
pieces have an aura to them that other textiles do not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peruvians knew how to use abstraction for esthetic effect,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid added: ``The textile museums have missed the boat on
feather art because all they focus on is warp and weft. The modern
art museums shy away because they call it artisan craftwork. I want
to do a show displaying feather works next to paintings by Morris
Louis, Brice Marden and Kenneth Noland.''
</P>
<P>
   Three New York galleries that carry some feather art are Merrin,
at 724 Fifth Ave., at 56th Street; Throckmorton Fine Art, at 153 E.
61st St., and Gail Martin, 310 Riverside Drive, at 103rd Street
(open by appointment).
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from a few thousand dollars to occasionally more
than $100,000 for a single feather work.

D.L. HUGHLEY`S `GOING HOME': HE'S DOWNRIGHT LOVABLE. SURE. JUST RUN
FOR COVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is D.L. Hughley's bad luck that his HBO comedy special
Saturday night follows Chris Rock's by only four weeks. Rock's
``Bigger and Blacker'' was the kind of star triumph that 99.9
percent of all stand-up comedians can only dream about.
</P>
<P>
   Hughley's ``Going Home'' has to be compared with its recent
predecessor, if only because he and Rock deal with a lot of the
same comic subjects: violence in white schools, gun control, the
battle of the sexes, the state of the black family and the
differences between black and white culture and attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition is unfortunate. Hughley is now best known as a
sitcom star; in the ABC series ``The Hughleys,'' he plays a
successful businessman and family man trying to adjust to life in a
predominantly white suburb.
</P>
<P>
   But he has some original and funny things to say. Bothered that
Charlton Heston is now president of the National Rifle Association,
he shakes his head and observes that you know the world is in bad
shape ``when Moses is packing.''
</P>
<P>
   Confessing to a certain historical ignorance, he says, ``Maybe
they covered this in the 65 days I was absent from history class.''
As Thomas Jefferson, he admonishes the young man serving tea to him
and his 18th-century colleagues: ``Now, Silas, I've told you never
to call me Daddy in front of the Founding Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughley has some entertaining thoughts about corporal punishment
in the South; ``because I said so'' parenting; why a dog would
rather belong to a white person, and why Coretta Scott King has
never remarried. But the unnecessary presence of four-letter words
in virtually every joke reflects his background on ``Def Comedy
Jam'' all too clearly.
</P>
<P>
   His sex jokes indicate that he might want to talk to his
therapist a little more about the good girl-bad girl issue. And the
variations on punch lines that indicate that black people don't
think much of self-sacrifice, as in Secret Service careers, sitting
in the airplane's emergency row, helping out a child during an
alligator attack, are bothersome. But humor is about taking risks,
and he certainly does.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd in Charlotte, N.C., where the special was filmed, goes
wild for Hughley from the beginning. For the first 15 minutes or
so, this seems uncalled for, but he eventually hits his stride and
makes himself downright lovable by the end.

A `GIANT' STEP FOR WARNER BROS. ANIMATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' is an animated film of such charm that it's a
shame that it cops out on itself with an overdone gunbattle in the
final act. Not that the little boys it's aimed at will mind,
although their parents might raise an eyebrow or two over a cartoon
with a few instances of mild swearing (which is probably no worse
than what you'd hear in an average schoolyard).
</P>
<P>
   Based very loosely on poet Ted Hughes' 1968 children's book
``The Iron Man'' (renamed ``The Iron Giant'' in the United States),
``Giant'' is yet another variation on ``E.T.,'' but at least it's
one of the better variations. In this boy-meets-alien story, set in
1957, the boy is Hogarth (voice of Eli Marienthal), a precocious
lad with a tendency toward junk food and past-his-bedtime horror
movies. One night, while investigating a problem with his TV
reception, he runs into the Iron Giant, an alien robot with an
insatiable appetite for metal.
</P>
<P>
   You know what happens next. Boy and robot bond. Boy tries to
keep robot hidden from adults, especially attractive single mom
(Jennifer Aniston). Government loon (Christopher McDonald) begins
suspecting that something fishy is going on, and becomes film's
villain. Boy enlists aid of older, cooler friend (Harry Connick
Jr.), an artist who, conveniently enough, runs a scrap-metal yard _
or, as it's known to the Iron Giant, a buffet.
</P>
<P>
   None of the story is particularly original, and it varies so
widely from Hughes' book _ although the poet acted as a consultant
before his death last year _ that it's a wonder the filmmakers
actually call it an adaptation. But director Brad Bird, making his
feature debut here after his TV work with such shows as ``The
Simpsons'' and ``King of the Hill,'' makes up for a lot with his
obvious affection for the material.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's animation won't make anybody over at Disney lose any
sleep, but anyone who complains about the occasional static
qualities of the images in missing the point. The drawing has a
pleasant retro feel, as if Bird were trying to replicate what a
1957 animator would have done with modern-day tools; he focuses on
expressive faces while supplying more impressionistic backgrounds.
He also has a great feel for period flavor _ check out the scene in
which bored elementary-school pupils sit through a choppy ``duck
and cover'' nuclear-paranoia film.
</P>
<P>
   Bird and screenwriter Tim McCanlies (who wrote and directed
``Dancer, TX'') aren't above playing to the baser interests of
young kids, and they throw in a bit of benign (and quite funny)
toilet humor. But they seem in conflict with themselves; one of the
messages of the movie is that guns are bad _ a pretty radical
statement for Hollywood product, when you think about it _ but then
they deflate the message with the movie's over-the-top climax,
which involves a lot of cool-looking gun stuff. In these scenes
McDonald, a specialist in smarmy villainy, really overdoes it as
the wacky federal agent, but since he's saddled with an overwritten
character, he's not really to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is Warner Bros.' third major entry in the animation
war, after the likable but forgettable ``Quest for Camelot'' and
the what-were-they-thinking pickup of Rankin/Bass' ``The King and
I.'' ``Giant'' is an indication that there may be hope, after all,
for Warner Bros.; it looks unique, and it doesn't bow to
traditional animation formulas (i.e., there are no talking-animal
sidekicks). It's diverting, and it held the attention of the kids
at a fairly crowded screening. But it comes up short of being the
truly special film it could have been.

SHORT ITEMS ON THE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Renzo Piano Revisits Texas
</P>
<P>
   More than two years after the collector and developer Raymond D.
Nasher announced plans to establish a sculpture garden on two acres
next to the Dallas Museum of Art, he has chosen the Italian
architect Renzo Piano to design it.
</P>
<P>
   Piano, who won the Pritzker Prize in 1998, has designed several
museums, among them the Beyeler Foundation in Basel, Switzerland;
the Menil Collection in Houston, and, with the British architect
Richard Rogers, the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to a number of architects and felt that Renzo's ideas
were poetic and very exciting,'' Nasher said. ``He best understood
the nature of the project, that the garden needs to be flexible
since we are contemplating doing a different exhibition every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Piano said he had explored the relationship between art and
nature in several museum designs. ``I think of this more as an
open-air museum than a sculpture garden,'' he added. ``To my
knowledge there is no other truly urban sculpture garden of this
size in the world. I hope it will be a model for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Completion of the Nasher Sculpture Center is scheduled for 2001
and the preliminary design drawings and models will be developed by
the fall. So far, Piano's plans call for a large protected space
where small, more fragile sculptures can be shown. The plans would
also put the garden below street level to make it seem like an
archeological find.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great attractions to the space is that it is
sitting in the middle of the mess of the city, not paradise,''
Piano said. ``I've always been intrigued by the relationship
between the sacred _ the art _ and the profane _ the street. I like
that idea.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Getty as Muse &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While most of its permanent collection dates from before 1900,
the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles is beginning to organize
exhibitions that feature the work of contemporary artists.
</P>
<P>
   Its first large-scale group show, which will run from Feb. 29
through May 7, is ``Departures: 11 Artists at the Getty.'' It will
consist of commissioned pieces produced by 11 Los Angeles artists
in response to works in the Getty collection.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the artists are internationally known while others are
not familiar names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested in seeing a broad response to the Getty's
collection from people at different points in their careers,'' said
Lisa Lyons, the show's guest curator. ``I thought it would be
particularly interesting to see many unexpected connections these
artists make between their work and pieces from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The artists are John Baldessari, Uta Barth, Sharon Ellis, Judy
Fiskin, Martin Kersels, John M. Miller, Ruben Ortiz-Torres, Lari
Pittman, Stephen Prina, Alison Saar and Adrian Saxe. Using the
Getty's collection as inspiration, they will create new works in
media that include painting, sculpture, photography and film.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping the Getty organize a schedule of
contemporary art exhibitions, Ms. Lyons, formerly the director of
art programs at the Lannan Foundation in Los Angeles, has also been
involved in commissioning public art for areas on the Getty
Center's sprawling campus.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Edward Ruscha's ``Picture Without Words,'' which was
designed for the lobby of the Harold M. Williams Auditorium in the
center, and a multimedia installation made by Alexis Smith for the
Getty's restaurant, will soon be a 45-foot-tall sculpture by Martin
Puryear, which was commissioned for the museum's entry plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture, made of welded, sandblasted stainless-steel tubes
bound at the joints by strands of bronze, will rise from a
travertine pavement, its form suggesting a delicate fish net and a
human head. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cultural Exchange &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the latest exchange of art between museums, the Pitti Gallery
in Florence, Italy, will lend the Art Institute of Chicago two of
the greatest portraits of the Italian Renaissance _ one by Titian
and one by Raphael _ and the Art Institute will lend the Pitti
seven landscapes by Monet.
</P>
<P>
   Both loans are firsts of a sort. The Raphael will be shown
outside Europe for the first time. (The Titian has been exhibited
once before in the United States, in the ``Titian, Prince of
Painters'' exhibition in 1990 at the National Gallery in
Washington.) And the Pitti's show will be the first in Italy
devoted solely to Monet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to fill gaps in each other's collections,'' said
Larry J. Feinberg, a curator in the department of European painting
at the Art Institute. ``The Pitti owns no Monets and while we do
have some Italian Renaissance portraits, they are not as good.''
</P>
<P>
   The portraits coming to Chicago are among the Pitti's
masterpieces. The Raphael, ``The Veiled Lady'' (circa 1516), is
considered the artist's greatest portrait and was inspired partly
by Leonardo da Vinci's ``Mona Lisa.'' Titian's ``Young Englishman''
(circa 1540-45) dates to the artist's early maturity.
</P>
<P>
   The portraits will be hung with a small group of Renaissance
portraits from the Art Institute's collection. The show, which runs
from Dec. 15 through March 19, will trace how these masters changed
portraiture in 16th-century Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will also explore issues of gender, as well as the
Florentine School versus the Venetian School,'' Feinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The Art Institute's Monets are on view at the Pitti until Sept.
1.
</P>
<P>
   Portraits on Tour
</P>
<P>
   The National Museum of American Art isn't the only part of the
Smithsonian Institution that has established a traveling-exhibition
program while its home is being renovated. The National Portrait
Gallery, which shares the Old Patent Office Building on F Street
with the museum, must also close for about three years and will
also send several exhibitions drawn from its collection to museums
here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But an affiliated institution, the Renwick Gallery, on
Pennsylvania Avenue at 17th Street, will remain open and offer its
full program of crafts exhibitions.

 &HT;    SHOPTALK: SEPHORA
 &HT;    Wall-to-wall beauty, fragrance with French accent
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, August 8.
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  Name: Sephora, a huge cosmetics and beauty store. Opened June
18 in Lenox Square and July 23 in Gwinnett Place Mall. In 1993, the
first Sephora store debuted in Paris; today there are more than 100
of them in Europe and 28 in the United States, with 22 more set to
open by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The pitch: Think of it as a self-service shopping emporium for
cosmetics aficionados. ``It's total freedom,'' says Libby Carroll,
store director at the Lenox location. ``You can touch, feel and
smell. And you won't be sprayed with perfume when you enter the
store. Nor will a consultant (salesperson) ask you if you need any
help. You can sample products on your own, make selections, then
take them to a cashier _ without ever speaking to anyone. If,
however, you prefer to shop with a consultant, we also offer that
service.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The merchandise mix: As you enter a Sephora store, you are
blown away by the number of products, ranging from fragrances and
foundations to skin treatments and shampoos. Up front are Sephora's
private-label items, which include bath products (average price
$20) in yummy colors and fragrances; nail polishes (a 0.1-ounce
bottle for $3.50); potpourri ($8); professional tools such as
makeup brushes (a set is $15); and clear wax candles ($18-$22) done
especially for the store by Perfumes Isabell. What's lots of fun is
the massive lipstick bar, holding 365 tubes of lipstick ($9 each)
ranging from white to black and every color in between, including
green, yellow and blue along with the obvious shades.
</P>
<P>
   In the World of Color (blushes, eye shadows and liners,
foundations and lipsticks), the store offers some of the biggest
names in classic makeup: Christian Dior, Shu Uemura, Givenchy and
Shiseido. Cutting-edge lines include Anna Sui, Comfort Zone, Hard
Candy, Urban Decay, Tony &AMP; Tina, Club Monaco (an exclusive), Bloom
and Two Faced. One of the most popular is Stila, known for high
quality and low prices.
</P>
<P>
   At the back of the store, treatment products, including such
prestigious lines as Juvena, Decleor, Cellex C, Peter Thomas Roth
and Naturopathica, are showcased in the Library and arranged by
categories of need: dry skin, oily skin, sun, body, hair and face.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Making scents: Fragrances are organized alphabetically _ men's
on the left, women's on the right _ along the walls. And best
sellers are displayed in a special nook.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The decor: Contemporary tones of red, black and white
dominate. Consultants wear French-made black tunics and trousers.
Women wear only red lipstick and red or natural-color nail polish _
and no jewelry except a watch. Each consultant wears one black
glove so that he or she can show off a product in the best light,
as a jeweler uses a black velvet pad to display gems to a client.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Great gift idea: The store offers empty boxes so that you can
create a personalized gift filled with combinations of soaps,
bubble bath, room sprays, bath oils and potpourri. Complimentary
wraps include black or red paper and textured ribbons. Average
price is $30.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Thoughtful gestures: Baskets are available to hold goodies
while you shop. Also, you can freely test makeup throughout the
store. And candy is at the cashier stand, free for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Vital statistics: Open 10 a.m.-9 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays;
noon-6 p.m. Sundays. All major credit cards accepted. At Lenox
Square, 404-816-0123; at Gwinnett Place Mall, 678-473-4711.

 &HT;    Spooky storyteller scared even actors in `Blair Witch'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The script isn't the only thing spooky about ``The
Blair Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who has seen the film will remember near the beginning
the woman holding a toddler. She's interviewed by the on-screen
actors as they start to make their documentary of the harrowing
witch tale.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the woman says, she's heard of the Blair Witch.
Immediately she starts spouting off eerie details. And her toddler
protests, shouting out ``No!''
</P>
<P>
   Surely the woman is an actress just like almost everyone else in
the fictional ``Blair Witch,'' the box office phenomenon, which on
Friday expands to about 2,150 theaters nationwide. But she isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know who or where she is,'' says ``Blair
Witch'' producer Robin Cowie, formerly of Marietta. ``We've tried
for two years to find her, but to no avail.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the film's improvisational setup, ``Blair Witch's''
main actors _ Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams
_ were sent to Burkittsville, Md., and told to search for people to
talk about the made-up ``Blair Witch'' tale. Other actors had been
planted in the town to give the details needed to move the story
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found this woman in a restaurant,'' says ``Blair Witch''
co-director/writer Eduardo Sanchez. ``She made that stuff up. We
could not have scripted what she did any better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sent chills up my spine,'' says Donahue, who talked with
the woman while filming the scene. ``When I got that I knew I had
struck gold. That moment had to be the scariest moment in the movie
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, all that the film's creators know about the woman is the
name she gave Donahue in a release before the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked all around Burkittsville and no one knows her,''
Cowie says. ``Apparently she was visiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Could she be the Blair Witch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oooh,'' Cowie says.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few other little-known facts and news updates about
``The Blair Witch Project,'' which Artisan Entertainment, the
movie's distributor, estimates will ultimately top $100 million at
the box office:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Last weekend, moviegoers in Cobb County stoked the film's box
office more than any other area of metro Atlanta. The movie made
$65,349 at AMC's Barrett Commons 24 in Kennesaw, far outpacing the
take at other local movie cineplexes, according to Artisan. The box
office at some other theaters: $39,187 at AMC's Southlake Pavilion
24 in Morrow; $35,839 at United Artists' Tara Cinema in Atlanta;
$35,831 at AMC's Colonial 18 in Lawrenceville; $32,241 at AMC's
Mansell Crossing 14 in Alpharetta; and $30,032 at Regal's Hollywood
24 in DeKalb County.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Artisan and the ``Blair Witch'' creative team are expected to
meet on Monday to discuss sequel options. Steve Rothenberg,
Artisan's executive vice president of domestic sales, says his firm
``hopes'' to have a sequel in theaters for summer 2000. ``We'd sure
like to make it with the original team,'' Rothenberg says.
</P>
<P>
   Cowie, however, says the ``Blair Witch'' team's view is that
``you're not going to see it next summer _ not from us at least.''
He says his group will be concentrating on making a comedy called
``Heart of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Blair Witch'' team has developed ideas for what the group
is calling a ``sequel/prequel.'' Speculation is that it might
involve the original 1785 witch tale and/or the 1940s serial killer
case, both mentioned in the film.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Blair Witch's'' frightening final moments were actually shot
over three nights (the filmmakers had to return in part because the
light on Donahue's camera went out). The last of the filming
happened on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Throughout filming, the cast's food supply dwindled. Donahue
says that in the final days she ate nothing but bananas and power
bars. Williams took a different tact. ``I got so tired of power
bars I decided not to eat,'' he says. On screen you see him slowly
munching on a big tree leaf. Yes, he ate it. Williams says his
character ``was so gone he doesn't even realize what he's doing and
he doesn't care. He's kind of in la-la land at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The spooky rundown house exists in Seneca Creek State Park in
Maryland. ``We had to add support to some of the flooring, but
that's about it,'' Cowie says. The creepy kid-size handprints on
the walls were made by the three young nephews of the movie's art
director, Ricardo R. Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The movie was made in Maryland for one simple reason.
Co-director Sanchez was living there. ``I grew up in Maryland,'' he
says. And it's where he was driving a delivery truck and suffering
from depression after the failure of another full-length film
``Gabriel's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when the creators of ``Blair Witch'' decided to give
filmmaking one more try.

 &HT;    Pop vocalist Lalah Hathaway finally makes commercial waves in
jazz pairing with pianist Joe Sample
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having an R&AMP;B career on hold for five years hasn't
been a bad thing for Lalah Hathaway. Particularly since she thinks
R&AMP;B is pretty bad of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like this music has forsaken the whole art of A&AMP;R,
watching an artist develop, and having a story to tell with a
beginning, middle and end,'' says the 30-year-old daughter of one
of the genre's most revered talents, the late Donny Hathaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially for black girls who want to do something other than
shake (their) butts,'' she quips.
</P>
<P>
   And she should know. Even with a famous last name, Hathaway had
it hard when her self-titled debut came out in 1990. Around that
time, another young woman with an even more familiar name _ Jackson
_ was welcoming listeners into her multimillion-selling ``Rhythm
Nation.'' And, frankly, few seemed to have a problem with Janet
Jackson's ``hip-centered'' choreography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lalah Hathaway'' came from a completely different direction
than the heavily produced albums that peers such as Jackson, Jody
Watley and Paula Abdul were releasing. The focus was on vocal
quality, not being videogenic. Commercially, it flopped.
</P>
<P>
   Unbowed, Hathaway followed it in 1994 with ``A Moment,'' which
was also a sales disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   In jazz circles, however, many were taking notice of Hathaway's
silken, husky alto. Bassist-producer Marcus Miller asked her to
record and tour with him. Then she joined keyboardist-producer
Herbie Hancock on the road overseas. And, as early as 1992, pianist
Joe Sample asked her to accompany him stateside on a tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working so closely with Lalah has helped me to better
appreciate her ability to convey powerful emotions in subtle
ways,'' Sample says, ``which is not typical of so many of today's
pop singers.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet their first album together, Billboard's Top 5
contemporary jazz effort ``The Song Lives On,'' may finally be
elevating Hathaway to pop success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's found her niche,'' says Jay McLaughlin, morning
announcer on jazz station WCLK-FM (91.9). ``My listeners actually
listen, and obviously aren't driven by MTV and what have you. And
it's quite clear she's a talented young lady. I don't know a lot of
R&AMP;B singers that can just come over and start singing jazz. And be
received like she has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Hathaway's contemporary jazz work has kept her busy during the
half-decade she hasn't had her own album.
</P>
<P>
   Content is another matter altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't always want to be singing smooth jazz either,'' says
Hathaway, who is far more pleasant than her feelings for certain
kinds of music.
</P>
<P>
   `` A lot of my friends do smooth jazz, and I support them,'' she
continues on the phone from her Los Angeles home. ``But it's not
really my cup of tea.''
</P>
<P>
   So, believe it or not, despite what she thinks of it now,
Hathaway still wants a career in rhythm and blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's at my core,'' she says. ``I can't let the business
dissuade me. I want to record again.''
</P>
<P>
   But she's not going after a record contract the easy way; she's
recording a tribute album to her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's something I'm interested in,'' she says. ``I could
walk into a deal now and do that. But I really think that would be
the most anticlimactic thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm young and I have time to, need to, re-establish myself
with the audience,'' Hathaway says. ``Doing that would kind of be
like getting over. People say, `Well, Natalie Cole did it.' But
Natalie had been around and recording for like 18 years, been
through counseling, been through rehab, and been through a lot that
emotionally I'm not prepared to do either. I have a legacy, and I'm
not prepared to squander it away by doing the okie doke.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the shakey-shake, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sample,
</P>
<P>
   Lalah Hathaway
</P>
<P>
   8 tonight. $25 and $37.50. Atlanta Symphony Hall, Woodruff Arts

 &HT;    South's passion for racing gets artistic salute
 &HT;    By Tom Patterson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Since its advent in the years after World War
II, stock car racing has enjoyed a wide following in the South, and
North Carolina has been one of the hotbeds of this daredevil motor
sport.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of capitalizing on its mass appeal, the Green Hill
Center for North Carolina Art is presenting a show of contemporary
works inspired by stock car racing. Titled ``Just Racin': Art on
Wheels,'' it is curated by Roger Halligan, a sculptor from Randolph
County, N.C. Most of the works were created for this show, and few
of the 29 artists had demonstrated any particular interest in stock
car racing before they were invited to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The show's theme isn't likely to inspire work of great depth or
profundity, and, indeed, it hasn't. Several artists have
contributed relatively straightforward images of cars and races
that do nothing more than illustrate the most obvious aspects of
the sport, and the selection could have been improved by weeding
out such mediocre pieces. Nonetheless, a predominance of works that
are as brash, loud and garish as stock car racing itself _ and a
prevalent cartoon aesthetic that's entirely appropriate to the
theme _ make this a generally lively and often amusing exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The more effective pieces celebrate well-known stock car
drivers. The cleverest of several that pay lighthearted homage to
the South's most famous driver, Richard Petty, is Rob Kowski's
``Life Is Good.'' This plastic pink flamingo lawn ornament, an icon
of white-trash culture, has been transformed into a caricature of
Petty, wearing miniature versions of his trademark cowboy hat,
wraparound sunglasses and cowboy boots. To complete the portrayal,
its hooked beak has been painted with a cartoon rendition of
Petty's familiar grin. Wendell Scott (1921-1990), the first
African-American champion racer in NASCAR, is depicted by Roy
Nydorf. ``Homage to Wendell Scott'' juxtaposes a realistic portrait
of a fiercely heroic-looking Scott attired in a racing helmet with
background images of his No. 34 cars. With its flamboyantly
scripted caption texts, this painting recalls the bold style of old
movie posters.
</P>
<P>
   Scott is memorialized in more symbolic fashion in Mark Brown's
``Shrine for the Short Track (for Wendell).'' This mock trophy cup
and its wheel-mounted pedestal is covered in a multicolored
patchwork of nailed-on metal scraps salvaged from the exteriors of
several stock cars. In its formal and material aspects, it alludes
to Scott's cultural heritage by referencing traditions of African
ritual sculpture and black folk recycling.
</P>
<P>
   In an exhibit that emphasizes cars more than it does drivers,
the most imaginative depictions of stock cars are sculptures by
Luis Jimenez and Robbie Barber, which highlight the implications of
sex and violence within the stock car subculture. Jimenez, a New
Mexico sculptor who is the show's most widely known artist, is
represented by ``Demo Derby,'' a fiberglass model car whose
parenthetical subtitle, ``(Pure Sex),'' underlines the association
between fast cars and sex that is an essential component of
American capitalist mythology. This curvaceous caricature of a
stock car has a red-accented metal-flake blue exterior emblazoned
with numbers and slogans in a lurid shade of Day-Glo orange, and
it's equipped with electronically illuminated head and tail lights.
</P>
<P>
   Barber's realistically detailed painted-wood replica of a Ford
Fairlane emblazoned with a large No. 11 and a series of decals
bearing the logos of well-known auto racing sponsors is titled
``Good Ole Boys,'' in honor of the kind of men who form the core of
the car-racing audience in the South. Under its hood is a
velvet-lined case that holds a snub-nosed .38-caliber revolver and
six bullets, and its open trunk reveals a pint bottle of Southern
Comfort whiskey. The gun is an emblem of the Southern obsession
with firearms, and the trunk full of liquor is an allusion to the
illicit transportation of bootleg whiskey _ a job at which more
than one Southern stock car racer learned the art of high-speed
driving.
</P>
<P>
   Other noteworthy pieces include Dan Millspaugh's monumental
cast-aluminum effigy of a robotlike ``Gas Man''; Ginger Spangler's
text-augmented collages about the rural origins of Southern stock
car racing; John Rosenthal's trackside photograph of a huge balloon
in the shape of a cigarette pack; Stacy Lambert's clever ceramic
treatments of stock car drivers, pit crew members and racing
sponsors; and Mark Kingsley's small paintings of cars racing up and
down a mountain that resembles the biblical Tower of Babel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just Racin':
</P>
<P>
   Art on Wheels''
</P>
<P>
   Through Aug. 27. 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesdays-Saturdays; 10 a.m.-7
p.m. Wednesdays; 2-5 p.m. Sundays. Green Hill Center for North
Carolina Art, Greensboro Cultural Center, 200 N. Davie St.,
Greensboro, N.C. 336-333-7460.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A lively show.

   Got sunscreen?
</P>
<P>
   Men, women and children all need some form of protection from
the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, and summer is the time of
highest risk. But people often forget or neglect to apply
protective creams and lotions to the skin laid bare by short-sleeve
shirts, swimsuits, short pants and the like. For them, there's an
innovative solution: sun-blocking apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Florida-based Solarveil America has introduced a wide-ranging
collection of beach wear, sportswear and hats in a revolutionary
fabric rendered in 10 colors. Its patented Solarveil fabric is a
breathable, open-weave knit that blocks up to 80 percent of UVA and
UVB rays; a double layer blocks up to 95 percent of the rays. The
collection includes golf caps, sarongs, polo shirts and drawstring
pants. They range in price from $25 to $85 and come in men's,
women's and children's sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The collection is available by calling 1-800-400-3377 or by
visiting www.solarveil.com. A list of retail locations is posted on
the Web site.

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chief Justice William Rehnquist sits atop one of
our three equal branches of government. He is a powerful figure who
exercises immeasurable influence over all our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when he appeared in the Senate chamber to preside over the
impeachment trial of President Clinton, it was the first time that
most Americans had ever seen him in motion or heard him speak.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist was a novice to television. We live in an age
dominated by visual images _ but not at the Supreme Court and the
lower federal court system.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist and several other Supreme Court justices adamantly
oppose allowing television cameras to record the court's public
proceedings; not a single justice actively favors allowing cameras
in the curt. The result: The justices, unlike officials of the
other two branches, operate virtually in secret.
</P>
<P>
   The justices do not want their personal comments spread about
and they do not want to assist journalists trying to report on the
brief public hearings they conduct before making major decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David Souter, considered a centrist on most other
issues, has plenty of company when he vows that there will be no
cameras as long as he is on the bench. He told me he believes that
television has a distorting influence on a courtroom, artificially
affecting the way judges, witnesses and lawyers behave and
distracting everyone from the legal issues involved.
</P>
<P>
   The single concession from the high bench was a ruling in 1981
that, as a matter of principle, cameras in the courtroom are now so
unobtrusive they do not disrupt sober legal thought and are
therefore not unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Only two federal appellate circuits permit television coverage
of civil appeals cases and only 14 of 89 federal districts courts
permit judges to allow TV or radio coverage. None of the federal
courts permit television in criminal proceedings at either the
trial or appellate level.
</P>
<P>
   State courts have been far more receptive to expanding access to
public trials; 47 states allow some form of audio-visual coverage
of court proceedings, at the judge's discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans are not aware of the television blackout by the
federal courts because they have followed saturation TV coverage of
notorious cases that occurred in state courts. The O.J. Simpson
murder trial and the William Kennedy Smith rape trial, for
instance, became such media carnivals for posturing celebrities
that justice seemed like an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   The Simpson case was particularly outrageous. But television was
not at the root of it. The event itself was the problem. In our
entertainment-driven, race-influenced culture, that trial was
destined to spin out of control whether cameras were inside the
courtroom or poised for self-serving interviews outside it.
</P>
<P>
   If we weren't fascinated, of course, we didn't have to watch.
But we did watch, by the millions. Television is a fact of modern
life and federal judges cannot defy the public interest forever.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee gave the issue a push recently by
passing a measure that would allow federal judges to permit
television cameras in their courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would merely authorize the right to include cameras,
not require them. A similar measure is pending in the Senate and
both appear to have a good chance of passage.
</P>
<P>
   The issue here is how much it weakens our democratic system to
pretend we are still a rural, slow-paced nation in which locals
wander down to the courthouse to catch up on the legal news. These
days we mostly get our information from television and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Through modern technology millions of people instantly have
access to gobs of information about what is going on in the world.
Sometimes it overwhelms us with too much of a good thing. But if we
are to understand how our judicial system works, that is how we
will learn about it in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   And this is a good thing. Cameras can provide the whole story of
a trial, not just an edited version filtered through a reporter's
eyes or the pen of a court artist. The machine is a more objective
observer than the human.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments with cameras in a few federal courthouses between
1991 and 1993 were generally viewed as successful by the judges.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that if you believe in open government,
judicial credibility and mass public participation, the federal
courts cannot be excluded from modern means of communication.
Justice will not be respected if it takes place in an antiquated
context.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the judicial reform measure has bipartisan support.
It is sponsored in the House by Reps. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, and
William Delahunt, D-Mass., and in the Senate by Sens. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot noted that ``open trials will help ensure the fair
administration of justice.'' He added pointedly that because
federal judges are political appointees who serve for life, their
roles should be constantly observed, discussed and evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine. If President Clinton had been indicted and tried
for perjury or obstruction of justice rather than impeached by
Congress, he would have been in the dock in a federal courtroom
that could accommodate only a select few to observe whether he got
a fair trial or not. The lack of internal cameras would have
exacerbated the inevitable media circus outside and raised
suspicions that all was not right within.

   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ When summer comes and the golden yarrow is
blooming, this impossibly tidy New England town revels in its
nickname, ``The Village Beautiful,'' and in the usual tension of
dramas that divide twins, trap lost souls, rile shrews and inspire
neutrons to burst into song.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict Arnold and Henry David Thoreau may have retreated for a
respite to this village in the Berkshires of northern
Massachusetts, but the theater tourists drawn here are seeking
something more dynamic at the annual Williamstown Theater Festival.
For three months each summer, festival organizers mount an
ambitious schedule of new plays and classics that tap the talent of
Broadway and Hollywood. (The actor Ethan Hawke recently played the
doomed boxer in Tennessee Williams' ``Camino Real'' and Gwyneth
Paltrow is performing in Shakespeare's ``As You Like It'' this
month.) This year, from June to Aug. 29, 11 plays are being
performed.
</P>
<P>
   The tranquil setting does not influence the selection, said
Michael Ritchie, the producer of the festival, but it does help
lure actors, many of whom live during performances at the
dormitories of Williams College, a small, 206-year-old liberal arts
institution at the foot of Mount Greylock, the highest peak in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier time, the benefits of a retreat to the area duly
impressed Thoreau, who remarked that ``it would be no small
advantage if every small college were thus located at the base of a
mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``some will remember, no doubt, not only that they
went to college, but that they went to the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   The same advantage holds for the festival, said Ritchie, who
noted that the New England setting was ``a great hook in terms of
making an appeal to actors. It's an idyllic town of brick walls
surrounded by these beautiful mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   For the uncelebrated tourist without a script for a long
weekend, Williamstown is not only a draw for its theater but also a
convenient staging area for a leisurely drive along the 63 miles of
the Mohawk Trail, the only motor road of the pre-World War I era
still in use in the United States. Opened in 1914, the Mohawk Trail
(Route 2) is a two-lane road that follows the old footpath of trade
through northern Massachusetts. It was once used by five nations of
American Indians, including the Mohawk of New York and the Pocumtuc
of the Connecticut River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Roaming with a 2-year-old, the road beckoned for its hypnotic
effect on my passenger on a day when I didn't have a ticket to a
matinee. The air was cool and scented with wildflowers. The
sweeping view from Western Summit, or Spirit Mountain, as it was
known by Indians, takes in Mount Prospect, Mount Williams and Mount
Greylock, where Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne once met,
and the site this October for a ``ramble hike'' for an expected
crowd of 3,000 hikers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohawk Trail's twists, dips and landmark hairpin turn
conjured up the epigraph for the script for the dreamy ``Camino
Real,'' which I had seen a day earlier: ``In the middle of the
journey of our life I came to myself in a dark wood where the
straight way was lost.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a road that can lead a traveler to quirky landmarks, odd
adventures or serious institutions. For example, the newly
renovated 19th-century brick mill complex that houses the
Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams. This
community bills itself the city of spires for its abundance of
churches; in autumn, it is host to one of New England's oldest
celebrations, the foliage parade. In Williamstown itself, the
Sterling &AMP; Francine Clark Art Institute draws busloads of tourists
for its expansive collection of Impressionist art, including more
than 30 Renoirs, and a current exhibition devoted to the work of
the 19th-century artist Jean-Francois Millet.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mohawk Trail is also a path to the unexpected, a place
where the local guidebooks suggest short detours off the trail for
llama treks to sunset picnics or touring a climate-controlled
shiitake mushroom farm or glacial potholes. In a deserted clearing
looms the ``Hail to the Sunrise'' monument of a lone Indian in a
loincloth with outstretched arms. A short detour south leads to an
arched trolley bridge built in 1908 and now transformed into a
vivid garden of carefully labeled day lilies, primroses and
petunias.
</P>
<P>
   The Shelburne Falls ``Bridge of Flowers'' is described as
internationally famous in local guidebooks, but I was unfamiliar
with this 400-foot bridge, spanning the Deerfield River. It is
blooming with some 500 varieties that are tended by volunteers from
the Shelburne Falls Women's Club, which created the garden in 1929.
On Aug. 14, the village of Victorian homes and shops will be host
to the Bridge of Flowers Classic Road Race with a 10-kilometer and
two-mile run.
</P>
<P>
   Shelburne Falls is also home to a trolley museum that displays
the last surviving trolley car from the Shelburne-Colrain trolley
line, which used to rattle along the Bridge of Flowers. For years
the No. 10 sat idle after roads were improved and trucking drove
out the trolley business that hauled freight from the rail yard in
Shelburne Falls to mills in Colrain, Mass. In retirement the
trolley car doubled as a chicken coop in a farmer's field, but now
it is restored, and the museum and its volunteers are preparing to
operate it for passenger runs perhaps by October, when autumn-leaf
tourists head for the Berkshires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping it's going to run, but we're not promising it,''
said the museum's president, Tony Jewell.
</P>
<P>
   From the Bridge of Flowers, a two-lane road leads to little
galleries and a glass-blowing shop and candle-making factory, Mole
Hollow Candles, with a wide window on the workers dipping rows of
hundreds of sleek white tapers. Candles with imperfections are sold
at a discount footsteps away in a seconds store.
</P>
<P>
   And just beyond the candle factory is a lookout spot for viewing
glacial potholes, a tumble of ancient granite rocks smoothed and
scupltured by whirlpools just below Salmon Falls, which was a run
for salmon on their way to spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Our trip along the Mohawk Trail was limited by a deadline to
return to Williamstown for the theater, but I made mental notes of
little detours that I planned to make in the future. One would be
to the apple orchards just north of the trail off Route 112 in
Colrain, where the West County Winery offers tastings of its hard
cider wines. Nearby is one of four covered bridges in the area, the
1886 Arthur Smith Bridge across the North River.
</P>
<P>
   I was curious about watching the salmon on a spawning journey
upstream between May and mid-June at a fish ladder along Turners
Falls, where there is a grotto that is a Roman Catholic shrine to
the Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha, the Lily of the Mohawks.
</P>
<P>
   The return to Williamstown was placid. The road was marked with
bear-crossing signs, but none of the animals shared the trail with
us. We were somewhat disappointed that the restaurant at the fabled
hairpin turn was closed for renovations, but Thoreau was right
about the comforting qualities of Williamstown, which at twilight
was a peaceful place for a walk along the village's own little
bridge blooming with flowers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The main road in Williamstown leads toward the Williams campus,
the dominant white clock tower of the First Congregational Church
and a bustling little road of commerce, where a few students
gathered around a bakery.
</P>
<P>
   On Spring Street we found Robin's Restaurant and Catering, a
place where the chef and owner comes out of the kitchen to inquire
whether diners liked the lobster ravioli, and brochures are offered
testifying that the meals are made with Massachusetts produce.
</P>
<P>
   We also took a 20-minute tour across the Massachusetts border to
stay at the Sedgewick Inn, an airy old tavern stop with a
wraparound porch off Route 22 in Berlin, N.Y., a more isolated and
rural area with hay drying in the fields. Visitors seeking dinner
in its candlelit restaurant were turned away, but the inn makes
room for its overnight guests. Children are not allowed to stay
overnight in the historic portion of the inn but are welcome in a
small motel behind its carriage house. However, the nicer rooms,
furnished with antique beds and thick quilts, are in the main
house.
</P>
<P>
   But I preferred lodging closer to Williamstown, where we were
within milling distance of the summer theater crowd, which,
Ritchie, the festival producer, said tended to be made up of three
types of visitors _ local ones, those from around Albany and a
large contingent from New York City. Most of the actors and
playwrights are also from New York.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few years, the festival has made alliances with
the local museums so that the theater experience extends beyond the
stage to the Clark Art Institute, where on Monday afternoons
seminars take place that bring together festival directors and
designers to discuss topics like the creation of ``Camino Real.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in nearby North
Adams has also formed an association with the theater festival.
This month it is staging an animation exhibition, and in July it
was the site of ``Quark Victory,'' the festival's production of a
science-fiction musical comedy featuring singing electrons and
neutrons.
</P>
<P>
   The festival draws on a New York talent pool, but Ritchie
insisted that Williamstown plays its own quiet role in the
performances. ``The people that come here are inspired,'' he said.
``They're away from the normal pressures and they're surrounded by
these wonderful mountains. That's got to have an effect.''

   MACY GRAY; ``On How Life Is'' (Epic).
</P>
<P>
   Macy Gray has a degree of talent, originality and vision wrapped
in a familiar package. The problem with having this, as anyone from
well-knowns like Bruce Springsteen to unknowns like Mary Cutrofello
can tell you, is that the music business is so hungry for this type
of performer that it's hard to live up to the fanfare and
expectations on a first album.
</P>
<P>
   So if ``On How Life Is'' doesn't meet its impossible criteria as
the introduction of a seminal new voice that rhythm-and-blues fans
will be listening to for decades, it at the very least is a musical
success in its time, 1999, as something new delivered in a classic
mold.
</P>
<P>
   With the rasp of Rod Stewart when he had a glimmer of soul, Ms.
Gray reaches to grasp the intangible beauty of love, rainbows, and
self-awareness; though she knows her goal is unattainable, she
keeps on reaching, and therein lies the instantly likable depth of
these 10 songs. (The limited number of songs is in itself a
self-conscious throwback to the LP era.)
</P>
<P>
   Her singing is hard to forget, her music evokes Sly and the
Family Stone with turntables and samplers and her album is just
what rhythm-and-blues needs: another authentic, unfiltered,
immediate voice.

 Race Relations Taught on Tape  
 New Releases of Video Cassettes: Reviews by New York Times
Critics  
 Past Releases 
 (yn) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RACE RELATIONS TAUGHT ON TAPE: Applied to race relations, video
can be as good a teacher as it is an entertainer and, given the
average treatment of race in feature films or on television,
probably a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Video is a way to provide empathy and understanding at a
distance because it's not in your face in a setting that can cause
high tension,'' said Timothy Gunn, executive director of National
Video Resources, a nonprofit organization in New York that supports
varied uses of independently produced films and videos.
</P>
<P>
   The group's current project promotes documentaries about race
made by those with firsthand experience. ``The tellers, unlike
those on network television, are often persons of color who have
lived the situation,'' Gunn said.
</P>
<P>
   With the idea that such films would be of value to organizations
and individuals working with race problems, National Video
Resources has put together a multifaceted publication called
``Viewing Race: A Videography and Resource Guide.'' In the
introduction, people with direct experience at using video to
explore race explain how to set up community programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who do not usually discuss this subject find it less
difficult to come together to talk to and learn from each other as
a part of a workshop,'' write Lauren Kucera and Milton Reynolds,
contributors to the guide.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 titles are included, and it is a diverse selection.
Jennifer Fox's ``An American Love Story,'' for example, is about
the ups and downs in the 30-year marriage of a black man and a
white woman. Stephen C. Ning's ``Freckled Rice'' is the story of a
Chinese-American boy in Boston and Jay Rosenstein's ``In Whose
Honor? American Indian Mascots in Sports'' focuses on a Spokane
Indian named Charlene Teeters, who battles the University of
Illinois over its stereotypical Chief Illiniwek.
</P>
<P>
   Headings in the titles index are similarly diverse:
African-American Identity (and Asian-American Identity and
Arab-American Identity and Biracial and Multiracial Identity);
Immigration; Indigenous Peoples; Chinese Americans (and Korean and
Laotian and Mexican Americans); Labor and Race, Political
Correctness (for example, Michael Pack's ``Campus Culture Wars,
Five Stories About P.C.''), and War and Race.
</P>
<P>
   Gunn said the guide was aimed at community groups, libraries and
colleges and universities. Since few of these videos are in
mainstream distribution, prices sometimes run to several hundred
dollars, but discounts are offered to nonprofit organizations. For
example, the price of ``In Whose Honor?'' drops from $195 for an
individual to $99 for a nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   A free copy of ``Viewing Race'' can be obtained by faxing

   Expected to produce a money-maker for the strapped Rose Theater,
the young Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is stymied by writer's
block, which in turn has shut him down sexually. But just when his
latest project, ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' is about
to disintegrate altogether, along comes the high-born Viola de
Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) to inspire the project and bring Will's
libido to a boil. An aspiring actor, which was forbidden for a
woman of the day, Viola poses as Romeo in a film that, Janet Maslin
wrote in The New York Times, ``soars freely into the realm of
invention, wittily weaving Shakespearean language and emotion into
an intoxicatingly glamorous romance.'' &QL;

23-year-olds, not to mention his editor's wife (at least she's

case of Frank Beachum, a black man sentenced to death for killing a
pregnant white college student. Believing the man innocent, Everett
battles the case right through to the moment of execution in a film
directed ``with righteous indignation and increasingly strong

   Woody Allen's film wonders whether getting Knicks season tickets
and hot restaurant reservations are the supreme achievements of a
``culture that took a wrong turn somewhere.'' As Lee Simon, a
depressingly callow and thoroughly ordinary magazine ``journalist''
panting along the celebrity trail, Kenneth Branagh is in the
accustomed Allen role of the womanizing loser kvetching about his
career and chasing what he can't have and eventually wouldn't be
satisfied with anyway. In the end, though, Allen, not Branagh, ``is
the only man who can save these tics from whiny obsequiousness''
(Maslin).

   In a crowded hotel lobby, Beth Cappadora (Michelle Pfeiffer)
takes her eyes off her 3-year-old son, Ben, for a couple of minutes
and he's gone, presumably never to be seen again. But after living
for years obsessed with the loss, to the detriment of her
relationships with her husband (Treat Williams) and other children,
Beth answers the door one day and there stands Ben. At this point,
Ulu Grosbard's film, based on Jacquelyn Mitchard's book, shows an
interesting ``awareness of how wrenchingly, in any family, real and
idealized relationships can diverge'' (Maslin).

   RUNNIN' WILD: THE FILMS OF CLARA BOW. Hollywood's ``It'' girl of
the roaring '20s stars in three films, and gets her own
documentary, narrated by Courtney Love. In ``The Plastic Age''

 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The biggest threat to the Chinese Communist government is a
group of mostly elderly Chinese citizens who used to gather in
parks in the morning to practice traditional ``aigong'' exercises,
moving their hands around an imaginary wheel to music and Buddhist
meditation called Falun Gong (The Law of the Wheel Breathing
Exercises).
 &HT;    The number of Falun Gong practitioners is somewhere between the
government's estimate of 2 million and the group's own figure of
100 million. The group has no apparent organization or buildings,
charges no fees, and had no political agenda, except to defend its
own right to cultivate Xinxing (mind nature and moral level) in
public.
 &HT;    And there's the rub. Communists fear any kind of independent
group, particularly one with a religious agenda. As a U.S. State
Department expert said, ''They are very conscious of the role
religion played in Eastern Europe.'' Falun Gong denies that it is a
religious group.
 &HT;    However, while people are exercising, they listen to tapes of
the group's founder, Li Hongzhi, 48, who emigrated to America in
January of 1998. What is ''Master Li'' saying?
 &HT;    ''You should always display compassion and kindness toward
others and think of others before doing anything. There will not be
any problems if the first thing that you will think of, whenever
encountering a problem, is whether others can put up with this
matter and if it will hurt anyone. Therefore, you should follow a
higher and higher standard for yourself when you practice
cultivation.''
 &HT;    Falun Gong's philosophy is built on three universally admired
qualities: ''Zhen-Shan-Ren,'' which translate as Truthfulness,
Compassion, Forbearance. The movement has no advertisements and has
spread from heart to heart, which has enabled it to be propagated
quickly. When Li stopped teaching it in person four years ago,
there were only 20,000 followers.
 &HT;    As he puts it: ''The Great Law is being promulgated far and
wide. Those who have heard about it are looking for it. Those who
have attained it are delighted with it. Practitioners are
increasing day by day and they are countless.''
 &HT;    In May, 1998 a physicist criticized Falun Gong for promoting
pseudo science on TV. This infuriated the group and days later
several thousand followers appeared at the TV station demanding
apologies. After a few days, the station caved in, fired the
reporter hosting the show, and praised the good deeds of Falun
Gong.
 &HT;    What good deeds? An October, 1998 study of practitioners in
Beijing Zizhuyuan (a large park in Beijing) revealed remarkable
healing results. Of 700 questionnaires designed by such experts as
the Deputy Chief Physician of the People's University of China
Hospital, 84 percent (584) were returned -- 174 were male and 410
female and two-thirds were aged 51-98. They were intellectuals: 39
percent were college educated; 21 percent had two years of college.
 &HT;    In such an elderly group, 58 percent had cardiovascular problems
before Falun Gong; two-thirds suffered digestive problems; while 6
percent had incurable diseases. Their average annual medical
expense before participating was 3,500 Yuan.
 &HT;    Practitioners said their medical costs had plunged to an average
of 70 Yuan, and 418 said they now had zero medical expenses.
 &HT;    No wonder Falun Gong practitioners are deeply committed. When
governmental leaders called the movement a cult and began arresting
its leaders, an E-mail call sparked 10,000 to 20,000 Falun Gong
followers to gather in silent protest at Tiananmen Square. A
stunned Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji (who visited the U.S.
last spring) met with the group's leaders. (They were later
arrested.)
 &HT;    A front-page story in the ''People's Daily'' newspaper said the
government was not opposed to Falun Gong practice, which is good
for healing; that it was only a rumor that it would extradite
Master Li from America.
 &HT;    ''Months later, they are eating their own words,'' said Master
Li's interpreter.
 &HT;    On July 22, Falun Gong was banned for practicing ''evil
thinking'' and threatening social stability. In 30 cities, police
rounded up tens of thousands of followers, put them in sports
stadiums where they were interrogated over days and forced to sign
letters disavowing the group.
 &HT;    ''In scenes reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution, more than 2
million books and instructional tapes were pulped or crushed by
steam rollers,'' said Time magazine. And 1,200 Communist Party
officials involved in Falun Gong were sent to re-education camps.
 &HT;    The parks are empty today. But the repression is infuriating and
politicizing millions.
 &HT;    Have not Chinese leaders heard that by the blood of martyrs,
Christianity was built? I predict that today's repression is
temporary.

 &HT;    BILL WOULD ALLOW INSURANCE RESERVE FOR MAJOR DISASTERS
 &HT;    Eds: Rewrites throughout to correct description of program.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JONATHAN HALL
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Worried that a major natural disaster could
bankrupt insurers and leave thousands of consumers without
coverage, a bipartisan group of lawmakers Thursday unveiled a bill
to encourage insurers to establish future reserve accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., would alter the
tax code so that a portion of insurance premiums could be placed
into a tax-deferred reserve fund devoted only to covering claims
associated with natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal tax law allows insurers to make reserves only
against losses that have already occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed bill ``will directly address and solve this problem
in the tax law,'' said the National Taxpayers Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we cannot predict nor prevent natural disasters from
occurring, we can prepare for them,'' Foley said at a Capitol Hill
news conference. ``This is a common-sense measure ensuring that
home and business owners who suffer one tragedy don't suffer
another'' if an overexposed insurer went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   After Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992, 10 insurance
companies were unable to pay all of their affected policy holders.
It's believed that if Andrew had come closer to Miami, roughly
one-third of the insurance companies in Florida would have become
insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other bills designed to help the insurance industry
prepare for a major disaster, this proposal would not require the
federal government to back up a reinsurance pool.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the disaster fund would be phased in gradually
over 20 years and held in a special tax-deferred account until
needed to pay claims to policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $16 billion reserve fund would be built within the
first 10 years, costing the government about $500 million per year
in deferred taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taxpayers will be much better served. The insurance
companies can remedy the claims, remain solvent, remain in business
and not come up with the constant government solutions for the
(disaster) problems,'' Foley said.

  askMartha Weddings: CAN YOU RECOMMEND SOME INEXPENSIVE DECORATING
IDEAS FOR A PATIO RECEPTION? 
  
 (This is the debut of Martha Stewart's 'askMartha Weddings,' a
weekly Q&AMP;A all about weddings, from the engagement to the
honeymoon. Art is available. FOR PURCHASE INFORMATION: Contact New
York Times Syndicate sales director BOB FARNELL at (800)
535-4425(AP), fax (212) 499-3382 or farnell(at)nytimes.com.) 
  
 By MARTHA STEWART  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: Do you have any inexpensive decorating ideas for our
reception, which will be held on a patio? _ Katie via e-mail
</P>
<P>
   MARTHA STEWART: A pretty outdoors venue doesn't require a lot of
embellishment. There are no bare walls or ceilings to transform,
and you may even have a lovely view.
</P>
<P>
   But if you need to mask a less than attractive area, consider
renting potted trees from a nursery or florist. For a daytime
wedding, tie the pots with wide ribbon or fabric, string ribbons
through the branches or drape the trees in tulle.
</P>
<P>
   At night, decorate the trees with white lights, or line up tiki
torches or luminaria (paper bags with a little sand for weight and
a candle inside) around the perimeter of your space.
</P>
<P>
   Next, you'll want to concentrate your efforts _ and the largest
portion of your decorating budget _ on the guest tables. Cut flower
arrangements make lovely centerpieces, but why not consider using
pots of planted flowers or fragrant herbs? Terra-cotta pots are at
home in a garden setting, but you can spray-paint them to
complement your color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Add candles _ in hurricane lanterns or even jelly jars _ to
illuminate your table. Platters, bowls and cake stands can be
rented or borrowed and used for centerpieces. Pile them with fresh
fruit and tuck in a few flowers or leaves. For a rustic lunch or
dinner, assemble a basket with assorted country breads, bowls of
olives and olive oil, a pitcher of water and jugs of wine.
</P>
<P>
   While white or ivory linens and china are traditional, consider
adding a bit of color. Colored napkins, a sheer overlay on the
table, unique china or unusual glasses enhance any setting.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: Who is usually invited to the rehearsal dinner? _ Dana
M. Tieman, Oxford, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   MARTHA STEWART: The rehearsal dinner is traditionally hosted by
the groom's family and held the evening before the wedding. It can
be an intimate gathering or a big party.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list always includes the members of the wedding party,
their spouses and members of the bride's and groom's immediate
family. The officiant and his or her spouse are often invited, if
they are close to the family. Beyond that, the list can include
extended family and close friends, especially those who have a role
in the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   It is customary _ not obligatory _ to invite out-of-town guests,
who would not otherwise be able to spend much time with the bride
and groom. For a destination wedding, in which everyone travels to
a special spot for a weekend or longer, all of the wedding guests
are usually included in rehearsal dinner.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: When should we leave for our honeymoon? The day of the
reception or the day after? _ Oct99bride, via e-mail
</P>
<P>
   MARTHA STEWART: There is absolutely no right or wrong time to
depart on a honeymoon. Make your travel plans according to what
will be most comfortable, enjoyable and exciting for you.
</P>
<P>
   Some couples relish the idea of making a dramatic exit from the
reception and going straight to the airport. This isn't always
possible, especially if the party lasts well into the evening. Keep
in mind that you may feel exhilarated after the reception, but you
are also likely to be exhausted, and embarking on a long journey
may prove stressful.
</P>
<P>
   Many newlyweds stay overnight in a local hotel or inn, where
they can relax before departing the next morning. And still others
leave later that afternoon or even the following day so they can
enjoy the company of the relatives and friends who have come from
afar. It is not uncommon for couples to postpone the honeymoon
because of work or financial situations. Sometimes this can't be
helped, but I cannot stress enough the importance of taking a
honeymoon, whether for a few weeks or just a few days. Newlyweds
deserve to spend this special time together, celebrating their new
status as husband and wife.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Questions should be addressed to askMartha Weddings, care of The
New York Times Syndication Sales Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York,
N.Y. 10168. Questions may also be sent to Stewart by electronic
mail. Her address is: mstewart(at)marthastewart.com. The (at)

`INTERPRETER OF MALADIES': LIKING AMERICA, BUT LONGING FOR INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this accomplished collection of stories, Jhumpa Lahiri traces
the lives of people on two continents _ North America and India _
and in doing so announces herself as a wonderfully distinctive new
voice. Indeed, Ms. Lahiri's prose is so eloquent and assured that
the reader easily forgets that ``Interpreter of Maladies'' is a
young writer's first book.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Ms. Lahiri's people are Indian immigrants trying to
adjust to a new life in the United States, and their cultural
displacement is a kind of index of a more existential sense of
dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   One couple living near a small New England campus ``used to
trail their fingers, at the start of each new semester, through the
columns of the university directory, circling surnames familiar to
their part of the world'' in search of new friends.
</P>
<P>
   Another faculty wife, who has taken a baby-sitting job to fill
her empty afternoons, tells her young charge that everything she
cares about remains in India in the home she left behind. ``Here,
in this place where Sen has brought me,'' she complains, ``I cannot
sometimes sleep in so much silence.''
</P>
<P>
   What Mrs. Sen misses in America is the close sense of community
she knew in India. ``Not everybody has a telephone,'' she explains.
``But just raise your voice a bit, or express grief or joy of any
kind, and one whole neighborhood and half of another has come to
share the news, to help with arrangements.'' In America, she
worries, she could scream at the top of her lungs and not a single
person would come to her aid.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lahiri's characters realize, however, that America offers
them, or at least their children, opportunities they would never
have at home. In the story ``When Pirzada Came to Dine,'' the
narrator, Lilia, says her mother knew she ``was assured a safe
life, an easy life, a fine education, every opportunity'' in the
States. ``I would never have to eat rationed food or obey curfews
or watch riots from my rooftop or hide neighbors in water tanks to
prevent them from being shot, as she and my father had.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of this story, Lilia, 10, is initiated into the
anxieties and complexities of the grown-up world. In experiencing
third-hand the travails of her parents' friend, Pirzada, who has
lost contact with his family back home in Dacca during the civil
war of 1971, Lilia learns about politics and political turmoil for
the first time and the personal consequences of such change.
</P>
<P>
   She learns what it means to face losing one's family and one's
home, and she learns just how vastly daily concerns in suburban
America differ from those in less stable parts of the world. Eliot,
the 11-year-old boy in ``Mrs. Sen's,'' learns a similar lesson from
his homesick baby sitter, who introduces him to the concepts of
isolation and exile and loss.
</P>
<P>
   In fact most of Ms. Lahiri's characters find emotional
connection elusive or fragmentary at best. In ``A Temporary
Matter,'' a husband and wife have grown estranged after their son's
stillbirth. During a week of electrical shutdowns in their
neighborhood, they find a parlor game _ ``telling each other
something we've never told before'' _ devolving into a hurtful game
of guilt and humiliation. By the end of the week, both are secretly
relieved to find their marriage coming to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The young Indian newlyweds in ``This Blessed House'' similarly
uncover the fault lines in their partnership as a silly tiff over
some Christian knickknacks discovered in their new home (a 3-D
postcard of St. Francis, a Nativity snow globe, a paint-by-number
picture of the three wise men) escalates into a fight not only
about religion but also about autonomy and control.
</P>
<P>
   Two pairs of unhappy liaisons also stand at the center of
``Interpreter of Maladies'' and ``Sexy.'' In the title story, a
tour guide who is showing an American-born couple around India
recognizes in the pair's exchanges _ ``the bickering, the
indifference, the protracted silences'' _ the same signs of discord
he sees in his own marriage.
</P>
<P>
   His flirtation with the woman, however, undergoes a strange
metamorphosis after she tells him about cheating on her husband; he
begins to suspect that he has simply been used as a receptacle for
her guilt, that he is only a bit player in her life story.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Sexy,'' it depicts two adulterous couples: Laxmi's
cousin's husband, who is cheating on his wife with a woman he met
on an airplane; and Laxmi's friend Miranda, who is sleeping with a
married man named Dev whom she met at Filene's department store.
After Miranda spends an afternoon baby-sitting the son of Laxmi's
cousin, she finds herself re-evaluating her affair with Dev.
</P>
<P>
   In this story, Ms. Lahiri relies far too much on coincidence to
propel her characters' lives forward, and two of the stories set in
India (``A Real Durwan'' and ``The Treatment of Bibi Haldar'') also
suffer from a certain folk-tale contrivance that results in overly
neat, moralistic endings.
</P>
<P>
   But such lapses do not detract from the overall achievement of
this volume. Ms. Lahiri chronicles her characters' lives with both
objectivity and compassion while charting the emotional temperature
of their lives with tactile precision. She is a writer of uncommon
elegance and poise, and with ``Interpreter of Maladies'' she has
made a precocious debut.

   (``A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up
anger.'' --Proverbs 15:1)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN M. TEMPLETON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. Templeton Foundation Press &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Distributed by N.Y. Times Special Features &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In living our day-to-day life, we may have been involved in
situations where tempers flared out of control. Although anger may
be considered a natural, self-protective reaction in moments of
great frustration, ``meeting fire with fire'' often seems to
compound the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Usually a moderate approach is best, and water, not fire,
extinguishes a fire. The writer of the book of Proverbs
acknowledged this truth when he wrote, ``A soft answer turns away
wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning the art of giving ``a soft answer'' can give you an
advantage in moments of great tension, when emotions tend to take
over.
</P>
<P>
   Giving in to anger can rob you of good judgment and leave you
regretting things said or done, once the intense emotions have
subsided. A gentle and controlled approach to an angry situation
can often provide an opportunity to choose your words and actions
rationally and bring a more desirable conclusion to a potentially
damaging situation.
</P>
<P>
   Taking charge of your emotions can allow you to assess a
troubled and clouded area of misunderstanding with a clearer mind
and then take the wisest course toward a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   People sometimes assume, mistakenly, that they have no power
over their emotions. In these instances, they may have given their
power to others. ``He made me so angry,'' someone might say. Or,
``she really gets under my skin.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that no one except yourself has the power to make
you angry. If someone else assumes that power over you, you have,
in some way, granted them that right. You may have reacted in anger
because you felt the other person drove you to it, but the
choice--to be angry or to try a more rational approach--is yours to
make. Louise Nevelson, an American artist said, ``You must create
your own world. I am responsible for my world.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be two ways to approach a situation that has triggered
heated, hard-to-control feelings. You can react to the words and
actions of others, or you can act from attitudes of your own
choosing.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``react'' is a composite of the prefix re-, which means
``again,'' and the word act, which means ``to perform an action.''
In other words, to react can be to perform the actions of another.
And reacting to someone else's negativity can have the potential to
raise the stakes to an explosive level.
</P>
<P>
   To act out of understanding, on the other hand, to give a ``soft
answer,'' allows you to remain poised and calm and may create the
potential for a peaceful, happy solution.
</P>
<P>
   A humorous story is told about British professor John Burdon
Sanderson Haldane. A discussion between Haldane and a friend began
to take a predictable turn. The friend said with a sigh, ``It's no
use going on. I know what you will say next, and I know what you
will do next.'' The distinguished scientist promptly sat down on
the floor, turned two back somersaults and returned to his seat.
``There,'' he said with a smile. ``That's to prove that you're not
always right!''
</P>
<P>
   The next time you are faced with an angry, escalating situation,
make a decision to try the ``soft-answer'' approach. Bring your
emotions under your control, and proceed from a calm and more
peaceful state of mind. By doing so, you can remain in control of
the most vital resource you possess--your mind. You can find, with
practice, that the soft answer may be your best defense against
harsh words.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Roosevelt, American humanitarian and first lady,
affirmed taking responsibility. She said, ``Somewhere along the
line of development we discover what we really are, and then we
make our real decision for which we are responsible. Make that
decision primarily for yourself, because you can never really live
anyone else's life, not even your own child's. The influence you
exert is through your own life and what you become yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   If you examine daisies, or sunrises and sunsets, or snowflakes,
or people, you may observe that the great laws of life provide a
wonderful uniqueness in the Creator's many expressions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there is nothing secretive or magical in the
instructions for starting a car. We follow the instructions so the
power can be released into action to transport us to our
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Where was that power before we turned the key in the ignition?
It was present, ready and waiting, but it was inactive. It was
power in potential, but we needed to activate it to get results.
</P>
<P>
   The power within us can also be ready and waiting. We activate
it by turning the key of our consciousness--our mind power.
However, it is important to operate this inner power with care for
the best results. In many instances, the best results may be
obtained by the soft answer that turns away wrath and fans the
precious embers of love and compassion.

JARRETT RETURNS TO BRICKYARD 400 A YEAR WISER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It is over, but not forgotten. A lesson learned,
Dale Jarrett says now.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a year ago that Jarrett came here with a car that
blew everybody's doors off.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1998 Brickyard 400 approached the halfway point, Jarrett
was far out in front and getting faster. Some 59 laps into the
race, Jarrett led Jeff Gordon by 1.242 seconds. By lap 66, he was
2.692 seconds ahead. By the 70th lap, he was 4.123 seconds up. By
76, it was 4.232 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, though, Jarrett was not only outrunning
Gordon, he was outrunning himself, gobbling up more gas than
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's fuel use had been carefully calculated by Todd
Parrott, Jarrett's crew chief. It would be tight, Parrott knew, but
the thinking was Jarrett could lead the 80th lap and collect the
$10,000 bonus that goes to the car in front at the race's halfway
point.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   An ominous warning came on lap 79, when Ward Burton's Pontiac
sputtered and slowed on the track.
</P>
<P>
   One lap later, after winning the $10,000, Jarrett's car coughed
and died on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   As he coasted around to the pits, his team had put $10,000 in
one pocket and taken nearly $1.5 million out of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Refueled, Jarrett would mount a furious, almost unbelievable
charge, making up the four laps he lost but running out of time
before he could regain the lead. When the race was finished, so was
he, in 16th place.
</P>
<P>
   But Jarrett, who had plenty of gas in 1996 when he won here, is
back, looking to run up front and determined to stay there if he
has the competition covered. His car was the fastest of the 57 that
ran here in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have the best car you'd like to take advantage of
that, especially in a race as big as Indy,'' Jarrett said. ``But I
think it gave us a heads-up on this year because we're gonna be
bringing the same race car back.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's loss was made even more frustrating because NASCAR
officials seemed slow to throw the caution when Burton's car
finally died.
</P>
<P>
   With an earlier caution, Jarrett might not have lost as many
laps, which could have changed the outcome of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's over and done, too,'' Jarrett said. ``Those are things
that are in the past, and hopefully, everybody learned from what
went on there and we know better than to sit and wait on something
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean Jarrett's team has stopped taking risks.
</P>
<P>
   In Daytona's Pepsi 400 this year, Jarrett once more stayed on
the track when it was uncertain how much fuel he had left.
</P>
<P>
   This time the race was winding down, and he was going for the
win.
</P>
<P>
   With the aid of a late caution, he made it to the end and won
the race before he ran out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   During the caution, Jarrett came down off Daytona's high banks
and ran on the apron, the flat part of the track.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted he would have made it even if the race had
stayed green.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett said he stayed low under caution because ``riding on the
bank that slow gives the fuel plenty of time to go away from the
pickup, and we just didn't want to take any chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The fuel pickup is on the right side of the car, which tilts to
the left on the banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had enough fuel, especially under caution, to make it,''
Jarrett insisted. ``But there's no sense in taking a chance in
having the thing burping and running out of something for a split
second and then being hard to crank up.''
</P>
<P>
   So the gamble that failed at Indy worked at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take chances on fuel and tires sometimes,''
Jarrett said. ``Those are the type things you have to do if you're
going to win.''
</P>

BASEBALL CARDS ARE A WHOLE NEW GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's surprising nobody thought of it before:
Baseball Tarot Cards.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lerner and Laura Phillips have produced 78 tarot cards
wrapped around a baseball theme (Workman Publishing, $20), with
handsome, hand-done images of everything from the Ace of Bases to
the Twelve of Mitts, from The Goat to The Umpire to a Whole New
Ball Game. The set comes complete with a 324-page book explaining
the way baseball tarot complements traditional tarot.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting Roger Angell (``Baseball seems to have been invented
solely for the purpose of explaining all other things in life''),
the book talks about the Majors, a group of 21 cards that
corresponds to the Major Aracana or Trumps in traditional tarot _
``the universal, underlying principles of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 57 cards fall into four suits _ Mitts, Balls, Bats
and Bases _ to make up the Minors. Mitts, including the Three of
Mitts (Triple Play), refer to matters of the heart or Cups in
traditional tarot. Balls (Swords in traditional tarot) deal with
analytical thought and include the Ace of Balls and the Eleven of
Balls (No-hitter). Bats, corresponding to Wands, offer Four of Bats
(Grand Slam) and Ten of Bats (Bases Loaded). Bases (Pentacles) has
cards labeled Pickoff, Rundown and Winning Streak.
</P>
<P>
   Players can refer to Baseball Tarot one card at a time for
everyday guidance, for a regular weekly or monthly reading, or only
when a pressing question is raised.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner and Philips offer a breakdown of different reading
layouts, starting with two- and three-card readings (Hit, Ball,
Strike), a 10-card layout, and the more traditional 12-card layout,
set in the shape of a baseball diamond _ each player at his
position, with a batter, umpire and on-deck hitter bringing the
total to 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Diamond is Baseball Tarot's answer to the traditional
Celtic Cross layout,'' the book explains, providing ``a fuller,
more detailed view of a situation's meaning and potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner and Philips also offer a ``Who's on First?'' layout,
which include ``Who,'' ``What'' and ``I Dunno'' for ``when you're
completely confused, like the characters in the famous Abbott and
Costello comedy routine.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors are serious about their baseball. In her
acknowledgments, Philips thanks ``Dem Bums and the Amazing Mets for
providing my family with a religion.'' Lerner thanks ``my camp
friends with whom I played ball and traded and flipped cards for
seven summers in upstate New York'' and ``the guy from Dallas who
didn't show up to meet his friends at Yankee Stadium, allowing me
to take his place and go to the third game of the 1964 World
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Philips and Lerner, who came up with Baseball Tarot at
Peralandra Books in Eugene, also are serious about their Tarot,
warning readers not to tempt the cards by asking the same question
over and over: ``You will likely find that the Tarot has an uncanny
way of unmasking attempts to get a `better' answer. A second-guess
reading will often include many of the same cards as the original
reading, underscoring the reader's reluctance to consider what's
already been offered.''
</P>
<P>
   The book breaks down the meaning of each card in a given order _
from the Ten of Bats (``acceptance of responsibility'') to the
Catcher (who ``shows up to remind you of an old adage: sometimes
you just know''). Along the line are philosophies, large and small,
from Ted Turner's ``People have the most fun when they're busting
their ass'' to Wes Westrum's ``Baseball is like church. Many attend
but few understand.''

A REVOLVING DOOR AT THE RAIDERS CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANK BLACKMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPA, Calif. _ Maybe someone should install a revolving door
here.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, running backs Ray Zellars and Tyrone Wheatley joined
the team. But there was a significant departure. The night before,
former Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware retired from the Oakland
Raiders and left camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ware talked to us last night,'' coach Jon Gruden said. ``He
informed us that was his decision. So we're to continue to move
forward with the quarterbacks we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruden acknowledged Ware didn't get much of a shot to make the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a tough situation,'' Gruden said. ``He wasn't
getting very many opportunities to show what he could do. It was
unfortunate. He got hurt in the World League and didn't really get
a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ware only played in five games for the Berlin Thunder before
breaking his collarbone. When he reported here, he was one of five
quarterbacks competing for a job. And Gruden immediately said that
was too many to give everyone an equal look.
</P>
<P>
   Ware wound up spending most of his time either watching the
other quarterbacks participate in drills or off on another field
taking meaningless snaps as the offensive and defensive lines
slammed into each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked some of the things that Scott Dreisbach was doing,''
Gruden said, ``and we decided to commit ourselves for a while to
Pat Barnes and see what happens. He (Ware) didn't get enough
turns.''

<P>
   BOSTON -- In his first public remarks on the scandal that rocked
the Boston office of the FBI last year, FBI director Louis Freeh
says ``significant mistakes were made'' by local agents who
recruited Irish gangsters to inform on the Italian Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   And, Freeh said, ``if'' a task force of FBI agents and Justice
Department prosecutors ``come(s) up with evidence that we can bring
within the statute of limitations, because there are some in this
case, you will see vigorous presentation and prosecution'' of the
local gents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll let the chips fall where they may,'' Freeh said
Wednesday during a news conference at the Boston office of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   And he insisted that the bureau was committed to finding James
``Whitey'' Bulger, the indicted South Boston crime boss turned
informant, who has been a fugitive for more than four years.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said that Bulger is in the running to be named to the
FBI's vaunted 10 Most Wanted list _ a designation long sought by
the local agents assigned to find him.
</P>
<P>
   For months, prosecutors investigating possible criminal
wrongdoing by Bulger's FBI handlers have been presenting evidence
to a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   That grand jury, according to sources, has heard evidence of
possible crimes by retired Special Agent John Connolly, who was
Bulger's handler for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the agents implicated are retired or the criminal
conduct dates back many years, Freeh said, ``There's nothing we
take more seriously than the integrity and honesty of our agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not an agency to make excuses for either problems or
people who. . .have committed serious violations and crimes while
working for the FBI,'' Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting that the FBI's credibility has been damaged in
the fallout over its handling of Bulger and his criminal sidekick
Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, Freeh said he didn't think the the
bureau's reputation had been ``indelibly'' harmed.
</P>
<P>
   He compared it to the taint which attached to the bureau after a
counterintelligence agent two years ago was discovered passing
secrets to Russian spies.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said the bureau was embarrassed by the espionage of
Special Agent Earl Pitts, who pleaded guilty to passing secrets to
the KGB, but not ``irrevocably'' damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh pointed out that no one yet knows if the alleged
wrongdoing of agents who handled high-level informants like Bulger
and Flemmi will result in the dismissal of extortion and
racketeering charges brought against Bulger, Flemmi, reputed new
England Mafia boss Francis P. ``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme and
several associates in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After holding months of hearings lasting most of last year, US
District Judge Mark L. Wolf has yet to rule on defense motions to
dismiss the charges and suppress evidence. Flemmi says the charges
should be dismissed because he and Bulger were given permission to
commit crimes in exchange for information they gave the FBI on the
Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Freeh said, the FBI is revising its policies on
handling criminal informants.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh stressed that the kind of wrongdoing Connolly and others
are alleged to have engaged in _ turning their backs on crimes
committed by informants, tipping them off to investigations,
exchanging gifts _ is neither ``representative or symptomatic'' of
the way the bureau's 29,000 employees operate.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he is concerned about losing the faith of the
public. Responding to relentless questions about the Bulger case
during the 20-minute news conference, Freeh said Bulger may be
added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list when a panel in Washington
meets next week.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger, he said, would be given ``due consideration.'' Freeh
said that finding Bulger, who has been on the run since his Jan. 4,
1995 indictment, is a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he demurred when asked why that has not translated into a
higher profile for the 69-year-old Bulger. He acknowledged that the
Boston FBI has proposed Bulger for the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   After at first saying that he is not on the committee that
chooses the Top 10, Freeh admitted he does in fact carry some
weight with the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Dating back to 1950, the 10 Most Wanted list has led to the
capture of many a criminal, often with the public's help.
</P>
<P>
   An important consideration in putting fugitives on the list _
and one that works in Bulger's favor _ is whether the publicity
would enhance his chances of being captured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may in fact put him on the Top 10 list,'' Freeh said later.
``He's as important as anyone on our Top 10 list.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For out-of-town visitors, summer in Washington can
mean many things: monuments and documents, a Babel of regional
accents, First Family photo ops (though these are rare), and the
sight of local office workers jogging at lunchtime on the National
Mall _ up and down, up and down _ no matter how hot the weather.
</P>
<P>
   But summer also means art, and plenty of it. Washington is a
serious museum city. There's the National Gallery of Art, of
course. And the Smithsonian Institution covers a wealth of cultural
bases. The nation's collections of African, African-American and
Asian art are under its auspices, as is the Hirshhorn Museum, a
showcase for contemporary work. That's just a partial list. Throw
in privately financed outfits like the Corcoran Gallery and the
table is set for a feast.
</P>
<P>
   All these venues have worthy-to-outstanding fare on view at
present, including retrospectives of Roy Lichtenstein, Brice Marden
and Alma Thomas; a survey of recent work from South Africa, and a
truly celestial gathering of South Indian goddesses. None of the
shows will travel to New York, which may make a Washington trip
(with a stop in Baltimore on the way) something more than a
should-we-or-shouldn't-we proposition.
</P>
<P>
   One attraction that certainly won't be going anywhere is the
National Gallery's new Sculpture Garden, which opened in May.
Covering a 6.1-acre square plot next to the museum, it has curvy
paths, shady plantings and a circular fountain about the size of
Lake Lucerne. This sends out mighty fire-hose-style jets of water
in summer; in the winter it will be a skating rink.
</P>
<P>
   Installed throughout the grounds are 17 examples of postwar
sculpture from the museum's collection. Some, like Ellsworth
Kelly's oval-shaped steel ``Stele II'' and Isamu Noguchi's ``Great
Rock of Inner Seeking,'' are poised and circumspect, the way we
wish politicians were. Others, like Louise Bourgeois' bronze
``Spider'' and Joan Miro's ``Gothic Personage, Bird-Flash,''
browse, wary and shy, among the the trees.
</P>
<P>
   To be frank, inner-city sculpture gardens are an iffy idea. They
corral together large-scale occupants who have basically nothing to
say to each other, then force them to show off competitively, a
situation in which nobody wins. Still, this one is good of its
kind. Most of the work gets to claim some personal space, and some
pieces are outgoing and user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can lounge around, for example, on Scott Burton's
granite seats and feel relieved that they don't have to negotiate
Lucas Samaras' vertiginous stack of turquoise chairs. And they can
fantasize a home away from home in Roy Lichtenstein's aluminum
``House I,'' with its cartoon lines, Pop colors and eye-tickling
play with perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran Gallery of Art
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein, who died two years ago and is best known as a
painter, has a full-scale survey of sculpture at the Corcoran
Gallery. It encompasses some 40 years of work, and although the
artist was involved in the planning stages, the final selection was
made by Jack Cowart, deputy director and chief curator at the
Corcoran.
</P>
<P>
   The show has much to offer, though it gets off to a shaky start.
The polychrome sculptures installed on the museum's grand interior
staircase are swamped by the heavy 19th-century architecture. They
look flimsy, almost like clutter. Lichtenstein's painstakingly
breezy art was made for cleaned-out modernist spaces. It often
depends on them, in fact, which is both a weakness and a strength.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the white-cube environment of the galleries,
everything perks up. The show begins at the beginning. From the
1940s comes a carved stone head influenced by pre-Columbian
sculpture, from the '50s a slender assemblage of painted wood in
which the artist's eye for whittled-down forms and his deadpan wit
are already in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lichtenstein had a brief Deco-ish phase in the late
1960s, his renowned Pop art style was firmly in place by 1964, as
seen here in sculptures of women's heads, soulful and Ben
Day-dotted steaming coffee cups and ``explosions.'' These images
were transferred straight from paintings, with in some cases the
Ben Day dots replicated in perforated steel.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture became more abstract as time went on and folded in
a range of art historical references, Picasso, Matisse and Abstract
Expressionism among them. Lichtenstein's famous images of frozen
brush strokes, which gently mock the psychic imperatives of Action
Painting, proved especially amenable to the sculpture medium, and
several variations splash and drip in mid-air here.
</P>
<P>
   If the show feels more and more absorbing as it goes on, it's
not because the work gets better exactly, but because one gets
attuned, even faintly addicted to, its character: self-amused,
good-natured, always preferring the eloquent turn of phrase to the
Big Statement. It all looks effortless, though the preliminary
studies and working collages in the show _ scuffed up, rethought,
drawn over _ tell a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein's art is cool, in the sense of ``Wow, that's
cool.'' He had oodles of style, enough to sustain a whole career.
It was a career very much of a piece. His sculptures, paintings and
prints are, visually speaking, all cut from the same bright, sheer,
wash-and-wear modern cloth. As a body of work, they give
lightweight a good name.
</P>
<P>
   Hirshhorn Museum
</P>
<P>
   If the Lichtenstein show offers a lesson in carefully honed
consistency, ``Brice Marden, Works of the '90s: Paintings, Drawings
and Prints'' at the Hirshhorn is the record of an artist taking a
big mid-career leap.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and '80s, Marden was known for his multipart
monochrome paintings. With their panels often arranged in
post-and-lintel format and their reverberant colors and skin-taut
encaustic surfaces, they seemed to infuse Minimalism with a muted
subjectivity.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '80s Marden was steeping himself in Chinese
literature and calligraphy, and his work changed. He began to trace
lines on monochrome grounds. Then, as if to physically break the
grip of geometry and the habit of control, he started to paint with
a stick held at a distance from the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   The linear webs and tangles that resulted both did and did not
amount to a personal signature. They were generated by the arm, and
to some degree by the eye, but they weren't hands-on. Physical
distance produced accident. Accident puts a drag on ego.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what one imagines was going on. A small painting
at the Hirshhorn, ``Prayer Flags,'' seems to encapsulate the
before-and-after effects of the process. The hard, dark lines in
the background (they seem to tilt and bend resistantly rather than
curve) were executed in 1989. The marigold color cords of paint
that twist over and around them were added in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In between came the monumental ``Cold Mountain'' paintings
(1989-91), probably the artist's best-known works. In them the
skeins of paint have the fluctuating tonal weight and uneven,
scratchy fibrous edges of ink-and-brush strokes, with underlying
webs that suggest erasures and pictorial depth.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually the line fattened up and color returned, and with it a
different kind of energy. The painting ``Progression'' (1993-95),
with its ropey swirls of hot orange and yellow on a blushing
ground, is as warm as an arterial system and has the adamant,
sensuous charge of Tantric deities locked in an embrace.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But by no means are all of Marden's sources Asian. A love of
Greek culture has infused his work all along; the patterns in
``Study for the Muses'' (1991-97) bring to mind the wind-whipped,
body-caressing drapery of classical sculpture. And natural forms or
forces, which are at the foundation of classical Greek and Chinese
art, underlie everything he does.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of ``classical'' has different implications in those
two cultures. Broadly speaking, in Greece it was associated with
stability and centeredness; in China, with flux and dispersal.
Marden's paintings in the Hirshhorn show, which was organized by
Charles Wylie for the Dallas Museum of Art, adroitly join the two.
</P>
<P>
   Anacostia Museum Gallery
</P>
<P>
   The abstract painter Alma W. Thomas (1891-1977) also drew
inspiration from nature, and often from specific forms: the flower
beds and cherry trees in Washington's parks, the light-catching
leaves of the holly tree outside the house in which she spent most
of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas studied art at Howard University, where she was the first
graduate of its fine arts program, and she was a junior high school
art teacher for 35 years. It was only after her retirement in 1960
that she turned to painting full time. And most of the work in the
Anacostia show, which comes from the Fort Wayne Museum of Art in
Indiana, dates from the last two decades of her life.
</P>
<P>
   She knew artists of the so-called Washington Color School, like
Kenneth Noland, Sam Gilliam and Gene Davis, and she studied with
Jacob Kainen. But she evolved a chromatic style of her own. Her
paintings from the 1960s are made up of multicolored bands,
mosaiclike streaks and dabs. In the early '70s, the strokes were
one color over a dark ground, as in ``Cherry Blossom Symphony,''
with its porous pink curtain floating over a field of hummingbird
emerald and blue.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later the strokes became puzzle-piece shards, as in
``Scarlet Sage Dancing a Whirling Dervish'' and the fantastic,
wall-filling ``Red Azaleas Singing and Dancing Rock-and-Roll
Music.'' Finally, in ``Oriental Garden,'' they mutated into
calligraphic commas, check marks and zigzags, which typically bunch
together on the left side of a painting and thin out as they move
to the right, like leaves scattered by a whoosh of wind.
</P>
<P>
   The links between Thomas' work and Marden's _ a passion for
nature and for abstract art's peculiar exhilarations _ are oblique
but real. It's great that they are showing in the same city at the
same time. Unfortunately, the likelihood of visitors chancing on
the Anacostia are slim. The museum, one of two sites for the
Smithsonian's Center for African-Amrican History and Culture, is in
a residential neighborhood and not near a Metro stop. But it's a
quick ride by cab from the Mall and worth the extra effort.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the Anacostia is a show of contemporary work, ``Locating
the Spirit: Religion and Spirituality in African-American Art.''
Many pieces _ a ``Crucifixion'' by Allan Rohan Crite is one _
depict biblical narratives. Others, like Ben Jones' heart-shaped
``Shango Fan'' and an altarlike installation by Leslie
King-Hammond, refer to Caribbean religions. Still other references
are to Islam. Such is the case with Yahya Muhammad's ``Victory,''
with its wild sci-fi landscape and Koranic inscription written in
traditional calligraphic scripts that also evoke graffiti art.
</P>
<P>
   It's a populous show, and not everything is on the same level,
though a selection of photographs in a separate gallery _ by Carl
Clark, Linda Day Clark, Adger Cowans, Michael Cunningham, Sheila
Pree, Ken Royster and Jeffrey Scales _ is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Arts and Industries Building
</P>
<P>
   For another photography show _ huge, unwieldy, deeply engrossing
_ head to the Arts and Industries Building, the Anacostia's in-town
headquarters on the Mall. The exhibition ``Revue Noire: Africa by
Africans, a Photographic View'' was organized by Deborah Willis and
has already traveled to Europe and South America in a much larger
form. But with more than 200 images by dozens of photographers from
across Africa, the Washington edition still feels compendious.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the names _ Seydou Keita, Peter Magubane, Rotimi
Fani-Kayode, Malik Sidibe _ are familiar in the United States. Most
are not but certainly deserve to be. To take random examples, one
would like to have an expanded look at the work of the wonderful
Samuel Fasso and the Congolese photographer Depara, who died in
1997, or the output of the Boyadjian family, once portraitists to
the Ethiopian court. (Don't miss the portrait of Haile Selassie.)
And the vividly colored South African interiors by Zwelethu
Mlthethwa make one hungry to see more.
</P>
<P>
   Documentary pictures, including those sponsored, for better or
worse, by government agencies, and others published in magazines
like the South African Drum give a textured sense of African life
at all social levels. They also raise endless questions about the
very idea of ``Africanness'' and about who controls the Africa seen
in the West (Politicians? Photographers? Curators? The art
market?). Big and scattershot as this exhibition is, it is the tip
of a many-faceted diamond of an iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   National Museum of African Art
</P>
<P>
   Photography plays a crucial, if incidental, role in ``Claiming
Art/Reclaiming Space: Post-Apartheid Art From South Africa,''
organized by Lidia Pucinelli at the National Museum of African Art,
where it is just one of several media _ painting, sculpture,
printwork _ mixed together in a peppery, simmering stew of a show.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the work still carries the sting of political emergency.
Willie Bester's tight assemblage of car parts and metal fencing
refers to drive-by police shootings. David Koloane's expressionist
painting of stray dogs is a thinly disguised symbol for a military
state. Kay Hassan's terrific mural-scale collage of torn-up
billboard posters is a shout-out-loud celebration of the country's
free elections.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of artists follow a less confrontational, more
metaphorical path, William Kentridge, Georgie Papageorge and
Rudzani Nemasetoni (who was an artist-in-residence at the Studio
Museum in Harlem a few years ago) among them. So does Gavin
Jantjes, who now lives in London. His series of astrological
paintings are dreamy to look at but pose questions about what's in
the stars for the still-vulnerable South African nation.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's special exhibitions gallery is not an optimum place
for seeing art. Long and narrow, and fitted with a choppy series of
partition walls, it tends to make shows look scrappy and
disorganized. And the selection in this case, drawn entirely from
the museum's collection, is fairly familiar. The next step will be
to bring fresh material from South Africa, which one hopes the
Museum for African Art in Manhattan will do in an exhibition
scheduled to open this fall.

   Arthur M. Sackler Gallery
</P>
<P>
   Directly across a pretty garden courtyard is the African
museum's architectural twin, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, with
the Freer Gallery beyond. The Freer and Sackler are among the
city's jewels. The curatorial lineup is top-notch, the exhibition
quality high, the combined collections spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   The Sackler's stellar draw at the moment is ``Devi: The Great
Goddess,'' a gorgeous, soul-stirring gathering of sculptures and
paintings, ancient and modern, devoted to the female divinities of
India. The objects range from cast-bronze temple icons to rural
figures carved in wood to action-packed manuscript pages. And the
aura they are collectively generating is as wide as a city block.
Organized by the art historian Vidya Dehejia, this show rates a
Washington visit all by itself.
</P>
<P>
   National Museum of American Art
</P>
<P>
   For a change of pace, carve out time for ``Picturing Old New
England: Image and Memory'' at the National Museum of American Art.
The show brings together roughly a century's worth of objects, from
paintings (Winslow Homer, John Singer Sargent) to dust-gathering
bric-a-brac (a stationery box in the form of Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow's Cambridge, Mass., home, with pictures of Grave Alice
and Laughing Allegra and Edith With Golden Hair on the inside lid.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to examine how New England became a national symbol
(of moral rectitude, among other things), and a tourist lure. Art
had everything to do with it, according to this
exhibition-as-critical-essay, and the case it presents is on the
whole craftily wrought.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Museum of Art
</P>
<P>
   If you're heading north from Washington and have an extra hour
and energy to spare, consider a quick stopover in Baltimore to see
``Chokwe! Art and Initiation Among Chokwe and Related Peoples'' at
the Baltimore Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Manuel A. Jordan for the Birmingham Museum of Art
in Alabama, the show measures out art and anthropology in judicious
doses. It suggests how the Chokwe people of Africa, who now live in
Angola, Congo and Zambia, have traditionally passed the realities
of the present through the clarifying filter of the remembered past
to assure social harmony and spiritual continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Sculptures, masks and ceremonial paraphernalia of all kinds are
instrumental in this exchange, and some of the examples here bring
their extraordinary charisma intact into the museum setting. A
wooden chief's figure with a swept-back Superdome coiffure, a chair
bristling with minute human figures and a mask of a glamorous
female ancestor with high cheekbones and paint-rimmed eyes are a
few of the high points.
</P>
<P>
   The show requires some reading of wall texts to pick up its
thematic logic. But the installation, with its biscuit-colored
walls, is clean and straightforward, the material deeply absorbing.
And with full-dress, thought-through scholarly shows of African art
still absurdly rare in American museums, kudos to Baltimore (and to
Birmingham, of course) not only for being host of the show, but for
giving it main-stage attention as well.

MICHAEL JORDAN IS WORKING ON HIS BELLY

   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Michael Jordan has surfaced once again
in Santa Barbara, conducting his Flight School basketball camp for
the fourth straight summer at the University of California at Santa
Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan continued his custom of declining media interviews, but
he allowed his campers to ask questions. On Tuesday night, Jordan
opened up the floor to queries from the campers during a half-hour
``Talk Back'' session.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of some of the questions:
</P>
<P>
   So, how is the pot belly coming?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is coming along,'' said Jordan, who had announced that a
big belly would be a part of his life after retiring in 1998. `It
is a slow, gradual process.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you have an interest in coaching?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not right now,'' he said, confidently. ``I can't say I
won't down the road, but right now I am enjoying coaching my kids.
That is all I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you ever going to come back to the NBA?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I am done,'' Jordan said to a sea of disappointed
whimpers.
</P>
<P>
   Did you push off Bryon Russell (for the game-winning shot) in
the 1998 NBA finals?
</P>
<P>
   ``No I did not, did they call a foul?,'' said Jordan with a big
smile. ``I was simply getting my balance. Now, what Reggie Miller
did to me in Game 6 (of the 1998 Eastern Conference finals) was a
foul. But, I am not whining.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was the hardest championship to win?
</P>
<P>
   ``The last one,'' said Jordan. ``We had a lot more
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you think you can guard Sacramento Kings' guard Jason
Williams?
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is, can he guard me?'' said Jordan. ``He has
a killer crossover, but he has to play at the other end too.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you really like Wheaties?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, after a second of thought. ``Do you really
expect me to say no?''
</P>
<P>
   Do you wear Hanes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said. ``I told you kids ask the best questions. Only
a kid would ask that question.''
</P>
<P>
   What kind of gum do you chew during games?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it depends on the opponent,'' said Jordan. ``If we play
the Lakers, Wrigley's Doublemint. If we play the Clippers,
Bubblicious.''
</P>
<P>
   If you had a chance to play golf with anyone, who would it be?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be Ben Hogan,'' said Jordan, who now
considers golf to be his favorite sport.
</P>
<P>
   Do you ever watch Dennis Rodman wrestle?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that what Dennis is doing now?'' said Jordan with a smirk.
``I haven't talked to him in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the question-and-answer session, Jordan put on a show
with the help of some of his basketball friends. The camp
directors, stars at the high school and collegiate level, split up
into teams for two 20-minute halves.
</P>
<P>
   While Jordan made about 90 percent of his shots, East St. Louis
High School star Gary Smiles stole the show. Smiles, a 7-foot
senior, converted on five spectacular dunks, including his own
version of Jordan's patented flight from the free-throw line to jam
the ball home.
</P>
<P>
   With retirement a permanent part of Jordan's life, he'll have to
get used to passing the baton onto younger players like Smiles.
</P>
<P>
   But judging by the sea of black-and-red No. 23 jerseys at UCSB's
Thunderdome, the kids will always live in a Jordan world.

THE `REAL' THING: ANOTHER BRITISH COMING-OUT STORY RINGS TRUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's getting to where director John Hughes' name is getting
batted around as an allusive source almost as much as Hitchcock's.
</P>
<P>
   He's been credited as the inspiration of audience-pleasing
comedies such as ``Can't Hardly Wait,'' ``She's All That'' and the
smash hit ``American Pie,'' as well as two new gay indie pictures,
``Edge of Seventeen'' and this weekend's ``Get Real.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite ``Get Real's'' upper-class British setting and gay
main characters, the trials and tribulations of its high school
heroes has never seemed more Hughes-ian. Call it ``The Brunch
Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Silverstone is Steven Carter, a 16-year-old walking hormone
who has comfortably come to grips with his own homosexuality _
though not enough to tell anyone other than his gal pal, Linda
(Charlotte Brittain).
</P>
<P>
   Carter endures the ruthless taunts of the school jocks while
mooning over track superstar John Dixon (Brad Gorton). Linda,
meanwhile, purposefully continues to flunk her driver's ed test in
order to woo her instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Neither experiences much success, until a chance encounter at a
public restroom accidentally outs Steven and John to each other.
What follows is all the delightful awkwardness of first love _
Steven dealing with his giddy excitement at learning that the man
of his dreams has eyes for him as well, and John dealing with how
his affection forces him to face his own painful closetedness.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of running secondary story lines _ Steven must
fend off an amorous female classmate while John has to keep his
life secret from his catalog-model girlfriend and his homophobic
jock friends, but director Simon Shore has found such a terrific
cast of talented unknowns that they make you almost forget the
film's Afterschool Special approach.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstone, especially, is an amazing find. His Steven is among
a refreshing new breed of gay teen heroes _ confident in his own
sexuality, brave enough to take the difficult steps toward coming
out, and in touch with his own emotional turmoil without being
crippled by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' makes a great companion piece to the lower-class
Brit coming-out film ``Beautiful Thing,'' offering an interesting
comparison of class structure's influence on gay youth. And the
good news is that ``Get Real's'' upper-class dialect is a lot
easier to digest than the thick wish-it-had-subtitles slang of
``Beautiful Thing.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Film: ``Get Real''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 1/2 on a scale of 5

YEATS, A POET WHO KEPT TRYING ON DIFFERENT IDENTITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   Michael Frank is a book critic, essayist and short-story writer.  
 (bl)  
 By MICHAEL FRANK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nothing turns a man into a statue more effectively
than a combination of fame, death and the passage of time. Together
they join hands and hoist him up on a high cold plinth. If the man
is a writer, he disappears into the official editions of his work,
all polish and (ideally) perfection, the fits and starts and wrong
turns folded out of sight like the hem on a pair of dress pants.
</P>
<P>
   There is always the biography. But in biography a man often
undergoes a different sort of hardening: his turmoil, his
inconsistency, his groping confusion are by necessity smoothed into
a narrative whole. Even the most sensitive of biographers sacrifice
throb and raggedness in the name of storytelling; their work would
be unreadable otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   For a sense of process _ in the work and the life alike _
exhibitions of manuscripts, books and related memorabilia can be
extremely successful at getting the statue to come down off his
plinth and take a breath or two. These exhibitions reverse time.
They take a visitor back into the moment. Because of the
inconsistency of materials available to a curator, they are not
always comprehensive or in perfectly calibrated balance, but their
subject is often palpable, paradoxical and animated.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this is very much the case with William Butler Yeats
in ``Such Friends,'' a rich survey of his work and life now on view
at the New York Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   Yeats (1865-1939) is a challenge to the curator, as he is to the
biographer and in a different way to the reader of his verse,
prose, memoirs and plays. He lived a long, complex, regularly
self-reinventing life, and in his obsessions and enthusiasms he was
sometimes, well, a little all over the place. His trajectory, of
writing as of living, can be seen as one long attempt to build up,
then to a degree break down again, a series of identities or
preoccupations until he got closer and closer still to his true,
authentic self and voice.
</P>
<P>
   In his pivotal 1948 study, ``Yeats: The Man and the Masks,''
which still remains fresh, Richard Ellmann saw these different
identities as masks. Rodney Phillips, curator of the exhibition
(and of the library's Berg Collection of English and American
Literature, from which much of the material is drawn), highlights
Yeats' use of doppelgangers, whom Yeats named variously Michael
Robartes, Owen Aherne and Red Hanrahan. Many people have observed
Yeats' lifelong self-division, which falls into two categories:
Yeats the dreamer and Yeats the man of action.
</P>
<P>
   Yeats the dreamer was variously attracted to the occult,
spiritualism, fairy life and fairy tales, paganism, magic, seances,
psychic phenomena, Eastern religion, Theosophy and Mme. Blavatsky,
mysticism and William Blake. All of this culminated, famously, in
his years-long preoccupation with the automatic writing of his
wife, George, which was believed to give Yeats direct access to the
spirit world and which led to ``A Vision,'' Yeats' attempt to
summarize and categorize all of human personality through ``a
system of symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeats the man of action, by contrast, worked for Irish
nationalism, helped ignite the Irish literary renaissance, and was
co-founder of the Abbey Theater, which encouraged the work of Irish
playwrights. Mediating between _ and arcing over _ these two selves
and drawing fully on their range of interests was of course Yeats
the poet, whose lifelong directive, which he first articulated to
himself when he was in his early 20s, was ``Hammer your thoughts
into unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Unity of thought is a tall, perhaps even an unreasonable, order
for a man in his youth and his maturity both, and Yeats seems to
have been only sporadically successful at achieving it. He  &UR; was &LR; 
successful, however, at submitting himself to all these stimuli and
all these interests, and out of them _ and his knowledge of life,
which age deepened significantly _ he wrote magnificent verse whose
meaning often remains accessible even when some of its inspiring
symbols are obscure.
</P>
<P>
   Yeats was supremely successful in another area as well. He made
many profound and sometimes passionate connections to other people,
and it is to these key human connections that Phillips has turned
for the organizational tissue of his show.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yeats' first connections were, like every human being's,
involuntary, that is to say to his family, and in his, Yeats was
both blessed and cursed. He was blessed because his family was
artistic and accepting and encouraging of the pursuit of art and
literature: his father, John Butler Yeats, was an intellectual and
a painter, as was his brother, Jack; his sisters, Lily and Lolly,
became printers who elegantly published many of Yeats' books at
their Cuala Press.
</P>
<P>
   Yeats was cursed, though, because his father was dominating,
opinionated and often devouring of his gifted son. George Yeats
told Ellmann that the poet brought a particular burden to their
marriage: his lifelong tension with his father. And this when Yeats
was already well into middle age. (He married at 52; George was
25.)
</P>
<P>
   Little sense of the paternal burden comes through in the
father's delicate and sensitive pencil drawings of the son, which
like the best objects in this exhibition seem to live in a
perpetual present tense, as though the artist had just lifted his
pencil off the page minutes earlier and slipped the sketchbook
behind glass for safekeeping. The notion is not so very
far-fetched: John Yeats did in fact leave some of this work in
Manhattan, where he lived for the last 15 years of his life, in a
rooming house run by the Petipas sisters on West 29th Street.
Rather like Leopold Mozart, it would seem, John Yeats withdrew from
his son's life (and country) once the poet achieved success, at
least in person: daily letters continued to flow.
</P>
<P>
   Yeats had both a father and a father figure. The latter was the
Irish Fenian Brotherhood hero John O'Leary, who is represented here
in an album of photographs of prisoners. An editor of The Irish
People, he advocated overthrowing British rule and was convicted of
treason in 1865. He spent two decades either in jail or exile
before returning to Ireland in 1885 and becoming a major influence
on the young, politically awakening, ever versifying Yeats
(``Beautiful lofty things: O'Leary's noble head'').
</P>
<P>
   Also on display are O'Leary's copy of ``Mosada'' (1886), Yeats'
first publication, and a famous letter in which he tells O'Leary
that, next to poetry, he has decided to make magic ``the most
important pursuit of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mystical life,'' he asserts, ``is the centre of all that I
do &AMP; all that I think &AMP; all that I write.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his friends Yeats was not alone in splitting his
personality and trying on different identities. There must have
been something in the air in the 1880s and '90s: Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde and Dorian Gray (and his portrait) among the fictional
schisms, George William Russell and William Sharp among the real
ones. Russell, mystic, poet and artist, published under the
pseudonym A.E.; he and Yeats intersected in their fascination with
Theosophy, Irish matters and dreams. A.E. is represented here by
manuscript material and a sketch by John Yeats.
</P>
<P>
   William Sharp is an even more curious case. After publishing
literary biographies under his own name, in 1893 he began to write
poetry on Celtic subjects under the name of Fiona Macleod. Yeats
said that Fiona was Sharp's ``imaginary beloved,'' and that in her
``all the heart, all the brain of the Celtic races shall be
stirred.'' Fiona had her own literary style and feminine
handwriting and conducted her own correspondence with Yeats and
others.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As friends and lovers, or a mixture of the two, actual women
were focal in Yeats' life. The poet Katharine Tynan, one of his
earliest women friends, recalled that Yeats was ``beautiful to look
at with his dark face, its touch of vivid coloring, the night-black
hair, the eager dark eyes.'' ``He asked you to be profoundly
interested in his poetry,'' said Tynan, whose work appears here
alongside Yeats' in ``Poems and Ballads of Young Ireland'' (1888).
``On the other hand, he was always interested in yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeats formed one of his most enduring friendships with Lady
Augusta Gregory, a folklorist and a major figure in the Irish
Literary Renaissance. Lady Gregory, whose papers became part of the
Berg collection in the 1950s, is abundantly represented in ``Such
Friends.'' In her diary entry for April 14, 1894, for example, she
records her first meeting with Yeats: ``At the Morrises I met
Yeats, looking every inch a poet.'' (That is the William Morrises,
who also numbered among Yeats' friends.)
</P>
<P>
   Then inevitably there is Maude Gonne, Yeats' elusive, longtime
love and muse, who rejected his marriage proposals on five separate
occasions. ``I had never thought to see in a living woman so great
a beauty,'' Yeats wrote of the first time he met her.
</P>
<P>
   A radical Republican, Gonne conducted her personal life with
more daring than Yeats initially grasped. In December 1898, after
they kissed for the first time, she confessed to him about her
affair with Lucien Millevoye, by whom she had two children. Yeats
promptly wrote to Lady Gregory, in a letter on display here: ``I
have come to understand her &AMP; admire her as I could not have done
before. My life is a harder problem to me than it was yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later Gonne told Yeats: ``I know that just now,
perhaps, it is useless my saying to you `love some other woman.'
All I want of you is not to make up your mind  &UR; not &LR;  to.''
</P>
<P>
   In the cool marbled hall of the library, this century-old
passion and the attempted thwarting of it flame fiercely. They're
visceral. They live in Gonne's crunched, sloped, rushed handwriting
and in Yeats' more deliberate script. They live in the hastily
folded paper and the envelopes the paper was hurried into and the
flaps licked urgently shut. Above all they live in the words.
</P>
<P>
   Life fairly exudes from these cases: this one man's one busy,
layered life, which burst out in action and writing and friendship,
decade after decade. Phillips referred to ``the whole `six degrees
of separation' thing.'' Three, more like it. There's the Rhymer's
Club, where Yeats and his poet friends met weekly to discuss one
another's work. (Oscar Wilde stopped by.)
</P>
<P>
   There is the Irish Dramatic Movement (its goal: Irish plays on
Irish soil) and the eventual forming of the Abbey Theater. Here the
links proliferate: to the actress and critic Florence Farr, to J.M.
Synge, to George Bernard Shaw (who appears in three beautiful
photographic self-portraits), to Sean O'Casey.
</P>
<P>
   There are Yeats' encounters with the pricklier figures of
20th-century letters. When he met James Joyce, who was 17 years his
junior, Joyce reputedly said: ``I have met you too late. You are
too old.'' ``Deteriorating'' is another word that slipped out that
November day, but somehow Yeats' father sketched Joyce anyway, and
Yeats was generous enough to recognize Joyce's gifts, telling him,
``The work which you have actually done is very remarkable for a
man of your age.''
</P>
<P>
   First Joyce, then Pound: for three winters a young Ezra Pound
served as Yeats' personal secretary in a spare stone house in a
tiny village in Sussex. He took dictation, read to ``Uncle
William,'' studied Japanese literature with him and, in a
foreshadowing of his later relationship with T.S. Eliot, revised
Yeats' work unbidden and published the revisions unapproved. Yeats
was furious at first but later allowed most of them to stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``All life weighed in the scales of my own life seems to me a
preparation for something that never happens,'' Yeats wrote near
the end of one of his autobiographies, ``Reveries Over Childhood
and Youth.'' Alas something did happen to Yeats: in 1917, in middle
age, he married.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years earlier he had written to A.E. that ``a poet, or
even a mystic, becomes a greater power from understanding all the
great primary emotions &AMP; these one only gets out of going through
the common experiences &AMP; duties of life.'' This was very prescient.
As a husband and eventually a father, Yeats grew to feel ``more
knitted into life.'' His work became more powerful. And he found in
George, as Ellmann puts it dryly, that he had ``married the Sibyl
herself.''
</P>
<P>
   When Yeats panicked early in their marriage, George decided to
soothe him by faking a few lines of automatic writing. Yeats was
soothed and captivated and compelled, but the joke was on George,
since she apparently had a talent for receiving messages from her
various ``communicators'' or ``controls'' and in 450 subsequent
sittings was to produce 3,600 pages of this ``miraculous
intervention,'' which became the basis for ``A Vision.'' The first
preserved page of George's automatic script (which has been lent to
the library by their son, Michael Yeats) shows George's wobbly
writing dropping off the page in an increasingly illegible slope.
This is a document remarkable to behold: an obsession close to its
original provoking moment.
</P>
<P>
   All life prepared Yeats for marriage, perhaps, but it also seems
to have prepared him for more life. To inhabit it, that is, and his
art, more fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must lay aside the pleasant patter I have built up for
years, &AMP; seek the brutality, the ill breeding, the barbarism of
truth,'' he wrote in 1937. The barbarism of truth: his late verse
is veritably racked with it; and with sharp, merciless, naked
self-inspection; and with grief, as his friends began to die; and
with an acute sense of his own approaching mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout ``Such Friends,'' working holograph drafts,
much-amended typescripts and revised proof copies of Yeats' verse
are on display. In the end little makes the poet live and breathe
so vibrantly as watching him do what he did best, fitting the words
together like the shards in a mosaic, arranging and rearranging
them until he achieved his exact and most radiant design.
</P>
<P>
   In the final room of the exhibition the first continuous draft
of ``The Circus Animals' Desertion,'' Yeats' great retrospective
poem of 1937, is laid out in all this searching evolution. It
famously ends:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that my ladder's gone,
</P>
<P>
   I must lie down where all the ladders start,
</P>
<P>
   In the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   These words, some of the most beautifully conjoined in the
English language, did not come easily to Yeats. He wrote and
rewrote, he erased and he spliced and he sharpened. In looking back
over his life as in anticipation of it, he worked hard, and he
reworked hard. He was not a statue at all. He was a man.
</P>
<P>
   Where and When &QL;

<P>
   On Monday night, like generations of actors before me, I played
a fairy.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any fairy, mind you, but Fairy No. 6, one of the
midnight sprites, a bit player in the sultriest Shakespeare comedy,
``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, I joined the members of the city's acting fraternity
who spill out of theaters and into the great outdoors every summer,
tossing aside their fine-tuned elocution and 10-step relaxation
exercises in exchange for the big gestures and shouting over
traffic noise, which are the hallmarks of open-air theater.
</P>
<P>
   They are everywhere, from the Joseph Papp Public Theater's sleek
showcases at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, where
``Tartuffe'' begins on Tuesday, to a gritty production of ``Romeo
and Juliet'' being staged this weekend in an outdoor garage next to
the Theatorium on the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   The Shakespeare Project takes its outdoor stage to public spaces
all across the city, while the Fringe Festival, beginning on Aug.
18, will invite troupes from across the city to perform downtown.
Farther afield, outdoor performance rules in bucolic locales like
Lenox, Mass., in the Berkshires, where Shakespeare and Co &UR; . &LR; 
resides on the Mount, and a production of ``Love's Labour Lost''
romps through Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   But for a true acting challenge, urban actors have their country
brethren beat. The complications are Ozian in scope: winos and
hecklers and teenagers, Oh my!
</P>
<P>
   War stories are rampant. Actors tell of being upstaged by ice
cream trucks _ ``children are fickle'' _ chased by dogs and ignored
by audience members who feel no compunction about leaving in the
middle of a soliloquy. Sometimes it rains.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are moments when actors get the better of
these elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year there was this drunk dude, heckling us through the
entire second scene, who finally yells out, `Yeah, but can you do
it like a Viking?''' recalled Matt Daniels, who appeared last year
as Nick Bottom and has performed outdoors for three summers. ``So I
went immediately into a Swedish accent. I think he gained a new
respect for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But considering the potential indignities, why would actors put
themselves through this?
</P>
<P>
   I decided to try it firsthand, donned my acting persona (taller,
more confident) and headed for the park. The plan was simple: to
join, for one night only, the annual production of ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream,'' staged for the last 10 years by the Gorilla
Repertory Theater Company &UR;  &LR; and its director in the southwest corner
of Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. It wasn't a
tremendous stretch; in college I performed in the same play and I
flirted with the profession for several years after that.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the Delacorte, which has big budgets and
fixed seating, most of the outdoor troupes have to create their own
playing space; audience members sit on the grass or take chairs.
Gorilla Rep's production is played on a small wedge of grass
between the park's dog run and its chess tables, with the audience
following the actors as they move about the space from scene to
scene. Three bike hills dominate the landscape. Still, on a good
night a performance can draw hundreds of spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the company's open-air campaigns speak in awed tones
about the feeling when the audience is that big and that close.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no fourth wall,'' said Lynda Kennedy, who has been
acting in Gorilla Rep shows since 1991. ``They are right there.
You're walking on them.''
</P>
<P>
   While the outdoor life may mean anxiety for actors, directors
seem to thrive on having the city as a backdrop, a setting that
allows for effects that simply can't go on in a normal theater.
``We'd be rehearsing and as Richard would be giving a particularly
demonic speech, sirens would start going off,'' said David Levine,
who directed ``Richard III.'' ``It was three times as good as
anything you could plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in watching some of this summer's open-air shows, all
sorts of unexpected gems emerge. The clanging of the bells at
Riverside Church as two ``Midsummer'' lovers kiss. A pair of
tattooed punks hugging and peeking through a gate to watch Juliet
fall by her Romeo.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, what separates these productions, most of them
free, from their indoor counterparts is their ability to draw
audiences that aren't usually found in Broadway theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare's audience had the groundlings and the elitists,''
said Jennifer Spahr, the artistic director of Expanded Arts. ``What
we've got is the same thing. We've got the scholars, people who
read along with the play. And then we've got the locals, walking
through and saying, `What are you doing?' And often times they sit
down and watch.''
</P>
<P>
   With limited rehearsal time and an infinite capacity for
embarrassment, it was agreed that I would play the sixth fairy in
the gang of the fairy king, Oberon, as well as the plum role of Tom
Snout, the tinker, a part made famous by absolutely nobody.
</P>
<P>
   But playing Snout had an added advantage over my fairy role; the
role had lines. Three of them, to be exact, plus a 10-line speech
in the play's climactic play-within-a-play, wherein Tom Snout plays
a wall that divides two lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe. It was a small
part but staggeringly vital.
</P>
<P>
   Like most companies, Gorilla Rep rehearses inside for weeks
before releasing its actors into the wild. The goal, said
Christopher Carter Sanderson, Gorilla Rep's artistic director, is
to school actors in the art of performing in public spaces (speak
up) and school them out of habits bred indoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dramatic pause is my greatest enemy,'' Sanderson said.
``You've got to be the most interesting thing happening in that
moment, and it's not easy to be more interesting than a drug deal
or a drag queen or a car alarm going off.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson also said he emphasized a quick to blistering pace for
performances.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Scott Cargle, an actor and the artistic director of the
Shakespeare Project, summed up a typical approach: ``Subtlety you
can forget about. You have to tell the story in broad character
strokes and engage the audience as much as possible by talking
directly to the audience as much as possible. You see someone
fidgeting, you talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   To recap: Be big, loud and fast.
</P>
<P>
   My only full rehearsal was far from the teeming city, at a
company member's family house in Connecticut. The estate spread
over five acres adjacent to a forest. In the afternoon, I watched a
run-through as the 13-member cast clambered over rocks, through the
woods and across the tennis court, playing scenes wherever they
chose. The exercise is called a para-theatric; I was exhausted just
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the cast began to run my scenes, comforting me as I
tripped over them and my lines _ all three of them and that big
speech. The assistant director, Andre-Philippe Mistier, had only
one note for me: Don't hide my face as I speak.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hallmarks of outdoor performance is the immediate
rejection that actors can get from the audience. In a theater
intermission is usually the only time an unsatisfied crowd can
escape. Outdoors they come and go all the time, and if you're
onstage, you watch 'em go. A rule of thumb is that audiences
usually grow as the play progresses; but if their numbers are
getting smaller, something may be seriously wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Early on Monday before my performance I began to feel the
sensation known to every actor: nerves, sneaky twinges in the
belly.
</P>
<P>
   By midday I had worn dog-ears on my copy of the script, studying
my final lines:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so,
</P>
<P>
   And being done, thus Wall away doth go.''
</P>
<P>
   I memorized them, stuck the script in my pocket, panicked a
moment later and repeated the process. Again. And again.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 p.m. I arrived in the park, where Sanderson and company
walked me through the blocking for the play. The first fairy scene
would be played in the grass, the second on the bike hills etc. All
I had to remember was to keep the audience moving from location to
location. While I was ``offstage,'' I was to use a flashlight to
help light the actors ``onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening was perfect. It was cool and clear for the first
time in a week, and in the center of the park acrobats played to
circles of fans and the fountain provided instant water sports.
Several people lounged on the grass nearby, while a family of three
finished a picnic. All in all, I thought to myself, not a bad place
to work.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 minutes before the show about 20 people had gathered at
the playing space. On the periphery a homeless man slept beside a
grocery cart full of his possessions.
</P>
<P>
   The play began with Theseus, the Duke of Athens, striding up and
over a bike hill, as his bride, Hippolyta, the Queen of the
Amazons, approached from West Fourth Street. Just as Shakespeare
imagined it . . .
</P>
<P>
   It came off without a hitch. Theseus' voice echoed off the
nearby buildings as the rest of the players confidently strode into
the crowd, playing lines to them, with them and for them. And true
enough, the crowd began to build. By the time of my first entrance,
the crowd in the grass had doubled, and by my first exit, nobody
had left. I considered it a victory.
</P>
<P>
   The play moved along furiously, pulling the audience from the
grass to the bike hills and back again. There were a few
complications. A fight in the dog run (between dogs, not owners)
occurred during Act III, drowning out a lovers' quarrel in the
play. A bewildered group of tourists stumbled too near the playing
scene and fled of their own accord.
</P>
<P>
   Night, which ever is when day is not, fell. I played several
more scenes and much to my dismay, the crowd began to ebb. Was
something wrong? Daniels, who plays Nick Bottom, the play's
soft-hearted clown, put my mind at rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Monday night,'' he said. ``The feel of the park is
different.'' He talked about the energy of the weekends on a warm
evening compared with those nights when clouds threaten. Or the
Yankees play. Or there's a full moon. Each is different, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Act V, scene 1: Enter Snout as Wall''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd had rebounded by the play's finale. On the bike hills,
about 75 spectators hunched to watch Nick Bottom and company play
out, as Shakespeare quipped, the ``tedious brief scene of young
Pyramus and his love Thisbe'' for Theseus and his court.
</P>
<P>
   As Wall, I wore a giant foam glove etched with a brick wall
pattern, which was handy because I had an epic case of the cold
sweats. I dabbed my brow with my giant glove, entered and opened my
mouth for the big speech.
</P>
<P>
   My first line was half finished when I heard it. A snicker. Was
that a good snicker or a bad snicker? I stopped and looked in the
snickerer's direction, but was blinded by the light from a
flashlight. Then another snicker, from another direction. I shot a
glance in that direction, and my panicked look prompted a laugh. I
was in a snicker vortex. I spoke the second line of the speech;
there was a twitter and a throaty laugh. A warm feeling began to
replace the cold sweat.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I got to my final two lines, it was official: I was
hamming it up. My mood was so high that my final two lines, the
ones I'd suffered over all afternoon, came out like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus I, Wall, have finished my part so,
</P>
<P>
   Thus being done so, I in your absence go go.''
</P>
<P>
   Not really English, not really Shakespeare, but enough to exit
trippingly.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the play was over. The audience stood to applaud;
to be fair, they had been sitting on concrete but they stood
nonetheless. Then they wandered off, and the park was the same as
before the play had begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet are the uses of adversity,'' Shakespeare wrote in ``As
You Like It,'' and true to his words, the cast had used the barking
dogs, the limited light and the confused tourists to help create
the strange world of the play. The dogs became the hounds of
Athens, the tourists became woodland sprites. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   And as I took off my big foam hand, I came to see the payoff was
the same out of a theater as it is in one: the satisfaction of
transporting yourself and an audience somewhere else. It's just
where you start from _ in a park, in a plaza, in the cool night air
_ that's different.

`ILLUMINATA': BACKSTAGE WITH A CAST OF FOIBLES AND FOLLIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Illuminata'' is John Turturro's enormously fond homage to the
world of acting, beguilingly presented and filled with knowing
backstage humor. And Turturro, who directed the film and wrote its
screenplay with Brandon Cole, from Cole's original play, has done
an fine job of drawing his cast into the spirit of celebration. The
players' enthusiasm for this material is palpable as ``Illuminata''
summons the stock characters of behind-the-scenes theater stories
and affectionately invests them with new life. The actor who is
asked, ``You can't cross left to right?'' and answers, ``Not
emotionally, no'' may be a familiar type, but he's not one who will
ever go out of style.
</P>
<P>
   Set amid a turn-of-the-century New York repertory company with a
strongly European flavor, ``Illuminata'' features such divine
fixtures as the aging diva, Celimene. She is played gleefully by
Susan Sarandon as the kind of actress who sees a fresh-faced young
beauty and is moved to remark: ``That is how I shall look years
from now. I'm beginning to be able to play ingenues.'' Attacked
with equal gusto is the smug, lofty critic with the Transylvanian
accent, hilariously played by Christopher Walken as a master of
casual cruelty and irrelevant ad hominem observations.
</P>
<P>
   When this critic arrives to review the troupe's work, he winds
up writing about the long eyelashes of a male bit player. Bill
Irwin is amusingly cast as the reluctant object of the critic's
affections. ``There is nothing I like better than things like
this,'' the critic confides when one of the actors goes wild and
apparently drops dead onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Turturro and his somberly beautiful wife, Katherine Borowitz,
play out the section of ``Illuminata'' that gives it ballast and
heart. The filmmaker appears as Tuccio, an aspiring playwright
involved with Ms. Borowitz's Rachel, the company's reigning star.
These two work out a delicate balance of love and ambition during
the course of the story and deliver what are its most earnest and
also most theatrical sentiments. ``Illuminata'' is both the title
of Tuccio's play and what he eventually calls Rachel, as the light
of his life, after the film has taken them down quite a rocky road.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Beverly D'Angelo brazens her way delightfully through
the film as one of the theater's owners, with a comic yet movingly
rueful performance from Donal McCann as her weaker mate. (McCann,
who died in July, is well remembered for his role in John Huston's
elegiacal film ``The Dead.'') The large and zestful cast also
includes Rufus Sewell, breathing funny new life into the
standard-issue myopic leading man; Ben Gazzara as an actor who
can't build a character without the right hat, and Aida Turturro
and Leo Bassi as the story's earthiest clowns.
</P>
<P>
   Turturro, who directs ``Illuminata'' well enough to let the
viewer stop noticing that he directed it, gives the film
(handsomely shot by Harris Savides) more visual variety than might
be expected. There are puppets and curtain calls, an exotic lair
for Ms. Sarandon's grande dame and a quaint and invitingly
dreamlike stage set. The white flakes drifting onto this set are
bread crumbs at an early stage, flower petals by the time the film
is over.
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ In this era of intensive media nosiness, politics
and corporate life have been transformed by the routine exposure of
previously private matters, from sexual affairs to financial
malfeasance to mere incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   The world, in short, has been demystified by digging _ all the
world, that is, except at least one area: moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd because Hollywood has been the focus of a profound
fascination in recent years in both the mainstream press and
specialty publications. And yet with all the attention lavished on
stars, the media tend to get little access to the unglamorous
day-to-day process of creating and distributing movies, save for
carefully managed set visits from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' for example, took more
than three years to make, involved scores of actors, technicians
and studio executives, and was the subject of heavy media
speculation. Yet the public learned almost nothing of substance
about the film _ other than what the studio and its publicity
agents doled out _ until it was released three weeks ago to mixed
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   All this underscores why Rob Nilsson is, by Hollywood standards,
so deeply subversive. His new movie, ``Scheme,'' would probably
just be one of the hundreds of small independent films made every
year if it did not breach the one taboo Hollywood rarely ignores:
the one against making the filmmaking process completely
transparent.
</P>
<P>
   And it is doing so thanks to the Internet, where Nilsson is
displaying his dailies, or scenes as they are shot, mistakes and
all, as well as a running commentary explaining what he is up to.
The Web address is: www.ifilm.net.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson, 59, is something of a guerrilla filmmaker. He has
tended to work with small budgets on offbeat subjects, and some of
his films have been well received critically. ``Northern Lights,''
about the struggles of some farmers in North Dakota, received an
award at Cannes in 1979, and ``Heat and Sunlight,'' about a
photographer whose affair with a dancer is falling apart, took a
prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   For his last several movies he has enlisted the homeless,
through his Tenderloin Action Group in San Francisco, to make
pictures that are heavily improvised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scheme,'' he said, begins with some general scenarios focusing
on a thief named Bid who chooses to live outside the system on his
motorcycle. But the actors will then recreate the scenes much the
way they want. The story ``is about people who are going to do
something but never do,'' he said, adding, ``It is about people who
sustain a dream, or a scheme, but the seeds of its destruction are
in the characters or the culture around them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of it as depressing,'' Nilsson said. ``It's as
true a fact as any in our lives that our schemes don't work out.
What's wrong with not getting the whole wave?''
</P>
<P>
   He said the movie would cost in the neighborhood of $150,000,
was being shot digitally on electronic cameras and was scheduled to
be completed around the end of the year, when it would be
distributed digitally on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way of demystifying the whole filmmaking process,
and that's subversive,'' Nilsson said. ``Hollywood wants to keep it
a big secret and say there's this golden process. But that's just
the way they make money.''
</P>
<P>
   To help viewers understand what is happening in the movie,
Nilsson is even going so far as to film elements of the back
stories of the characters. In other words, the Internet shows
scenes depicting key events in the lives of his characters that
will not appear in the final cut of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this guarantees that the movie will be good
or that many people will want to watch it. But at least lots of
people will know about it, another important aspect of this
pioneering project.
</P>
<P>
   Rodger Raderman, 30, the chief executive of iFilm Network, the
company behind the Internet screening, said: ``The whole idea is to
create this community of interest before it even comes out. My
feeling is people will come to like and appreciate the characters.
They'll want to see the finished project more, not less.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a subversive side to using the Internet to market
``Scheme.'' The tactic has reduced costs considerably and gotten
around the traditional and extremely expensive distribution system
controlled by the studios.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Normally each print of a movie costs as much as $4,000. So if a
film opens on 100 screens, it costs $400,000 right there. And
traditional marketing and promotion add about 25 percent to the
production costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scheme'' will incur none of those costs, yet an almost
limitless number of consumers will have the opportunity to watch
it. Raderman said he hoped to make money not by charging people to
watch the film on the Internet but by charging for advertising that
will run with it, much as a television network does.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that this process was best suited to smaller
projects that might not be viable by Hollywood's usual financial
standards. But he said it would provide a new generation of
filmmakers with a novel method of finding an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts artists in direct contact with consumers,'' Raderman
said. ``You don't need the whole studio structure to find that
audience.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adam Rifkin is an example of an increasingly common Hollywood
type. At 32 he's a filmmaking veteran with a long and diverse
career in a business increasingly run by and catering to the youth
market.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote and directed the independent movie ``The Dark
Backward,'' for instance, a low-budget tale of a talentless garbage
man who, after failing in his efforts to become a comedian,
suddenly grows a third arm from his back and enjoys a peculiar kind
of celebrity. He has also written big-budget mainstream movies like
``Mouse Hunt'' and ``Small Soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin is in short a movie nut who did not sell a script until
his 30th effort and who now tries to use his extremely profitable
successes to finance the more personal, oddball projects he loves
to do _ and do and do.
</P>
<P>
   He is hoping his latest movie, ``Detroit Rock City,'' to be
released next Friday, will be a combination of the two, a quirky
movie about things he likes and a mainstream commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is Rifkin's first job as a director of a studio
feature; he did not write this one. He noted that its budget, about
$16 million, was more than all the other movies he has directed
combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit Rock City,'' which stars Edward Furlong, Giuseppe
Andrews, James DeBello and Sam Huntington, is essentially a
coming-of-age film for the new generation of filmmakers. It is
about four young people desperately in love with the clownish rock
act Kiss (the movie takes place in 1978, the group's heyday) and
desperate to get into one of the band's concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Simmons of Kiss is one of the movie's producers, and the
aging band members make cameo appearances. The journey of the four
young friends is a tale of misadventures and of growing up in a
twisted sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sort of '70s movie for the '90s, because the baby
boomers who really came of age at that time may not completely
recognize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel so much nostalgia for the '70s,'' Rifkin said.
``It just seemed like such an innocent time.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was pointed out that he was just 11 years old in 1978,
Rifkin added: ``I wasn't these kids, but I idealized kids like
this. These were the big brothers of my friends. The movie's my
perception of what their world was like.''
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin said that while the film's intended audience was young
people, he hoped it would click with aging baby boomers nostalgic
for their misspent youth and still able to chuckle at these kinds
of antics.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, this band was every parent's worst nightmare,''
Rifkin said. ``Now, there's a Kiss Visa card. I hope all different
age levels will connect with that irony.''

 &HT;    ATTENTION: RESENDING TO CORRECT INGREDIENTS LIST
 &HT;    Chill with pineapple concoctions
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pineapple Sherbet made with buttermilk is what my
mother turns to when it's too hot for anything else at her Florida
home. She has adapted a recipe that her mother took from a booklet
accompanying a refrigerator many decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   So when Mary Custar asked for such a recipe, I knew where to get
one. In fact, when I called Mom to discuss it, she and Dad had just
polished off a batch.
</P>
<P>
   But because I also knew Mom's recipe calls for uncooked egg
whites _ which can be risky for young children, older folks and
those with immune system disorders _ we published Cus-
</P>
<P>
   tar's request hoping for a less-risky version.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the few that came in included raw egg whites. But dining
critic John Kessler came through with one that does not _ Pineapple
Freeze.
</P>
<P>
   We're including both because they are both colder than ice cream
on a hot day, and neither requires an ice cream maker. If you
decide to make the one with eggs, you might consider substituting a
pasteurized egg white product.

PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW: WHIMSY AND HARSH REALITIES IN THE LAND OF THE
TANGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Argentina may commonly be associated in the American
popular imagination with Eva Peron, Nazi war criminals, polo,
tango, soccer and steak. But for the 11 photographers represented
in ``Myths, Dreams and Realities in Contemporary Argentine
Photography,'' now at the International Center of Photography
uptown, Argentina is quite another place.
</P>
<P>
   For them, it is a land of bewitching primordial forces and a
cruel plague known as AIDS, of children without homes and women
without freedom, of the grimly religious and the ill-fated
``desaparecidos'' (disappeared), of urban whimsies and urban
horrors, of simple hope and brash Warholian spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The photographers in this show, which was organized by the Pan
American Cultural Exchange in Houston, and curated by Anne Wilkes
Tucker, curator of photography at the Museum of Fine Arts in
Houston, have varied backgrounds and highly individualistic visions
of Argentina. Yet the images, five from each artist, have an almost
organic cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominators are a gentle humanity, a sophisticated
eye, an uncommon intelligence and originality, and an expert
command of black-and-white tonal ranges. Only one artist works in
color.
</P>
<P>
   All but three of the photographers were born in Buenos Aires,
where most still live and work. The oldest was born in 1948, the
youngest in December 1968. Like Manuel Alvarez Bravo, the grand old
man of modernist photography in Latin America, all are clear-eyed
and unsentimental about what they capture on film.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the photographers have at least one or two strong images
in the show.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Southeasterly Winds, North Shoreline, Buenos Aires,''
Marcos Zimmermann juxtaposes the full misty fury of crashing waves
with the still black motifs on a waterfront balustrade. Among
Adriana Lestido's photographs of women in prison is a haunting one
of a woman, a dirty apron over her clothes and a big kitchen knife
in one hand, who looks with fierce mournfulness at the camera.
</P>
<P>
   The standouts in the show are Gabriel Valansi, Marcos Lopez,
Martin Weber, Eduardo Gil and Helen Zout.
</P>
<P>
   Valansi, a self-taught photographer, has produced some of the
show's most transcendent work. His ``Buenos Aires at Night''
series, all printed in gorgeous black-and-white tones, is dreamy
and mysterious. Valansi's nocturnal finds include a ghostly dress
in a cellophane bag; a popcorn machine that at first sight
resembles a fish tank, and a luminescent street banner against a
velvety black sky.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the only photographer who registers the
blatantly cosmopolitan side of the capital and its iconic masks is
not a native porteno, as a resident of Buenos Aires is known. Born
in Santa Fe Province in 1958, Lopez went to film school in Cuba,
and his Technicolor post-modern work is exuberantly irreverent,
with mad touches of Warhol, Cindy Sherman, David Levinthal and
Henri Rousseau.
</P>
<P>
   President Carlos Saul Menem has been praised for halting years
of hyperinflation. So in ``Buenos Aires, the City of Happiness''
(1993), Lopez gives him a kind of visual credit by making drawings
of Menem's smiling face the backdrop for an affluent-looking couple
_ she in white fur, he in wool coat and yellow muffler, both
wearing Chiclet smiles, bright red lipstick and 3-D paper glasses.
</P>
<P>
   The other strikingly post-modern work is by Weber. His series
``Dreams With Me'' is a combination of performance and conceptual
art. Weber asked his subjects to write down their wishes on a small
blackboard, then artfully posed his subjects with the blackboard.
In lesser hands, this would be a hokey enterprise. But Weber gives
his spare black-and-white pictures a lovely narrative spin.
</P>
<P>
   The best is the one in which the wish is for many horses.
Slightly evocative of Sally Mann's pictures of her wise-innocent
children, this photograph is a marvelous portrait of a seemingly
unspoiled young man leaning against a tree, a bamboo grove behind
him, horse reins in his hands, the horse standing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Also nearby are two little girls, obviously oblivious to the
longed-for wish. One is crouched and looking wide-eyed at the
camera; the other looks away and stands with hands nonchalantly
holding onto bamboo stalks.
</P>
<P>
   Gil's surreal ``Buenos Aires 1984-1996'' series suggests that
the man behind the camera has seen his share of urban horrors but
remains fascinated by the mysteries in human drama. In a riveting
image, a man in white shorts sits at the foot of a tree, bandages
over his eyes, his mouth and one knee.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting beside him is an anguished blond woman in a halter and
sarong skirt, one hand on the man's chest, the other gesturing
desperately at someone or something out of the camera's range.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most powerful images were taken by Ms. Zout. She
began a series on children with AIDS in 1989, and, like Gil, she
has not let the grimness of what she has seen lessen the humanness
of her subjects.
</P>
<P>
   With no-nonsense tenderness, she shows a mother and daughter
with AIDS hidden under a lacy cloth. The cloth may hide their
identities but it is very likely a harbinger of the funeral shroud.
Cruelly highlighting their plight is a photograph above them of a
different mother and child: a healthy mother breastfeeding a
healthy baby.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zout's portrait of a child afflicted with AIDS playing in
his home, his face behind a fright mask, brings to mind the masked
subjects in Ralph Eugene Meatyard's photographs and the violently
distorted faces by Francis Bacon. Here the mask is not just a
kindness to the boy but also a not-so-subtle gibe at a society that
continues to react with horror to those struck by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myths, Dreams and Realities in Contemporary Argentine
Photography'' remains at the International Center of Photography,
1130 Fifth Ave., at 94th Street, (212) 860-1777, through Sept. 26.

INJURIES WON'T STOP MARTIN FROM RACING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Mark Martin isn't thinking about the Winston Cup
championship, although he's second in points to Dale Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   And he isn't thinking about his injuries or how much he hurts,
although he is driving with a cast on a broken wrist and a brace on
a fractured knee, which now has a pin in it. All he's thinking
about is the next race, which is Saturday's Brickyard 400.
</P>
<P>
   That the Brickyard is now arguably the second most important
event on the schedule, trailing only the Daytona 500 in many minds,
makes no difference to Martin. To Martin, a race is a race is a
race. You put the same effort into all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Lately though, that has been difficult for Martin, who went hard
into the wall at Daytona in the final practice for the July 3 Pepsi
400 and tore himself up. He put the pain aside to drive the very
next day, ending up 17th. And he drove at New Hampshire the next
week, finishing sixth despite arthroscopic surgery on his knee.
</P>
<P>
   After a week off, he was third at Pocono, where his crew still
had to lift him into and out of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Indy. For many drivers _ especially those who grew up
in open wheel ranks like Jeff Gordon, John Andretti, Tony Stewart
and Kenny Irwin _ it is a huge event.
</P>
<P>
   To Martin, it is another race to do his best, another race to
try and win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to win every one of them, every race I run,''
Martin said. ``That's how I feel about them. I know that's a big
disappointment to a lot of people, but I don't pick one particular
race and say that's it and if I don't win I'm going to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not that way,'' Martin said. ``I try my hardest in
every race I run. It doesn't matter where it is or what's at
stake.''
</P>
<P>
   That he has been able to continue driving competitively,
considering the severity of his injuries, amazes many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pain is pain,'' Martin said. ``The one thing I have found
about pain, especially in these particular injuries, it reminded me
that whatever hurts new, hurts,'' said Martin, who has been
bothered by a disc problem in his back for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you live with that for awhile, your body adapts to that
pain and you're able to go on and not notice that pain as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still there, but your body becomes adapted to it, and you
learn how to move and get around the pain the best way possible.''
</P>
<P>
   What has never become tolerable, for him, is being unable to
compete. And as long as he can get in a race car, or someone can
put him in, he'll drive, because for Martin, the real pain doesn't
start when he's in the car. It begins when he has to get out.

EVERY BOY NEEDS A BOX
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Monday Aug. 9)  
(rk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The watchword in father-son relations these days is ``quality
time,'' which in my household means doing a project that could
result in a messy power-saw accident and a panicked run to the
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Call me old-fashioned, but to me nothing says ``bonding'' like
sitting slumped in the front seat, your severed thumb chilling in
the cooler between your feet, while your hysterical wife fishtails
the Oldsmobile through rush-hour traffic with one hand while
applying pressure to your bloody stump with the other.
</P>
<P>
   The project that Michael and I attempted the other day is called
a ``low box,'' a name that derives from the fact that it is nothing
more than a box, and a rather low one at that.
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot comprehend the purpose of a low box then it is
likely that you are not a 13-year-old boy who has been recently and
seriously bitten by the skateboarding bug.
</P>
<P>
   Florida skateboarders discovered some time ago that standing
motionless atop a skateboard, waiting for a geological event that
would result in something called a ``hill,'' was not only
time-consuming but also incredibly boring. So they built, possibly
with the help of their fathers, boxes and ramps and half-pipes and
other dangerous apparatuses on which they could injure themselves
more expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
   The low box that we built is, or at least should be, 8 feet
long, 4 feet wide and 10 inches high. We made it out of
three-quarter-inch-thick pressure-treated plywood that, in case you
haven't bought any recently, is alarmingly expensive, more
expensive, in fact, than several of the major furniture items in my
living room.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to me that I might save a lot of money, not to
mention blood, by simply dragging the couch out into the driveway
for Michael and his skateboarding friends to jump onto and off of,
but I figured the years of accumulated dog hairs and Coke stains
might cause some traction problems not to mention complaints from
the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   We bought the blueprints for our low box from a company that
sells such things on the Internet. I did not think the $9.99 price
was horribly outrageous (compared to the price of the plywood, at
least) until I learned, at the end of my order, that the company
required a minimum purchase of $10, thereby requiring me to buy
another set of $9.99 blueprints to make up the penny difference.
And yet some people wonder why there were riots at the Woodstock
concert, where water was selling for $4 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the blueprint was clear and easy to read, the kind
of blueprint an 8-year-old could follow without any difficulty.
Unfortunately, we didn't have any 8-year-olds handy, which meant
that I had to decipher the blueprints myself, resulting in a sawing
error that came within a half-inch of costing me a $38 piece of
plywood. (Michael has insisted that I report that it was he who
discovered my mistake in the nick of time, which I will be glad to
do if and when he cleans his room.)
</P>
<P>
   Before we began our low-box project, I never really understood
what this ``bonding'' business was all about. But looking back, it
seems to have something to do with squatting together for hours at
a time in the hot sun, driving in numberless screws with a cordless
drill that poops out and needs recharging about every 15 minutes,
drinking lots of Cokes and competing with each other to see who can
burp the loudest.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodletting was confined to a small cut on the back of my
hand (no emergency-room trip necessary) and the effects of the
squatting dissipated over the course of a few short weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The box itself looks a lot like, well, a box, only lower.
Michael and his friends spend hours on it, working on tricks that
have names like ollie and nose slide and half-cab and 50-50. White
with spray-painted green graffiti, it is a nice addition to the
driveway decor.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if it had cushions, I'd consider moving it to the
living room.

SOTHEBY'S HOPES TO SELL A $500,000 MOTORCYCLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Italy, Brazil, Ill.)   By JIM McCRAW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sotheby's, the auction house known for selling objets d'art,
plans a sale of high-performance and vintage motorcycles, its first
in North America, on Sept. 13 in Chicago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's Chicago showroom will feature about 100 motorcycles
from around the world, as well as 150 antique and vintage bicycles
and related memorabilia. The sale will be led by a number of
Italian-made Ducati motorcycles, including some famous racing
machines, street bikes, racing memorabilia, parts and champions'
racing leathers. Items will be exhibited on Monday through Thursday
the week of the auction.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sirolli, director of Sotheby's Chicago, said: ``You're no
longer dealing with the same crowd of people who for years traded
bikes at swap meets and bought them from garages. You now have Wall
Street execs and traders all of whom are very into motorcycles _
extraordinary toys for big boys, to some extent.'' Sirolli likens
Ducati design to Italian Futurist works by Giacomo Balla, Umberto
Boccioni and Gino Severini, for their movement and mechanical
flavor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The piece de resistance of the Sotheby's sale will be a
one-of-a-kind Ducati MH900e, a bike designed by Pierre Terblanche
to recall the 1978 Ducati F1 ridden to victory at the Isle of Man
TT races in 1978 by Mike Hailwood, the British world champion.
Sirolli says there is no precedent for the sale of such a
motorcycle; he expects a serious collector to bid at least
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Second only to the MH900e in collector interest and value will
be the Ducati 996 factory racer ridden to the 1998 Superbike world
championship by Carl Fogarty, the British three-time Superbike
champion. Sotheby's has estimated the selling price of this bike at
$180,000 to $200,000 because of its racing record and 200 mph
performance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty's personal Ducati, a 1998 Monster 600 with a shark paint
job, is also offered, with an estimate or $15,000 to $22,000, along
with a Ducati 900 Super Sport Final Edition, at $12,000 to $15,000,
and a 1997 Ducati Senna 916, a special model dedicated to the late
Ayrton Senna, the Formula One world champion from Brazil, which is
expected to fetch $22,000-$28,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ducatis, motorcycles from the collection of the
late Frederick G. Wacker will be offered. These include a 1922
Ricardo Triumph 550, a 1950 Vincent 1000 Custom and a 1924
Harley-Davidson JD. &QL;

   Each year, I take my oldest child on a vacation where it's just
the two of us. When he was younger, I'd do this to reconnect with
him, since he has always been a ``daddy's boy.'' Then, after his
little sister came along, it became even more important for us to
find some quiet time to share.

   We've done the Orlando theme parks and a week at the beach with
friends. We've flown to West Virginia to visit family, and stayed
in a hotel in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   This year, we're going west. My best friend has moved to
Monterey, Calif., with its piers and seals and lighthouses, and my
mother-in-law is just up the coast on an island near Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Our goal is to make it to the top of the Space Needle. ``Wow,
it's the FUTURE!'' Adam said, when I showed him a picture of the
Seattle skyline at night.
</P>
<P>
   But as our departure got closer, I started feeling a bit uneasy
about leaving my 3-year-old for a week. ``She's going to be really
mad at me,'' I told my husband. ``I bet she won't talk to me for
days when we get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, I found the book, ``Working Parents, Happy Kids:
Strategies for Staying Connected'' by Pati Crofut and Joanna Knapp
(Turnagain Press, 1999, $15). While their tips are intended for
parents on business trips, I found that they apply equally well to
vacations where kids are left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be in two places at once, but your love can,''
assure the authors in the introduction.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they remind us, ``When you leave your children, it
often seems to them as if you disappear into a black hole only to
be deposited back at your home hours or days later.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiny imaginations kick into hyperdrive.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to handle this, say Crofut and Knapp, is to be
clear about where you're going, when you're coming home and who
will take care of them while you're gone.
</P>
<P>
   Young children, especially, need to be prepared for your
departure so it doesn't catch them by surprise. A two- or three-day
notice is fine, say the authors, who call it the ``pre-trip
countdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Letting your child help you pack, or sticking little surprise
notes in your suitcase, are ways of getting them involved and
building the ``line of communication'' you want to have established
for the trip. You might pick out a ``remembrance'' of you they can
keep until your return ... an article of clothing you wear a lot, a
photo of you together. Show your child that you will also be taking
a picture of them along to display in your hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Say goodbye and let them see you walk out the door. Don't sneak
out or leave quietly. That's not fair to the child, even if it
works better for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   While you're gone, the adult at home can track your journey with
the child on a map _ a personal version of ``Where in the World is
Carmen San Diego?'' They also may want to check the newspaper to
see what the weather is where you are. This helps kids learn states
and cities, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, leave a grab bag of things for the stay-at-home child,
such as special bedtime stories you've written to be read to them,
or a cassette tape with you singing some of your favorite bedtime
songs, or reading a familiar storybook they can follow along in.
</P>
<P>
   The authors even include a script for an ``interactive'' video
you can make, where you go through the bedtime routine with the
child, reminding them to get on their pajamas and brush their
teeth, asking questions and reading a story.
</P>
<P>
   So, while I'm tucking Adam's swim trunks and travel diary into
his backpack, I'm also packing a bag for Sarah, filled with
reminders of her brother and me. The separation, I hope, will now
be easier on us both.

AUTO SAFETY: A FATAL CRASH'S REPERCUSSIONS, 100 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a season of anniversaries _ 30 years since the first moon
landing, 25 since Nixon resigned _ Heward Grafftey is pitching one
more. He says that September is the centennial of the first
recorded auto fatality.
</P>
<P>
   If he is correct, the accident would seem to have begun a New
York City trend: The victim was a pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
   The death occurred in Manhattan on Sept. 13, 1899, at Central
Park West and 74th Street. According to an article on the front
page of The New York Times the next day, the victim was H.H. Bliss,
``a real estate dealer.'' He was ``alighting from a southbound
Eighth Avenue trolley car when he was knocked down and run over by
an automobile in charge of Arthur Smith of 153 West 62d Street.''
Smith told police that he had to pass close to the trolley because
a truck was in the way _ a situation that sounds quite plausible
today. The passenger in the car was a doctor returning from a house
call, which no longer seems so likely.
</P>
<P>
   The car, the article noted, was electric. The Times detailed
Bliss' injuries in somewhat greater detail than is now customary.
Smith was arrested, but a search of the following days' papers did
not turn up a disposition to the case. His passenger, Dr. David Orr
Edson, son of a former New York City mayor, provided medical
attention at the scene, but Bliss died later at Roosevelt Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Grafftey, a former member of the Canadian Parliament, said that
a daughter of his secretary, a neighbor and an executive assistant
while he served in the House of Commons had all died in traffic
crashes. He is now president of Safety Sense Institute, a nonprofit
organization Orleans, Ontario, that promotes traffic safety.
</P>
<P>
   Grafftey figures that Bliss was the first of about 30 million
auto fatalities worldwide. He came to New York in 1969 to
commemorate the death, and again in 1989, when two of Bliss' great
grand-daughters attended a ceremony at the site.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Grafftey has organized a ceremony that is to include
the unveiling of a plaque and a speech on auto safety by Rep.
Thomas Petri, R-Wis., chairman of the surface transportation
subcommittee of the House Transportation Committee. Six of Bliss'
descendants are expected at the ceremony, at 10:45 a.m. on Sept. 13
at the site of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   In a century, Grafftey said in a telephone interview, ``We have
doubled life span because of improved health care, but this
man-made epidemic has crept up on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss is not exactly a cult figure, but he does have a
following. In 1991, Ralph Nader presented an H.H. Bliss Award to 11
inventors who helped to develop the air bag.

<P>
   Differing on Car-Truck Deaths  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trucking industry is promoting a new study by the Office of
Motor Carrier and Highway Safety, which regulates heavy trucks,
finding that in truck-car crashes in which someone died, the car
driver's behavior often contributed to the collision.
</P>
<P>
   Trucking opponents cite another recent study, by the General
Accounting Office, that found the Office of Motor Carriers was not
very good at gathering statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The OMC study looked at 8,300 crashes involving one large truck
and one passenger vehicle (a car, van, pickup or sport utility
vehicle) from 1994 through 1996. There are about 2,700 crashes a
year between a single truck and a single passenger vehicle in which
someone dies.
</P>
<P>
   In head-on crashes, the passenger vehicle crossed the double
yellow line 89 percent of the time, and the truck 11 percent, the
study found. In sideswipe crashes in which the truck and passenger
vehicle were moving in opposite directions, the passenger vehicle
hit the truck in 88 percent of the cases. When the two vehicles
were moving in the same direction, the passenger vehicle hit the
truck 72 percent of the time. And in rear-end crashes, 80 percent
of the time it was the passenger vehicle that rear-ended the truck.
</P>
<P>
   The study said that in 71 percent of the crashes, the police
found ``one or more errors or other factors related to the driver's
behavior'' for the passenger vehicle driver, but none for the truck
driver.
</P>
<P>
   This last statistic infuriates those who lobby for tighter
control of trucks. ``The trucking industry has been trying for
years to place most of the blame for accidents on car drivers, and
it's patently false,'' said Michael Scippa, a spokesman for
Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways, or Crash. The reason for
the statistic, he said, is that in 98 percent of the cases in which
one driver dies, it is the person at the wheel of the car, not the
truck. ``The reports are written based on the truck driver's
recollections,'' Scippa said. ``Dead men tell no tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lobbyist for tighter restrictions on trucks, Dr. Gerald
Donaldson of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, said that
assignment of factors ``isn't adjudicated fault assignment, but
subjective work by police officers who may have only one live
driver to talk to, the one from the truck.''
</P>
<P>
   But the OMC found that in 15 percent of the crashes, both
drivers survived. And in those, investigators cited the car
driver's behavior 73 percent of the time, compared with 34 percent
for the truck drivers. Donaldson said that when analysts pared
their sample size, eliminating all but the biggest trucks, and
cases in which more than one truck or car was involved, the
remaining 500 cases were too few to allow meaningful conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   In the fatal crashes, the OMC said that physical evidence showed
that for sideswipes and head-on or rear-end crashes, physical
evidence, rather than recollections, established the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But the GAO told Congress in March that the Office of Motor
Carriers had problems collecting data. One is that its analysis is
not based on thorough investigation at the crash scene. Another is
that the office itself estimates that it never gets reports on
about 38 percent of all crashes, and 30 percent of all fatal
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The office uses the crash data in part to focus on trucking
companies that have more than their share of crashes. But the GAO
said that 10 states reported fewer than half the fatal crashes
occurring within their borders, and 4 states reported fewer than 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the crashes that were not reported
differed systematically from those that were reported and analyzed.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Another in a series of weak cold fronts will sweep southeast
from the Great Lakes into the Northeast. A few thundershowers will
dampen the hilly terrain of New England, but most coastal sections
should stay dry with ample sunshine and afternoon cumulus clouds.
The boundary between warm and somewhat humid air over the Ohio
Valley and a crisp air mass across the northern Great Lakes will
produce a few clouds but no rain across Michigan and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   A high-pressure system in Kentucky will circulate very warm and
moderately humid air across the Middle Atlantic region. The South
will stay sultry with morning sunshine, yielding to a patchwork of
afternoon cumulus clouds, a few of which will grow into
thunderstorms, especially over Florida and along the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A disturbance over the Rockies, which produced an all-time
24-hour rainfall record of 4.21 inches in Colorado Springs on
Wednesday, will begin to move over the Plains. As a result, a
cluster of thunderstorms will migrate into Nebraska and Kansas.
Flash flooding is possible in a few sections. Thundershowers
associated with the monsoon circulation of tropical moisture over
New Mexico and Colorado will persist. More showers will dampen
eastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The weather will turn dull and damp across much of the Pacific
Northwest as a disturbance moves onshore across Oregon.
Thunderstorms will erupt over the Sierra, but sunshine will return
to much of Nevada and Utah. Coastal clouds will linger in
California as onshore winds strengthen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Drizzle Storm
</P>
<P>
   A storm of tiny drizzle drops produced 0.07 inches of
precipitation at Eureka, Calif., on Wednesday, breaking the town's
record rainfall for the date. Actually, drizzle is not light rain.
The diameter of a drizzle drop ranges from about 0.01 inches to
approximately 0.02 inches. Any drop with larger diameter is
considered to be a raindrop, while any drop with a smaller diameter
qualifies as a cloud droplet. That drizzle broke a rainfall record
at Eureka in August is not meteorological heresy. Most August days
are dry, with the average monthly rainfall only about a quarter of
an inch.

   &LR; Whatever moved the action along in a film was called a McGuffin
by Hitchcock. But what's a McGuffin? Here's Hitchcock's
explanation:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called the McGuffin because ... the story goes that two
men are in the train. And one sitting across from the other says,
`Excuse me sir, what is that strange-looking package above your
head?'''
</P>
<P>
   And the other man says, `Oh, that's a McGuffin.'
</P>
<P>
   And the first one asks, `What's it for?'
</P>
<P>
   `Well,' the other man says, `it's for tracking lions in the
Scottish Highlands.'
</P>
<P>
   And the first man says, `But there are no lions in the Scottish
Highlands.'
</P>
<P>
   And the other man says, `Well then, that's no McGuffin!'
</P>
<P>
   ``The McGuffin is nothing, really. It's like a painter, worrying
whether the apples in the painting are sweet or sour. Who cares?
It's his style, his manner of painting. That's where the emotion
comes from. It's for the artist to interpret in his own way and
thus create an emotion. Literature can do it by the way the words
are put together, but sometimes you find that a film is looked at
solely for its content _ without any regard for the style or manner
in which the story is told. And basically that is the art of the
cinema.'' &QL;

   DEMS-RACE _ CHICAGO_In their bids for the Democratic nomination,
Bill Bradley and Vice President Gore have been reaching out to
minority voters, a key voting block in the Democratic primary.
Despite Bradley's long record of speaking out on racial issues,
most analysts say that Gore holds the edge, benefiting in part from
the strong support black voters give President Clinton. They note
that Gore is strongest in the South, where most black voters live,
and that Bradley hasn't made a serious attempt to build grassroots
support in the region. Bradley attempts to make inroads among black
voters with a speech to the Rainbow Coalition's annual meeting
Thursday. Tipper Gore will speak later in the day and the vice
president will deliver a key note address Saturday. (Foskett,

 &HT;    Jenkins inspires with stories of `the Rapture'
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a counselor at a Christian camp, Jerry Jenkins
relished opportunities to entertain and inspire his young minions
with stories of ``the Rapture,'' the time, many Christians believe,
when the faithful will be called into heaven leaving those on Earth
to deal with the end-times.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jenkins, 49, is co-author of a series of novels that has
enthralled the reading public with that same story, embellished and
updated.
</P>
<P>
   The series started in 1995 with ``Left Behind,'' which opened
with Capt. Rayford Steele flying a 747 across the Atlantic when
more than 100 of his passengers disappeared _ as, he learned later,
did his wife and son. In fact, millions of people all over the
globe vanished. Steele, his daughter and Buck Williams, a senior
writer for a newsmagazine, are Left Behind.
</P>
<P>
   This week, book six in the series, ``Assassins,'' hit bookstores
with an advance printing of 850,000 copies. ``Left Behind'' sales
are nearing 2 million, and ``Tribulation Force'' (1996) and
``Nicolae'' (1997) have each topped 1 million in sales. ``Soul
Harvest'' (1998) is a few sales shy of a million; ``Apollyon''
(1999) has sold more than 850,000. There are also ``Left Behind''
books for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apollyon'' hit both The New York Times and the Publishers
Weekly list of best sellers for the general market. ``That's
unprecedented for a Christian novel,'' said Lynn Garrett, religion
editor of Publishers Weekly, a book industry trade magazine.
Garrett attributes the accomplishment to the success of the
previous books and to savvy marketing by publisher Tyndale House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the books have had appeal beyond the usual
audience,'' said Garrett. ``They're being read by people who aren't
evangelical Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins will be in metro Atlanta today and Saturday for signings
at two bookstores, one Christian, one secular.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Brown, a community relations manager for Barnes &AMP; Noble in
Morrow, said the store invited the author because ``these are
enormously popular books. We're excited about his coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown read ``Left Behind'' in preparation for Jenkins' visit and
said she will probably read more. ``You get hooked on the series,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Store manager Emily Gulledge, 46, got hooked and read them all.
``Even if they didn't have the religious content, they would be
interesting books,'' said Gulledge, who says she was raised
Southern Baptist and has attended several different kinds of
churches.

   ``Me and my wife fight over who's going to read them first,''
said aircraft mechanic Bob Brown, 41, who lives in Milner and
attends Fairview Baptist Church in Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   For Jenkins, successful books are nothing new. He's written more
than 130 volumes, including co-authoring memoirs for Billy Graham,
Nolan Ryan and Orel Hershiser. His ``'Twas the Night Before,'' a
secular Christmas novel from Viking, has been sold to CBS for a
movie next year and he has a new Christian novel, ``Though None Go
With Me,'' due out from Zondervan in January. For readers who want
to keep up with it all, he also has a website:
www.jerryjenkins.com.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Left Behind'' books are the result of a match made by a
literary agent, Rick Christian of Alive Communications. Co-author
Tim LaHaye, a Bible prophecy expert, author of several non-fiction
Christian books, and part of a power evangelical partnership with
wife Beverly, founder of Concerned Women For America, had an idea:
a modern-day account of the events of the book of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that appealed to me about the project is that Tim
didn't want to ... help write it,'' said Jenkins. ``He provides the
prophetic chart and sequence of events. He serves as the expert on
prophecy. And he's proven to be a great cheerleader.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, who was born and raised in a Christian home in
Kalamazoo, Mich., and spent his teenage years in Chicago, said he
``had always believed the way LaHaye did, although I wouldn't have
been able to justify it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said he felt good about the first ``Left Behind'' book
and thought it might sell as many as 200,000 copies. ``I didn't
tell too many people that,'' he said. ``It doesn't sound good to
predict.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the phenomenal sales of ``Left Behind'' and its sequels,
Jenkins says, ``It's just crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to what he attributes the success, Jenkins answers, ``The
great writing,'' but quickly adds, ``no, I'm just kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dr. LaHaye has it right,'' Jenkins said. ``Revelation
is so difficult to understand that by fictionalizing it, people are
fascinated. I think that's part of it. I think there's also a
general hunger for spiritual things in the market place. Look at
'Celestine Prophecy' and other New Age-type things. People seem to
be drawn to those. We feel like we get a chance to throw our answer
into the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he and LaHaye are splitting millions in royalities,
``my life really hasn't changed much materially,'' said Jenkins,
who lives in Colorado Springs. ``I was raised in a tradition where
you're not comfortable with great amounts of income. We look for
places to use it for good because the Bible sort of teaches that
wealth can be a dangerous thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is a bit uncomfortable with the financial riches the books
have brought, he thoroughly enjoys the visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never seen people read my books on airplanes before,'' he
said. And as for book signings and public appearances, ``I really
love that part of it,'' he said. ``Writing is such a solitary
profession, I think it's good to get out and meet people. I've had
my share of those autograph parties where three people show up and
two of them are relatives. I kind of enjoy the crowds.''

 &HT;    ASO appreciates Levi with Beethoven concerts
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra has announced a
seven-concert Beethoven Festival for June 2000, to be conducted by
music director Yoel Levi as the final programs of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The concerts, called by the ASO ``A Celebration and Appreciation
of Yoel Levi,'' are offered to ``underscore the gratitude felt by
the entire Atlanta Symphony family'' for Levi's 12-year
directorship, according to ASO board chairman A.D. Frazier Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the greatest musical challenges imaginable, and
I had been thinking about doing it for some time,'' Levi said
Wednesday. ``It is rarely done, to perform all of Beethoven's
symphonies and concertos in one shot, which makes it a truly
special cultural event for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But Levi declined comment on the ASO's official gesture of
farewell, according to ASO spokesman Charlie Wade.
</P>
<P>
   Levi said in an interview Wednesday that he had been given a
printer's proof of the planned summer brochure during a rehearsal
break the previous day and had not had time to read it. Nor would
he discuss anything more about it until after this weekend's
performances of ``The Abduction From the Seraglio.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for June 9-24 in Symphony Hall, the Beethoven concerts
will feature the nine symphonies, the five piano concertos with
Argentine pianist Bruno Leonardo Gelber, the triple concerto (for
violin, cello and piano) with the Eroica Trio and the violin
concerto with ASO concertmaster Cecylia Arzewski. All except the
trio are old friends and musical colleagues of Levi.
</P>
<P>
   The final concert will include the ``Choral Fantasy,'' with
Gelber playing the piano solo, and the ``Choral'' Symphony No. 9,
both to be sung by the ASO Chorus. Vocal soloists for this program
have yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   The ASO describes the Beethoven concerts as ``a tribute ... to
culminate (the ASO's) season-long salute to esteemed music director
Yoel Levi.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement incorporates a summation of his accomplishments
with the ASO, including:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The 1991 European tour, which received excellent critical
notices.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  28 recordings, including the first four increments of a Mahler
symphony cycle. Next season's performances of the Symphonies Nos. 1
and 2 will be recorded by Telarc International to continue the
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A Grammy Award nomination for ``The Planets,'' the first ASO
recording not conducted by the late Robert Shaw to be nominated.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ASO's performance at the opening ceremonies of the 1996
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ASO's nomination as ``Orchestra of the Year'' (1991-92)
for the first annual International Classical Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to the Beethoven concerts are $25, on sale today through
the ASO season ticket office. Those who buy four tickets will
receive one free. Ticket information: 404-733-4800 or
www.atlantasymphony.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In other ASO news, soloists for the master season finale
program of Mahler's Symphony No. 2 (''Resurrection'') in May will
be Margaret Lloyd, soprano, and Mary Phillips, mezzo.
</P>
<P>
   The ASO's New Year's Eve concert will be led by guest conductor
Robert Spano instead of Levi. Tickets for the New Year's Eve
dinner/concert package are $40-$90.

<P>
   Sotheby's, the auction house known for selling objets d'art,
plans a sale of high-performance and vintage motorcycles, its first
in North America, on Sept. 13 in Chicago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's Chicago showroom will feature about 100 motorcycles
from around the world, as well as 150 antique and vintage bicycles
and related memorabilia. The sale will be led by a number of
Italian-made Ducati motorcycles, including some famous racing
machines, street bikes, racing memorabilia, parts and champions'
racing leathers. Items will be exhibited on Monday through Thursday
the week of the auction.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sirolli, director of Sotheby's Chicago, said: ``You're no
longer dealing with the same crowd of people who for years traded
bikes at swap meets and bought them from garages. You now have Wall
Street execs and traders all of whom are very into motorcycles _
extraordinary toys for big boys, to some extent.'' Sirolli likens
Ducati design to Italian Futurist works by Giacomo Balla, Umberto
Boccioni and Gino Severini, for their movement and mechanical
flavor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The piece de resistance of the Sotheby's sale will be a
one-of-a-kind Ducati MH900e, a bike designed by Pierre Terblanche
to recall the 1978 Ducati F1 ridden to victory at the Isle of Man
TT races in 1978 by Mike Hailwood, the British world champion.
Sirolli says there is no precedent for the sale of such a
motorcycle; he expects a serious collector to bid at least
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Second only to the MH900e in collector interest and value will
be the Ducati 996 factory racer ridden to the 1998 Superbike world
championship by Carl Fogarty, the British three-time Superbike
champion. Sotheby's has estimated the selling price of this bike at
$180,000 to $200,000 because of its racing record and 200 mph
performance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty's personal Ducati, a 1998 Monster 600 with a shark paint
job, is also offered, with an estimate or $15,000 to $22,000, along
with a Ducati 900 Super Sport Final Edition, at $12,000 to $15,000,
and a 1997 Ducati Senna 916, a special model dedicated to the late
Ayrton Senna, the Formula One world champion from Brazil, which is
expected to fetch $22,000-$28,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ducatis, motorcycles from the collection of the
late Frederick G. Wacker will be offered. These include a 1922
Ricardo Triumph 550, a 1950 Vincent 1000 Custom and a 1924
Harley-Davidson JD. &QL;

HILLARY CLINTON SAYS RESCUING TROUBLED YOUTH HELPS THE NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 and DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TONAWANDA, N.Y. _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton urged
Americans Thursday to tune out violent television programs and join
a crusade to help troubled young people become productive,
taxpaying adults who can help underwrite the retirement of baby
boomers.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, after hearing nightmarish stories of inner-city
life in nearby Buffalo, appealed to the self-interest of the
American middle class in hopes of rescuing gang members or other
alienated young people.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing her exploration for a possible Senate campaign in New
York, the first lady issued an impassioned plea for parents to
protect their children from the ``overwhelming amount of violence
and mayhem'' in some television programming. She urged parents to
use the technical device called a ``V-chip'' to block violent
programing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot give our children their childhoods back if we throw
them into a situation that you would not let (come) into your
house,'' Clinton said, her voice rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody knocked on the door, and said, `Let me come in,
yell and scream and swear and carry on, and use an assault weapon
in front of your child,' you'd say, `You're crazy,' and you'd call
the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton said Americans ``invite those people into our living
rooms'' every day through the television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, be the bad guy on the block and maybe you'll set an
example for the rest of the parents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady told an audience invited for a round-table
discussion at an elementary school in suburban Buffalo that the
nation cannot afford to lose a single potentially productive worker
in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Within 15 years there will be only two employed workers paying
into the Social Security system for ever one of the 76 million baby
boomers who begin to retire in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now every time I'm in a group of young people, I'm trying to
figure out which are my two because I want to make sure that my two
are going to be productive working citizens to support the whole
system as the rest of us get older,'' said Clinton, 51.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said her outlook is ``a way that all of us ought to be
thinking because there really isn't anybody else's kids that we can
waste, that we can walk away from.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also expressed her ``great disappointment'' with
the Republican-led Congress for ``its lack of action'' on ``common
sense'' gun safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that guns play a very important role in the level of
violence and fear in our communities _ and unfortunately in our
schools,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton heard vivid accounts of inner city strife from teachers
and students with experience in the tough neighborhoods of Buffalo,
a city of 311,000 people less than 10 miles to the south of
Tonawanda.
</P>
<P>
   Although the discussion took place in a middle-class suburb,
Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said the first lady planned to
visit inner-city neighborhoods later in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Schuta, a curriculum specialist at an inner-city school
in West Buffalo, recounted a second-grade girl arriving at school
one morning to tell the authorities to call the police because her
father had broken both of her mother's arms and torn the phone from
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Schuta also introduced the first lady to one of her students,
whose father is in prison for murder. Schuta drove the young
student home from school one afternoon to see gunplay under way in
the boy's neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural part of David's life,'' Schuta said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomeka Sanders, a high school senior in East Buffalo, told
Clinton how hard it is for teen-agers to turn aside the allure of
gangs or temptations to fight at an inner-city school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really easy to be bad. If I wanted to get a gun, I could
get a gun right now,'' she said. ``It's not considered cool to be
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady told her, ``If you can give young people a good
gang _ a theater group, a team, a band to be part of _ they'll join
a good gang 99 times out of 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Bill Conway, a 21-year veteran on the New York State
Police, recalled a 10-year-old girl approaching him in a Buffalo
school not long ago to alert him that her uncle had been molesting
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a police officer in the building that they know that
they could come to is an asset,'' Conway said. Clinton endorsed
setting up ways for students to tip the authorities, either through
suggestion boxes or secure telephone hot lines.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton referred to the killings at Columbine High School in
Colorado, where two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher
before committing suicide, and at two brokerage houses in Atlanta,
where a frustrated stock trader killed nine people and wounded 13
others before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The two episodes underscore that ``no criminal deterrent can
stop someone who is both homicidal and suicidal,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke before she learned about the latest multiple killing
in Pelham, Ala., were the police said three people were shot dead
at two businesses. The suspected gunman was in police custody.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Washington, a prominent Republican defended the
first lady and her interview with Talk magazine in which she
discussed her husband's infidelity and attributed it to troubles in
his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican presidential contender
until he dropped out of the race last month, said he didn't think
Hillary Clinton was making excuses for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what she was saying is `I hate what the president did.
My take is he did it for these reasons. I don't think he did it
because he's a bad guy. I think he did it because he's got these
problems that he hasn't fixed.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a tragic thing for this woman,'' Kasich said.

   The matte-blue towers stretch so high they appear to be a danger
to passenger plane traffic. The overambitious set design is a
winning joke. However, between the overly elaborate sets and the
wide-angle, deep-focus shots used by director Kinka Usher _ the guy
behind ``Got Milk'' and ``Yo quiero Taco Bell'' ads _ ``Mystery
Men'' eclipses ``Armageddon'' as the most determinedly busy visual
spectacle of the decade. Half the time, there's so much going on
that you're not sure where to look.
</P>
<P>
   An unfortunate situation, because ``Mystery Men'' is an idea
whose time has come, a parody of superheroes with a hard-working
group of actor-comedians as its stars. Ben Stiller is Mr. Furious,
a runt dressed in rough-trade leather motorcycle gear who can
become a ``ball of rage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shoveler (William H. Macy) is the calm yin to Mr. Furious'
yang, wearing his little boy's catcher's vest and wielding a
shovel. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), with his fruity fake British
accent and lack of blue in his costume, flings silverware, ``but no
knives.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the least lethal superheroes in memory _ and the least
powerful _ this core of the Mystery Men is a pathetic version of
the Justice League of America. They labor in the shadow of Champion
City superhero, and super sellout, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear),
whose jumpsuit sports more logos than the entire pack at the Indy
500. When the smirking Captain Amazing is dispatched by
superannuated disco villain Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush),
Champion City has no choice but to turn to the jealous Mystery Men.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, the Men force themselves on the city. They shore up
their numbers with the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the most
dangerous one of the bunch _ she hurls a bowling ball possessed
with the spirit of her father. At least, she talks to him through
it all the time, anyway. Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell, of
Nickelodeon's ``Kenan and Kel,'' reprising the happy-go-lucky
earnestness of his ``Good Burger'' character without the surfer's
accent) can maybe turn invisible, but only if no one is looking.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there are those who think the Spleen (Paul Reubens) is the
most dangerous. It appears at first his power is his warty, pasty
bad skin. Until he lets loose his explosive flatulence, which sends
good and evil alike to their knees in tears. The Sphinx (Wes Studi)
has a moldy aphorism for every situation, when he isn't
mysteriously carving guns in half _ maybe his real power is to bore
men's minds.
</P>
<P>
   The director is so busy finding God in the details that the
actors are left on their own. Reubens noted that the cast was an
able collection of writers on their own, and Usher was smart enough
to stay out of their way. Which leaves the movie without a unifying
narrative. The funny moments dissipate because the movie's all over
the place.
</P>
<P>
   The actors, whose chic makes the movie look as if it were cast
out of an issue of Details magazine, are battling with the costumes
and set design. Tom Waits shows up as a weapons inventor who
cruises rest homes for dates. And there are turns by the Fugees'
Pras, British comedian Eddie Izzard (who maybe one day will not
have to wear a '70s retro wardrobe in a movie), and the Goodie Mob
(playing villains called the Not So Goodie Mob). The schism makes
``Mystery Men'' more facetious than funny.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the movie's central idea, squabbling second-raters who
have to get past their neuroses to do some good, is worthwhile.
Surprisingly, creator Burden's concept remains intact. (Don't
worry, ``Flaming Carrot'' fans. The rights to Burden's original
creation _ the Mystery Men were secondary characters in the
Carrot's book _ were secured by other producers, so don't think he
wasn't good enough for this movie.)
</P>
<P>
   The film lacks Burden's wormy, depressed surrealism. Burden's
heroes would be more at home in a trailer park eaten away by weeds,
not this steroided world of the future. Instead of being close to
Burden's world in that way _ he made an eccentric mess _ the movie
of ``Mystery Men'' is an ecstatic mess.

   UNDATED _ It may be the season of the witch, the ``Blair Witch''
that is, but Hollywood still has a few spooky tricks up its sleeve.
Take ``The Sixth Sense.'' On the surface, it's a bloated, plodding
psychological drama that doesn't get warmed up until it's almost
halfway over. But for the patient viewer, there are some genuine
chills, intense performances and one of the best

NEBRASKA IS GOVERNED DIFFERENTLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Nebraska has a different form of state
government. Can you explain this?
</P>
<P>
   _S.W., Granbury, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Nebraska is the only state that has a unicameral legislature.
Legislators are elected to a State Senate _ commonly known as ``the
Unicameral'' _ rather than a house and senate in bicameral
governments such as Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The state's unicameral system was approved in 1934, cutting the
number of elected legislators from 133 to 43 and reducing the cost
of funding a session of the legislature in half.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference unique to Nebraska is its nonpartisan
election. Legislative candidates are listed on the ballot without
identifying their party affiliation, and the top two vote-getters
in the primary face off in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska Unicameral Web site at www.unicam.state.ne.us
includes a complete history of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to make a report on a tax charged by a Saginaw, Texas,
grocery store. What's the 800 number that used to be Bob Bullock's
office?
</P>
<P>
   _ U.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: To report a possible violation of the state's sales tax laws,
call the Comptroller of Public Accounts at (800) 252-5555.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller monitors state sales tax collection, auditing
businesses at least once every four years. The basic sales tax rate
is 6.25 percent, though city, county and special districts can
increase the rate up to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A sales tax holiday on most clothing and footwear priced under
$100 will be Aug. 6-8. The purchase of any qualifying item will not
include a state or local sales tax. The main items that are not
exempt from tax during the holiday are clothing and footwear used
primarily as protective wear or for athletic activities.
</P>
<P>
   The event, scheduled to occur the first Friday, Saturday and
Sunday of each August, is expected to reduce this year's sales tax
collections by $84.7 million, state Comptroller Carole Keeton
Rylander predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm unable to find the TV show ``Judge Wapner's Animal
Court'' in my TV guide. When and where does it air?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.H., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Animal Court'' airs three times a day during the week on
the cable channel Animal Planet.
</P>
<P>
   The show premiered in September 1998 and features small-claims
cases involving animals. Rusty Burrell, Judge Joseph Wapner's
bailiff on ``People's Court,'' has the same position on the new
program.
</P>
<P>
   Wapner, 79, is a former Los Angeles Superior Court judge whose
TV jurisprudence career began with ``People's Court'' in 1981.

GROUP EXAMINES POPULAR CULTURE TO DETERMINE WHAT PEOPLE WANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do people want?
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the burning question in business today. Never
before have companies been so eager to zero in on the products and
services that people need and desire.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many are beginning to realize that answering that
question correctly can lead to unparalleled success. Missing the
boat, or even worse, not paying attention to the customers, can
lead to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   All that makes companies such as Iconoculture even more
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   This interesting group of marketers lists its offices as
``somewhere between cyberspace and a Starbucks in Minneapolis.''
Their focus is popular culture, specifically American, and their
methodology involves traveling cross-country by car, browsing the
Web, reading everything in sight and ``relentless'' channel surfing
on television.
</P>
<P>
   Then the group members _ Mary Meehan, Larry Samuel and Vickie
Abrahamson _ get together to ``make sense out of the cultural
chaos, make key connections, and discuss the implications for
individuals and marketers.''
</P>
<P>
   Iconoculture's clients include the likes of General Mills,
Wendy's and Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't afford to hire this group, you certainly can afford
its book, which is out in paperback. It's called ``The Future Ain't
What It Used to Be: The 40 Cultural Trends Transforming Your Job,
Your Life, Your World'' (Burkley Publishing Group, 270 pages
$14.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``These forty cultural trends are literal signs of the times,
guideposts that point the way for you to proactively manage your
future,'' they write. ``Think of signs as territories to stake with
your career, business or brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider their take on ``zentrepreneurism,'' businesses out to
make a positive social change as well as some monetary change. The
Iconoculture group calls it ``the fusion of one's personal vision
with one's professional mission, grounded in activism and holistic
philosophy,'' adding that this trend will be the hallmark of the
next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The group provides numerous examples of zentrepreneurism from
New York City's ``Street News,'' a newspaper for homeless vendors
to sell so they can get back on their feet, to Aveda's lipstick,
which is made in cooperation with an Amazon Indian tribe that
benefits from sales of the makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Investing, trade, even transportation (Greyhound offers free
rides for runaways returning home) are cashing in on doing good.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that ethnic is in, but did you know that in the
1980s, more immigrants came into this country than in any other
decade in American history _ about 10 million? Or that more than 80
percent of them were Latin American or Asian and that 75 percent of
them came to just six states, including Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Such a trend affects everything from food and beverages to
tourism to fitness to education. Diversity will be the name of the
game in virtually every product and service seeking success in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   Along with all that diversity, however, is another strong trend
toward ``beehiving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you look and with whom you share physical, emotional,
educational, and spiritual hallelujahs and high-fives will not
necessarily be the traditional venues of home, neighborhood, work
and Main Street,'' the group writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``New beehives of shared interests and value are buzzing on the
horizon, reshaping relationships inside and outside of the
honeycomb.''
</P>
<P>
   That trend is being adopted in branding (Saturn,
Harley-Davidson), housing (retirement communities) and technology
(chat sites, support groups). Iconoculture calls the American
Association of Retired Persons the biggest beehive of all. Watch
for it to get even more enormously powerful within the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian philosophy of chi, or tapping into your body's energy
flow for health and well-being, is taking this country by storm. So
is fingerprinting, in which each person has a personal consumer
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The trends are there, spelled out in black and white, in a
fascinating look of where society is heading, and how to cater to
it.

   ``Your Y2K Personal Protection Plan''

   The ``electronic tidal wave'' is coming, and this author
recommends having the goods and wherewithal to sustain yourself for
at least two weeks after the new century dawns. The bad news, says
Jim Hackman, who guides workshops on Y2K readiness around the
country, is that there is a good chance the telephone and electric
systems will go down at least temporarily because of the software
problem. The good news is that the banks have worked through most
of their Y2K problems, and that our home appliances should be
unaffected.

CHINA SPYING REPORT EXAMINES RENO'S ROLE IN U.S. PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A string of ``baffling decisions'' by Attorney
General Janet Reno and Justice Department officials stifled the
FBI's investigation into possible Chinese espionage and may have
prevented the agency from catching a nuclear spy, a congressional
report charged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, who wrote the report with Sen. Joe Lieberman of
Connecticut, the committee's top Democrat, said much of the blame
for the ``shockingly poor'' investigation lies with Reno who
appeared ``out of the loop'' for many important decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very troubled by the Department of Justice in this case
because it had a string of baffling decisions,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also criticized Reno, saying she should have been more
involved in the investigation, which he called a ``tragedy of
errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she had not seen the report and had no comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the FBI's espionage case against the Los Alamos
National Laboratory weapons scientist, Wen-Ho Lee, was considered
``flawed from the outset'' because authorities failed to
investigate a number of other nuclear lab workers who had access to
the W-88 information and who appeared to be security risks because
of their close associations with Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, the investigation disregarded many people
who could be guilty,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report detailed information gathered during
two closed-door hearings the committee held this spring on the
federal investigation into the possible theft of design information
on the W-88 nuclear warhead. The weapon is used in the Trident II
submarine-launched ballistic missile system carried aboard many
U.S. submarines.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's investigation eventually led to Lee, who was fired
from his top-secret job last March for minor security violations
after becoming the probe's primary suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a Taiwan-born naturalized U.S. citizen, has not been
charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report said it has no evidence that the W-88
or other nuclear weapons information had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview last Sunday, Lee categorically denied
providing nuclear secrets to China or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   However, the congressional report disclosed that Lee failed a
polygraph test in February when asked if he had passed nuclear
secrets ``to any unauthorized person.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-page report focused much of its criticism on the FBI's
unsuccessful attempts to get Justice Department approval to search
Lee's office computer.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, the FBI urged the department to request the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to issue a warrant allowing
the FBI to search Lee's office computer and to place him under
surveillance, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's told the department that Lee had ``extremely close''
contacts with Chinese scientists, had traveled often to China, had
given a Chinese scientist unclassified but weapons-related computer
codes and had contacted another U.S. scientist who was under
investigation at a separate nuclear lab.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Department officials refused to ask for a search
warrant on the ground that the FBI had ``not sufficiently
demonstrated a connection between Lee and the compromise of the
W-88 information.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, Reno was alerted to the FBI's inability to get a
search warrant, the report said. She then asked the deputy attorney
general's office to look into it but never heard back, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said it was ``unfathomable'' that the Justice
Department refused the FBI's request on such an important matter.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said it was ``remarkable'' that FBI Director Louis
Freeh ``didn't just picked up the phone and say to Reno, `Stop
treating this like it's a burglary.'''
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that the dispute between the FBI and Justice
Department likely was unnecessary because Lee had signed a privacy
waiver allowing authorities to search his computer and that his
computer, in fact, carried a ``banner'' warning that such searches
could be made.
</P>
<P>
   That the FBI was unaware of Lee's signed waiver was the result
of a series of misunderstandings between an FBI field agent and Los
Alamos officials in 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to provide accurate information to senior FBI and
Justice Department officials had ``significant implications for the
course of the Lee espionage investigation,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (entire probe) is a story of investigatory missteps,
miscommunications, misunderstandings and mistakes at all levels of
government,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators finally searched Lee's computer in March and found
he had transferred thousands of top-secret computer code files from
a highly secured computer system in Los Alamos to his unclassified
office computer that was linked to the Internet. It has not been
determined whether any of those files ever left the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was fired on March 8 for minor security violations, such as
leaving his computer unattended and not protecting papers that were
unclassified but sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that while the scientist's activities were
suspicious and deserved to be investigated, the FBI should not have
limited its probe to Lee and his wife, Sylvia, also a Los Alamos
employee.
</P>
<P>
   The report said ``key technical information'' concerning the
W-88 warhead was available at a number of other government and
military sites where workers could have stolen the data, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the start, the government excluded a whole group of
people who could be responsible ... and who could still be
operating,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   These other suspects also had access to the secret information
at Los Alamos, traveled to China, had contacts with Chinese
scientists visiting the New Mexico lab, and fit the profile that
made Lee a prime suspect, the report said. Still, they were not
investigated in any detail, although the FBI questioned some of
them earlier this year, the report said.

BUSH APPEALS TO IOWANS WITH TAX CUTS, FARM POLICY  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST DES MOINES, Iowa _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush tried to lure
traditional Republican Iowans into his presidential camp for next
week's straw poll Thursday with talk on tax cuts, preserving Social
Security and farm policy.
</P>
<P>
   In just his third visit to Iowa, the Republican front-runner
said he is taking seriously the Aug. 14 Ames straw poll and
believes it will be a show of the strength of his grass-roots
organization in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're for me, I'm honored to have you on my team,'' Bush
told about 300 people in West Des Moines. ``If you haven't made up
your mind yet, thank you for giving me a chance to share some
thoughts with you. If you're for somebody else, that's OK. Just
don't work too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has not been campaigning as hard in Iowa as most of
his Republican rivals, his staff has organized buses to bring
people from almost 110 cities to Ames and give them $25 tickets so
they can participate in the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has arranged for a slate of country and western
entertainers at his 65,000 square foot tent outside the coliseum
where the straw poll will be held, as well as appearances by former
Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach and bass fishing
professional Johnny Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been criticized for vagueness on the issues
discussed taxes and farm issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush played to his Iowa audience in saying he backs the
controversial ethanol tax credit for turning grain into
alcohol-based fuel. He also said he supports ``emergency cash
payments'' to farmers and said he wants to open European markets up
to ``biogenetically grown corn.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush restated his support for the compromise tax cut package put
together by congressional Republicans, saying the tax bill that
President Clinton has threatened to veto contains many elements he
supports, including cutting marginal tax rates, eventually
eliminating estate taxes and the so-called ``marriage penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that he wants to use part of the nation's
budget surplus to shore up Social Security for people already
committed to the system. But Bush said he wants to expand Social
Security so that part of the payroll deduction for Social Security
could go to individual savings accounts for younger people.
</P>
<P>
   The governor did not go into details on what percentage of
Social Security money &UR;  &LR; could be diverted to such accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``However much is possibly affordable,'' Bush said. ``Personal
savings accounts will make it more likely that younger contributors
to Social Security will have money available when they retire.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to appealing to traditional Iowa Republicans, Bush
met Thursday with a group of about three dozen Hispanics, almost
half of whom were employees of the University Park Holiday Inn
where he was speaking. The meeting had been described on his
schedule as a meeting with Hispanic ``leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   He came under tough questioning from the group, whose views of
Republicans had obviously been forged by anti-immigration and
anti-affirmative action policies promoted by former California Gov.
Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Bush received hearty applause from the group when he said he
opposes ``English only'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   But others said Bush's stands on using ``affirmative access'' to
replace affirmative action, on immigration and how to treat
undocumented workers already in this country were ill-defined and
left them wondering about the depth of his plea to Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's interested in getting our votes, he needs to give us
some specifics. I didn't feel he gave any specifics,'' said Sandra
Sanchez, a naturalized citizen who directs Immigrants Rights
Project of the American Friends Service Committee, a non-profit
organization that helps local Hispanic immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in his heart he is very earnest. He in his heart
really believes it is important to reach out to Hispanics,''
Sanchez said. But she added that anti-immigrant policies in
California have soured many Hispanics to Republican candidates in
general.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mike Murillo of West Des Moines praised Bush for taking
a position that could force other Republicans to start addressing
Hispanics and Hispanic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the new future and the new direction of the Republican
Party for Hispanics,'' Murillo said.

`MY LIFE SO FAR' IS A TAD ORDINARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you wanted to oversimplify things a bit, you could file
cinematic imports from the British Isles into two categories:
working-class stories told in accents so impenetrable that you wish
for subtitles, and winsome but unchallenging tales that are as
accessible as their perfect diction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Life So Far,'' a well-acted, Scottish-set little movie
that's ultimately as ordinary as its title, falls into the latter
category. The life in question belongs to a young lad named Fraser,
whose restlessness is quickly defined in a literal way, as the
3-year-old tyke opts to crawl around the roof of his family's
palatial home rather than be put down for a nap.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the movie is told from the perspective of the boy at 10,
and although Fraser is allegedly based on a real person, the story
of his young life comes off as something that was plugged into a
computer program for beginning screenwriters: Here's the
eccentric-inventor father (Colin Firth), here's the long-suffering
wife and mother (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), here's the sister
(Tcheky Karyo) feeling the first stirrings of a teen crush, here's
the crusty but understanding matriarch (Rosemary Harris), and
here's the dyspeptic uncle (Malcolm McDowell) who thinks that all
the others in the family are a bunch of bloody loons.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the uncle's much younger fiancee (Irene Jacob), a
cellist who's the catalyst for family rifts, attracting the
attention of the increasingly precocious and sexually curious
Fraser (who has a way of saying the wrong things at the wrong
times) and of Fraser's father, creating an odd sort of romantic
triangle. Or rectangle, since the uncle is still in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Mix these ingredients together, and you yield an uncomfortable
mixture of whimsy and soap opera, with both elements underlined by
director Hugh Hudson. Best known for ``Chariots of Fire,'' Hudson
hasn't directed a movie in 10 years, but ``My Life So Far'' seems
even more frozen in time than that: He's so enamored of the movie's
pastoral setting, its 1930s period flavor and its random
observations about jazz and deception that he forgets to bring any
thoughts of his own to the piece. He's content to let the movie
float by on its charm, and its charm isn't enough to add weight to
such a light story.
</P>
<P>
   He's fortunate, then, to have actors who save the film from
total mediocrity. Firth is especially good as the father, whose
seeming innocuousness hides a dark, flawed soul, and Robert Norman
is relatively unaffected as the young Fraser, a role that could
easily have been cloying. McDowell's watchable hamminess keeps the
movie from sinking into its own gentility, but Harris and
Mastrantonio are all but lost in their stereotypical roles.
Mastrantonio's role is particularly thankless after her revelatory
work in John Sayles' ``Limbo;'' ``Life'' will probably please more
people, but it treads in places where many movies have gone before.

<P>
   HOLBROOKE-CONFIRM (Washington) _ The Senate voted Thursday to
confirm Richard C. Holbrooke as chief U.S. diplomat to the United
Nations, ending a 14-month nomination battle that left the Clinton
administration without a high-profile representative to the United
Nations during military conflicts in the Balkans and the Persian
Gulf. By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Congress gave its final approval
Thursday to a Republican plan that would lower the income taxes of
all Americans who pay them, but the bill stands no chance of
becoming law. The House approved the bill on a party-line vote,
221-206; the Senate is scheduled to vote at about 7 p.m. By David
E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-ASSESS (Washington) _ A news analysis: Are the Republicans,
or perhaps the Democrats, driving off a political cliff on tax
cuts? Almost all Republicans in Congress favor one, and almost all
Democrats are against it. Rarely have both parties sounded equally
confident about the political benefits they think their policies,
decided on principle alone, of course, will bring. With each side
sated with polling data and focus group results, the conflict
suggests that at least one side is taking a big chance on the
voters. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-CONGRESS (Washington) _ House Democrats and a group of
dissident Republicans were expected to reach agreement Thursday on
a comprehensive bill to regulate the managed health care industry,
and they challenged the Republican leadership to bring their
measure to a House vote in the fall. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   BEAR-FRAUD (New York) _ According to the SEC, Bear Stearns
Securities Corp. willfully aided and abetted A.R. Baron, a small,
New York brokerage firm that defrauded investors out of $75
million. The regulators also said that Bear Stearns willfully
violated securities laws in its record-keeping practices by
discarding documents relating to A.R. Baron's operations and
violated regulations governing the credit it extended to its
customer clearing firm. By Gretchen Morgenson.
</P>
<P>
   TV-STATION-OWNERSHIP (Undated) _ The FCC on Thursday voted to
liberalize rules limiting television station ownership, allowing a
single company or network to own two separate stations in the
largest cities. One immediate result of the decision may be a rush
by big television companies like the broadcast networks to sweep up
any available television stations in cities where they already own
a station. As put in one memo to the top corporate officers at one
of the four big broadcast networks, ``The race is on.'' By Bill
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   FIELD-OF-DREAMS (Dyersville, Iowa) _ All that really happened
here is that someone decided to shoot a movie. But that is not how
people here see it. The place is an eastern Iowa cornfield where
Hollywood built the set of ``Field of Dreams,'' the stirring,
fanciful story of a farmer who hears a voice telling him to build a
baseball diamond in his cornfield. Suddenly, some 50,000 people a
year started coming to the baseball diamond in the cornfield.
People still come, but now the object of their sentimental
pilgrimage is ensnared in a bitter disagreement between the farm
couple who owns most of the outfield and the farm couple who owns
most of the infield. By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   VACATION-SMOG (Washington) _ People who flee the big cities for
the beach or the mountains this summer are finding as much smog on
vacation as they left at home, according to a survey of government
monitoring data by environmentalists. Sometimes, the sea breezes
are even more noxious than the urban fumes, because the air arrives
there after loading up with pollutants in the cities and baking for
hours in this summer's strong sun and relentless heat. By Matthew
L. Wald.

RESENDING TO CORRECT MOVIE TITLE  
 `THE DINNER GAME' ISN'T CINEMA MAGIC BUT IT STILL WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his two Gerard Depardieu-Pierre Richard teamings, ``La
Chevre'' (1982) and ``Les Comperes'' (1983), French writer-director
Francis Veber found a near-perfect star chemistry and scored two of
the funniest mismatched buddy comedies of the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   In his new film, ``The Dinner Game,'' he tries to recreate some
of that same distinctive chemistry with two new actors, Thierry
Lhmerette and Jacques Villeret. Not surprisingly, lightning doesn't
strike twice in the same place, but the results are passably
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opened the last Seattle International Film
Festival and moves into a regular run on Friday, is about Pierre
(Lhmeritte), a shallow Parisian publisher trying to find a guest to
bring to a dinner that's actually a secret contest by his friends
to see who can find the biggest ``idiot'' _ so they can laugh at
him.
</P>
<P>
   And the despicable yuppie seems to find the perfect fool in
Francois (Villeret), a sweet-spirited but impossibly naive and
clutzy tax accountant whose avocation is building scale models of
famous buildings and monuments with matchsticks.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner has Pierre snared this perfect dinner guest than
everything goes wrong. Not only does an injury keep him from the
dinner, he can't get rid of Francois, and his meddling steadily
creates havoc in Pierre's well-ordered life: alienating both his
wife and mistress, even triggering a tax audit.
</P>
<P>
   From the first scene, it's clear that Veber is out to recerate
his early-'80s successes by once again teaming a hunky, attractive
leading man (Lhhmeritte instead of Depardieu) with a knockabout
physical comedian (Villeret standing in for Richard), and letting
the sparks fly.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't completely work. Barely 78 minutes long, the film
seems incorrigibly slight for a feature, Lhmeritte never quite
works his way into the likable range, Villeret is almost too
bumbling to be believable, and the pair never really click as a
comedy team.
</P>
<P>
   But if not cinema magic, ``The Dinner Game'' is still a workable
screwball comedy of frustration. Veber builds and sustains an
enjoyably frantic pace, his physical gags are clever and
imaginative, and the formula works to the extent that it's always
fun to watch an arrogant smartie get his comeuppance at the hands
of the lovable fool.
</P>
<P>
   The Dinner Game. Directed and written by Francis Veber. Produced
by Alain Poire. Cast: Thierry Lhermitte, Jacques Villeret, Francis
Huster, Daniel Prevost, Catherine Frot. Lions Gate. 78 minutes. In
French with English subtitles. Rated PG-13 for sexual references.

SKIRMISH IN CAPRIVI HAS ROOTS IN CONGO WAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Militarily, the brief battle on Monday in Katima
Mulilo, a small town in the Caprivi Strip in Namibia, did not mean
much, but it was an example of the domino effect of the war in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The battle seems to have stemmed from a combination of ethnic
separatism and the personal ambitions of the rebel leader, Mishake
Muyongo, but there are charges that the Unita rebel movement in
Angola is supplying the separatists and perhaps fighting with them.
</P>
<P>
   Unita's suspected motive is to punish the Namibian government
for its role in the Congo war and to tie up its small army. Namibia
sent troops to Congo to help President Laurent Kabila, who is
fighting Uganda and Rwanda in the east but has also allowed Unita
to keep bases in Congo and smuggle diamonds out across his
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen people _ five rebels and eight government troops _ were
killed Monday when an outfit called the Caprivi Liberation Army
attacked a military base, a radio station and an airport. Namibia
closed the borders around the strip, imposed a curfew and evacuated
foreign aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   Muyongo, a former leader of the opposition in the Namibian
Parliament, confirmed on Wednesday that his men had carried out the
attack, saying President Sam Nujoma had maltreated his people, whom
he called Caprivians.
</P>
<P>
   But other reports have emerged that Muyongo's movement was being
helped by the even less-known Barotse Patriotic Front in Zambia.
The Lozi-speaking Barotse, of which Muyongo is a member, are in
much the same plight as the Kurds split between Turkey, Iraq and
Iran: they once controlled their own territory, Barotseland, which
was under British protection, but up to two million are now
scattered, mostly in western Zambia but also in Namibia, Botswana
and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be an appendix to Namibia,'' Muyongo told a
South African radio station from his exile in Denmark. ``We've been
marginalized, unemployment is high, our schools are destroyed and
the only thing we're getting is brute force from Sam Nujoma's army
and police. We can't take it any more.'' Nujoma is an Ovambo, the
dominant tribe in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   Muyongo was once a member of Swapo, the ruling party of Namibia,
but was ousted because of suspicions of his secessionist
tendencies. He joined the opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance,
a conservative anti-Swapo party with many white backers that needed
black faces in its leadership. But nearly two years ago he was
ousted from it, too, again suspected of fomenting secession.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the Namibian Army scoured the strip, hunting for
military training camps, 2,000 of Muyongo's followers, some heavily
armed, fled with him into Botswana. Many returned, but he was
granted asylum in Denmark.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Caprivi Strip, which sticks out like a saucepan handle, is
an appendix to Namibia. During Europe's scramble for African
colonies in the 19th century, the strip was granted to Germany,
Namibia's ruler, as a corridor to the Zambezi River, which flows
east and would theoretically let German gunboats cross Africa to
the Indian Ocean. However a problem just downstream remained
unsolved: Victoria Falls, the Niagara of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, when Namibia was a colony of South Africa, Caprivi
was the staging ground for South Africa's campaign against Angola,
a secret war that apartheid South Africa carried out at
Washington's request and that is considered here the same kind of
military and political disaster that Vietnam was for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Many Caprivi residents helped the South Africans, leaving the
``Caprivians'' unloved by the victorious governments of Angola and
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, although Muyongo denies it, South African political and
military analysts suspect Unita is helping him and the Barotse.
Witnesses said they had seen men in the uniforms and red headbands
of Unita rebels from Angola in the area two days ago, and the
government reportedly captured a soldier who spoke only Portuguese,
the language of Angola. Unita's arms-smuggling network goes through
western Zambia, so it would have been simple to have delivered arms
to the Barotse.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought slim Caprivi could survive as a separate
country, Muyongo cited an island nation _ he could not recall the
name _ that he said has only 80,000 people but is a member of the
British Commonwealth. Caprivi has rich soil and safari tourism, he
said, while now ``even if we work until doomsday, Sam Nujoma will
do nothing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Muyongo, a colorful, undiplomatic speaker, ended a brief, angry
interview in an odd way: ``We don't even eat dogs in the Caprivi,''
he insisted, an obvious reference to the reputed taste for dogs
among the Ovambo. ``Dogs to us are pets.''

MARKING MERCHANDISE `SOUVENIRS,' A BERLIN STORE DEFIES SUNDAY
SHOPPING BAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Called everything from Rambo to an apostle of German
freedom, his courage compared to that of the people who brought
down the Berlin wall, a middle-aged department store executive with
a very big mustache has emerged as the most talked-about man in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Guenter Biere and his much-discussed revolution has
consisted in opening the large Kaufhof department store on the
Alexanderplatz here on a Sunday. In so doing, he defied the
labyrinthine shop-closing law intended to insure that Sunday
remains a rest day for Europe's largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that his coup, which he has vowed to repeat every
Sunday, occurred as newspapers here pondered how to fill their
August columns. It is also true that most Germans are at the beach.
The chancellor is in Positano, an Italian resort, and the
substantial Toskana-Fraktion (Tuscany Set) in Parliament has
retired to its villas. Still, Germany is about as close to abuzz as
it ever gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about me,'' Biere, 55, said as he tugged a strand
of his mustache out toward his left ear. ``It is about changing an
absurd situation. Our law on Sunday shopping is as full of holes as
a Swiss cheese, and I decided to indulge in a little provocation
designed to bring Germany into the modern world.''
</P>
<P>
   Biere should know about Swiss cheeses _ he has been in retailing
at various Kaufhof branches for 41 years, rising from an apprentice
to store manager. Along the way, he learned how to market an idea.
</P>
<P>
   For there is now little doubt that his brazen challenge to the
law, applauded by the 50,000 people who shopped at Kaufhof last
Sunday, has touched a nerve in a country increasingly torn between
custom and innovation, control and deregulation, and between the
different desires of its eastern and western parts.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufhof occupies the building that was formerly the main
department store for state-produced goods in Communist East
Germany, and that neatly symbolizes the fact that challenges to a
stolid, complacent western German society are increasingly coming
from the brasher east.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the Sunday store opening in what was until 1989
the main square of East Berlin, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
commented that the ``conventions of western Germany'' were being
challenged by a movement ``whose message was clear _ free at
last.''
</P>
<P>
   That may seem a lot for Germany's most serious newspaper to read
into buying sheets, shirts or sugar on a Sunday. But then shopping
is a lot more than shopping when done on German soil. It is a
legally intricate, culturally charged, emotional and sometimes
frustrating undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Its rules are defined with the laborious detail of a tax code,
complete with exemptions, special conditions and rigorous
deadlines. Its significance is often charged with the weight of a
cultural conflict between America's frenzied materialism and the
gentler pace of European society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the American drugstore has to be open at any time
when the cowboy swings by,'' said Ingo Schwoppe, an official at the
union representing about 200,000 store employees. ``But ours is a
different, less consumerist culture. Our members still think it is
important that Sunday be a day for the family and for children.''
</P>
<P>
   The current law bans shopping on Sundays in most of the country,
except in airports, gas stations and train stations. As a result,
some new shopping malls, like the 140-store complex in Leipzig
opened in 1997, have been built in train stations, making it very
convenient to buy bread when taking a Sunday train trip but less so
at other times.
</P>
<P>
   Stores can generally open until 8 p.m. on weekdays, and until 4
p.m. on Saturdays. But they can open for two hours longer on the
four Saturdays before Christmas, and on four Sundays a year,
provided they have closed by 2 p.m. on the preceding Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   One significant loophole permits Sunday shopping for a limited
number of articles _ including sun-cream, umbrellas and souvenirs _
in so-called ``tourist areas.'' When the Berlin city council
extended Berlin's ``tourist area'' to Alexanderplatz at the end of
July, Biere pounced.
</P>
<P>
   Having prepared his move by having 600,000 ``Berlin Souvenir''
stickers printed and by reaching an agreement with his 1,000
employees granting a 20 percent pay bonus for Sunday work, Biere
opened the Kaufhof from noon to 5 p.m. Every article sold was
labeled a ``souvenir.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales were 15 percent higher during a five-hour day than during
a normal 11-hour day, Biere said. Opinion polls quickly appeared
showing broad approval. But the Office for Workers' Protection,
which oversees shopping laws, was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Souvenirs must be specifically related to the area they are
from,'' said Robert Rath of the Berlin Workers' Protection office.
``Putting a little souvenir sticker on a washing machine does not
make it a souvenir. Perhaps an iron would qualify if its grip was
in the form of the Brandenburg Gate. But only then.''
</P>
<P>
   Rath said a fine of 50,000 marks ($27,500) imposed on Kaufhof
might be doubled if the store opened next Sunday, and the police
might be called in to force the store to close.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufhof has appealed the fine, and Biere said he was determined
to fight on. He has hired 20 new employees to work on Sunday, and
argues that Sunday opening could help create jobs in a society with
a 10.3 percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally I prefer American culture, and I go to America four
times a year to shop,'' Rath said. ``But the law is the law.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With unemployment over 20 percent in some eastern areas, with
Sunday religious observance lower than in the west, and with many
increasingly deserted eastern city centers desperately needing the
injection of life that Sunday shopping might bring, the east has
led the push for Sunday shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only stupid tradition of an old Germany is against this,''
said Gabriele Mueller, who works for a German subsidiary of the
United States Can Co. in the eastern town of Schwedt and came to
Kaufhof to shop. ``People work all week, and it only adds to their
stress if they cannot shop on Sunday. We should accept our
Americanization.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was regulation, not deregulation, that cemented the
postwar success of Germany's social-market economy, with its
emphasis on solidarity, consensus and order. Although the system is
now ailing, especially in its inability to create jobs, the
attachment to it remains strong, especially in labor unions and
churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men and women who wrote our Constitution saw the need to
make Sunday a work-free day,'' said Manfred Kock, the president of
the Evangelical Church of Germany. ``We should respect them and
preserve a day of communal tranquillity for social as much as
religious reasons.''

CONGO REBEL LEADER MAY REPUDIATE TRUCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ The leader of one of the two main rebel
forces in Congo appeared ready Thursday to call off a cease-fire
accord he signed just days earlier, in what would be another blow
to the already shaky process of bringing peace to Africa's
third-largest country.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre Bemba, the leader of the Movement for the Liberation
of Congo, which occupies the northern parts of Congo, said two
airplanes belonging to an ally of Congo President Laurent Kabila
bombed two towns held by the movement Wednesday, killing more than
500 civilians and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Bemba's assertion, which could not be independently confirmed,
was denied by Kabila's government. The high number of reported
deaths also raised doubts among Western diplomats, who noted that
Bemba had signed the accord reluctantly in Lusaka, Zambia, on
Sunday and might have been seeking an excuse to resume fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I consider the cease-fire is broken,'' Bemba said,
according to Reuters. ``It has been broken by Kabila himself while
all my troops were on the defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Kabila's government and five nations openly involved in
the one-year-old war signed a cease-fire agreement in Lusaka,
Zambia. But Bemba, who is supported by Uganda, and the Congolese
Rally for Democracy, which is backed by Rwanda, refused to endorse
the document.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats have been pressing Rwanda and Uganda to put
pressure on the two rebel groups to sign the accord. But it is
unclear how hard the two nations have been pressing the rebels,
whose organizations would not survive long without their sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel groups have also been under intense pressure by the
West, the United Nations and other international organizations to
stop fighting. The Congolese Rally for Democracy has yet to sign
the accord.
</P>
<P>
   And so Bemba's report of an attack might be, as one Western
diplomat in Kinshasa said, ``an attempt to garner international
diplomatic sympathy and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington and the United Nations on Thursday warned the warring
parties to stick to the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are calling on every party not to allow what happened or
did not happen to become a pretext to back away from the Lusaka
accord,'' a Clinton administration official said, speaking on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that unless
all sides respected the cease-fire, the United Nations would not
send an observer mission to Congo, a prelude to possibly sending
peacekeeping troops there.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bemba, Russian-built Sudanese planes dropped 18
bombs on the towns of Makanza and Bogbonga at 10 a.m. Wednesday. If
the casualty figures are confirmed, the death toll would be one of
the highest recorded in a single incident in this war.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan has never acknowledged its involvement in the war, and did
not take part in the talks that produced the Lusaka accord. But it
is widely believed that Sudan's government, which for historical
reasons has been at odds with Uganda's government, has helped
Kabila as have Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia.

PATRIOTS FOCUS ON LONG SHOT BOWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects spelling of Mike Matarazzo.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ The Patriots wanted to draft Rob Konrad, the
Syracuse University fullback and North Andover, Mass., native, but
he was scooped up by the Miami Dolphins in the second round of
April's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Shaping up as the next best thing for New England is free agent
Jamie Bowers, an H-back who has been moved from fullback to tight
end as a result of recent injuries at that position.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers's teammates have even nicknamed him ``Konrad.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 3 inches and 237 pounds, Bowers has decent size, but
is much smaller than the 260-pound Konrad. Bowers attended a small
school; Wabash, with 800 students, is one of the few all-male
private colleges still remaining in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers has become noticeable because Ben Coates and Mike Bartrum
have been sidelined with a sprained left knees, and Rod Rutledge
has a minor finger injury.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers was especially impressive Wednesday and even earned some
recognition from coach Pete Carroll, who yelled, ``Having yourself
quite a day, 43.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers has made the most of his chance, showing the ability to
catch the ball consistently and in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots didn't have much information on Bowers until they
were flipping through a pre-draft book on small college players
published by Mike Matarazzo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking through the book for a fullback and we gave
him a call,'' said Patriots vice president of player development
Bobby Grier. ``He's been a pleasant surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   A long shot, yes, but Bowers never thought he'd even be in an
NFL training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given me a chance and they've told me to make the most
of it,'' said Bowers. ``I'm just trying to learn the information
real quick. It hasn't been super rough; sometimes there's a little
juggling going on in the brain, but it's not too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-sport star at Wabash, Bowers played baseball and football
for four years, certainly unusual for most college athletes, who
normally play just one sport. He was also a physics major and had a
3.3 grade-point average. He was heading toward a career in teaching
and coaching and had actually completed a nine-week course tutoring
high school sophomores on their state-mandated testing.
</P>
<P>
   It was just after the nine-week period ended that Bowers got a
call about coming to Foxborough for a tryout.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't even find me,'' said Bowers. ``I got done with
school in December and then did my student teaching. My coach was
trying to get in touch with me to let me know. No one else called.
For me, this is my one and only shot. There weren't many people
knocking on the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers caught 37 passes for 547 yards in his senior year and
made 94 receptions for 1,323 yards and five touchdowns in his
career. His career average on the baseball team was .321 with 19
doubles, 4 triples, 5 homers and 76 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many Division 3 guys get drafted,'' said Bowers. ``It
wasn't until I got to college when I started to gain weight. Out of
(Warsaw, Ind.) high school I was under 200 pounds and there weren't
any big schools interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers said he lined up on the line sometimes and also was used
as the lead blocker in the backfield. He carried only 11 times for
45 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers does a good job catching and protecting the ball. He has
already caught Coates's eye, the All-Pro telling Bowers to keep
making the most of every day.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to arriving here, Bowers said he phoned former NFL tight
end Pete Metzelaars, the only athlete to make it to the pros from
Wabash. In college, Bowers wore No. 88, a number that will soon be
retired in Metzelaars's honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was compared to him a lot in school,'' said Bowers. ``I
ended up calling him up to get some veteran advice before I came
out here. He gave me some good advice, but it's classified
information. He gave me some good tips, basically to work hard and
never let up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nervous about fitting in before he got to camp, Bowers now
thinks he belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I've gotten to camp, I think I can play,'' he said.
``I was a little nervous at first because I didn't want to mess up.
Now that the coaches have a little confidence in me, I can show
them what I have to offer. It's a great opportunity. That's what
I'm all about. Going to a 3-D school, it's a long shot, so I have
to show up every day and make sure I do something the coaches
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to be inconspicuous in other ways. Apparently one
of the bits of information Metzelaars gave him was to be seen but
not heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be seen by the coaches and not so much by the veterans,''
Bowers said. ``Lay low, keep my mouth shut, and say the right
things on the field. I don't want to get too chummy, chummy with
anybody. I'm just feeling my way through and as I'm getting more
reps, more guys are saying hello.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now he says the playbook is easier than the physics book,
but ``with the hits to my brain, I think I'm losing a little bit up
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Patriots are impressed. From the Wabash Little
Giants to the New England Patriots. It's a good preseason story
that may have a longer life span.

AN AIR OF RELUCTANCE IN CHINA'S CRACKDOWN ON FALUN GONG 
</HEADLINE>

 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's fierce-looking crackdown on Falun Gong, the
spiritual movement that claims tens of millions of followers, is
turning out to be far less severe than it first looked, with more
propaganda than action.
</P>
<P>
   Although the authorities have detained tens of thousands of
people and are spewing a deafening barrage of anti-Falun Gong
publicity each day, ordinary offenders are being handled with
relative leniency. Most of those detained are being released within
a few days and sent home, apparently because officials at many
levels of government fear the enormous disruption that would be
caused by mass arrests for the innocuous crime of practicing a
variant of an ancient form of meditation and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   This deep contradiction _ the vehement pronouncements of the
official campaign versus the more malleable reality _ points at
both the resilience of the Communist Party's political apparatus
and, paradoxically, the reluctance of the authorities to use it to
its fullest extent. A harsh crackdown would also risk provoking an
unpredictable backlash.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the severe punishment of participants in the 1989
pro-democracy movement, the authorities' hesitance to apply all
their force against Falun Gong followers appears to reflect the
shrinking status of the party in a society that has grown more
disparate and hard to control over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than retreating in fear, as the targets of previous
political campaigns did, many Falun Gong practitioners are
continuing to speak out against the crackdown as a misguided effort
that will never shake their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Falun Gong organizers remain in custody, and may face
heavier charges. Many ordinary followers, however, say the
authorities in their workplaces are deliberately fudging orders to
check employees and obtain promises to stop practicing Falun Gong,
in order to avoid the havoc of mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A 39-year-old schoolteacher surnamed Cao represents a new breed
of political activist in 1999. She came to Beijing from her home in
northern China on a personal mission to tell the nation's leaders
about what she believes is the essential goodness of Falun Gong,
which teaches its followers to adopt highly moral behavior and to
think of others first.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can stop me from believing in Falun Gong,'' said Ms.
Cao, a willful-seeming woman with short hair. ``It changed my life.
I will never stop practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cao tells a remarkable tale of her arrest, her quick
release, rearrest and re-release in the days after the start of the
crackdown last month.
</P>
<P>
   She came to Beijing on July 20 to protest the crackdown that
Falun leaders heard was coming, and was one of hundreds of
followers who were detained for protesting outside Zhongnanhai, the
compound where China's top officials live and work. She was taken
to a military post on the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Forced home on a military bus the next day, she immediately made
her way back to Beijing, where she was arrested again at a sit-in
in Tiananmen Square, the site of the 1989 student-led movement.
</P>
<P>
   Taken partway home again, Ms. Cao escaped the loose custody she
was under and made her way to Beijing for a third time in a week.
When she called home, she was told by her school's principal that
she risked losing her job if she did not follow orders to return
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I don't care,'' Ms. Cao said. ``They can take my
job and my home. If I can't practice Falun Gong, there is no point
in living.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of defiance may seem remarkable in the face of the
tough-talking Chinese authorities, yet it was echoed by seven other
followers who were eager to tell their stories, and to communicate
their determination to persuade China's leaders to rescind the ban
on Falun Gong that was ordered on July 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not afraid of being arrested,'' said another
schoolteacher, named Yang. ``When we have contact with the
government, that is when we can tell them what we think.''
</P>
<P>
   When this attitude is voiced by Falun Gong's organizers, it is
not likely to be treated so kindly. The authorities have accused
the movement's leaders of aiming to overthrow the government, a
deeply serious offense, and have not publicized how many of the
movement's top leaders have been detained or how their cases are
being handled.
</P>
<P>
   China placed a request through Interpol, the international
police force, for the arrest of the movement's founder, Li Hongzhi,
who is based in New York City. Interpol turned it down this week,
citing a lack of criminal evidence. The State Department,
meanwhile, has pointed out that the United States does not have an
extradition treaty with China.

 BEIJING: treaty with China. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lighter treatment of ordinary followers like Ms. Cao may
reflect a tacit admission by the authorities that there is little
wrong with practicing this form of qigong, the traditional
exercises that the overwhelming majority of Chinese people believe
can enhance vital energies.
</P>
<P>
   But the quick release of the people detained also seems to
reflect concern by Communist Party officials that harsh punishment
of Falun Gong followers could risk an unpredictable and dangerous
backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts in Beijing say the anti-Falun Gong campaign is
being directed by President Jiang Zemin. Jiang was apparently so
disturbed by the lack of warning he received from security forces
before more than 10,000 Falun Gong followers surrounded the
Zhongnanhai leadership compound on April 25, that he ordered a
far-reaching political campaign to force security and party
officers into concerted action.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Jiang's intention may be to whip his forces into line in
the run-up to Oct. 1, when China celebrates the 50th anniversary of
the Communist state, a highly sensitive date that Jiang would like
to cast as a grand observance of the party's glory with himself at
the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Falun Gong followers say they reject official media
reports demonizing Li, who founded the movement in 1992, and intend
to continue to follow his teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has taught me to be a better person,'' said a coal company
executive named Han, who said he was a Communist Party member.
``They say we are a political organization, but I just bought the
book and read it myself. Where is the organization there?''
</P>
<P>
   Han, like several other followers, said he did not mind losing
his job if need be in order to continue practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't let me practice, I can't live,'' he said. ``It
would be like cutting my head off. How can I be a real person
without it ?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the commitment that Han displays, he and other followers
said they were not sure that they would actually lose their jobs
for ignoring pleas from their leaders to stop protesting the
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Yang said the principal of his school, situated 50 miles outside
Beijing, was taking a typically ambiguous approach to orders to
expel any employees who refuse to renounce Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   The principal, Yang said, did not want to lose all 20 teachers
in the school who practice Falun Gong, so the principal asked
others to forge confessions in the names of Yang and others, to be
passed on to education officials as proof that the school was
complying with the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Yang said a fellow Falun Gong believer who is a doctor had
discovered that the director of his hospital had signed a
fabricated confession in the doctor's name, to avoid the issue of
whether the doctor would have to be let go.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese journalist who is not sympathetic to Falun Gong said
he found the political campaign excessive and unnecessary, and
argued that many of the confessions by Falun leaders broadcast by
the authorities sounded so insincere that they seemed to be
signaling a refusal to buckle.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist said he had been musing on the difference between
the terror of the crackdown in 1989 and how silly the heavy-handed
official statements seemed this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marx was right when he wrote that history will repeat itself,
the first time as tragedy and the second time as farce,'' the
journalist said. ``In 1989, it was a tragedy. This time it's a
farce.''

2 NYC ARCHITECTURAL FIRMS TO DESIGN CLINTON LIBRARY AND MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a year, some of the nation's top architects and
designers have been battling feverishly _ but discreetly _ over a
commission in a weed-filled old warehouse district on the banks of
the Arkansas River.
</P>
<P>
   The prize was President Clinton's library and museum, part of
the future Clinton Presidential Park, a 27-acre expanse in downtown
Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The William J. Clinton Presidential Foundation confirmed
Thursday that two New York City firms had won the commission: the
Polshek Partnership, the architects who restored Carnegie Hall and
designed the new Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Natural
History in Manhattan, and Ralph Appelbaum Associates, museum
planners and exhibition designers for the Hayden Planetarium and
the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The project is expected to cost $125 million. It is too early to
say what the library will look like, what exhibits it will contain,
and when construction will begin, said foundation president Skip
Rutherford, who is coordinating the project.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain, he said. Visitors will be able to walk
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a downtown location,'' Rutherford said, ``which is far
different from other presidential libraries.'' It will also be
close to an emerging shopping and entertainment district known as
River Market.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Little Rock is acquiring land for the park through
condemnation and purchase, Rutherford said. The 100-year-old
Choctaw-Rock Island railroad passenger depot on the site will be
preserved and incorporated into the new complex. An abandoned
railroad bridge over the river will be converted to pedestrian use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very accessible site,'' said James Stewart
Polshek, who will design the building with Richard M. Olcott.
``That's one of the reasons the president selected that one,
because of its visibility and accessibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides that, Polshek diplomatically sidestepped any
characterization of his two meetings at the White House earlier
this year, other than to say that Clinton sought architectural
excellence and was familiar with ``a number of other presidential
libraries and had opinions about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Appelbaum, too, shied from describing his White House meeting,
besides noting the president's ``caring thought'' about the
selection process.
</P>
<P>
   News of the selection was first reported Thursday in The
Arkansas Times.

MAJOR BLACK EMPOWERMENT COMPANY RESTRUCTURES, RETURNING CONTROL TO
WHITES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ South Africa's flagship ``black empowerment
company, recovering from an investor revolt that ousted its
chairman, has announced a large-scale restructuring that creates
more accountability to shareholders but means the company no longer
will be controlled by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring of New Africa Investments Ltd., announced
earlier this week, may spell the end of the black empowerment
trend, a push toward economic equality that gained force with the
election of the African National Congress government in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   From a strictly financial point of view, the move by New Africa
Investments is considered long overdue: More equitable ownership
rights for shareholders and a more open, understandable corporate
structure that could become a model for all South African
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The 95 percent of shareholders who now hold nonvoting shares
will get voting rights; blacks will control only about 10 percent
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   At its height, the black empowerment trend saw the big mining
and insurance conglomerates that dominate this economy regularly
spinning off subsidiaries and, through tricky financing, handing
them over to black control.
</P>
<P>
   But black trade unions and the black investment clubs called
``stokvels'' are no longer leaping into such arrangements. After a
brief fad of investing in them, big investors began to shun these
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most big early deals went sour. The 100-year-old mining house
JCI Ltd. was broken up after its black chairman, Mzilikazi Khumalo,
was ousted in an insider-trading scandal; its best gold mine passed
to the white Kebble family that had backed him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnnies Industrial Corp., another conglomerate, is still headed
by Cyril Ramaphosa, a former General Secretary of the African
National Congress, but it is really a holding company with a large
portfolio of shares in other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting Thursday on the passing of this brief era, Business
Day, a financial newspaper here, reacted with both regret over the
failure of an ideal and pleasure that financial standards had
prevailed. Referring to New Africa Investments Ltd. by its familiar
acronym, it said, ``As the cases of NAIL and the likes of JCI have
shown, being an owner means little if the owner himself is not on a
sturdy financial footing.''
</P>
<P>
   Defining empowerment only as control, the editorial went on,
ignores the value of managing a division or starting a small
business.
</P>
<P>
   Dikgang Moseneke, the executive director of New Africa
Investments, who introduced the restructuring plan, said the
company would now concentrate on empowering blacks by employing
more of them, training them as executives, and helping the
disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   The company's structure is to be more like any American or
European counterpart: major shareholders will get seats on the
board and the company will concentrate on profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't add value, we will be prepared to walk the
plank,'' Moseneke promised shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The company will split into two divisions, one with interests in
insurance and banking, the other in newspapers and radio stations.
Then, ``like Siamese twins,'' Moseneke said, they will be separated
into two companies.
</P>
<P>
   New Africa Investments was founded in 1993 when the South
African National Life Insurance Company decided to spin off 30
percent of Metropolitan Life, its subsidiary that wrote policies
for blacks, and turn it over to black control. As chairman, it
chose Dr. Nthato Motlana, an old friend and personal physician of
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   The insurer, widely known as Sanlam Ltd., is an
Afrikaner-dominated conglomerate whose directors thought it wise to
rapidly lift blacks into positions of economic power, both to
compensate for the damage of apartheid and to curry favor with the
African National Congress government about to be elected. (Sanlam
itself was an empowerment vehicle for Afrikaners _ it was founded
50 years ago when the National Party took office, and government
contracts that formerly went to English-speaking insurance
companies were steered to it.)
</P>
<P>
   Under the restructuring, New Africa Investments will undo the
pyramid of holding companies that kept control in the hands of its
founders. Pyramid-style ownership is frowned upon in the United
States and Britain, but common in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   For example, despite directly owning only 8 percent of the
shares, the Oppenheimer family controls the De Beers diamond-mining
company and its sister conglomerate, Anglo American PLC, which
together once accounted for a quarter of the country's gross
domestic product. The Rembrandt Group and Liberty Life, two other
big conglomerates, are controlled by the Rupert and Gordon families
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   When New Africa Investments was created, there were two classes
of stock: 83 million common shares controlled by the directors, and
two billion nonvoting N shares sold to outside investors. The
common shares were controlled by four family trusts for the benefit
of Motlana; Zwelakhe Sisulu, a member of Parliament and son of the
ANC stalwarts Walter and Albertina Sisulu; Moseneke, who also has
ANC connections and is chairman of the national telephone company,
and Jonty Sandler, a white businessman who had made and lost a
fortune building an amusement park near the black township of
Soweto and was considered a wizard at creative financing. The four
trusts owned Phaphama Holdings, which owned 96 percent of Corp. Af
rica, which owned 55 percent of New Africa Investments.
</P>
<P>
   In April, shareholders revolted. The big banks and insurers who
held the bulk of New Africa Investments' stock were outraged at
plans by board members to award themselves options worth $20
million and to increase the number of nonvoting shares by 50
percent, particularly since the company's stock had lost half its
value since early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In a humiliating retreat, the board scrapped the compensation
plan a day before the annual meeting. A month later, Motlana and
Sandler resigned.

 &HT;    Brosnan, Russo are remake's crown jewels
 &HT;    By Jim Luksic
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Analogies between this remake of ``The Thomas
Crown Affair'' and Norman Jewison's 1968 version can't be surmised
instantly. Alan Trustman's original narrative, though tweaked and
slightly glossed over, remains essentially intact here _ the
Hollywood-cliched finale notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Chunks of dialogue will ring a bell, and many of the
forerunner's principal figures are back in place. Director John
McTiernan also has enlisted one performer (Faye Dunaway) to return,
this time as Crown's shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Brosnan steps into the late Steve McQueen's shoes as our
suave billionaire, and it's hardly a stretch for the actor best
known as James Bond. Portraying the restless title character,
Brosnan oversees the heist of an invaluable Monet from New York's
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Big Apple's finest _ namely detective Michael McCann
(Denis Leary) _ would even conceive of Crown being the culprit, but
that only makes investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) more
determined. For reasons not made convincingly clear, she suspects
the affluent playboy immediately. (Her deductive logic: Because
Crown capsized a yacht just for kicks, he also must be bored enough
to steal paintings.)
</P>
<P>
   Banning is on his heels and under his covers as the pursuit,
much to McCann's jealousy, crosses the professional line. Brosnan
avoids tipping his player's hand by staying cool and letting us
mull over the identity of an enigmatic companion (supermodel Esther
Canadas).
</P>
<P>
   It's clear, despite Leary's fleshed-out effort, this stage
belongs to the capable Brosnan and Russo. The former is a sturdy
pillar of panache, a fine foil to his female counterpart, who
smoothly grabs the spotlight and doesn't let go. Ben Gazzara barely
warrants a glance as an attorney; the veteran, well utilized in
``Summer of Sam,'' is brutally underused. And Frankie Faison, as
Leary's sidekick, is asked to do little beyond make faces while
expressing resignation at Russo's antics.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, the filmmakers deserve kudos for remodeling and
resuscitating a caper that hasn't worn out its welcome. Jewison's
employment of hideous split-screen, screen-in-screen gimmickry has
been suitably replaced by McTiernan's straightforward gaze and
orthodox approach.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Conti's intrusive score simmers, yet it fails to transport
us back three decades, as it was obviously designed to do. And a
few action segments seem prolonged, in turn extending their
improbability.
</P>
<P>
   Co-writers Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer have some trouble
keeping absurdity to a minimum, but golden moments can be seen: The
hero abandoning his ride to follow and console his distraught
lover; a cleverly tooled climax in which numerous bowler-hatted
gentlemen befuddle the police force; any shots inside the elegant
ballrooms and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   When all is done, this reworking of ``The Thomas Crown Affair''
proves to have a distinct style, personality and direction. It
stands, and occasionally falls, on its own.

 &HT;    Plot twist, psychic sidekick help Willis redeem himself in
creepy `Sixth Sense'
 &HT;    BY Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The sight of Bruce Willis shepherding a young boy
raises the troubling specter of ``Mercury Rising,'' a ludicrous
1998 suspense thriller about a 9-year-old autistic child who
cracked a secret government code and needed washed-up FBI Agent
Willis to save him from evil Alec Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercury Rising'' was Willis' attempt to show his soft side,
but it sank fast as he reverted to his usual action-hero mode. He
succeeds with ``The Sixth Sense,'' an eerie psychological thriller
in which he helps a frightened boy who is terrorized by ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   The film is effectively creepy, despite its muted tone and
tendency to drag. Stripped of his sidearm, Willis gives the kind of
weighty, measured performance that proved his abilities as an actor
in ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``12 Monkeys.'' However, he's outshined by
Haley Joel Osment, who is incredibly intense as the 8-year-old
clairvoyant, Cole Sear.
</P>
<P>
   Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, an award-winning Philadelphia child
psychologist. As the story opens, Crowe and his wife, Anna (Olivia
Williams), are confronted in their home by one of his former
patients, Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg), now an adult. The
disturbed young man babbles something about knowing what makes
people afraid when they're alone before shooting Crowe and killing
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Having failed Gray, Crowe tries to ease his conscience by taking
the similar case of Cole, who is diagnosed as suffering from acute
anxiety. The pale, stricken-looking lad eventually confides that he
can see and hear dead people. He is a reluctant channel, plagued by
sometimes violent spirits with unresolved problems.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from some strange occurrences, such as Cole's mother (Toni
Collette) stepping out of the kitchen for a second and returning to
find every cupboard and drawer open and her son unmoved, we don't
witness many manifestations during the first 40 minutes. Much of
the plot also deals with Crowe's estrangement from his wife, who is
being romantically pursued by a co-worker, Sean (Glenn Fitzgerald).
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``The Sixth Sense'' is often heavier on mundane
drama than chilling horror. The spine-tingling scenes in which
phantoms materialize are scary and disturbing, heightened by
writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's otherwise minimal use of mood
music and visual effects.
</P>
<P>
   The story builds to a well-handled whammy of a plot twist that
does much to redeem the film's shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Willis is poignant in an unusually sensitive role, but ``The
Sixth Sense'' belongs to 11-year-old Osment, who merited Emmy
consideration as a dying boy who wanted to sue God in an episode of
``Ally McBeal.'' His haunted performance is riveting.

DEAL BARS GERMAN AIR FORCE FROM FLYING OVER RANCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ American and German fighter pilots will not be
conducting low-level, high-speed flights over a course that
stretches 800 miles from New Mexico to the Big Bend region of
Texas, according to a settlement announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In settling a lawsuit filed by five West Texas ranchers over the
proposed exercises, the Air Force agreed this week to withdraw its
application with the Federal Aviation Administration to use the
route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it means there won't be any airplanes flying on the
routes that were contested,'' Kaare Remme, a principal in the McCoy
Land and Cattle Co. and one of the plaintiffs, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its a great victory but sort of a left-handed one. They agreed
to stop it, but they said they might try to perpetrate it on our
neighbors,'' Remme said from his office in San Marcos, about 45
miles northeast of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   According to the settlement, the Air Force may try to find
another West Texas route for the German pilots who conduct training
mission in the United States. The Air Force agreed to do further
environmental studies before proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Air Force officers and government lawyers involved in
the settlement were not returned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome represents a clear, if narrow, victory in the
ongoing legal struggle between West Texas ranchers and the federal
government over military training flights above private property.
</P>
<P>
   The next battle brewing is over the Air Force's plan to begin
``realistic bomber training'' missions over a broad expanse of West
Texas. Widely resented, the bomber plan cannot be challenged in
court until it is formally adopted by the Air Force, a step that
may occur late this year.
</P>
<P>
   The five plaintiffs involved in the lawsuit over the training
flights by Germany's Luftwaffe own several hundred square miles of
ranchland in Reeves, Pecos and Davis counties.
</P>
<P>
   They sued last year, claiming the Air Force did not follow
procedures in the National Environmental Protection Act to evaluate
the impact of the flights on humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Military Airspace Expansions will directly interfere with
the company's operations, including cattle management and
operations, tourism and hunting operations, employee quality of
life and safety ...'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plaintiffs, the planes reach speeds of 600 mph
while flying within 100 feet of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Luftwaffe pilots are based at Holloman Air Force Base, near
Alamogordo, N.M., and train over West Texas and New Mexico because
such low-level flights are prohibited in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The route that sparked the lawsuit was once used to test cruise
missiles but has never been used for fighter pilot training.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the plaintiffs, Murray Feldman, said the
settlement has limited significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not overstate it. It's just one instrument route. But if
you are someone like Mr. Remme and the route was right over your
ranch house, it's pretty darn significant,'' Feldman said from his
office in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Feldman said the Texas lawsuit was noteworthy
because, unlike most actions against the Air Force over training
flights, it involved private and not public land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force faces too much pressure from citizen groups and
land management agencies when they try to expand flights over
public lands, so they were looking at private land,'' he said.
``But you almost have to wonder if they underestimated that people
who own their own property have the same, if not a greater, level
of concern.''

   &QL; 
DOUGLAS (Douglas, Ariz.) - The mayor of Douglas is fed up. He's
sick of illegal immigrants dying in the desert as they try to cross
the border. He's sick of ranchers with rifles looking for a reason
to shoot immigrants camping on their property. He's sick of the
disease, the violence, the trash and the tragedy that surround the
flow of people into his city. But instead of going after the
immigrants, he's lashing out at those who entice them to come:
employers. He has launched a letter writing campaign to newspapers
across the country, slamming those who hire illegal immigrants. The
mayor takes us on a tour of his gripes, showing and telling us why
he's taken this unusual step. By GRACIELA SEVILLA. Story will move
in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GRAND CANYON (Grand Canyon, Ariz.) - After years of analysis and
public debate, forest officials will vote Friday on two final
choices for developing land south of the Grand Canyon: a
conservative plan that would cut out only 50 acres for federal
housing and community facilities, and a proposal by a Scottsdale
developer to clear a section four times as big so that hotels and
retail space can be added. Both would also provide 60 acres for a
transit center where a new light rail will pick up canyon-bound
visitors. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ODD LAWS (Phoenix) - We look at some of the odder laws that go into
effect today (Friday), from setting the legal temperature for
storing eggs to letting law-enforcement officers give you a
blood-alcohol test even if you're dead; from allowing almost any
organization get a custom-designed license plate to making it a
felony to tattoo anyone under 18 without parental consent. By JON
KAMMAN. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;  &QL; 
BADCOMPANY (Phoenix) _ Paul Rodgers, whose soulful voice fronted
the popular '70s rock act Bad Company, talks about his 15-year wait
to ``set the record straight'' on the group's current reunion tour.
By LARRY RODGERS. Story will move in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - They died in Kosovo two days after a
small plane disappeared off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, so
reports of their passing were buried inside most newspapers under
truckloads of JFK Jr. and ``the end of Camelot`` and ``the Kennedy
curse.'' Army Sgt. William ``Gunz'' Wright, 27, and Spc. Sherwood
B. Brim, 30, They were husbands. They were brothers. They were
sons. They were, in Wright's case, a father. They were overlooked.

(HAS ART; RUNS WITH LAUGHLIN-GO)

<P>
   LAUGHLIN, Nev. _ Don Laughlin is a time-warp kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   The music piped through his casino is rooted in an era roughly
bracketed by Roy Orbison and Brian Wilson. His classic-car exhibit
features a '60 Chrysler coupe with some wicked tail fins, a
metal-flake gold Mustang from '65 and a two-tone '56 Ford station
wagon. His hairstyle is right out of ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's all fitting, really. In 1966, this man began carving
out a tiny gambling settlement on the shores of the Colorado River
_ later consenting to have it named after him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite lying within a 90-mile shadow cast by Las Vegas, the
town has succeeded precisely because it has resisted change. It has
been content to offer the gambler a throwback experience: Vegas of
30 or so years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is a time of grave identity crisis for Las Vegas. It seems
to be taking great pains to distance itself from its past,
trumpeting theme hotels that depart dramatically from the frontier
ambience of old. It touts its gourmet chefs, its hoity-toity shops.
It books Broadway musicals and operatic tenors. It enthuses over
the fact that its hotel guests can get to elevators without having
to pass through casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Laughlin _ the city and the man _ harbors no such pretension.
This is a place that doesn't apologize for its nickel slots and
$2-limit black jack. It is proud of its $3.99 breakfast buffets and
sloppy Western barbecues. For entertainment, it books the Kingston
Trio (Ramada Express, mid-July) and Willie Nelson (Riverside, Aug.
14).
</P>
<P>
   This is a place where elderly snowbirds descend en mass in
winter _ that sound isn't a great flapping of wings, it's the groan
of RV engines gearing down. The seniors are replaced in summer by
river-rat families _ also packed thickly into RVs.
</P>
<P>
   And no one is the least bit self-conscious about it. In
Laughlin, you don't blink when you see patrons crossing the casino
in swimsuits and reef sandals, lugging ice chests. In fact, in
terms of male attire, this has got to be the tank top capital of
the Western world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a down-home atmosphere,'' Laughlin, 68, said the
other day from behind the desk of his spacious office at his
Riverside Resort Hotel &AMP; Casino. ``The prices are probably a third
here what they are in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we don't get $100-chip play, but the people who
wear a suit and tie in Las Vegas come down here, and they're in
their grubbies.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughlin laughed. He admitted that the city's appeal leans
heavily to the retired set from October to May. He confirmed that
vacationing families then take over in summer. (``They may not have
much money to spend, but they stay up all night.'') He acknowledged
the area's popularity with truckers, who park on the Arizona side
of the river and bolt for the casino in the Riverside's free boat
shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a mixture of everything,'' he went on. ``We try to
keep a friendly atmosphere here with our employees. I think we have
the old touch that Las Vegas had 30, 40 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In this community in the extreme southern tip of Nevada, other
hotel-casino operations have followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms are practically given away along its mile-plus strip of
nine hotels; it's not unusual to find midweek rates under $20. Far
from being discouraged, the motor-home travelers are openly
courted. There are 21 RV parks in Laughlin and immediately across
the river in Bullhead City, Ariz. Some 2,263 of their sites have
hookups.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the casinos, the atmosphere is no less inviting for
visitors who aren't flush with discretionary income. Quarter, dime
and even nickel slot machines produce a terrific din. Video poker
is also extremely popular, while table games are often draped in
tarps and idle. When demand for the table games does pick up, much
of it is concentrated in blackjack games of $2 and $3 limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about Laughlin, it is very inexpensive _ rooms,
food, the lower limits on the games,'' said Steve Bourie, who
edited the 1999 ``American Casino Guide'' (Casino Vacations;
$14.95) _ and personally wrote the book's entry on Laughlin.
``There's more value for your money.''
</P>
<P>
   And to think it all started with a flight in a small plane.
</P>
<P>
   Don Laughlin, who had hustled slot-machine business as a
teen-ager in his home state of Minnesota before an anti-gambling
ordinance drove him to Las Vegas, was flying his private plane over
a desolate stretch of the Mojave Desert and Colorado River in the
early 1960s. He had just sold his 101 Club, a successful bar and
gambling hall he'd established in North Las Vegas, and he was
looking for new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Laughlin spotted a boarded-up eight-room motel on the Nevada
side of the river, across from Bullhead City, which had sprung up
to accommodate workers building nearby Davis Dam. On a hunch, this
entrepreneur decided to put $35,000 down and buy the motel and its
six acres of riverfront property.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was motivated not by what Laughlin saw on the
ground, but what he saw from the air. At night, the lights of
Phoenix were visible in the distance. So were the headlights of
truckers and vacationers bound out of California on nearby Route
66. Nevada permitted gambling, and Arizona and California _ long
before the advent of Indian gaming _ did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw opportunity in a state-line location,'' Laughlin says
now. ``I saw an opportunity for a hotel, maybe a couple hundred
rooms. I didn't envision nine hotels, 50,000 people a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of Laughlin's appeal was somewhat puzzling, since
it couldn't boast convenience in its attempt to lure gamblers away
from Las Vegas. Each destination is about a 300-mile drive from Los
Angeles. From Phoenix, the drive to Las Vegas is only 19 miles
shorter than the one to Laughlin.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's that river. It flows by reassuringly, perhaps serving
as a metaphor for gamblers who have seen their money drift away but
would like to think fresh prosperity will be borne by the next
current.
</P>
<P>
   The hotels along this stretch position their bars and
restaurants to overlook the river, and a river walk connects many
of them (although some greedy hotels interrupt the foot traffic by
forcing walkers to detour through their casinos). Water taxis work
the route, making stops at all the hotel boat docks; fare: $2.
</P>
<P>
   The river also provides relief from Laughlin's legendary heat.
</P>
<P>
   The Earth, as it spins on its axis, lurches a few hundred miles
closer to the sun, as if tugged by a magnet, whenever Laughlin
comes around.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least it seems that way. In summer, the temperature is
routinely in the 110s, and the recorded high is 126.
</P>
<P>
   But visitors here don't seem to mind. They head for the water.
It's not unusual to see hotel guests take lawn chairs into the
river shallows, choosing depth in direct proportion to the height
of the thermometer reading.
</P>
<P>
   Speed boats also ply the river, but no one in his right mind
attempts to water ski here. That's because the traffic kicks up a
chop that would make the Irish Sea, by comparison, look like glass.
There are tour boats, water taxis and, of course, the current rage
of river recreation: personal watercraft.
</P>
<P>
   Jet Skis, Sea Doos and their ilk tear up and down the river,
generating an aural assault that can best be characterized as an
armada of water-bound leaf blowers.
</P>
<P>
   It can be treacherous out there. The thrill of a personal
watercraft is derived from careening through the wake of another
vessel, which means making sharp turns at high speed, often without
warning. And those motorized insects aren't equipped with side-view
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   If you're tempted to give one a whirl, they rent for just under
$50 an hour at several locations along the river walk. One rental
shack, across from the Regency Casino, has a list of 19 regulations
for anyone hopping aboard. But most of the rules seem to be broken
with impunity _ particularly the ones about wave jumping, reckless
use and maintaining a distance of at least 100 feet from other
craft.
</P>
<P>
   As for the insistence that riders not be under the influence of
alcohol, well, you don't want to know. Besides, a large sign on the
very side of the rental shack screams ``Last Stop for Budweiser'' _
an ad for the Regency bar just across the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   When the river toys are put aside for the day, the casinos
await, with air-conditioning systems that seem to puff against the
sweltering heat 24 hours a day. The Flamingo Hilton, in fact,
entices people who stroll the river walk by keeping two of its
casino doors swung wide open; the blast of cool air is
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't want to gamble nonstop _ or for those who
are too young to gamble at all _ Laughlin boasts numerous
diversions on dry land.
</P>
<P>
   Let Las Vegas have its various themes. This place has one, too:
suburban shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   The Riverside recently opened a 34-lane bowling alley to go with
its six-screen movie theater complex. It also launched a supervised
day-care center, where parents may drop their little ones (at $5
per head per hour) and be assured that the kids will be mesmerized
by Nintendo, Skeeball and Disney movies while the parents, drawn to
a different kind of recreation, delight in dealers having to hit on
a soft 17.
</P>
<P>
   Older travelers can find plenty to do as well. The Ramada
Express seems to target them specifically, presenting a
multifaceted promotion called ``Back to the 1940's.'' It includes
big-band music and dance programs, exhibits devoted to World War II
and a free multimedia show titled ``On the Wings of Eagles, A
Tribute to American Heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Flamingo Hilton recently, the evening entertainment in
the Vegas-style showroom was a fellow doing a Jimmy Durante
impersonation. But not the gravel-voiced act of the latter years.
This was a young Durante, delivering song, dance and one-liners
right out of the vaudeville days. Most of the crowd appeared
qualified to vouch for the authenticity of the portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   At the Riverside, the auto exhibit is another popular stop for
older patrons. One such visitor paused by a 1922 Model-T Depot Hack
with wood-spoke wheels and exclaimed, ``Oh, yes, my father had one
of these. You had to crank it (manually) to start it.''
</P>
<P>
   Can this area tap its niche market for continued expansion? The
founder isn't sure. ``I don't think we'll see the boomtown-type of
growth that we've seen,'' said Don Laughlin, citing burgeoning
Indian casinos in both California and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nevada's Gaming Control Board, Laughlin's casinos
have experienced a relatively flat gaming win over the last couple
of years. Casino gambling revenues were down 5 percent for fiscal
'97 and were down .04 percent for fiscal '98 (a period that ended
in June).
</P>
<P>
   That means the inducements for gamblers are sure to be stepped
up ever more: cash giveaways, car giveaways, club awards. Plus, of
course, the inexpensive food, drink, rooms and attractions that
have always been its hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism for the area maintaining its health is strong. ``The
whole Southwest is booming. We're getting some of that,'' said Don
Laughlin, whose property has climbed from 104 rooms in '75 to its
current 1,401.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be wise to underestimate this man ... or the town
named for him.
</P>
<P>
   Some 35 years ago, he looked down on a forbidding stretch of
river, then populated primarily by gnats and black flies, and
envisioned a modest gambling operation aimed at fishermen,
truckers, river's-edge campers. That site ballooned into one of the
fastest-growing communities in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing to say it won't maintain its appeal _ especially
if it keeps striking a nostalgic chord with the gamblers of today. &QL;

   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Laughlin lies along the Colorado River in the
extreme southern tip of Nevada, about 20 miles due north of
Needles. The drive from Los Angeles, via interstates 10, 15 and 40,
is a little over 300 miles. No airlines offer direct service from
Southern California to the small airport across the river in
Bullhead City, Ariz., but you can connect through Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AROUND: The nine hotel-casinos of Laughlin's gambling
strip are concentrated in a mile-plus stretch of Casino Drive.
Unlike Las Vegas, vehicle traffic tends to be light _ because so
many people use water taxis ($2 one way, $3 round trip) or walk
along a river walk that connects several of the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: It's possible to find midweek rates under $20, but
generally rooms go for $20 and up from Sunday through Thursday, at
least double that on weekends. Of Laughlin's nine major hotels, all
but the Ramada Express are situated on the river bank. Probably the
nicest hotel is Harrah's, which features a sandy beach and swimming
cove at the river's edge (mercifully, watercraft must slow to 5 mph
here). The Riverside maintains a convenient RV park directly across
Casino Drive from the hotel; rates are $17 daily plus tax, $95
weekly plus tax.
</P>
<P>
   TOURS, RECREATION: The Riverside, Edgewater and Flamingo hotels
offer river tours of about 80 minutes for $10; Harrah's charges
$13. There are a number of places to rent watercraft; expect to pay
$45-$50 per hour.DINING: The hotels have dueling inexpensive
buffets, and most also feature one upscale option _ often a
steakhouse. Nothing was found to be exceptional on a three-day
visit in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Laughlin Visitor Information Center can offer
assistance on a wide variety of inquiries, including lowest room
rates. It also has information brochures available for mailing. Its
Web site includes information on all lodging options. Phone: (800)
452-8445 or (702) 298-3321. Web: www.visitlaughlin.com.

POLL SHOWS HILLARY CLINTON GAINING WITH WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARA JAKES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton's approval rating among
New York women has surged since publicly addressing her husband's
infidelities, according to a poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a similar survey by Zogby International found that 42
percent of women voters across the state would vote against Clinton
should she run for the U.S. Senate against the Republican favorite,
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Now that number is down to 37 percent, while 50.1 percent of New
York women say they would vote for Clinton, according to the new
poll, which also was conducted by Zogby.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was released in the wake of this week's inaugural issue
of Talk magazine, in which the first lady discusses, for the first
time publicly, President Clinton's extramarital affairs. Fifty-five
percent of the state's registered voters are women.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the survey shows Hillary Clinton and Giuliani in a
statistical dead heat, each with 44 percent of the vote. Eleven
percent of the 761 likely state voters surveyed were undecided. The
poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.

   WASHINGTON _ People who flee big cities for the beach or the
mountains this summer are finding as much smog on vacation as they
left at home, according to a survey of government monitoring data
by environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the breezes at the beach are even more noxious than
the urban fumes, because the air arrives at the shore after loading
up with pollutants in the cities and baking for hours in this
summer's strong sun and relentless heat. And the mountaintop trails
wind along the Appalachian chain at the same altitudes where
pollution from the Midwest drifts by.
</P>
<P>
   The tip of Cape Cod, Mass., has had 11 smog violations this
summer, compared with four for Boston; the New Jersey Shore is tied
with Newark, N.J., for violations, and the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park has had more pollution than any city in the South,
except for Atlanta, according to the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the Hamptons, which are a playground for the wealthy, who
think they're getting away from the dirty city, has had almost as
many dirty days as New York City,'' said Jayne Mardock, an author
of the report, which was issued by the Clean Air Network and the
Clean Air Task Force. She and others called for tighter controls on
cars, especially sport-utility vehicles, and on power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The smog season is about half over, and this year is worse than
last, said Ms. Mardock. ``The heat wave that we've had this summer
has become a smog wave,'' she said. Nationally, since May 1, there
have been only 14 days when the smog standard was not exceeded
somewhere, she said. The report has only incomplete data for
California, and other data is preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   But Environmental Protection Administration Administrator Carol
Browner said that it was perfectly possible for the air to be worse
in the country than in the city. ``Pollution knows no boundaries,
and the long-distance transport of ozone is a very serious problem
in this country,'' she said. Smog can blow 300 or 400 miles, she
added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Smog is made mostly of ozone, a molecule of three oxygen atoms
that forms when the pollutants from cars, power plants and the like
mix in the air and react to bright sunlight and heat.
</P>
<P>
   So the same ingredients of the perfect summer _ beach traffic,
the hum of air conditioners going full blast, blue sky and hot sun
_ are a recipe for smog that irritates the eyes, sears the nasal
passages and hurts the lung's linings like a tinge of sunburn. The
combination is especially bad for people with asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Episodes of smog have reached higher peaks than usual in the
cloudless hot weather that has recently prevailed in most of the
East. Ms. Browner said that 1999 could turn out to be the worst
year for smog in this decade in the East.
</P>
<P>
   But formation usually takes several hours, during which time the
air drifts from where the pollution was emitted. Thus Narragansett,
R.I., a lovely beach spot downwind from New York and Stamford,
Conn., has had violations on eight days, vs. two in Providence, a
much bigger city.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management,
Stephen Majkut, the chief of the Office of Air Resources, said that
there were other contributing factors. One, he said, was weather
patterns that have held pollution close to the coast.
</P>
<P>
   But the basic problem, he said, is ``the whole pervasive
Northeast summertime ozone problem, which we've been working on for
any number of years now.''
</P>
<P>
   Majkut's counterpart in New Jersey, Andrew Mikula, said any part
of his state could have bad air, ``as long as it's downwind of a
major metropolitan area, which New Jersey usually is.''
</P>
<P>
   Breezes on Thursday were from onshore, he said, so beach air was
bad. He said that the state had had about 34 bad air days this
year, compared with 31 days through Aug. 5 of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Acadia National Park, in Maine, downwind from Boston, continues
to record very high smog levels. It is one of the most heavily
visited parks in the east, its mountaintop gazing to sea from Mount
Desert Island above Bar Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term solution, according to environmentalists, is
tighter controls on cars, especially sport-utility vehicles, and on
older coal-burning power plants in the midwest. In the meantime,
Paul Billings, a spokesman for the American Lung Association,
suggested that for people whose schedules are flexible but like the
beach, ``try to avoid the hottest parts of the summer for those
kinds of vacations. Look to September and October.''
</P>
<P>
   People who heed the advice of public health authorities and stay
inside when air is bad can watch ozone's progress on several
websites. The Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management,
which includes the New England states, New York and New Jersey,
displays air quality data for that region and some areas outside,
at www.nescaum.org. Another site, www.4cleanair.org, carries data
for the Middle Atlantic states, as far south as North Carolina.

`IRON MAN' MORE INTELLIGENT, THOUGHT-PROVOKING THAN USUAL KIDS'
FARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally _ a terrific summer film for kids.
</P>
<P>
   One that mixes fine writing _ the book ``The Iron Man'' by the
late British Poet Laureate Ted Hughes _ with the animated film
world.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes won more notoriety as the husband of feminist icon and
poet Sylvia Plath, who committed suicide in 1970. But his
children's stories, which depict the brutal world of animals and
nature, are as powerful as his book of poems on life with Plath
called ``The Birthday Letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he seems an ironic choice for kid's movie material. Maybe
that's why ``The Iron Giant'' is more intelligent and
thought-provoking than the usual dumb and dull-witted fare for
children.
</P>
<P>
   It's essentially ``Frankenstein'' updated into the paranoid Cold
War of the 1950s, but this time out there is a young boy named
Hogarth (voice of Eli Marienthal) involved.
</P>
<P>
   Hogarth lives with his single mom, Annie Hughes (Jennifer
Aniston) in the small town of Rockwell, Maine. When Hogarth
overhears a wild sea-tale from a crusty old sailor who believes he
spied a giant monster in the midst of a gale, he opts to believe
it's true.
</P>
<P>
   One dark night Hogarth stumbles upon this iron giant and the
pair become friends. He teaches the metal man to speak and helps
the big guy discover his humanity. What Hogarth doesn't know is
that this robot is fully equipped to decimate the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns kill,'' Hogarth teaches him after the pair spy hunters
murdering a beautiful deer and Iron Giant sees red. But the old
tar's tale has reached the ears of a special government bureau and
soon word of the robot's existence spreads and the town becomes
paranoid and fearful of this ``symbolic'' intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   When the army invades, the giant is faced with a dilemma:
annihilate the weapons that have been ordered to blow him away or
heed Hogarth's reminder that ``You don't have to be a gun; you can
be what you want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iron Giant's newfound will is surprisingly moving and shows
that even in a time of unreason and disorder, soul and heart come
from the most unexpected places.
</P>
<P>
   Director and animator Brad Bird lovingly illustrates the idyll
of American small-town life in the '50s while refusing to shirk
several unusual subplots _ single moms and the difficulty of life
as a bohemian artist in a time when ``men were men.'' And the
animation in ``The Iron Giant'' is beautiful and sometimes as
delicate, perfect and gorgeously lit as real life at sunrise or
dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, there is quite a lot to chew on for adults and kids
alike. ``The Iron Giant'' is more truthfully scary and full of
humanity (and humor) than the run of children's movies that show
violence without remorse. This is a film that allows some
destruction but also gives us an aftermath _ the loss of loved ones
_ and includes a huge dollop of regret and responsibility once
terrible acts are committed that could have been avoided with just
a moment's patience and, most of all, tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   The Iron Giant. Directed by Brad Bird. Written by Tim McCanlies.
Voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Vin Diesel,
Christopher McDonald. Warner Bros. 84 minutes. Rated PG for mild
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

PALESTINIANS PUZZLED ABOUT BARAK STALL ON WYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ By now, most Palestinians, and even some Israelis,
expected that Yasser Arafat would be president of an independent
Palestine comprising the West Bank and Gaza, with at least a token
piece of Jerusalem to call its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Israel and the Palestinians are still fighting over
details of the peace agreement signed in 1993 _ and updated,
changed, and delayed countless times since. A final peace agreement
was supposed to have been completed by May.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat, who turned 70 on Wednesday, seems to have decided he
no longer wants to debate already-signed agreements; instead, he
wants to see them implemented and is refusing to listen to Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's pleas for changes in the Wye accord signed
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's stance has befuddled many Palestinians, who do not know
whether the new prime minister is willing to give up territory but
just wants to do it his own way _ or whether this is an attempt to
thwart the Palestinians' takeover of land they were already
promised.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Authority officials characterize Barak's latest
moves as disappointing, particularly efforts to change the
US-mediated Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Israelis are unsure of Barak's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this just an irritating delay or a major breakdown?'' said
Barry Rubin, a Middle East specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complicated situation and we still don't know yet what
exactly Barak has in mind,'' said Rubin, who has written a book on
Palestinian politics that will be published in September by Harvard
University Press.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who spent much of the past three years waiting for
former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stop what critics
called stalling on the peace process, is not in the mood to give
Barak the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In a weeklong round of trips, meetings, and speeches, Arafat
made clear he will not agree to changes in the accord, under which
Israel is supposed to turn over another 13 percent of the West Bank
to partial or full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   His refusal to consider anything else has already sparked angry
words between the two sides, reminiscent of the mistrust that
existed during Netanyahu's administration. Netanyahu carried out
the first redeployment under Wye and then suspended the accord,
claiming the Palestinians were not doing enough to stop armed
militants opposed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who took office in July amid promises to make the
Palestinians real partners in the peace process, now says he is
worried about leaving Jewish settlements isolated by
Palestinian-controlled land, as will happen after the Israeli
redeployments.
</P>
<P>
   Barak proposed delaying the next withdrawal until October and
putting off the third Wye withdrawal until the two sides have
reached some agreements on the final peace accord, which will deal
with issues like what to do with the Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Israeli military source said the fear was that isolated
Jewish settlements would be vulnerable to attack. In the past,
attacks by Palestinian groups opposed to the peace process have
soured the atmosphere and often delayed the whole process.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Palestinians, the settlements are at the core of the
dispute over how much land the expected state will comprise.
Palestinians in the West Bank, whose farm-land is confiscated for
roads for the settlers or swallowed by settlement expansion, see no
reason to do something special for people who say they are opposed
to the land-for-peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians are also waiting for the start of free movement
between Palestinian-ruled Gaza and the West Bank _ Palestinians now
need permission, which Israel does not give easily _ something also
promised in the Wye accords.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Arafat is shoring up his support to make it
clear that when he speaks, he speaks for all Palestinians and that
Barak should not think the Palestinians are weak, divided, or can
be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat went to Egypt this week to meet opposition Palestinian
groups that reject the Oslo peace accords. While the sides are not
reconciled, conciliatory statements coming out of the meeting were
a sign that Arafat remains the one person who can gather support
for a final peace accord, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Arafat's position is assured. A new poll by a
Palestinian research group put support for Arafat at 44 percent _
but support for the nearest rival, the Islamist Hamas's Sheik Ahmet
Yassin, was only 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What's less assured are his options if Barak refuses to adhere
to the Wye accords. Arafat's tough statements cannot hide the fact
that he has few cards to play, specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat probably will look to US Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright to help him pressure Barak into carrying out the Wye
accord, which was signed in Washington after personal intervention
by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   She is expected in Israel Aug. 14 for a four-day visit that will
include trips to Jordan and Syria. The United States is eager to
help restart peace talks between Syria and Israel, but Albright
could instead find herself trying to defuse a new
Israeli-Palestinian crisis.

ALTMAN TO MOVE TO MISSOURI REP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Mo.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Peter Altman, the producing director of the Huntington
Theatre, will be assuming the reins of the Missouri Repertory
Theatre in Kansas City a year from now. The theater is in the same
League of Resident Theatres category as the Huntington _ LORT B _
although it is not considered in the same league artistically.
</P>
<P>
   The move, then, comes as something of a surprise to those in the
Boston theater community who thought Altman would be moving to a
bigger theater than the Huntington. ``I really wanted a new
situation,'' said Altman by phone Thursday, reaffirming that he
didn't have another situation in mind when he announced his
decision to leave the Huntington last year. ``I thought there was
the potential to take an institution forward, and I like the
challenge of making the progress that needs to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Altman, 56, has been the only artistic director at the
Huntington since its inception and will be here through next
season, his and the Huntington's 18th. He has a strong-minded view
of theater, and he expects to carry that vision forward in Kansas
City, where his title will be producing artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to be very responsive to the community you
serve,'' Altman said. ``You have to learn what it likes, what it's
had before. No doubt I'll try to find some Kansas City- or
Midwest-based plays, but I still believe in the diversity of
America and finding plays that reflect that diversity; I believe in
an international sector of programming and that will continue; I
believe in musical theater; and I'm certainly committed to classic
plays that are done with respect for the text.'' Among the artists
who've reflected those categories at the Huntington are August
Wilson, Tom Stoppard, Gilbert and Sullivan, and Friedrich von
Schiller, with this season's ``Mary Stuart.''
</P>
<P>
   As for plays that fit a community's life, the Huntington is
premiering an adaptation of ``The Last Hurrah'' this season. Altman
will continue to look for coproductions in Kansas City and thought
that the Huntington could be a future partner, depending on its
choice of a new artistic director, which should be made in the next
few months.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that an artistic director can be too far
ahead of his audience, he pledged that there wouldn't be any
condescension in his selections: ``There won't be any `Harveys,' ''
he laughed, referring to audience grabbers that theater companies
produce for box office enhancement. ``Or Mamet,'' he added,
referring to David Mamet, whom Altman has never particularly liked
and therefore has not produced.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Rep has a 733-seat theater and the use of smaller
theaters at the University of Missouri at Kansas City. As the
Huntington is associated with Boston University, the Missouri Rep
is aligned with UMKC, and Altman will also be in charge of the
school's theater program.
</P>
<P>
   Altman is certainly a coup for the Kansas City theater, which is
trying to increase its profile in the world of resident theaters,
and both the university and Altman are eager for him to continue
his work with playwrights, directors, and designers he championed
at the Huntington. The Missouri Rep currently has a $4 million
budget, which it will be increasing incrementally over the next few
years to a size that approaches the Huntington's $6 million budget.
The Kansas City Star reports Altman will be earning $144,000 in
salary and benefits, which is thought to be in the same ballpark of
what he was earning at the Huntington.
</P>
<P>
   The university affiliation is surprising to some, since there
have been longstanding rumors of friction between Altman and BU
that may even have contributed to his decision to leave. ``The
difference,'' said Altman, ``is that the training program is
primarily a graduate program. I must say that's attractive, a
program that emphasizes more advanced students. I would also become
the producing director of the university theaters and have the
opportunity of supervision and oversight; I don't have to be the
chairman myself. The structure is different in that at BU the
director of the theater program reports to a dean, and in this case
the director will be overseen by me.''
</P>
<P>
   Altman denied, though, that problems with BU or other
frustrations were the reason he's leaving. ``There are always going
to be some people who wonder about it, but the main thing is it's
good to leave at a time when things are successful and to find a
new opportunity that's invigorating. I certainly had a wonderful
time at the Huntington doing the work I've enjoyed doing.'' As for
Kansas City, ``I love learning about a new place, what's specific
to it. My impressions are positive, and I'm curious to learn more
and have the experience of discovering it.''

BUSH TO TARGET HISPANIC VOTES IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Texas Governor George W. Bush, who has staked his
reputation as the clear GOP frontrunner on winning next week's
Republican straw poll in Ames, has unveiled what he hopes is his
secret weapon of support here: the state's small but active
Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this has ever been done in Iowa before,'' Bush
said at a meeting with a few dozen Hispanics here. ``I want your
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   While only about 53,000 out of Iowa's nearly 3 million people
are of Hispanic origin, Bush spent an hour Thursday in a Holiday
Inn conference room in Des Moines meeting with Hispanics, including
community leaders and more than a dozen workers from the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Hispanic population has been growing quickly,
largely because of the state's labor shortage, represented by a 2.5
percent unemployment rate. Many of the new arrivals come from Texas
and Florida, where Bush and his brother, Jeb, are governors of
those states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to make an active effort to reach out to the
Hispanic community,'' said Bush, who switched between English and
Spanish in his remarks. ``I did so in the state of Texas, and I am
going to do so in the state of Iowa and in other states. I am
trying to broaden the base of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides dismissed suggestions that governor was trying to
make amends with the Hispanic community for failing to show up last
month at a Texas meeting of leading Latino organization called La
Raza, or a Corpus Christi meeting of the League of United Latin
American Citizens. In both cases, Bush said he had scheduling
conflicts. Bush's meeting was open to the press, highlighting an
effort by the campaign to publicize the candidate's relationship
with the Hispanic community. A Bush aide denied reports that the
meeting was opened only at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Bush has strong support from Hispanics in
Texas. In his 1998 reelection, Bush received between 41 percent to
49 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to exit surveys, an
extraordinarily high number for a Republican. Bush's strategy for
winning the nomination and the general election rests significantly
on continuing to get strong support from Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to gauge the depth of Bush's support among
Hispanics in Iowa. At Thursday's event, perhaps 30 Hispanic leaders
and another dozen hotel workers listened to Bush as the candidate
stood under a sign that said ``Un Nuevo Dia'' _ A New Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Reverend Roberto Mendez, of the Rivers of Living Water
church in Des Moines, said Bush can count on significant support
from Hispanics. Mendez, a recent arrival from Florida, said many
people in the community are familiar with Bush and are pleased with
his immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not break any new ground in his discussion with
Hispanics, but he promised to ``revisit'' the question of whether
undocumented immigrants should be given the right to become
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   When a woman in the audience asked Bush about his immigration
policy, the candidate offered only vague language about how ``the
dream is meant for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you give us some specifics?'' the woman asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Bush replied, using a favorite line, ``every child
ought to be educated.''

Bang, You're Dead' is not part of my professional career.'' At the
same time, his play about high school homicide has provided him
with some of the most ``sensational, fulfilling moments'' he ever
expects to experience in his life as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   Mastrosimone, 51, lives in Enumclaw, Wash.. He writes in a
converted barn with a view of Mount Rainier. Deer, elk and even
bears and mountain lions are among the neighbors he sees around his
property from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   But even in this bucolic setting, fear of murder at school can
be a scary possibility. Mastrosimone and his wife, Sharon, have
four children, two boys and two girls. Last year they were startled
to learn that someone had written on a blackboard in the junior
high school attended by one of their sons, ``I'm going to kill
everyone in this class. And the teacher, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sleep that night,'' Mastrosimone said in an
interview earlier this week. ``I'm a playwright. So what can I do?
That night I wrote a play, or at least the first draft of a play.''
</P>
<P>
   That draft turned into ``Bang, Bang, You're Dead,'' a fictional
drama that reminds audiences of recent school murder sprees in
Littleton, Colo., Jonesboro, Ark., Springfield, Ore., and Paducah,
Ky. Since its premiere early this year, ``Bang, Bang'' has been
produced by something like 4,000 groups of young people all over
the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Children's Theatre's youth acting program will stage
``Bang, Bang'' Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The play focuses on Josh, an angry high school freshman who has
killed five of his schoolmates. The dead literally come back to
haunt Josh in his jail cell. At first he blows them off with
smart-aleck zingers. But eventually he realizes his homicidal spree
was not a video game or a 3-D version of an action/adventure
revenge movie. Trivia and cheap thrills turn into real tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Mastrosimone achieved national recognition with his unusual
revenge drama, ``Extremities,'' which was first a play and then a
1986 movie starring Farrah Fawcett and James Russo. Like many
playwrights, Mastrosimone supports his interest in writing for the
stage with income from TV and film projects.
</P>
<P>
   Mastrosimone is not exactly sure how often ``Bang, Bang, You're
Dead'' has been produced. The play was published in a unique way.
The text can be downloaded, free, from a Web site
(bangbangyouredead.com). Anyone can produce it. Some 16,000
downloads have been recorded to date. The only stipulation
regarding use of the material is that productions must be
not-for-profit. Mastrosimone makes nothing from the show in the way
of fees and royalties, which is why ``Bang, Bang'' is not really a
milestone in his ``professional career.''
</P>
<P>
   Producers may not even sell refreshments in their theaters.
``This is entirely a way of focusing on a particular issue,''
Mastrosimone says. ``It's not a fund-raiser. It's not about
somebody's ego. I've turned down TV and film offers. This is by
kids, about kids, for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was developing ``Bang, Bang,'' Mastrosimone approached
the drama department of Thurston High School in Springfield. ``I
had the shell of the play,'' he says. ``I realized the kids at
Thurston could give it the emotional content.''
</P>
<P>
   At first there was resistance. The title was offensive. The
events were offensive. The timing was offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, the drama teacher, Mike Fisher, is a real regular
guy,'' Mastrosimone says. ``He's the teacher who tackled Kip Kinkel
when he was shooting in the school cafeteria. Mike had done my play
`Extremities' in college. I'm one of his favorite writers. So he
was willing to give it a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a community meeting. Lots of people spoke against
it. But by then the kids were really dedicated to the project. They
said that they'd do it in the streets or in the parks if they
couldn't do it in the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal, Larry Benz, is one of my all-time heroes. He
said we'll take this real slow and see how things work out. I
thought he'd simply cancel the whole venture. But no.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and his cast rehearsed in secret. ``The auditorium was
locked,'' Mastrosimone says. ``Not even the janitor was allowed to
see what they were doing. When they were ready, the cast brought in
an invited audience, about 100 community leaders, police chiefs,
fire chiefs, teachers, doctors, people who had been in the thick of
the massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   Mastrosimone was in the back of the auditorium. Like any
playwright watching a run-through of a new play, he had his laptop
computer open, ready for notes. ``About 30 seconds into it,'' he
says, ``I closed my computer. It was clear to me that something
very special was going on. I just watched in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end no one applauded. What's wrong? I started down the
side aisle, so I could see people's faces. Everyone seemed to be
reaching for a Kleenex or a handkerchief or wiping their nose on a
sleeve. Then they were jumping up to hug the kids in the cast. I
mean cops and fireman and professional people _ not folks you'd
expect to be real emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Mastrosimone had touched a nerve. Subsequent responses
confirmed his satisfaction with ``Bang, Bang.'' ``As a writer for
non-profits or the commercial stage, I try to be economical, keep
the cast to six or less,'' Mastrosimone says. ``But high school
drama clubs are not concerned with actors' salaries. There are
none. The more roles the better. I popped into a production in
Southern California and, my lord, it looked like they had
Napoleon's army up there on the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Writers Guild of America, Mastrosimone has been
rethinking his position on Hollywood aesthetics and ethics. He
wrote an article for the June/July issue of the association's
magazine, ``Confessions of a Violent Movie Writer.'' ``The essay
caused such a stir that it's being reprinted in the August issue,
something that publication just doesn't do, normally.''
</P>
<P>
   Mastrosimone's sons are 12 and 15. ``I am sometimes aghast at
the movies they see on television,'' he says. ``I try to watch with
them and talk to them about the violence. I find humor, making fun
of the material, sometimes works.''
</P>
<P>
   Mastrosimone recalls seeing the movies ``Natural Born Killers''
and ``Pulp Fiction'' with his wife. They were startled when the
audience cheered and laughed during scenes of grotesque violence.
And yet, Mastrosimone notes, mayhem-as-entertainment is even more
extreme in video games like Quake and Doom.
</P>
<P>
   A new play by Mastrosimone, ``Like Totally Weird,'' is a
satirical comedy drama about Hollywood's exploitation of the
malleable imaginations of young males. A Quentin Tarantino type
meets two of his rabid fans. The results are not fun for all.
Mastrosimone expects a Broadway production of ``Like Totally
Weird'' this fall and a movie within a year after the stage
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of studies have shown the correlation between
fantasy violence and real violence,'' Mastrosimone says. ``We
create monsters. We poison the souls of kids. The Paducah killer
was definitely trying to act out `The Basketball Diaries.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies are ignored. Well, the pharmaceutical industry finally
got nailed. The tobacco industry got nailed. The car industry got
nailed. The entertainment industry may be next. Parents are
passionate about their children's safety. You ask them to chose
between their kids' safety and the First Amendment and it's no
contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Bang, Bang, You're Dead'' is not part of Mastrosimone's
``professional career,'' it has brought him a unique professional
satisfaction. ``Four kids got in touch with me through the
Internet,'' he says. ``Three had seen the play. One had read it.
They all confided that they had their hit lists. But the play made
them change their minds. Wow! And if four get in touch with me, how
many have had the same response but kept quiet about it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied.''

DRUG THAT IDENTIFIES CANCER CELLS IN LUNGS OK'D 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KRISTIN VAUGHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new drug made by a New Hampshire company that lights up cancer
cells could help doctors determine if patients with suspicious
chest X-rays need a biopsy for lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   NeoTect, made by Londonderry-based Diatide Inc., was approved
Wednesday by the US Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't replace biopsy. It is supposed to be used as an
adjunct with an abnormal chest X-ray or CT scan,'' said Dr.
Florence Houn, director of the FDA's Office of Drug Evaluation III.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are injected with a teaspoon-size amount of the drug
which floats through the body searching for basket-shaped receptors
found atop proteins that are produced by many types of lung
cancers. A common nuclear-medicine camera then feeds the image to a
computer screen or an X-ray-like film where the image of the lung
lights up to show where cancer cells or located. If there are no
cancer cells, the drug flows through the body.
</P>
<P>
   Richard T. Dean, president and CEO of Diatide Inc., said that it
works with the X-rays and CT scans to if suspicious masses that
appear could be cancerous tumors or maybe just scar tissue.
</P>
<P>
   `This takes the technology to the next level. X-rays can tell if
there is an abnormal mass in the body, but it can't tell what it
is. It could be a tumor, a blood clot or a golf ball. With NeoTect,
if it is a cancer, it will light up and if it is not malignant the
patient doesn't have to go through invasive procedures like surgery
and biopsies.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean said that in addition to detecting cancer cells, NeoTect
can also help doctors determine if there are other areas that have
cancer cells and it can be used as a follow-up procedure with
cancer patients to see if treatments are working effectively or if
cancer has spread.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Dr. Bruce Johnson, Director of Lowe Center For
ThoracicOncology at Dana Farber Cancer Institute said that the drug
could potentially be the most helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The drug could help cut down on the amount of tests cancer
patients need to determine whether it has spread outside of the
lung, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually do a number of tests to make sure that it hasn't
spread outside of the lung by doing a CT scan to image the liver,
brain, bone scan...about three If you do the test and pick
something up, you could do it in one test,'' Johnsons said. Houn
said that ``We (FDA) think it's an important new diagnostic tool.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Diatide Inc. had its application put through a
``priority review'' by the FDA, a fast-tracking approval approach
done for only about 10 to 20 percent of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Houn said that it is commonly done with drugs that could be of
significant benefit to life threatening diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer is the number one cancer in women and men in the
United States. More than 170,000 have been diagnosed with the
disease. Biopsies in which lung tissue is surgically removed allows
doctors to diagnose the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Houn said the help that it can help patients and doctors make
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are wondering, `Could this be cancer or something
benign, this test can help,'' ' Houn said. ``If you are not sure if
it is a scar, this can help when you are stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   In active NASDAQ trading Diatide stock fell 5/8, to 6 1/8 with
more than 253,000 shares _ more than three times its average daily
volume _ changing hands.

 &HT;    Veteran never saw action, but plenty of death at Nagasaki
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Somewhere in the Pacific, Motor
Machinist's Mate 3rd Class J. Norman Ingram read a mimeographed
news summary as it passed from hand to hand aboard the USS
Waukesha.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never heard the phrase, `atomic bomb,''' Ingram says,
recalling how he learned about the devastation of Hiroshima on Aug.
6, 1945. ``But it sounded like it was just what we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than four years after being jolted into World War II by
disaster at Pearl Harbor, America had Japan in a tight squeeze. By
late July, the 3rd Fleet had sailed straight into Tokyo Bay,
launching explosive shells onto shore. Waves of B-29s firebombed
city after city.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Japan refused to surrender, although it had nearly
stopped fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   ``By patiently biding our time,'' announced a Japanese broadcast
beamed toward America, ``we are taking the strategy of preserving
our aircraft for the coming decisive battle of the homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect was ominous: Japan still had 8,000 warplanes and 2
million soldiers. American ships were being attacked by torpedoes
and suicide dive-bombers. ``We were told they'd fight until they
had nothing to eat but rocks,'' Ingram says.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram believed it. He still does.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Navy in 1944, right after graduation from Palm
Beach High School, just in time to be trained for Operation
Downfall _ the invasion of Japan. He drew a perilous assignment,
ferrying troops ashore on an LCM (landing craft, mechanized).
</P>
<P>
   He got a firsthand preview of those perils as the Waukesha, a
cargo ship outfitted for attack, docked at Guam, Guadalcanal and
other battle sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw any action,'' says Ingram, now living in Palm
Beach Gardens. ``The fighting was over when we got to each of these
places. But we saw plenty of death. I saw the caves where the
Japanese had dug in and refused to come out. I saw their skulls.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingram, and everyone back home in America, thought the fight
might be over for good when the first A-bomb exploded over
Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   (SET ITAL, BREAK)WASHINGTON, AP _ The most terrible destructive
force ever harnessed by man _ atomic energy _ is now being turned
on the islands of Japan by United States bomber. The Japanese face
a threat of utter desolation and their capitulation may be greatly
speeded up.(END ITAL, BREAK)
</P>
<P>
   Three days passed with no surrender. On Aug. 9, a B-29 loaded
with a second A-bomb headed for the steel-making center at Kokura.
Cloudy skies diverted the flight to the backup target, the shipyard
city of Nagasaki. Meanwhile, Russia declared war on Japan and
launched an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Another day passed after the second A-bomb blast before Japan
offered to surrender, but only if Emperor Hirohito could keep his
throne. President Truman repeated the Allied demand for
unconditional surrender and ordered conventional bombing to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese finally gave up on Aug. 14. They got to keep their
emperor with a couple of conditions they didn't ask for: He would
take orders from American Gen. Douglas MacArthur, and he would
insist that his subjects do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The invasion force became an occupation force. Ingram's ship
sailed into Tokyo Bay and docked at the battered Yokosuka Naval
Base on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what to expect,'' he says. Although Japan had
surrendered, no treaty had been signed. ``To be honest, I was
frightened,'' Ingram says. ``We wondered if they'd let the fleet
sail in and then try to trap us.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no tricks. The ship dropped off troops and equipment
and returned to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram and the Waukesha came back to Japan with another load of
Marines on Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The port: Nagasaki.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small crew of sailors needed to unload cargo went ashore
with a Marine occupation force. They were ordered to take no
pictures, but Ingram pretended not to hear. He'd been carrying a
palm-size camera since he left home, sending back film of exotic
locales to his parents in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the pictures, and the way I described it, it was like a
pleasure cruise,'' he says. ``I didn't want to worry them.''
</P>
<P>
   There was supposed to be little time spent in Nagasaki, but a
choppy tide stranded the crew for most of a day. It was enough time
for Ingram and shipmates to wander from the southern port to the
north side of the city, where the bomb fell.
</P>
<P>
   No one warned them about radiation. They weren't given special
suits or helmets or breathing gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we were the first Americans in Nagasaki after the
bomb,'' Ingram says. ``I'd never seen anything like it. No one
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Flattened buildings. Shattered concrete. Seared grass.
</P>
<P>
   Bodies everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weeks after the bomb, and people were still dying,''
Ingram says. ``The stench was awful, unforgettable.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of death within days of the explosion are as high as
70,000; as many died in following years from radiation. Concern for
his parents caused Ingram to turn his camera away from the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Although more powerful than Hiroshima's bomb, Nagasaki's did
less damage because the hilly terrain shielded some of the
concussion. ``On one side of a hill, everything would be intact,
and the other side would be destroyed,'' Ingram says.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram photographed a number of survivors, but always in the
background. Some stared; some ran away. None showed anger.
``Mostly, they seemed to be afraid of us,'' Ingram says.
</P>
<P>
   The Waukesha was at sea again in less than a week. Ingram was at
home in two years, going to work at his father's grocery store.
He's found no ill effects from radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his mates weren't as lucky. Cancer is a big topic at
reunions. ``We've lost a lot of men from that ship because of that
bomb,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 years passed before the federal government
acknowledged the radiation hazards of such duty. The National
Association of Atomic Veterans says it has documented high cancer
rates among veterans of the atomic occupation zones and later
A-bomb test sites. The group has continued to lobby for more tests
and increased benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his concerns about radiation, Ingram isn't swayed by
revisionist historians who argue that the war could have been won
without using the atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hear that from veterans,'' he says. ``You don't hear
it from people who would have had to take part in an invasion. If
it weren't for the bomb, I don't think I'd be alive.

 &HT;    Troops weren't guarding Enola Gay but plane's cargo
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On Tinian Island in the Pacific, late
July 1945: I'd just completed my 35th combat mission against the
Japanese and was being processed for my journey home.
</P>
<P>
   Something strange occurred that none of us could understand. One
area of the island was sealed and completely off limits to all
personnel. Being curious, we got as close as we could. All that was
visible were two B-29s with armed troops, probably 10 or 15 around
both planes.
</P>
<P>
   A few of us had been in the B-29 program from its inception.
What could be so secretive about two very familiar-looking B-29s?
</P>
<P>
   Long story short, I arrived home (Miami) around Aug. 1, 1945.
The news came over the radio Aug. 6 that a super bomb had been
dropped on Hiroshima and later on Nagasaki. Both of these attacks
came from Tinian Island.
</P>
<P>
   I knew then and there that one of the B-29s I saw from some
distance was the Enola Gay. The secret wasn't the planes; it was
the bomb. _ William Boyer, Palm Beach Gardens
</P>
<P>
   I was co-pilot on a B-24 flying a mission on the island of
Kyushu the day the first atomic bomb was dropped. We had orders not
to go within 15 miles of Hiroshima, with no explanation. Flying at
12,000 feet, we had an unobstructed view of the huge mushroom cloud
rising from the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   We decided it must be a huge raid on Hiroshima, but we did not
know the truth until we returned to our base on Okinawa and learned
it was one bomb. _ Roger R. Farlow, Fort Pierce
</P>
<P>
   Development of atomic weapons continued after the war with the
first peacetime test at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands.
</P>
<P>
   I was the flight navigator on a crew assigned to fly observers
to the test during the last week of June 1946. We picked up our
passengers at Hamilton Field, Marin County, Calif. We then flew to
Hickam Field, Honolulu and on to Kwajelein Island in the Marshall
Islands. Our passengers included a general, an admiral and a
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Flying within 5 to 8 miles of the blast, we circled the area,
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   We were given special glasses and told not to look directly at
the blast. After the blast, we could observe the white mushroom
cloud. After circling for about a half-hour, we returned to
Kwajelein Island. _ Ralph Langley, West Palm Beach

EX-FBI AGENT SAYS HE ACTED LEGALLY IN HANDLING MOB INFORMANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c. 1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Former FBI Agent John Connolly reiterated Thursday
that he did nothing to violate policies or laws in his handling of
James ``Whitey'' Bulger as an informant against the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly was responding to remarks made by FBI Director Louis
Freeh during a visit to the Boston office of the FBI on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly has been under investigation by a special task force of
agents from the FBI and other federal agencies that is looking for
evidence of crimes by anyone who dealt with Bulger and Stephen
``The Rifleman'' Flemmi over the decades that they were FBI
informants.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time during my entire career did I engage in any conduct
in violation of those policies or existing laws,'' Connolly said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony during lengthy hearings last year before US District
Judge Mark L. Wolf indicated that gifts, including wine, were
exchanged among Bulger and Connolly and his FBI supervisor John
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who testified under a grant of immunity from
prosecution, also acknowledged that he accepted as much as $7,000
in cash from Bulger that he never repaid. Morris also claimed that
Bulger and Flemmi had been tipped off to investigations, a charge
Connolly has steadfastly denied.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly maintains that everything he did with Bulger ``was done
with the full knowledge, approval, and direction of my superiors in
the Department of Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the events involving Bulger date back to the
1970s and 1980s, Freeh said the task force is trying to determine
whether there is any evidence that falls within the statute of
limitations and could be used to prosecute agents who dealt with
the informants.

Democrats are against it. Rarely have both parties sounded equally
confident about the political benefits they think their policies,
decided on principle alone, of course, will bring. With each side

Suddenly, some 50,000 people a year started coming to the baseball

 &HT;    `Crown' remake is a well-polished gem
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Admit it. Old movies gave us our only
chance to learn how the other half lives. They taught many of us
which fork to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' is an old-fashioned movie featuring
sleek stars playing sophisticated characters. But the zillionaire
Mr. Crown of the title is not someone to emulate. He's a thief. For
the hell of it.
</P>
<P>
   This enjoyable romantic caper is a remake of the 1968 movie. It
has Pierce Brosnan in the Steve McQueen role of the bored
gentleman-thief and Rene Russo as the insurance investigator who
must decide whether to nab him or marry him, a role originally
played by Faye Dunaway.
</P>
<P>
   The flick has all the virtues of old-school filmmaking. Although
the plot has a few forgivable holes in it, the film is crisply
paced, with smart dialogue and stylish settings. Even the songs fit
perfectly, beginning with Bill Conti's bouncy jazz score and ending
with an upbeat ``Windmills Of Your Mind'' (also in the first
movie). And another virtue in this summer of dung-stirrers, the
film is free of gross twits.
</P>
<P>
   As Thomas Crown, Brosnan is a very cool customer _ a self-made
man who has earned millions in corporate acquisitions. He lives in
a beautiful New York penthouse and _ geez _ even has a man servant.
</P>
<P>
   He's a true sophisticate, a man who has everything, including a
case of ennui. ``A big day for him is taking off his tie,'' someone
observes. So, to amuse himself, Crown plans an elaborate heist of a
multimillion-dollar Monet from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Russo as Catherine Banning, a hot-shot insurance
investigator not afraid to use her obvious charms to get her man.
She has some run-ins with a police detective on the case, played
nicely by Denis Leary with a minimum of smart-mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the film is her confrontations with Thomas
Crown. The pair are well-matched, and after some amusing
intellectual fencing, and a bit of steamy rump-wiggling at a
charity ball, they fall in love. This presents a dilemma for the
lady when Crown sets out to return the painting to the museum in
another clever if improbable caper.
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan is a very likable mogul, exuding quiet confidence and a
good deal of bemusement. And like his other character _ James Bond
_ he looks good in a suit.
</P>
<P>
   Russo is delectable. Although a hard-core snoop, her Catherine
charms us with a bag of little tricks _ a cute smile here, a giggle
there. Faye Dunaway makes a welcome cameo appearance as Crown's
bemused therapist.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also charms through small, comedic touches, such as a
simple shot of two pairs of feet after a night of lovemaking. The
heists are exciting, and it's doubtful that people will guess how
Crown plans to return the Monet. But the film is basically
lighthearted, with perhaps a touch more emphasis placed on the
romance than the capers.
</P>
<P>
   The director is John McTiernan, known for action films such as
``Die Hard'' and ``The Hunt for Red October.'' He proves he can
also shoot romance. He's fond of close-ups and does some nifty
quick-cuts during the heist. And there's the must-do, revolving
overhead shot, lifted from the original film.
</P>
<P>
   Like the original, ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' is an affair to
remember _ classy, clever and thoroughly entertaining.

   DYERSVILLE, Iowa _ All that really happened here is that someone
shot a movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the house where Elvis was born. Or the theater where
Lincoln was shot. In fact, what is striking is how people can get
nostalgic over make-believe these days, steered by the emotional
pull of a vivid Hollywood invention.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not how people here see it. They consider themselves
custodians of a slice of the American dream. They paint it as a
battle between entrepreneurial freedom and the moment that a
landmark, even a made-up landmark, becomes too commercial.
</P>
<P>
   And since it is an American story, it is, of course, also about
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The place is a cornfield in eastern Iowa where Hollywood built
the set of ``Field of Dreams.'' The 1989 movie was a sensation _ a
fanciful, sentimental story of a farmer (Kevin Costner) who hears a
voice telling him to build a baseball diamond in his field _ ``If
you build it, he will come'' _ and is rewarded with the magical
appearance of his dead father and the unfairly maligned Shoeless
Joe Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, some 50,000 people a year did start coming to the
baseball diamond in the cornfield.
</P>
<P>
   People still come, but now the object of their pilgrimage is
ensnared in a bitter disagreement between the farm couple who own
most of the outfield and the farm couple who own most of the
infield. One side feels the other has over-commercialized things,
and is going to court to try to stop that trend.
</P>
<P>
   The rift has other symptoms. Each side, for instance, has its
own entrance sign. Don and Becky Lansing, who own right field, most
of the infield and the white farmhouse used in the movie, have a
sign proclaiming their property the ``Original Field of Dreams
Movie Site'' and calling the gravel road to their side the ``main
entrance.''
</P>
<P>
   Steps away, on a parallel gravel road, Al and Rita Ameskamp, who
own left field, most of center field, third base and the cornfield
from which the movie's phantom ballplayers emerge, have a sign
promoting ``Left and Center Field of Dreams'' and directing
visitors to ``enter here.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side has a gift shop, with the Lansings selling white
pickets from the movie fence for $25 apiece and the Ameskamps
selling $2 vials of ``dream dirt'' from the field, complete with an
``affidavit of authenticity'' signed by Al and Rita. Both shops,
incidentally, sell ``temperature-sensitive'' T-shirts featuring a
cornfield that reveal baseball players when the shirts get warm.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, for the movie's 10th anniversary, the Ameskamps
wanted to attract tourists with a maze in their cornfield shaped
like Shoeless Joe. They got their property rezoned for it, and
since July 31 they have charged visitors $6 to walk through.
</P>
<P>
   To the Lansings, who say they want the movie site to be
authentic and not over-commercialized, this was the last straw. The
couple, who no longer allow organized events, like ball games, on
the infield, are suing to try to prevent attractions like the maze
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we want to do, they say no,'' Mrs. Ameskamp
lamented. ``Sometimes it brings tears to your eyes. We love our
Field of Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lansing, who says her side wants only to make enough money
to keep up the site, was asked if the two farms could mend fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to make communist countries and non-communist
countries come together?'' she retorted. ``What's going to make men
and women come together? What's going to make blacks and whites
come together? We're just trying to protect this piece of heaven.
We want to tell the world that preserving historical sites is
important.''
</P>
<P>
   This friction saddens the author of the book on which ``Field of
Dreams'' was based, W.P. Kinsella, who is on Christmas card terms
with both families and is not offended by the corn maze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad that they can't get along, because I think they
both sort of want the same thing,'' he said. ``The Lansings sell
souvenirs and stuff, so what's the difference? People expect that
sort of thing from a tourist attraction. If I were the Lansings, I
would certainly make a buck out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinsella noted that in his ook, ``Shoeless Joe,'' and the
movie, the seemingly foolhardy economic step of plowing up corn for
a ball field draws people willing to pay $20 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go by the book, by my book,'' he said. ``If I owned
the property, I'd be charging $20. After all, this is America.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, for a figment of Hollywood and a tourist site
that could easily get smothered in kitsch, the Field of Dreams is
remarkably unspoiled. Anyone can come for free and hit balls, run
bases or stroll the cornfield where James Earl Jones, Ray Liotta
and Burt Lancaster disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a highway billboard (paid for by the Lansings) and
competing tourist brochures and Web sites, there is little
promotional hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   And people go miles out of their way to recapture the movie's
nostalgic air, rekindle father-son relationships or play ball with
tourists they don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Paul DuCharme, who brought his two young sons from Chicago, said
the experience reminded him of playing catch with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Joye Giroux, making a detour with her daughter and grandson on a
trip from North Carolina to Wyoming, said the tension between the
farms was sad. ``It's the American way, I guess,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ball field was built on two farms because the movie people
liked the sunset in that direction. After the filming, Lansing
built the first souvenir stand. Ameskamp plowed under his portion
and planted corn for a year or two, until tourists asked for the
outfield back.

EMC TO STEP UP SOFTWARE MARKETING EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EMC Corp. will boost its efforts to market software to other
companies, a move it hopes will increase sales of its information
storage hardware as well.
</P>
<P>
   EMC previously sold only a few outsiders portions of its code,
pieces known as software ``hooks.'' These are needed to write
programs around the big Symmetrix disk-drive systems EMC sells to
major banks, airlines, and other companies that store a lot of
data.
</P>
<P>
   But at a meeting with financial analysts at its new facility in
Franklin, Mass. Thursday, EMC executives said they will now sell
its hooks to almost any company wanting to develop new programs to
make use of EMC-stored data.
</P>
<P>
   The software secrets will cost $35,000. But EMC's chief goal is
to enable outsiders to customize Symmetrix to their own needs _ and
deepen clients' dependence on EMC, said chief executive Michael
Ruettgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge value, because as we get designed into new
systems, they (customers) will only want to work with EMC,''
Ruettgers said.
</P>
<P>
   EMC's move comes as the company is fighting off renewed
competition from rivals including IBM, which recently introduced a
low-priced storage system. Also, longtime partner Hewlett-Packard
Co. recently ceased buying EMC parts for resale, a relationship
that had accounted for as much as a fifth of EMC's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, EMC leads the market for big storage systems; despite
HP's move, EMC executives said they are sticking by their earlier
projection the company will have revenue of $10 billion in 2001, up
from $4 billion in 1998. New incentives for its own sales staff
will make up for lost orders from HP, EMC said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the code marketing tactic also should help EMC
achieve its targets. They compared EMC's strategy to one Microsoft
Corp. pursued to encourage outside software developers to write
programs around its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes a lot of sense once you reach a certain size and
have the market power to get the leverage,'' said Justin Kelly,
analyst at Winslow Capital in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   EMC vice president Don Swatik said companies including Computer
Associates, Sterling Software, and HP have already developed new
application programs for Symmetrix, and that EMC is in talks with
Oracle Corp. to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's meeting, some wondered whether EMC might be
sharing too much of its code with outsiders, but Swatik said the
company would share only code needed to develop new interfaces.
``We're not disclosing the algorythms for what makes Symmetrix
tick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in EMC, whose headquarters are in Hopkinton, Mass., rose
2 1/16 to close at 62 5/16 in New York Stock Exchange trading.

 DYERSVILLE: outfield back. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early cinematic afterglow, the farms jointly managed
their famous base paths and cornstalks. They allowed Buick and
Wheaties commercials, a fantasy camp and a baseball card company's
celebrity ball game.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Becky, 45, came as a tourist from Colorado and met and
married Lansing, 57, who grew up on his farm.
</P>
<P>
   Things began to change. The Lansings say they felt the movie
site's essence would be compromised by commercialism and fanfare.
They objected in 1996 when the Ameskamps leased their property and
made a profit-sharing arrangement with a group called Left and
Center Field of Dreams, financed by four out-of-state investors,
including a heart surgeon and a clothing store owner, and run by a
former Dyersville farmer. The group manages the Ameskamp gift shop,
the maze and the Ghost Players, who stage baseball exhibitions in
old-time uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The Ameskamps, 63 and 59, farmers here for 32 years, say they
were about to retire and merely wanted things managed by skilled
people.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ameskamp side sought zoning board permission for
batting cages and a gift shop expansion, the other side blocked the
cages and allowed the shop to grow only as big as the Lansings'.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the Lansings stopped organizing infield events,
including free Ghost Players exhibitions. (The players, several of
whom were in the movie, now emerge from the corn and play only in
left and center field.)
</P>
<P>
   The Lansings have also put up signs that say things like ``The
souvenir stand at third base is operated by an out-of-state
investment banking firm and is not associated with the Lansing farm
or family.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Ameskamps decided to rezone part of their farm
commercial so they could charge admission for things like the maze
without getting approval each time. Mrs. Lansing sued to get the
zoning overturned, warning that commercial zoning could lead to
``hotels, bowling alleys, bus depots, banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Rahe, who manages Left and Center Field of Dreams, said
the rezoning bars permanent structures. He said his side wanted
only occasional events like baseball demonstrations, which he said
would help Dyersville, a town of 3,700 that rests on a limping farm
economy and whose other attraction is the National Farm Toy Museum.
He said the rezoning would bring tourists and money to the Lansing
side, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have this trivial little squabble over this,'' Rahe said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lansing said it was hardly trivial.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think the Field of Dreams and the issues that involved one
of the most popular movies at the end of the 20th century is petty
and small?'' she said with a gasp. ``You think it's silly for us to
protect a vision? It's not petty. It's huge.''

DRUG THAT IDENTIFIES CANCER CELLS IN LUNGS OK'D 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KRISTIN VAUGHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new drug made by a New Hampshire company that lights up cancer
cells could help doctors determine if patients with suspicious
chest X-rays need a biopsy for lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   NeoTect, made by Londonderry-based Diatide Inc., was approved
Wednesday by the US Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't replace biopsy. It is supposed to be used as an
adjunct with an abnormal chest X-ray or CT scan,'' said Dr.
Florence Houn, director of the FDA's Office of Drug Evaluation III.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are injected with a teaspoon-size amount of the drug
which floats through the body searching for basket-shaped receptors
found atop proteins that are produced by many types of lung
cancers. A common nuclear-medicine camera then feeds the image to a
computer screen or an X-ray-like film where the image of the lung
lights up to show where cancer cells or located. If there are no
cancer cells, the drug flows through the body.
</P>
<P>
   Richard T. Dean, president and CEO of Diatide Inc., said that it
works with the X-rays and CT scans to if suspicious masses that
appear could be cancerous tumors or maybe just scar tissue.
</P>
<P>
   `This takes the technology to the next level. X-rays can tell if
there is an abnormal mass in the body, but it can't tell what it
is. It could be a tumor, a blood clot or a golf ball. With NeoTect,
if it is a cancer, it will light up and if it is not malignant the
patient doesn't have to go through invasive procedures like surgery
and biopsies.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean said that in addition to detecting cancer cells, NeoTect
can also help doctors determine if there are other areas that have
cancer cells and it can be used as a follow-up procedure with
cancer patients to see if treatments are working effectively or if
cancer has spread.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Dr. Bruce Johnson, Director of Lowe Center For
ThoracicOncology at Dana Farber Cancer Institute said that the drug
could potentially be the most helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The drug could help cut down on the amount of tests cancer
patients need to determine whether it has spread outside of the
lung, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually do a number of tests to make sure that it hasn't
spread outside of the lung by doing a CT scan to image the liver,
brain, bone scan...about three If you do the test and pick
something up, you could do it in one test,'' Johnsons said. Houn
said that ``We (FDA) think it's an important new diagnostic tool.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Diatide Inc. had its application put through a
``priority review'' by the FDA, a fast-tracking approval approach
done for only about 10 to 20 percent of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Houn said that it is commonly done with drugs that could be of
significant benefit to life threatening diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer is the number one cancer in women and men in the
United States. More than 170,000 have been diagnosed with the
disease. Biopsies in which lung tissue is surgically removed allows
doctors to diagnose the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Houn said the help that it can help patients and doctors make
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are wondering, `Could this be cancer or something
benign, this test can help,'' ' Houn said. ``If you are not sure if
it is a scar, this can help when you are stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   In active NASDAQ trading Diatide stock fell 5/8, to 6 1/8 with
more than 253,000 shares _ more than three times its average daily
volume _ changing hands.

MUSIC HAS ALWAYS BEEN SPECIAL TO TATYANA ALI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tatyana Ali, one of the stars of Nickelodeon's ``All That Music
and More'' festival, launched her singing career after an episode
of NBC-TV's ``The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Smith, Ali's co-star on the family comedy about a
streetwise Philadelphia teenager sent to live with rich relatives
in Bel-Air, suggested an episode in which Ali could show off her
singing talents.
</P>
<P>
   Ali, who played Ashley, Smith's closest pal in the Bel-Air
household, was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will knew that I sang, but I kept saying, `No, no, no. I'm not
going to do it,''' Ali said in a phone interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it was going to be corny, it was going to be
cheesy. I was afraid that if I sang on the show, I would end up
mocking the thing I loved. Music had always been really special to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, formerly of the rap duo D.J. Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh
Prince, finally talked her into singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will promised me it'd be cool,'' she said. ``He said,
`Everyone will talk about this episode. Please just trust me, trust
me.' I finally said fine, but told him that I'd never speak to him
again if it came off cheesy.''
</P>
<P>
   When the episode aired about three years ago, about a year
before the show went off the air, rumors began circulating that Ali
was recording an album.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really amazed me,'' the 20-year-old Ali said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Ali later signed a development deal with Smith's production
company, which in turn led to a recording contract with MJJ Music,
a label distributed by Epic Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will and I have always had a really good relationship, like a
brother-sister relationship,'' Ali said. ``When I started the show,
I was like 11. And he was about 21, around my age right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always had a lot of faith in me, even when I didn't have
a lot of faith in myself. And because he's someone I respect, it
meant so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali _ her father is a native of Trinidad, her mother a native of
Panama _ is a lifelong overachiever who began performing for family
and friends at age 4 and appeared at age 7 on TV's ``Star Search.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard-bound teenager began work on her debut album, ``Kiss
the Sky,'' after graduating from high school on Long Island, N.Y.
It's a smooth collection of upbeat, semiautobiographical dance
tunes and ballads, among them ``Boy, You Knock Me Out,''
``Everytime'' and ``Yesterday'' (a duet with Chico DeBarge).
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was done, I played it for some of my friends and they
all laughed and said, `Oh, great. You just told everybody
everything that's gone on in your life for the last year.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ali worked at her own pace on the album, collaborating with a
team of songwriters and producers. Among them were Shawn Stockman
(of Boys II Men) and Narada Michael Walden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, no one's going to pay attention to the album, so
I'll take my time, enjoy myself and I'll see who wants to work with
me in the studio. And someday I'll tell my grandchildren, `Look
what grandma did when she was young.'''
</P>
<P>
   The album, released last August, was far more successful than
Ali ever imagined. It has produced two hits, ``Daydreamin''' and
``Boy, You Knock Me Out.'' Her latest single, ``Everytime,'' is
currently on Billboard's Top R&AMP;B Singles &AMP; Tracks chart.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Ali decided to tour with 'N Sync, deferring her second
semester at Harvard, where she is studying genetics and African
American culture and history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that I couldn't say that I had completed the whole
recording process for the album without actually performing the
songs on the road,'' she said. ``I couldn't call myself a singer
without going out and singing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 'N Sync tour gave Ali some much-needed experience as a
performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt improvement everywhere, from my comfort level in front
of the audience to my stamina during the show,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the 'N Sync tour, Ali joined the Backstreet Boys on a
European tour. Her current trek with ``All That Music and More,'' a
kind of Lollapalooza for kids, is her third tour.
</P>
<P>
   The tour appears Sunday at 4 p.m. at The Gorge outdoor
amphitheatre in George, Wash.. It includes Monica, 98 Degrees, 3rd
Storee, BWitched, No Authority and Aaron Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of the kids, this is their first concert,'' Ali
said. ``They're just freaking out and dancing on the lawn to the
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like watching any other music festival _ but in
miniature.''

DEATH RATES FROM CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE REPORTED DOWN 60 PERCENT

<P>
   Death rates from cardiovascular diseases have plummeted by 60
percent since 1950, a federal agency is announcing Friday,
indicating that the advance against the leading killer of Americans
has been one of the major public health achievements of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   It has been known for years that death rates from heart attacks
and strokes have been falling. But this report, in summarizing
trends over a century, dramatically illustrated what has been
accomplished, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in Friday's
issue of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report that deaths from
strokes have declined steadily since the beginning of the century
while those from heart disease peaked in the 1960s and have been
falling ever since. If the heart attack death rate from 1963 had
prevailed in 1996, the report said, an additional 621,000 Americans
would have died in 1996 alone.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, for example, the death rate from heart disease was
307.4 per 100,000 people. In 1996, it was 134.6. In 1950, the
stroke death rate per 100,000 people was 88.8. In 1996, it was
26.5.
</P>
<P>
   The decline ``is stunning,'' said Dr. Gilbert Omenn, a public
health expert who is executive vice president for medical affairs
at the University of Michigan. ``It is a true success story of
grand proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Jacobs, a professor of epidemiology at the University
of Minnesota's School of Public Health, said the decline in the
death rate is ``surely one of the great accomplishments of the
century.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline is a major reason why people are living longer,
Jacobs said. But, Omenn noted, it allows cancer, heart disease's
grim competitor, to kill older people instead.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Samuel Preston, a demographer who is dean of the School of
Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, said that when
he was a graduate student in the 1960s, no one would have ever
expected the death rates from heart diseases to decline
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense that cardiovascular death rates were as low
as they could go,'' Preston recalled. ``They hadn't moved for
several decades and there was a suggestion that they may be rising
with affluence. There was a general aura of pessimism. Then all of
a sudden in 1968, the rates began to go down very very steadily and
they have continued to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control said no one factor was
responsible for the decline. Instead, the centers noted, the
contributing factors constitute an almost humdrum list inspired by
public health campaigns and clinical trials that showed the
benefits of controlling the risks. One major factor was a decline
in cigarette smoking over the past 30 years, with 25 percent of
adults smoking today, down from 42 percent. Other factors included
better control of blood pressure, decreases in cholesterol levels,
and improved treatments of heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   It is a familiar story to students of public health. The great
killers of the 19th century were also controlled by a collection of
societal changes, like maintaining clean water supplies and
quarantining the sick, resulting in declines in diseases like
tuberculosis, cholera and diphtheria before there were drugs to
treat the illnesses or vaccines to prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cardiovascular disease story was less
well-appreciated, Preston said, ``preventive measures were as
important in this as they had been early in the century with
infectious diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardiovascular disease story is a model for all the
remaining common diseases, Omenn said. He predicted that diseases
like cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, gastrointestinal
diseases and psychiatric diseases will be controlled not by a
wonder drug like a penicillin that cures patients but by a mixture
of preventive measures and treatments, some of which will involve
changes in diet and behavior that might seem almost mundane.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of
death in the United States, with heart disease the No. 1 killer and
stroke No. 3. And that raises the question of whether the trend can
continue.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC noted that more can be done even without new medical
discoveries by getting the various risk factors under control.
</P>
<P>
   Omenn, however, noted that only half of cardiovascular disease
victims have major risk factors like smoking, high blood pressure,
diabetes, high cholesterol levels or obesity. When he thinks about
the potential to slash the cardiovascular death rates further, he
thinks of that other half whose disease is as yet unexplained by
medical science.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means we have plenty more to learn,'' Omenn said.

COMMENTARY: PARTYING WITH SADDAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Often this week I found myself wondering how Saddam Hussein
would celebrate Aug. 5, the first anniversary of his spectacular
victory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In my mind's eye I saw magnificent stomping and feasting in the
great halls of his palaces, and in my ear is the contemptuous
slapping of thighs about the United Nations and its top bureaucrats
who worked so hard to give Iraq this wonderful victory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no dictator has more reason to rejoice. Eight years
ago he was ground into the desert sands by a coalition of nations,
American-organized and -led. Parades were held in the U.S.
Coalition leaders drank toasts to each other. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   None were so small-minded as to comment on Saddam's refusal to
show up to sign Iraq's surrender document. Nor, almost a decade
later, do they stoop to mention his failure to appear at any of the
meetings where Saddam's victory has taken place _ U.N.-Iraq
meetings in Baghdad or the elegant chamber of the U.N. Security
Council, created half a century ago in New York for the cause of
peace and freedom, as it is still put with a straight face. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The meetings last year were to try to find the exact words of
Chamberlainism that would persuade Saddam to permit the United
Nations to carry out inspections in Iraq for nuclear,
bacteriological and chemical weapons. When he lost the gulf war he
promised the inspections would be satisfactorily finished in 15
days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, despite his relentless daily effort to block
inspection teams, they found that Iraq could become a nuclear power
within a year or two if inspection ceased, and could mount a
chemical and bacteriological war after three months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But most Council members except America and Britain sabotaged
the inspection teams and their chief, Richard Butler, one of the
most staunch and skillful U.N. officials I have known in the United
Nations' lifetime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In conspiracy with Saddam, Russia led the Council members who
fought inspection. Their goal was to lift the commercial sanctions
against Saddam, which prevented them from doing billions in
business with Iraq.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never do these nations speak the truth that sanctions, which
hurt the ordinary Iraqi, would be lifted almost instantly if Saddam
lived up to his inspection promises. Forbes magazine estimates he
is the sixth-richest man in the world, so we can assume he has
plenty to eat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Butler's inspectors drew too close to Iraqi weaponry, last
Aug. 5 Saddam curtly told the United Nations no further inspection
would be allowed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What the United Nations did about Saddam's tearing up of the
gulf peace agreement was exactly nothing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States, acting outside the United Nations later, did
mount an air campaign against Iraq. It lasted just four days
because of the advent of the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, which
apparently took Washington by surprise. Iraq and other Muslim
states attacked Israel in 1973 when Yom Kippur and Ramadan came
together.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Butler's contract expired about two months ago. Neither he nor
the United Nations' top bureaucracy wanted any further part of each
other. Now he is a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations,
writing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the first issue of Talk _ Tina Brown's loving gift of
heartburn to the magazine world _ the Australian Butler is a hard
fast bowler, or whatever they call it in cricket. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He pays his respects to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who had
boasted that he could do business with Saddam. He did, straight to
bankruptcy. Butler accuses Annan of handing Saddam the ``greatest
possible prize'': destruction of the U.N. inspection commission,
the only barrier to Iraq's achievement of weapons of mass
destruction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So by another Aug. 5, possibly the next, Iraq will be resurgent
with the combination of mass-death weaponry and Saddam's passionate
commitment to control the Mideast, including all Western roads to
it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One strategy, only, will block this. The United States should
inform all its allies _ real or pretended _ that helping Iraq
continue to refuse inspection, or in any other way, would be
considered an act hostile to America's high national interests and
we will no longer regard them as allies or true friends, real,
pretend or would-be.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I do not think U.S. leadership is wise or strong enough to adopt
that strategy. Saddam will be allowed to follow his own, with
consequences we are afraid even to consider, yet.
</P>

 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ The apple market, a small grocery story in east
los Angeles, is a typical U.S. store. But on its shelves are some
not-so-typical items: tamarind pulp, candies and spicy ice cream
bars and even powdered chili, all manufactured by just one Mexican
company and discretely marked as ``Product of Mexico.'' Near the
cash registers are even more products made by the same company,
Grupo Lorena, including its most famous and powerful offering: El
Pelon Pelo Rico (Tasty-Haired Baldy).
 &HT;    El Pelon, a phenomenon in Mexico and Central America, is not
quite at the point of threatening U.S. candy makers. But since its
introduction north of the border in 1993, sales have doubled,
according to the company. And, like other Mexican candy makers, it
has taken advantage of its brand name recognition among Mexicans
living in the U.S. But now it's setting its sights on the rest of
the U.S. market, one that is far more difficult to crack but offers
much sweeter rewards.
 &HT;    ``We are well positioned in the smallest slice of the marketing
pie, the Hispanic slice, but we are interested in reaching the
Anglo market,'' says Ulises Padilla, the international sales
manager for Grupo Lorena. The U.S. market is pegged at about $22
billion a year _ 10 times the size of Mexico's _ according to the
U.S. National Confectioners Association.
 &HT;    Grupo Montes, another Mexican candy manufacturer _ which sells
about $70 million a year and exports one-third of its production _
also wants to reach a broader market. ``We want to take advantage
of the marketing knowledge of U.S. distributors,'' says Armando
Crespo, assistant manager of exports for Grupo Montes, whose
products are sold in huge U.S. retail chains like Sam's Club,
Wal-Mart and Costco.
 &HT;    Entering the U.S. market requires some creative strategies. Both
Grupo Lorena and Grupo Montes started by offering their services as
manufacturers. Grupo Lorena makes candies for The Candy Company,
Albert's and Spain's Chupa-Chups. Montes does the same for the
private labels of Sam's Club or Costco.
 &HT;    But their ultimate goal is to sell their brands. Lorena sells
its Fruit Pops and Color Brush; Montes sells its Fruit Chews and
Panda Pops.
 &HT;    ``This market is more difficult because we don't have brand name
recognition,'' says Grupo Montes' Crespo. It is also a market that
demands more in the way of content, packaging, presentation and
service.
 &HT;    ``Here they call you on the phone to ask you if your lollipops
have such and such percentage of sugar or glucose, or why they
don't have proteins,'' says Miguel Angel Valadez, an international
sales manager at Grupo Lorena.
 &HT;    Discrimination is still a problem. ``To sell your candy in the
Anglo market, the first thing you have to do is take off every
label that says ``Made in Mexico,'' or ``Mexican,'' because they
assume that it's meant for the Hispanic market _ cheap and of low
quality,'' says Jesus Arroyo, Grupo Lorena's business manager. The
company lists its products' origin as discretely as possible, but
must do so to comply with U.S. regulations.
 &HT;    But just because the companies downplay their Mexican origins
doesn't mean that they don't take advantage of marketing tactics
that worked well in Mexico. For example, Lorena, like the larger
Mexican food company Bimbo, distributes its candies to retailers
using its own trucks. Lorena's so-called Plan of 100 Stores, which
began in 1998, seeks to create its own direct, controlled
distribution ton at least 10 medium-sized, U.S. supermarkets. This
gives the company critical information about its customers and
which products are in demand.
 &HT;    Valadez, of Grupo Lorena, says that the company is halfway to
its goal, and the company's principal clients now include small
chains like Farmer's Market, the Apple Market, Best Value and
King's Ranch. With this strategy, Lorena has not only gotten shelf
space, it has found other products that are beginning to sell well.
As a result, though El Pelon Pelo Rico remains the main attraction,
it now makes up 30 percent instead of 80 percent of all sales
because its line of candies has more than 35 different products.
This year, Grupo Lorena estimates it will sell about 100 million
pieces of candy in the U.S. market.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Power of El Pelon
 &HT;    Like the Biblical character Samson, the power of El Pelon Pelo
Rico (Tasty-Haired Baldy) is in his hair. In this case, the trick
is to squeeze the tube and eat the hair as it oozes out of the head
of El Pelon.
 &HT;    The ``hair'' is actually tamarind candy mixed with hot peppers.
Known as a dulce-juguete, or toy candy, El Pelon is popular in
Mexico and Central America and is sold in large and small stores.
The idea is to make eating the candy fun. El Pelon comes in a
plastic tube with the face of a bald man. When the tube is
squeezed, the man grows ``hair.''
 &HT;    It may not sound good, but the mighty Pelon is responsible for
Grupo Lorena's success in the 1980s, when the son of the founder,
Fernando Topete Davila, set up the spicy candy lines that became
the company's leading product. Today, Grupo Lorena is made up of 10
candy companies, employs more than 900 people, exports about 25
percent of its production and sells some 700 million pieces of
candy a year throughout the Americas.

NARCOLEPSY-INDUCING GENE IN DOGS IDENTIFIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a decade of trying, scientists are beginning to discover
the genetics and chemistry of one of life's most basic functions _
sleep and wakefulness.
</P>
<P>
   As an added bonus, the nerve cells and neurohormones that
control sleep and wakefulness turn out to be closely related to
those that regulate another vital behavior _ eating.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new findings appear in two scientific reports in the
current edition of the journal Cell, published in Cambridge, Mass..
</P>
<P>
   In one, Stanford University researchers report the discovery of
a single gene that causes a dramatic disorder called narcolepsy in
dogs _ one of the few species other than humans to have the strange
and often disabling disease.
</P>
<P>
   A second paper, to be published in Cell later this month, will
report the unexpected discovery that mice who lack the ability to
produce a key protein thought to be involved in feeding behavior
also suffer from narcolepsy. That report is authored by researchers
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center with
colleagues from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and
Miyazaki Medical College in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   People with narcolepsy, thought to number about 135,000 in this
country, suddenly suffer attacks of irresistible sleepiness that
can occur while talking, standing, walking, eating, or driving.
Attacks are often brought on by strong emotion.
</P>
<P>
   People and dogs with the most severe form can suddenly collapse
from muscle weakness that mimics a state called ``atonia'' that
normally occurs every night when humans or animals enter
rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep after about an hour and a half of
non-REM sleep. REM sleep is characterized by dreaming, lack of
muscle tone, and involuntary muscle twitches.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Emmanuel Mignot and his Stanford colleagues found that the
gene for narcolepsy in Labrador retrievers and Doberman pinschers
is a mutant form of the blueprint for a receptor that sits on the
surface of nerve cells that are widely distributed in the brain.
The receptor permits these cells to respond to a chemical called
orexin discovered only last year.
</P>
<P>
   That's where eating comes in. Orexin, also called hypocretin,
got its name from the Greek word orexos, which means ``to eat,''
because scientists noticed that injecting orexin into rats
increased their appetite and feeding behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Orexin or hypocretin is a potent activator of nerve cells, so
scientists hypothesize that a faulty receptor for this chemical
messenger disrupts the body's normal mechanisms for maintaining
wakefulness or neurologic ``arousal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on brain anatomy, we predicted that orexin would be
related to arousal,'' said Dr. Joel K. Elmquist of Beth Israel
Deaconess, a coauthor of the report on the narcoleptic mice.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship of orexin to appetite and eating, Elmquist
said, is still not understood. It may involve a similar brain
chemical called melanin-concentrating hormone, a potent appetite
stimulator whose distribution in the brain closely overlaps with
orexin. This makes sense, Elmquist noted, because wakefulness and
feeding behavior are necessarily linked.
</P>
<P>
   Another intriguing piece of the mosaic is that the Boston
researchers have shown that a newly approved narcolepsy drug called
modafinil (brand name Provigil) works by stimulating
orexin-producing nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford researchers note that the orexin receptor gene they
have discovered in dogs also exists in humans. But it appears that
the genetic mechanism of human narcolepsy is more complex, perhaps
involving several genes and an environment trigger. One hypothesis
is that some people's immune system mistakenly attacks the system
of orexin-producing neurons or orexin receptors.
</P>
<P>
   The new discoveries represent ``a giant step toward
understanding the molecular basis of sleep,'' said Dr. Gerald D.
Fischbach, director of the National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke, and Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, in a statement Thursday.

 &HT;    Microsoft piracy suit cites 5 Atlanta firms
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Microsoft filed suit this week in federal court
against five Atlanta area companies, claiming the computer hardware
and software retailers are selling pirated products.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said the companies _ Microseconds in Duluth; Atlanta
Computer and CompuTime International, both in Norcross; Tierra
Computer of Doraville; and Net-Sol, in Hall County _ sold illegal
versions of its software products to undercover detectives working
for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The software included Windows 95, Windows 98 and Office
Professional 97. The civil suits, filed Tuesday, also claim the
companies loaded unauthorized versions of Microsoft software onto
hard disks of PCs they sold.
</P>
<P>
   The companies can face penalties of up to $100,000 for software
products sold, regardless of how many copies. CompuTime
International, accused of selling illegal copies of Windows 95,
Windows 98 and Office Professional 97, could face up to $1 million
in fines, $100,000 each for the Windows products and $100,000 for
the eight programs included in the Office Professional suite.
</P>
<P>
   People who bought the allegedly counterfeit software from the
companies would not be liable for any of the damages or eligible
for any award given to Microsoft. A Microsoft spokesman said the
company would give customers a letter to bolster their case for a
refund from the stores.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' owners, none of whom returned callsThursday, have
20 days to respond to the complaints. None of the companies is an
authorized distributor of Microsoft products. A ruling could take
up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Psyhogeos, a Microsoft corporate attorney based in
Washington, said Microsoft is stepping up its efforts to combat the
illegal use of its software. The company started a television and
billboard anti-piracy advertising campaign in Georgia in May.
</P>
<P>
   Piracy is widespread, the company claims. Microsoft estimates
that one of every five software programs being used in Georgia was
illegally obtained, most by small- to medium-sized businesses. In
1998, the Business Software Alliance, a lobbying group, collected
$10 million in fines from companies using software for which they
did not have licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that these companies knew what they were doing and
they willfully ignored our requests that they refrain from that
conduct,'' he said. Psyhogeos said half of any settlement will be
given to local charities focused on teaching kids technology and
toward technology training for displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
   Psyhogeos said Microsoft learns of companies selling pirated
software or businesses using counterfeit versions from people who
call its toll-free anti-piracy number, 1-800-RULEGIT. Then they
hire a private detective to conduct a ``test purchase'' at a

   In the case of Microseconds, Microsoft claims that it twice
bought PCs with pirated copies of Windows 95 installed, in
September and in April. After the September purchase, Psyhogeos
said Microsoft sent Microseconds a letter asking it to stop selling
the counterfeit product. Then last month, Microsoft said it bought
components of the 1997 version of its Office Pro software that
proved to be counterfeit. Office Pro includes several components,
including a word processor and a spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   Microseconds owner Steven Brandt was among the owners who could
not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Psyhogeos said consumers sometimes can tell if they are buying
pirated software because the user manual, license agreement and
warranty card will be missing.
</P>
<P>
   He said Microsoft is most interested in finding out where the
retailers get their counterfeit product.
</P>
<P>
   One such source was shut down in June.
</P>

   Police in Southern California arrested an eight-person operation
using a $1.2 million machine to copy 15,000 Microsoft software
programs a month.

COMMENTARY: KOSOVO'S THREE WARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching the latest cycle of ethnic revenge being played out in
Kosovo, this time with Albanians murdering Serbs, is a graphic
reminder that there were actually three wars in Kosovo this year.
The first war we lost, the second war we won and the third war is
yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   The first Kosovo war was the diplomatic fight that was supposed
to prevent an ethnic war in Kosovo. At the Rambouillet peace
conference the United States and its allies laid down a plan
calling for autonomy for Kosovo, but with the promise of some kind
of referendum on statehood three years down the road, which looked
like a tacit commitment to independence for Kosovo Albanians on the
three-year installment plan. Rambouillet also gave NATO the right
to operate inside Serbia. Using coercive diplomacy, the U.S.
declared that if the Albanians accepted Rambouillet, and the Serbs
rejected it, NATO would bomb the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic rejected this plan, and so did the Albanian
Kosovars, some of whom wanted firmer guarantees of independence.
But after intense arm-twisting by the United States, the Albanian
Kosovars said yes. This was a dishonest yes _ it was a yes that was
given not because the Kosovars truly embraced Rambouillet, but
because it was whispered in their ears that if they just said yes
and the Serbs said no, NATO would bomb the Serbs, and in a few days
Milosevic would cave. He didn't cave, NATO bombed, and Milosevic
began ruthlessly killing and evicting Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the first Kosovo war was lost. The U.S. and NATO,
having adopted a strategy of coercive diplomacy against Milosevic,
were totally unprepared with sufficient coercive power when he
called their bluff. As a result, the very people whom NATO had set
out to protect with its diplomacy were ravaged by Serbian forces
before NATO was able to get an effective military response
together.
</P>
<P>
   This led to the second Kosovo war, which was fought purely to
reverse the results of the first war. This war was fought with no
coherent view of what sort of Kosovo political settlement NATO
wanted. Rather it was fought to stop the ethnic cleansing, to
return the refugees so that all Southern Europe wouldn't be
destabilized and to save NATO's credibility. The whole debate
around this war was about the means _ air power or ground troops _
not the political ends, which were vague.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the only way NATO could sustain this war in a
corner of Europe with little strategic significance was by not
asking too much of its own citizens and by relying on air power
alone. Given these constraints, it was a war fought skillfully by
the Clinton administration and NATO. Air power alone worked.
Milosevic's ethnic cleansing was not allowed to stand, and all the
world got to see that. NATO won Kosovo War No. 2, and that was
important.
</P>
<P>
   But air power worked not because NATO bombed all the Serbian
troops out of Kosovo but because it bombed all the jobs out of
Belgrade _ crushing its economic infrastructure, and creating
something of a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are in Kosovo War No. 3. We are back to fighting over
what sort of Kosovo would be best. The U.S. and NATO favor a
self-governing, multi-ethnic, democratic Kosovo _ fully autonomous
but still formally part of Yugoslavia. An autonomous Kosovo still
officially part of Yugoslavia is what the Serbs also want, though
they resist the notion of multi-ethnic democracy. The devastated
Kosovar Albanians, however, want full independence now more than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   This has led to an odd situation. As the Council on Foreign
Relations fellow Michael Mandelbaum points out in a provocative
article coming out in Foreign Affairs, the NATO alliance has
``intervened in a civil war and defeated one side, but embraced the
position of the party it had defeated on the issue over which the
war had been fought.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens next?
</P>
<P>
   Think of it this way: NATO says it wants three things in Kosovo
_ multi-ethnicity, democracy and a very small NATO/U.S. presence.
But when you have two intermingled populations that fear and loathe
each other, as you do in Kosovo, you can only have two out of
three. You can have multi-ethnicity and democracy, but only with a
large NATO presence that puts a policeman on every corner. This is
the Lebanon solution, where you have different communities
intermingled, but under the hard fist of Syria. NATO doesn't want
to play Syria, though, and it is shamefully trying to fob off the
job on the U.N. That won't work. How are 3,500 U.N. police going to
do what 35,000 NATO troops can't?
</P>
<P>
   The other option is that we can have democracy and a small NATO
presence, but only if we give up on multi-ethnicity and divide
Kosovo _ only if we partition it into a separate Serbian Kosovo and
a separate Albanian Kosovo (which would mean a second Albanian
state) and then just patrol the line between them.
</P>
<P>
   Those are our Kosovo choices: Either we create two Albanias or
one Lebanon. If we don't face that squarely, NATO will be presiding
over Kosovo War No. 4.

 &HT;    Interactive TV potential `massive'
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to interactive TV, you'd better stop
laughing _ and some local companies can celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   A leading industry consultant now says that this technology will
rival the Internet within three years, generating $20 billion in
revenue by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the findings of a new report by Forrester, a
Boston-based company that studies the commercial and social impact
of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interactive TV has gone from being a laughingstock to becoming
a potentially massive revenue generator,'' says Josh Bernoff,
principal analyst for television research at Forrester.
</P>
<P>
   If Bernoff and Forrester are right, interactive TV could become
a bonanza for some Atlanta-based companies such as Cox
Communications and Scientific-Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications has been rebuilding its cable systems to
eventually offer interactive services.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta, which sells cable TV operators a digital
cable system called Explorer 2000, has bet big on interactive
television. In the past six years, the company has invested $300
million in the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Scientific-Atlanta sees the Forrester study as
an affirmation of its digital gamble. It also says that the
Forrester study tracks what it is finding in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, the consumer response to our digital systems has been
outstanding,'' says Jim McDonald, Scientific-Atlanta's president
and chief executive. ``The response has surpassed everyone's
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Interactive television refers to the ability to use a TV set for
such things as electronic mail, buying merchandise online, playing
games against others and browsing the Internet. Perhaps one of the
most eagerly awaited promises of the technology is video on demand
_ the ability to structure television programming according to the
viewer's interests.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been promised with the advent of digital technology,
but no one yet has figured out how to cash in on interactive
television.
</P>
<P>
   The days of stumbling, however, may soon be over. At least
Forrester says so.
</P>
<P>
   The medium is on the cusp of generating billions of dollars for
the cable operators, broadcast networks and entrepreneurs who have
invested so much in it, Forrester's study finds.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester says, for example, that interactive TV will generate
$11 billion in advertising, $7 billion in commerce and $2 billion
in subscription revenue by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an advertising medium, it will rival the Internet within
three years,'' says Bernoff.
</P>
<P>
   Three hot uses of interactive technology will drive revenue,
says Bernoff. The first is electronic program guides, which let
viewers see and browse shows from one easy-to-use list on the
screen. Advertisers are expected to spend $3.2 billion buying ads
on electronic guides within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The second is what Bernoff calls enhanced broadcasts. The term
refers to such things as playing games with someone across town _
or across the country _ on your television. Enhanced broadcast
services are expected to generate $3.8 billion in fees and $6.2
billion in ad revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The third is Internet access through the television, which
Forrester forecasts will generate $5 billion in revenue from
advertising, subscriptions and electronic commerce within five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Bernoff says the big beneficiaries of this bonanza will be the
cable operators and satellite companies, which have led investment
in interactive television.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, cable _ and especially satellite companies _ have
been lesser players in the media business compared with the big
four broadcast networks and the movie studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interactive television will turn the media industry inside
out,'' says Bernoff. ``As ITV (interactive TV) spreads across the
consumer landscape, it will pull advertising dollars away from
existing media, including television and the Web.

DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR GRAND CANYON TOWN TO BE ANNOUNCED 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ After years of analysis and pitched debate, federal
officials are planning to announce on Friday an ambitious plan to
develop national forest land beside Grand Canyon National Park in
Arizona that environmentalists are calling a model for future
development around national parks.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, to create Canyon Forest Village on 272 acres at
the south entrance of the park in the town of Tusayan, represents a
compromise that appears to have something for everyone, making it a
rare example of cooperation between two forces _ environmentalists
and developers _ who rarely agree on anything in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The village would include new housing for park employees, new
hotels, restaurants and other amenities for local residents and the
millions of tourists who visit every year. A key element favored by
environmentalists was a decision to transport water for the
facilities from the Colorado River rather than from within the
canyon itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once completed, this will raise the bar for development next
to national parks and be a model for other situations,'' said Dave
Simon, the southwest regional director of the National Parks and
Conservation Association, a nonprofit group that worked with other
environmental groups to develop the plan, known as Alternative H,
that the U.S. Forest Service is expected to endorse.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswomen for the Grand Canyon National Park and the U.S.
Forest Service said details of the project would be revealed at a
news conference Friday morning in Flagstaff, Ariz., and declined to
comment until then.
</P>
<P>
   However, Simon, other environmentalists and associates of the
development group's general partner, Thomas DePaolo of Scottsdale,
all said Thursday that the forest service had agreed on a plan that
was supported by at least nine leading environmental groups,
Arizona's native tribes and various state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The village will be built with private funds. The forest service
approval is only necessary because the acreage designated for
development was obtained through a swap of nearby federal forest
land.
</P>
<P>
   While the final plan includes more development than some of the
other eight originally under consideration, environmentalists were
won over by the water program and other ecological concessions that
they contend would protect the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the proposal expected to be endorsed Thursday,
water into Canyon Forest Village would be brought by rail and
pipeline from the Colorado River at Arizona's border with
California. In a runner-up proposal, water would have been used
from wells and springs inside the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups also prevailed in pressing for the use
of more efficient energy systems and for recycling programs than
landfills for waste management.
</P>
<P>
   `'We were blessed to find representatives of national
environmental groups who recognized the challenges, and they were
willing to negotiate from the beginning,'' DePaolo said in an
interview, acknowledging the unusual collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   He praised the environmental groups who helped shape the final
proposal calling them ``as much a developer of this project as we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials began contemplating the need for an expanded
gateway community at the Grand Canyon's busiest entrance more than
a decade ago. By last year, more than 4.5 million people visited
the Grand Canyon, making it the country's second-most popular
national park or preservation area after the Great Smoky Mountains
in North Carolina and Tennessee. About 80 percent of visitors to
Grand Canyon enter from Tusayan.
</P>
<P>
   But Tusayan, an unincorporated town of fewer than 1,000
year-round residents in the Kaibab National Forest, could
accommodate neither the growing number of visitors to the Grand
Canyon nor the park's own pressing needs of 500 housing units for
its expanding workforce and concessionaires.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, park officials drew up a management plan in 1995
that sought to eliminate problems through the expansion of Tusayan
and construction of light-rail service from Tusayan into the park
to reduce pollution from automobile traffic, another growing
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion was only made possible by the land swap. Tucked
away within the 1.6 million square miles of the Kaibab forest were
12 parcels of land, about 2,200 acres combined, that were privately
held since the homesteading days of the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   DePaolo bought the first parcel with the idea of building a
resort hotel. In discussions with the forest service about
improvements to roads, he learned of the bureau's interest in
swapping private land for Tusayan acreage. Bureau officials, he
said, encouraged him to pool his resources with residents of the
town who were already investigating the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of meetings, DePaolo and his partners set out on
their own, buying up 11 additional parcels by 1995, the dozen
costing about $5 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With its own problems at Grand Canyon to solve _ a shortage of
housing, a surfeit of cars and visitors _ the service readily
agreed to the swap.
</P>
<P>
   But it took much longer for federal officials to approve a
development plan that would take into account all the park's needs
and environmental concerns, while keeping the development project
viable to investors.
</P>
<P>
   The eight proposals were whittled down to two _ Alternatives G
and H, as they were known _ with their major differences chiefly
environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Each projected roughly the same size expansion. Alternative G
proposed more space for parking, 30 acres rather than 20 acres in
Alternative H; fewer hotel rooms, 900 to 1,220; and less retail
space, 220,000 square feet to 270,000. Early on in the process, at
least one proposal suggested expansion of 650 acres.
</P>
<P>
   But more troublesome to the environmental groups was the source
of water and energy systems; and to the park, the number of housing
units. Alternative G contemplated 423, compared with 535 for
Alternative H.
</P>
<P>
   Not all groups in Arizona favored expansion plans for Tusayan.
Many of the town business owners expressed opposition, fearing that
new hotels and restaurants would siphon off business from them. And
some environmental groups, including the Sierra Club's Grand Canyon
chapter, opposes any further development along the south rim of the
park.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Coconino County zoning board expected to grant
zoning approval for the project, little, it appears now, can derail
it.

<P>
   All at once it got very serious. Ken Newport looked up from the
600-page document he had printed from the Internet. He had been
ploughing through its interminable ramblings about horsemen and
brides, scrolls and seals, beasts and Babylon, demon armies and
divine punishments. But then something clicked.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant, he realized with a sudden chill, was blazing gun
battles, burning buildings and more dead children.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors of Waco were looking for a repeat of the awful
inferno in which some 80 people died in the siege of their
headquarters in Texas six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How, he wondered, did an unknown academic from Liverpool like
him go about contacting the FBI? It had all begun innocently
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Newport is a theologian who, for the past two years, has
been gathering material for an academic volume on how groups
throughout history have interpreted Revelation, the final book of
the Bible which is consumed with surreal visions about the end of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost without exception, he discovered, those who became
obsessed with the Apocalypse became filled with the conviction that
it was a timetable of real events and that the end was about to
come in their own time.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-century Baptist, Benjamin Keach, thought it would
happen in 1689. One of the founders of Methodism, Charles Wesley,
thought Doomsday would be 1794.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most famously, the American preacher William Miller
gathered his followers around him on Oct. 22, 1844, all having sold
their worldly possessions, quit jobs and moved to upstate New York,
which was where Christ was due to return.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Branch Davidian cult at Waco, under their
wild and charismatic leader David Koresh, were seized with the same
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something more. From time to time there appeared a
group that was not simply content to wait for Armageddon. They saw
it as their duty to provoke it.
</P>
<P>
   It was in gathering material on the history of the Branch
Davidian cult that he came across evidence that Koresh's
successors, who style themselves the Students of the Seven Seals,
are engaged upon a process whose logic seems to be taking them
remorselessly to the creation of another Waco _ sometime between
now and Friday Aug. 6, when they are convinced that the world will
end.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his neat modern study at Liverpool Hope University
College, amid racks of box files and a world away from the madness
of Waco, Dr. Newport began to correspond _ by letter and e-mail _
with the new generation of Branch Davidians, who have fled Texas
and are now dispersed throughout the U.S. and UK.
</P>
<P>
   He contacted them through their websites and by writing to the
seven members who are in American jails, serving a total of 238
years between them. Slowly he began to piece together the story
which has so unnerved him. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 350 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first piece in the jigsaw went back to Oct. 23, 1844 _ the
day after the world didn't end as William Miller had predicted. It
was then that his followers began the long process of coming to
terms with what they dubbed The Great Disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the several new groups which sprang from the disillusioned
Millerites was the Seventh Day Adventists, whose recruits included
one John Kellogg, who developed for his brethren a special
vegetarian breakfast food called corn flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was a movement doomed to schism. A washing machine
salesman called Victor Houteff led a breakaway called the Davidian
Seventh Day Adventists. And after Victor's wife and successor
Florence gathered the movement's 940 members together for another
unsuccessful Doomsday on April 22, 1959, it split again, with Ben
Roden and his wife Lois forming the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the succession should have passed to their son
George. But by then David Koresh was on the scene and things began
to turn from the merely eccentric to the downright dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the leadership issue, Ken Newport discovered, George
Roden dug up the remains of an 85-year-old Davidian who had died
some 20 years earlier, and challenged Koresh to a Resurrection
Contest.
</P>
<P>
   A gun battle ensued and, though the police arrested everyone, no
one was convicted _ though George was given six months for contempt
of court for threatening the judge with plagues and herpes.
</P>
<P>
   George was later sent to an asylum after drawing a third
Davidian into a row over whether George or Koresh had been chosen
by God to be the seventh and final angel named in the Bible; when
the third man insisted it was neither of them but him, George
chopped him up with an axe.
</P>
<P>
   But it was none of this which prompted the Davidians' letters
and e-mails to Ken Newport suddenly to halt. Nor was it his
questions about the awful events at Waco, at which the FBI
acquitted themselves so poorly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cult members began to get wary when Dr. Newport started to
ask about their belief that Koresh is due to return from the dead
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Their massive documents on the Web revealed that a code-breaking
of a combination of dates in Revelation and the prophetic book of
Daniel suggested that Koresh would return on Aug. 6, at the head of
200 million horsemen (see Rev. 9:16) to cleanse the earth and
slaughter the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Those of Koresh's followers who were not consumed in the flames
of Waco were to prepare for the event under the guidance of a
Davidian by the code name of The Chosen Vessel.
</P>
<P>
   It was when Ken Newport began to find out who this might be that
all communication was ended with a final e-mail: ``We perceive now
that you are not a seeker after the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Newport continued to comb through what had already been
made available to him. The conclusions he was forced to make
disturbed him.
</P>
<P>
   For the survivors to join Koresh's divine army they, too, would
have to be dead before Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no reference to self-sacrifice in any of the
documentation. Rather there was the suggestion that the remnant,
under the direction of The Chosen Vessel, would have to be killed
by the same forces who killed Koresh.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   All at once it got very serious. Ken Newport looked up from the
600-page document he had printed from the Internet. He had been
ploughing through its interminable ramblings about horsemen and
brides, scrolls and seals, beasts and Babylon, demon armies and
divine punishments. But then something clicked.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant, he realized with a sudden chill, was blazing gun
battles, burning buildings and more dead children.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors of Waco were looking for a repeat of the awful
inferno in which some 80 people died in the siege of their
headquarters in Texas six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How, he wondered, did an unknown academic from Liverpool like
him go about contacting the FBI? It had all begun innocently
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Newport is a theologian who, for the past two years, has
been gathering material for an academic volume on how groups
throughout history have interpreted Revelation, the final book of
the Bible which is consumed with surreal visions about the end of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost without exception, he discovered, those who became
obsessed with the Apocalypse became filled with the conviction that
it was a timetable of real events and that the end was about to
come in their own time.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-century Baptist, Benjamin Keach, thought it would
happen in 1689. One of the founders of Methodism, Charles Wesley,
thought Doomsday would be 1794.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most famously, the American preacher William Miller
gathered his followers around him on Oct. 22, 1844, all having sold
their worldly possessions, quit jobs and moved to upstate New York,
which was where Christ was due to return.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Branch Davidian cult at Waco, under their
wild and charismatic leader David Koresh, were seized with the same
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something more. From time to time there appeared a
group that was not simply content to wait for Armageddon. They saw
it as their duty to provoke it.
</P>
<P>
   It was in gathering material on the history of the Branch
Davidian cult that he came across evidence that Koresh's
successors, who style themselves the Students of the Seven Seals,
are engaged upon a process whose logic seems to be taking them
remorselessly to the creation of another Waco _ sometime between
now and Friday Aug. 6, when they are convinced that the world will
end.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his neat modern study at Liverpool Hope University
College, amid racks of box files and a world away from the madness
of Waco, Dr. Newport began to correspond _ by letter and e-mail _
with the new generation of Branch Davidians, who have fled Texas
and are now dispersed throughout the U.S. and UK.
</P>
<P>
   He contacted them through their websites and by writing to the
seven members who are in American jails, serving a total of 238
years between them. Slowly he began to piece together the story
which has so unnerved him. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 350 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first piece in the jigsaw went back to Oct. 23, 1844 _ the
day after the world didn't end as William Miller had predicted. It
was then that his followers began the long process of coming to
terms with what they dubbed The Great Disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the several new groups which sprang from the disillusioned
Millerites was the Seventh Day Adventists, whose recruits included
one John Kellogg, who developed for his brethren a special
vegetarian breakfast food called corn flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was a movement doomed to schism. A washing machine
salesman called Victor Houteff led a breakaway called the Davidian
Seventh Day Adventists. And after Victor's wife and successor
Florence gathered the movement's 940 members together for another
unsuccessful Doomsday on April 22, 1959, it split again, with Ben
Roden and his wife Lois forming the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the succession should have passed to their son
George. But by then David Koresh was on the scene and things began
to turn from the merely eccentric to the downright dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the leadership issue, Ken Newport discovered, George
Roden dug up the remains of an 85-year-old Davidian who had died
some 20 years earlier, and challenged Koresh to a Resurrection
Contest.
</P>
<P>
   A gun battle ensued and, though the police arrested everyone, no
one was convicted _ though George was given six months for contempt
of court for threatening the judge with plagues and herpes.
</P>
<P>
   George was later sent to an asylum after drawing a third
Davidian into a row over whether George or Koresh had been chosen
by God to be the seventh and final angel named in the Bible; when
the third man insisted it was neither of them but him, George
chopped him up with an axe.
</P>
<P>
   But it was none of this which prompted the Davidians' letters
and e-mails to Ken Newport suddenly to halt. Nor was it his
questions about the awful events at Waco, at which the FBI
acquitted themselves so poorly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cult members began to get wary when Dr. Newport started to
ask about their belief that Koresh is due to return from the dead
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Their massive documents on the Web revealed that a code-breaking
of a combination of dates in Revelation and the prophetic book of
Daniel suggested that Koresh would return on Aug. 6, at the head of
200 million horsemen (see Rev. 9:16) to cleanse the earth and
slaughter the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Those of Koresh's followers who were not consumed in the flames
of Waco were to prepare for the event under the guidance of a
Davidian by the code name of The Chosen Vessel.
</P>
<P>
   It was when Ken Newport began to find out who this might be that
all communication was ended with a final e-mail: ``We perceive now
that you are not a seeker after the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Newport continued to comb through what had already been
made available to him. The conclusions he was forced to make
disturbed him.
</P>
<P>
   For the survivors to join Koresh's divine army they, too, would
have to be dead before Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no reference to self-sacrifice in any of the
documentation. Rather there was the suggestion that the remnant,
under the direction of The Chosen Vessel, would have to be killed
by the same forces who killed Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logic is clear,'' says Dr. Newport. ``It all makes perfect
sense if you take on board the hypotheses they start with. It is
entirely possible that they are provoking some horrendous
confrontation with the U.S. authorities.'' His estimate is that
around 40 to 50 individuals might be involved in such an outrage.

UNITED TO SET UP NEW SEAT CLASS WITH MORE LEG ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With airplanes growing more crowded and passenger complaints
soaring, the nation's biggest airline announced Thursday that it
would offer its best customers more of what has become an
increasingly scarce commodity: leg room.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines said that it would spend $30 million to
reconfigure the interiors of 450 jetliners in its domestic fleet to
create a new section in the front of coach with 5 to 6 more inches
between seat rows. The new class, called Economy Plus, will be
offered to elite members of the airline's frequent-flier program as
well as to passengers who pay full coach fares.
</P>
<P>
   United, which is owned by UAL Corp., hopes that the new section
will win the loyalty of business travelers, who make up 9 percent
of the airline's total passengers but account for 36 percent of its
sales. Rono Dutta, United's president, said that the airline
surveyed hundreds of frequent fliers and found that what they
wanted more than anything else was more leg room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a lot of business travelers who are trapped in
economy,'' he said, ``and we have to provide them with a higher
level of service.''
</P>
<P>
   United's move could usher in a new caste system in the air by
creating the first new level of service since business class was
introduced. Though competing airlines may wait to decide whether to
spend the money to copy United, analysts said that they would have
little choice if the new section becomes a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow ourselves to be at a competitive
disadvantage,'' said Bill Berry, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines,
the nation's third-largest carrier. ``But it is too early to give
any kind of response as to what Delta will do.''
</P>
<P>
   United's success is by no means guaranteed. Other airlines in
the past have tried to woo passengers with more leg room only to
find that the effort did not pay off. Critics also say that
creating a preferred class in coach could spark even more ill will
when the roomier seats fill up, forcing some qualified passengers
to sit in the regular economy section.
</P>
<P>
   United said that the new section would not be physically
separated from the rest of the the economy section, and no other
amenities will be offered beside the increased leg room.
</P>
<P>
   The added space will be generous in airline terms. So-called
seat pitch, which is measured from the back of one seat to the back
of the seat in front, will expand to 35 or 36 inches in Economy
Plus from 31 inches in regular economy. By contrast, a first-class
seat on one of United's domestic flights measures 38 inches between
rows. The width of the seats will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   But looked at another way, United will be returning its frequent
fliers to a level of comfort that was enjoyed by all coach
passengers only a short time ago. Over the last decade, seat pitch
has steadily declined in coach from 34 inches as airlines tried to
squeeze more paying passengers onto each airplane.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That, along with increased delays, a decline in food service,
poor customer service, more people flying and a myriad of other
hassles has created a groundswell of complaints against the airline
industry. Several lawmakers have proposed legislation giving
passengers more rights. The airlines now complain that their
customers are becoming increasingly violent, putting their
employees at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta said that the Economy Plus initiative was not directly
related to developments in Washington but was part of United's
longtime campaign to improve its customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The new section will vary between six and 11 rows depending on
the type of plane. For example, on United's 53 Airbus A320
single-aisle jets, 36 of the 126 coach seats will be converted to
Economy Plus, compared with 12 first-class seats. A Boeing 777 will
have 89 Economy Plus seats, 223 regular economy seats and 36
first-class seats. United airplanes that offer first- and
business-class seats will not feature the new section, nor will it
be introduced on its low-fare Shuttle, which flies predominantly on
the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   United plans to begin converting its fleet of Boeing 757s next
month and says the entire fleet will be converted by next April.
The airline will begin reserving seats for passengers in the new
section as each airplane type is converted, so passengers could be
booking seats on routes flown by 757s in October.
</P>
<P>
   Members of United's frequent-flier program who have flown at
least 25,000 miles on the airline in the previous year will be
eligible for the new seats along with passengers paying full fares.
The airline said that other customers would not be placed in the
seats even if no frequent fliers reserved them. However, Dutta said
that United would not try to stop passengers from moving into empty
seats after the plane took off. He also said that the roomier seats
would be sold to standby passengers at the gate, a move that may
create resentment among customers who bought their tickets in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta said that widening the rows would result in the loss of
about six seats per airplane, which will cause United's capacity
growth to be flat next year, down from an estimated growth rate of
2 percent. United could conceivably lose money by carrying fewer
passengers. But airlines often sell the last seats in a plane at
steep discounts simply to fill them. The hope is that the roomier
seats will fill United's planes with more passengers paying higher
fares, thus increasing profits.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent fliers greeted the news enthusiastically Thursday. In a
discussion group on Webflyer.com, an Internet site devoted to
frequent fliers, several people praised United.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure once the word gets around corporate America (source
of the highest revenue travelers),'' wrote one correspondent from
Redondo Beach, Calif., ``employees forced to sit in coach will be
pressuring their travel offices to book them on United.''

3 GRANTED AMNESTY BY SOUTH AFRICA TRUTH COMMISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ A former Cabinet official, a former
head of the national police force and the former head of the brutal
Vlakplaas police unit were granted amnesty Thursday for their roles
in blowing up a church headquarters in Johannesburg in 1988 and
falsely implicating an anti-apartheid activist in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men, Adriaan Vlok, once the minister of law and
order, and Gen. Johann van der Merwe were the highest-ranking
officials of the former government to confess to illegal activities
and ask the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Vlok testified before the commission that when he ordered the
bombing he was acting under direct orders from P.W. Botha, the
president at the time, who told him the South African Council of
Churches headquarters, known as Khotso House, had become a ``house
of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The former leader of the Vlakplaas Unit, Eugene de Kock, a man
nicknamed ``Prime Evil'' by his men, has confessed to more than 100
acts of sabotage, assault, torture and murder. This is the first
time he has been granted amnesty for any of his crimes. He is
serving a 212-year jail sentence for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The commission found that all three men had met the requirements
for amnesty: They had ``made a full disclosure of all relevant
facts'' and had ``a political objective'' when they organized the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The six-story Khotso House _ the name means house of peace in
the Sotho language _ was virtually demolished in June 1988 by an
explosion in the middle of the night. The bomb injured more than 20
people.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombing, the government then engaged in a smear
campaign, trying to blame a young anti-apartheid activist, Shirley
Gunn. Ms. Gunn, and her baby, were detained by police for 62 days.
Vlok has publicly apologized to her.
</P>
<P>
   When it was destroyed, Khotso House had become a symbol of
nonviolent resistance to apartheid. In his application for amnesty,
Vlok said Botha had asked him to render it unusable. He quoted
Botha as saying he had done ``everything possible to persuade''
those who worked at Khotso House to ``come to their senses, but
nothing helps.'' Botha, now 83, has steadfastly denied any
involvement in illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Truth Commission also released its findings Thursday in
another notorious case, involving the killing of three white
right-wing activists who invaded the former black homeland of
Bophuthatswana on the eve of the country's first nonracial
elections five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The commission granted amnesty to the homeland police officer
who killed the members of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, known
as the AWB, two of whom were killed methodically after they had
already been injured.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wingers were among thousands of AWB members who had
invaded the homeland _ an area designated for blacks under the
apartheid government _ to try to quell a popular uprising against
the homeland leader, Lucas Mangope. Mangope was refusing to have
Bophuthatswana reintegrated into the new South Africa, and most of
his army and police officers turned against him. As the militant
whites invaded to help Mangope, chaos broke out and more than 20
people died.
</P>
<P>
   But the killing of the three white militants stood out amid the
carnage in part because it was captured by television cameras.
Journalists watched as the police officer, Ontlametse Menyatso,
approached the three men who lay in the dust around their Mercedes,
one dead and two bleeding badly but still answering questions.
</P>
<P>
   Menyatso then aimed his automatic rifle and shot them four
times. The killings were a defining moment in a day in which South
African right-wingers mounted their first armed challenge to the
new South Africa and went away disorganized and defeated. Mangope
acknowledged defeat the next day.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the commission, created to help South Africa put
its brutal past to rest, found that ``the events which led to the
general chaos and violence which reigned'' that day were clearly
politically motivated and it found that Menyatso had also made a
``full disclosure of all relevant facts.''  &QL;

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ The Apple Market, una pequena tienda de viveres de
Los Angeles, es el tipico mercado estadounidense, pero en sus
anaqueles hay pulpa de tamarindo, dulces y paletas picantes, y
hasta chile en polvo, todos productos de una sola empresa. Y cerca
de las cajas registradoras hay mas dulces del Grupo Lorena, entre
ellos el Pelon Pelo Rico.
 &HT;    Desde que el Pelon y sus cuates cruzaron la frontera en 1993, el
Grupo Lorena dice que las ventas se han duplicado cada ano en
terminos de volumen. Mientras Lorena, al igual que otros
fabricantes mexicanos de dulces, ha aprovechado el reconocimiento
de marca que gozan entre los consumidores mexicanos en Estados
Unidos, ahora apuntan hacia el mercado anglosajon, mucho mas
dificil de penetrar pero que pudiera ofrecer ganancias mas dulces.
 &HT;    Un paladar exigente. ``Estamos bien posicionados en la parte mas
pequena del pastel, el mercado hispano, pero nuestro interes es
desarrollar el mercado anglosajon,'' dice Ulises Padilla, gerente
de comercio internacional del Grupo Lorena. El mercado
estadounidense, segun la Asociacion Nacional de Fabricantes de
Confituras (NCA) de Estados Unidos, se calcula en unos US$22.000
millones anuales, diez veces mayor que el de Mexico.
 &HT;    De igul manera, Grupo Montes, otro fabricante mexicano de dulces
que vende unos US$70 millones al ano y exporta la tercera parte de
su produccion, tambien quiere salir del nicho al mercado mas
amplio. ``Se trata de aprovechar al maximo el conocimiento de
mercado que tienen los distribuidores estadounidenses,'' dice
Armando Crespo, subdirector de exportaciones del Grupo Montes,
cuyos productos se venden en cadenas como Sam's Club, Wal-Mart y
Price Costco.
 &HT;    La entrada al mercado anglosajon exige estrategias diferentes.
Tanto Grupo Lorena como Grupo Montes afirman que los servicios de
maquila son un buen inicio. Grupo Lorena elabora dulces para The
Candy Company, Albert's y la espanola Chupa-Chups, y Montes para
las marcas de Sam's Club o Price Costco. Pero el objetivo final es
comercializar su propia marca. Y ya comenzaron: Lorena, con sus
paletas Fruit Pops y Color Brush, y Montes, con sus Fruit Chews y
Panda Pops.
 &HT;    ``Este mercado es mas dificil porque no tenemos una marca
reconocida,'' explica Crespo, de Grupo Montes. Tambien es un
mercado mucho mas exigente en materia de contenido del producto,
empaque, presentacion y servicio.
 &HT;    ``Aqui te llaman por telefono para preguntarte por que tus
paletas tienen tanto porcentaje de azucar o de glucosa, o por que
no tienen equis valor proteico, por ejemplo,'' cuenta Miguel Angel
Valadez, ejecutivo de Comercio Internacional del Grupo Lorena.
 &HT;    Ademas, todavia predominan los prejuicios. ``Para vender tus
dulces en el mercado sajon, lo primero que tienes que hacer es
quitarle todo lo que diga 'Hecho en Mexico' o 'mexicano', porque se
asume que es un producto para el mercado hispano barato y mala
calidad,'' explica Jesus Arroyo, director comercial de Grupo
Lorena.
 &HT;    Pero no exhibir su procedencia mexicana no significa dejar de
aprovechar en Estados Unidos las tacticas que han rendido
resultados en Mexico. Igual que el grupo mexicano Bimbo _ aunque en
una escala mucho menor _ Lorena asegura la presencia de sus
productos en los puntos de venta con sus propias camionetas
repartidoras. El denominado Plan de las 100 Tiendas, que arranco en
1998, busca una distribucion directa y controlada en por lo menos
100 supermercados medianos, que ademas le permitira conocer que
productos tienen mayor demanda y quienes los consumen.
 &HT;    Valadez, de Grupo Lorena, explica que el plan esta a mitad del
camino, y entre sus principales clientes ahora estan pequenas
cadenas como Farmer's Market, The Apple Market, Best Value y King's
Ranch. Con este plan, Lorena no solo ha conseguido espacio en los
anaqueles, sino que ahora sabe que otros productos comienzan a
venderse mas. El resultado: aunque el Pelon Pelo Rico es aun la
estrella, ya no representa el 80 por ciento de las ventas sino
apenas el 30 por ciento, porque la linea cuenta con mas de 35
productos. Ademas, Grupo Lorena calcula que en 1999 vendera unos
100 millones de golosinas en el mercado anglosajon.
 &HT;    El Poder del Peloton
 &HT;    Al igual que Sanson, el poder del Pelon Pelo Rico esta en su
cabello. En ese caso, sin embargo, el chiste no solo es cortarlo
sino comerse el cabello que comienza a salirle cuando se aprieta el
tubo, en realidad dulce de tamarindo mezclado con pimiento picante.
 &HT;    Conocido como un dulce-juguete, el Pelon puede encontrarse en
todo Mexico y Centroamerica, desde una pequena tiendita hasta los
grandes mercados. El termino de dulce divertido o dulce juguete es
un concepto que integra la golosina en si a un juguete o artefacto
que hace su consumo mas divertido. En el caso del Pelon Pelo Rico
es un tubo plastico con la cara de un senor calvo. Cuando se
aprieta la parte inferior del tubo, al senor le sale pelo, pero en
realidad es dulce picante de tamarindo.
 &HT;    Aunque no le suene muy sabroso, al poderoso Pelon se le atribuye
auge del Grupo Lorena a mediados de los anos 80, cuando el
primogenito del fundador, Fernando Topete Davila, establecio la
linea de dulces picantes que en poco tiempo se convirtio en el eje
del negocio familiar. Hoy, Grupo Lorena agrupa a 10 empresas
dulceras, tiene mas de 900 empleados, exporta el 25 por ciento de
su produccion y vende unos 700 millones de dulces al ano
practicamente en toda America.

venderse mas. El resultado: aunque el Pelon Pelo Rico es aun la
estrella, ya no representa el 80 por ciento de las ventas sino
apenas el 30 por ciento, porque la linea cuenta con mas de 35
productos. Ademas, Grupo Lorena calcula que en 1999 vendera unos
100 millones de golosinas en el mercado anglosajon.
 &HT;    El Poder del Peloton
 &HT;    Al igual que Sanson, el poder del Pelon Pelo Rico esta en su
cabello. En ese caso, sin embargo, el chiste no solo es cortarlo
sino comerse el cabello que comienza a salirle cuando se aprieta el
tubo, en realidad dulce de tamarindo mezclado con pimiento picante.
 &HT;    Conocido como un dulce-juguete, el Pelon puede encontrarse en
todo Mexico y Centroamerica, desde una pequena tiendita hasta los
grandes mercados. El termino de dulce divertido o dulce juguete es
un concepto que integra la golosina en si a un juguete o artefacto
que hace su consumo mas divertido. En el caso del Pelon Pelo Rico
es un tubo plastico con la cara de un senor calvo. Cuando se
aprieta la parte inferior del tubo, al senor le sale pelo, pero en
realidad es dulce picante de tamarindo.
 &HT;    Aunque no le suene muy sabroso, al poderoso Pelon se le atribuye
auge del Grupo Lorena a mediados de los anos 80, cuando el
primogenito del fundador, Fernando Topete Davila, establecio la
linea de dulces picantes que en poco tiempo se convirtio en el eje
del negocio familiar. Hoy, Grupo Lorena agrupa a 10 empresas
dulceras, tiene mas de 900 empleados, exporta el 25 por ciento de
su produccion y vende unos 700 millones de dulces al ano
practicamente en toda America.

MOBY INFUSES ELECTRONICA WITH GOSPEL, HIP-HOP, BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moby's new album, ``Play,'' is an orgy of musical eclecticism.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic-music artist turns convention upside-down with
his mesmerizing blend of throbbing hip-hop, ambient piano noodlings
and early 20th-century blues and gospel fused with modern
electronic beats.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Play'' isn't a concept album, Moby explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only agenda in making a record is to make something that I
love and that I think is interesting and compelling,'' he said in a
phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``And hopefully in the process, I can make something that other
people will love and find interesting too.''
</P>
<P>
   Moby put his stamp on techno with the 1990 recording of ``Go.''
It became an anthem of the international rave scene. But his resume
includes punk rocker and soundtrack composer as well as techno
artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play,'' one of the coolest electronic-music albums of the
year, has the stylistic breadth to appeal to the most dedicated
fans of the genre as well as casual but adventurous pop listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the album was recorded in Moby's home studio in the
South Bronx. Moby wrote all the songs and played all the
instruments. He also sang on a number of tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play'' opens with ``Honey,'' featuring singer Bessie Jones'
earthy vocals over Moby's funky, shuffling beats and pounding
piano. Synthesizers brighten the pleading gospel vocals of ``Why
Does My Heart Feel So Bad?'' And on ``Natural Blues,'' Vera Hall, a
gospel singer of the '40s, sings ``Ooh, Lawdy, troubles so hard''
over a rumbling honky-tonk piano that takes the floor right out
from under you.
</P>
<P>
   Moby sampled vintage blues and gospel music from field
recordings made by folklorist Alan Lomax in the 1920s, '30s and
'40s. Some of Lomax's recordings are available on Atlantic Records
and Rhino Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lomax) spent his whole life just driving around the country
and recording as much indigenous music as he could get his hands
on,'' Moby said.
</P>
<P>
   Lomax used some of the best recording equipment available at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons I was able to incorporate these
vocals into the album,'' Moby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of his recordings are great to listen to, but they're
sort of unusable because the sonic quality is so limited. But so
many of them were pristinely recorded.''
</P>
<P>
   Moby, a descendant of ``Moby Dick'' author Herman Melville, got
his nickname from his parents (his real name is Richard Hall). His
father died when he was 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a musically eclectic household,'' he said. ``My
mom played piano and she was always listening to different kinds of
music, everything from classical music to folk music to rock and
jazz and pop and blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I grew up hearing all these different types of music and
she had lots of friends who were musicians. We always had a lot of
musical instruments around and she encouraged me to take lessons
and pursue music in any way that I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Moby once quipped to a reporter that history's first rave might
have been the celebration that greeted the arrival of the Ark of
the Covenant in Jerusalem. His new album suggests a connection
between the giddy excitement of rave music and the inspirational
music of church.
</P>
<P>
   Though he isn't a religious person, Moby thanks Jesus Christ in
the liner notes for ``Play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Christ and I love the teachings of Christ,'' he said.
``But I don't see how by anyone's conventional definition I could
be considered a religious person. My mother, if I could describe
her, was a pantheist. She didn't have any specific religious
belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Moby's current tour included a stop at the recent Woodstock
festival, where about $5,000 in Moby T-shirts and merchandise were
trashed and burned by rioters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do my own merchandise, so it wasn't like they were sticking
it to some faceless corporation. It was poor little me getting my
T-shirts burned,'' Moby said.

800 LIBERTY MUTUAL WORKERS MAY FACE JOB LOSS IN CUTBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER KAMINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Liberty Mutual Group, the nation's largest workers'
compensation insurer, is laying off employees as part of a national
effort to contain costs and consolidate its operations.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 800 workers may receive pink slips, according to
several former employees who asked to have their names withheld.
Layoffs began about six weeks ago, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees said the layoffs were undertaken after Liberty Mutual
acquired a number of smaller insurance firms in the United States
and overseas. ``They told us it was because of reorganization,''
one former company attorney said. ``They said they didn't have the
workload to support all of the people they had.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cusolito, a spokesman for Liberty Mutual, confirmed
Thursday that the company is laying off some of its 37,000
employees as part of a nationwide ``expense management'' program.
``It's in all parts of our organization,'' he said, and is being
carried out by managers in various departments and offices in order
``to align expenses with revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   However, reports of 800 layoffs are ``not accurate,'' Cusolito
said. ``It's really too premature,'' he said. ``We don't have an
overall number.''
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs came across the board, according to the former
employees. But substantial numbers of workers were cut from the
legal, computer support, research, and statistical analysis
departments, they said. It's unclear how many employees in
Massachusetts would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 workers in Liberty Mutual's information technology
division in Dover and Portsmouth, N.H., were let go at the
beginning of July. Those layoffs were attributed to a declining
need for technicians as the company completed its preparations for
dealing with the computer glitch known as the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Liberty Mutual reported a net income of $244.8
million. The Boston company manages more than $61 billion in
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Workers' compensation insurance, which provides benefits to
workers who are unble to perform due to injuries on the job, is
becoming an increasingly competitive industry with significant cost
pressures, Cusolito said.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years Liberty Mutual has aggressively sought
to buy a number of insurance companies across the nation and in the
United Kingdom, notably Wausau Insurance Cos. of Wisconsin and
Guardian Royal Exchange PLC, to diversify business and become less
dependent on workers' compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Mutual has received strong credit ratings from both
Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service, but in
February Moody's added a ``negative'' outlook to its ``Aa3''
rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Aa3 rating means they are a fairly sound franchise,''
Moody's analyst Bill Wilt said, adding that increased competition,
medical cost inflation, and government reform efforts have made the
market less profitable. ``In general workers' compensation results
have been deteriorating,'' he said. ``It has been an increasingly
challenging way to make money.''

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The danger from mines and unexploded
bombs in Kosovo is far greater than previously thought, and
casualties have soared to alarming levels, according to
international aid agencies and mine-clearing organizations here.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most dangerous are the volatile British- and
U.S.-made cluster bombs, which have been found in almost every part
of the province and have already caused some terrible accidents.
Depleted uranium ammunition was also used in Kosovo, NATO has told
those defusing the bombs and clearing the mines.
</P>
<P>
   As the death toll rises and aid agencies contemplate the
difficult task ahead, recriminations are growing over NATO's use of
the cluster bombs and what an aid worker said was NATO's reluctance
to deal with ``its own battle junk.''
</P>
<P>
   The mines were planted by the Yugoslav army and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas during their year-long war before the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In a report last week, the World Health Organization estimated
that between June 13 and July 12, 130 to 170 people were injured or
died in bomb and mine accidents, a rate of about 10 per 100,000
residents. This rate ``is comparable to that previously experienced
in other emergency situations such as Afghanistan and Cambodia,''
the Mine Action Coordination Center in Pristina said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Those clearing mines are reaching similar conclusions. Former
army engineers and explosives experts from a British group, the
HALO Trust, are close to completing a two-month survey and have
found a far greater presence of mines planted by Yugoslavs and
Kosovars than they had expected. These experts have visited every
village in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mine problem is much higher than the survey anticipated,
far higher,'' said Phil Straw, a senior survey officer at HALO.
``We came thinking there was a lot of media hype about mines and
what was here. But I can say now that there are 500,000 mines in
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably 400,000 of the mines are in uninhabited areas near the
southern borders, he said, but thousands are also strewn across
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have six kilometers of antipersonnel mines,'' Straw said,
pointing to a broad orange line running alongside a map of villages
in western Kosovo. ``That's in the middle of Kosovo, in village
areas. That really is a big task.''
</P>
<P>
   But far more alarming for the engineers is the high number of
cluster bombs they have found, and have seen kill people. Their
storage room in Pristina is full of the ugly casings of bombs,
missiles and mine debris, and a whole wall is devoted to the
cluster bomb.
</P>
<P>
   There is a three-foot-long oval green bomb casing with a broken
tail fin, an eight-inch-long bright yellow U.S. cluster-bomb
canister and a spiky metal shuttlecock of the British one.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has told those clearing the ordnance that it dropped 1,500
cluster bombs on Kosovo during its two-month air war. Each releases
150 to 200 bomblets, small canisters that float down to the ground
on individual parachutes or with metal shuttlecocks. Each canister
is potentially lethal when jolted or moved.
</P>
<P>
   HALO has found dozens of casings and canisters all over Kosovo,
and Straw said all of them were out of date and thus more likely to
land without exploding. He pointed to one and said, ``The date _
you see, they are all under warranty _ is until February '98.''
</P>
<P>
   Another engineer added: ``I have not seen a single one within
date. The high failure rate, perhaps 30 percent rather than the
predicted 10 percent, means there is more dangerous ordnance to
pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   Adem Berisha, 25, and several soldiers with the Kosovo
Liberation Army were victims of cluster bombs they found close to
the Albanian border. He lies on his bed in Pristina Hospital,
contorted with discomfort as nurses clean a deep wound in his foot.
His body is peppered with black scars and two long surgical scars
cross his chest.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars had collected seven cluster-bomb canisters and
brought them on a tractor to a weapons storeroom in Rogovo. Italian
troops from the peacekeeping force came to inspect them and moved
them close to the door.
</P>
<P>
   After the Italians left, one soldier decided to move the
canisters to a safer place. Berisha saw him trip.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion was enormous and deadly. Six men were wounded. Two
of his best friends were killed.
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread ignorance about the danger of cluster bombs.
Villagers and Kosovo Liberation Army soldiers are moving them, and
even two soldiers of the British Gurkha regiment were killed when
moving cluster bombs into a field to destroy them. Their bodies
were reportedly never recovered, so powerful was the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agencies are angry that NATO has only just released
photographs of the cluster bombs for safety campaigns being
conducted in schools and villages. It was reportedly four weeks
after the bombing ended that allied officers also mentioned that
depleted uranium rounds had been used on Serbian tanks, and warned
the mine-clearers to avoid crawling over tank wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   While many Kosovars are aware of the dangers of mines, few know
about cluster bombs or depleted uranium. Some information they are
being given is inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even when villagers know of the dangers, it is not enough to
protect them. According to WHO, 71 percent of the victims in the
last month have been under 24 years old, and 19 percent were
injured while clearing ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are forgetting they should be aware of mines,'' said
Bedri Bakalli, chief orthopedic surgeon at Pristina Hospital.
``Maybe they need to teach them for longer, and to repeat the
message more. It's going to go on being a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As the clearing operations continue, accidents keep happening.
</P>
<P>
   Two young patients tear around the hallways of Pristina Hospital
in wheelchairs. The boys, Adem Kelmendi, 13, and his cousin Alten,
9, both lost their legs when they stepped on a mine near their
house as they chased the family cow across a field the family
presumed was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men had cut the hay in those fields,'' Alten's mother
said, ``and the cows went there. We did not think there was a
problem. We had just been back home four days.''

SWISS PROSECUTOR TO BE NAMED TO WAR CRIMES TRIBUNALS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Switzerland, Canada, Sicily, Pakistan, Tanzania, Rwanda)   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A Swiss lawyer with wide experience in fighting
money laundering and organized crime is expected to be named chief
prosecutor of the international war crimes tribunals for the
Balkans and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Carla Del Ponte, Switzerland's attorney general and
federal prosecutor, would replace Louise Arbour, a Canadian judge
who has been appointed to Canada's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary General Kofi Annan met with Mrs. Del Ponte Thursday
and was expected to forward the nomination to the Security Council
overnight. U.N. officials do not expect opposition in the Council,
which created the tribunals and formally appoints the prosecutor
and judges, because members have been consulted in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Del Ponte, 52, will be the first experienced prosecutor to
hold the job on the war crimes tribunals. Her predecessors, Ms.
Arbour and Richard Goldstone of South Africa, were both judges. The
chief prosecutor is appointed for a four-year term and is based in
The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland is not a member of the United Nations, but Swiss
citizens often serve in professional U.N. jobs. In this case,
Switzerland's neutrality _ it is not a member of NATO _ is
considered an advantage for Mrs. Del Ponte, who will be working on
cases involving the conflict in Kosovo. The Balkan tribunal has
before it an indictment of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, Mrs. Del Ponte will be responsible for the separate
Rwanda tribunal, which has been plagued by management problems at
its headquarters in Arusha, Tanzania. The Rwanda tribunal has,
however, a growing list of indictments and convictions of people
involved in the mass killings of Tutsi and moderate Hutu in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Mrs. Del Ponte became well known in Europe for
breaking a Sicilian Mafia money-laundering operation in
Switzerland, pursuing former Soviet bloc officials who may have
been stowing illegal funds in Switzerland and investigating Swiss
bankers suspected of misappropriating money, in some cases in
collaboration with Latin Americans. She also produced the evidence
for Pakistan to bring money-laundering charges against Benazir
Bhutto, a former prime minister, and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of her international investigations, Mrs. Del
Ponte has worked with American officials, including Louis Freeh,
the FBI Director.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Del Ponte suffered a setback last month when Switzerland's
highest court overturned the confiscation by her office of $90
million from Swiss accounts belonging to Raul Salinas de Gortari,
the brother of a former president of Mexico. The court ruled that
Mrs. Del Ponte had no authority to seize the $90 million only on
the suspicion that it included money from drug-trafficking. But the
ruling did not absolve Salinas of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Lugano on Feb. 9, 1947, Mrs. Del Ponte was educated in
Geneva and Bern and in Britain. She began her career in a law firm
in Lugano and three years later, in 1975, set up her own practice.
In 1981 she was appointed investigating magistrate and then public
prosecutor in the office of the Lugano district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Mrs. Del Ponte, who speaks English, French, German and
Italian, was named attorney general of Switzerland, and she has
also served since then as the country's chief prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to aggressive investigations into money laundering
and other economic crimes, she also turned her attention to arms
trafficking and support for terrorist organizations.

RAPE OF 14-YEAR-OLD IN BALLET PROGRAM ALLEGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY AND RYAN DAVIS AND  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Police are investigating allegations that two young
male dancers in the Boston Ballet's summer program committed
statutory rape when they had sex with a 14-year-old female dancer
in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The charges surface as the summer program draws to a close
Friday with concluding performances.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Police detective Sergeant Margot Hill confirmed that
there is an ongoing statutory rape investigation involving students
in the summer program, but declined to supply any details. The
Suffolk County District Attorney's office also is involved in the
probe, office spokesman James Borghesani said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Ballet spokesman John Michael Kennedy said the ballet
company ``is cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities as
this matter is further investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston Ballet acknowledges the seriousness of the
allegations involving students in its Summer Dance Program,''
Kennedy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The ages of the male dancers were not available, but each would
have to be 22 or younger to participate in the summer program.
</P>
<P>
   Students said Boston Police detectives visited the ballet's
facility in the city's South End this week, where they interviewed
several members of the teaching staff and dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Two male students left with police officers for further
questioning, a witness said, but no one has been charged.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of statutory rape _ meaning the alleged victim
is younger than 16 years old _ would make it unnecessary for
prosecutors to prove in court that sex was coerced. Even consensual
sex is barred by the statute, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The company recruits students for the summer program from
throughout the world. Landing one of the 300 coveted slots in the
program is a highly competitive venture.
</P>
<P>
   Auditions are conducted at about a dozen sites around the
country, including New York City and San Francisco, Kennedy said.
In addition, some candidates send in videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a ``pre-professional program,'' the program has
students ranging in ages from 13 to 22. Many hope the exposure and
concentrated study will help launch their professional careers.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet has had 332 students in its summer program this year,
including 294 females.
</P>
<P>
   The students stay in a dormitory at Emerson College, where 13
resident advisers are on hand to supervise, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The students are divided among 10 skill levels, not by age,
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which started in 1980, includes one group that
meets for the six-week span and two others that meet for three
weeks each.

 &HT;    Rainbow/PUSH: Democrats court key voters
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley and
Tipper Gore, his rival's wife, campaigned at the Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition's annual meeting Thursday, bringing messages of racial
unity to a key Democratic Party constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president will speak to the gathering Saturday, and the
stakes for both men couldn't be higher. Rainbow Coalition founder
Jesse Jackson hasn't endorsed anyone, and many other influential
black leaders haven't, either.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore both were warmly received by the hundreds of
delegates gathered in Chicago under the slogan, ``Building Bridges,
Building Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore was clearly given the VIP treatment. The keynote
speaker for a luncheon honoring women, she spoke to more than 1,200
delegates _ three times the breakfast audience Bradley had hours
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Gore referred to her husband repeatedly in her remarks and
promised that if he is elected president, he will reduce class
sizes, make schools ``drug free and gun free'' and ``remain fully
committed to affirmative action and civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has remained neutral in the Gore-Bradley presidential
sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great respect for both,'' said Jackson, who spoke
privately with Bradley after his remarks. ``Vice President Gore _
our relationship is good. It's personal, it's deep, but that's true
for Bill Bradley, too. Both are decent men, smart, both are
sensitive. Both have the stuff of which great presidents are
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said it was time for the candidates to ``stake out their
territory and be defined by what they are going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bradley's long record of speaking out against racial
prejudice, most analysts say that Gore holds a distinct edge among
the nation's black electorate, benefiting partly from the enormous
popularity President Clinton enjoys among black voters.
</P>
<P>
   They note that Gore is strongest in the South, where black
people make up a larger portion of the Democratic primary vote, and
that Bradley has yet to make much of an effort to organize
grass-roots support in that region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see Bradley as a candidate who has any Southern
appeal,'' said David Bositis, senior analyst at the Joint Center
for Political and Economic Studies.
</P>
<P>
   In a new poll to be released as early as today, Bositis said he
found that black voters view both Bradley and Gore favorably by a
four to one margin. But Bradley is still unknown to more than 40
percent of the black electorate, while Gore is ``universally''
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has been going out of his way since at least 1996 to
attract black voters,'' Bositis said. ``It isn't that Bill Bradley
is unpopular. His biggest problem is that he is unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to delegates here, Bradley spoke about his
life-long commitment to ending racial inequality, and declared that
``racial unity is not a project, it is not my position, it is my
core.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley challenged the vice president to convince President
Clinton to sign an executive order banning racial profiling in
federal law enforcement, something Gore has said he will do if
elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say why wait?'' said Bradley. ``Mr. Vice President, walk
down that hall where the president is seated, go up to him with the
executive order and say to him, 'Sign this now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also charged that the White House has not paid enough
attention to the plight of poor children.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first two-term Democratic president since Franklin
Roosevelt, the number of children in poverty in America has barely
blipped down,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Egondu Onyejekwe, an engineer from Columbus, Ohio, gave Bradley
middling marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was OK,'' she said. ``Sometimes they offend you by saying
things you know they wouldn't do. It's a very good skill to talk in
generic terms, but I want something I can put my hands on and
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's impeachment ordeal, black voters were
consistently Clinton's biggest backers. In 1998, blacks voted in
sharply higher numbers and helped elect Democrats, especially in
the South.
</P>
<P>
   Much, though not all, of that support for Clinton will probably
transfer to Gore, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore starts out with a lot,'' said Emory University political
scientist Merle Black. ``He has certainly been the contact person
with the White House and with black elected officials across the
country. That pays off in political support.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Clinton is personally popular with black voters, some
of the administration's policies have upset black leaders. There is
still unhappiness that Clinton yielded on the welfare reform bill
and his initiative on race relations failed to deliver on many of
its promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Gore is that he is trading on the record of
the Clinton administration,'' said Dr. Ron Walters, a scholar at
the James McGregor Burns Academy of Leadership. ``What people want
to see is what he will do differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same challenge has to be met by Bradley,'' said Walters.
``He gives you the feeling he has an understanding of (racial
inequalities), but that is far from a public policy agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own speech to delegates, Tipper Gore noted that
unemployment figures for blacks and Latinos are at record lows, and
she pledged her husband would work to increase incomes for poorer
Americans, something Bradley has also promised to make a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just magnificent,'' said Helen Anglin, a Chicago
restaurant owner. ``She did address our concerns.''

ROLE OF ASSAD'S SON SAID TO BE UNDECIDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Whether the 34-year-old son of President Hafez
al-Assad is his father's preferred choice as the next leader of
Syria is an open question, a high-ranking government official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Information Minister Mohammed Salman, seemed to be
trying to inject a bit of doubt into the increasing presumption
that the son, Bashar, is being anointed as Assad's successor. There
has been speculation that the succession might be a factor in
Syria's renewed efforts toward peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent Syrians and foreign diplomats here have suggested
that a desire to smooth the way for the younger Assad might be
behind the 68-year-old president's declared eagerness to move
swiftly toward peace with Israel and its new leader, Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The question of succession is highly sensitive, one that Syrian
officials have almost always sidestepped. But Salman, who does not
often meet foreign journalists, raised the issue at the start of an
interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to now, officially there is nothing to indicate that he has
been appointed to any official position,'' Salman said of Bashar
Assad, a former ophthalmologist whose sole title is colonel. Under
the constitution, a president has to be a member of the command
council of the governing Baath Party and should be 40.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Salman did not try to close the door on the prospect that
Bashar Assad might be elevated, and he praised him at length. He
called the younger Assad a technocrat and a modernizer and noted
that as president of the country's computer society, he had been
the driving force behind Syria's gradual embrace of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people in this country see these new initiatives, they
are inclined to express their welcoming of such a man in a high
position,'' he said. ``As a person, I really want him to have a
high position, either in the party or the leadership of the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The succession question is increasingly being discussed, as the
president has shown signs of uncertain health and as his son Assad
has been given additional responsibilities. In official Syrian
publications, the caption under portraits of Bashar Assad describes
him as ``the hope.''
</P>
<P>
   A persistent rumor reported by many well-connected Syrians is
that Bashar Assad will be elevated to a party post at a meeting
being planned for the late fall, a step that could put him in line
for future promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Many diplomats based in Damascus say there is little doubt that
Bashar Assad is his father's choice. But the fact that Assad is
young and untested and that Syria has no history of family
dynasties has persuaded some that if the father died soon, the son
might be made part of a collective leadership headed by Vice
President Abdel Halim Khaddam.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hard-core elements in the Baath establishment and
the military leadership that might not see in Bashar the caliber of
leadership that they believe is required,'' said one well-connected
Syrian.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the interview Thursday, Salman also expressed a new hint of
dissatisfaction with Barak, whose post-election pledges of a
commitment to make peace with Syria have kindled a sense of
optimism. Salman said Syria was still waiting for Barak to
reiterate what Damascus says is a commitment that Israel made
before negotiations were suspended in 1996 _ to work toward a peace
that would include a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope,'' Salman said, ``that such maneuvering by Barak will
not lead to a delay in the restarting of negotiations and, of
course, to a deadlock.''

ROSENBLUTH INTERNATIONAL BUYS BUSINESS TRAVEL WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.) (Eds.: Please note that the word AT within parentheses has been
used in the 2nd graf instead of the symbol, which is
non-transmittable to many newspaper systems.)

<P>
   Rosenbluth International said Thursday that it had bought a
majority stake in Biztravel.com, a leading site for making business
travel arrangements over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors, including Continental Airlines, Marriott
International, Sun Microsystems and Excite (AT)Home, also bought
stakes in the company, which promises to vault Rosenbluth, a travel
management company, into the forefront of online travel.
Rosenbluth, which is privately owned, declined to disclose the
purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity to get into e-commerce,'' said Hal
Rosenbluth, the chief executive of the company. ``We've been
studying it for some time, and we were embarked on building our own
site, but when this opportunity came along, we jumped on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many companies, Rosenbluth was aware of a forecast by
Jupiter Communications, a research group, that online sales of
travel services will grow to about $11.2 billion in 2002 from $911
million in 1997. Its opportunity to become a bigger player in that
market arose after Biztravel.com retained Paine Webber to sell it
at auction, Rosenbluth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happened,'' he said, ``we were hellbent on ensuring
that we won, then we went out and brought in the other partners,
all of them class companies with good brands.'' The Blackstone
Group acted as Rosenbluth International's financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbluth, based in Philadelphia, is the nation's third-biggest
travel agency, with $3.74 billion in gross retail sales last year,
according to the Travel Weekly trade publication. Its revenue now
exceeds $4 billion a year, the company said. Only American Express,
with gross revenue of $11.9 billion, and Carlson Wagonlit, with
more than $11 billion, are bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, Rosenbluth International will establish
an affiliate company, Rosenbluth Interactive, It will comprise
Biztravel.com, which will focus on smaller businesses, including
the fast-growing home-based businesses, and a consumer site that
will be available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most notable features of the consumer site, to be
announced later, will be its posting of a wide range of discounted
fares that will be monitored up until the day of departure.
Rosenbluth said it would monitor those fares and would exchange
tickets already bought at a higher fare with cheaper tickets that
become available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our booking engine will continually pulse the airlines for low
fares,'' Rosenbluth said, ``and if we find a ticket lower than the
one somebody already bought from us, we'll exchange the cheaper
ticket for the more expensive one.'' Rosenbluth added that he was
``a firm believer that most of the public doesn't really think it
got the best air fare.''

RAPE OF 14-YEAR-OLD IN BALLET PROGRAM ALLEGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY AND RYAN DAVIS AND  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Police are investigating allegations that two young
male dancers in the Boston Ballet's summer program committed
statutory rape when they had sex with a 14-year-old female dancer
in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The charges surface as the summer program draws to a close
Friday with concluding performances.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Police detective Sergeant Margot Hill confirmed that
there is an ongoing statutory rape investigation involving students
in the summer program, but declined to supply any details. The
Suffolk County District Attorney's office also is involved in the
probe, office spokesman James Borghesani said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Ballet spokesman John Michael Kennedy said the ballet
company ``is cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities as
this matter is further investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston Ballet acknowledges the seriousness of the
allegations involving students in its Summer Dance Program,''
Kennedy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The ages of the male dancers were not available, but each would
have to be 22 or younger to participate in the summer program.
</P>
<P>
   Students said Boston Police detectives visited the ballet's
facility in the city's South End this week, where they interviewed
several members of the teaching staff and dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Two male students left with police officers for further
questioning, a witness said, but no one has been charged.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of statutory rape _ meaning the alleged victim
is younger than 16 years old _ would make it unnecessary for
prosecutors to prove in court that sex was coerced. Even consensual
sex is barred by the statute, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The company recruits students for the summer program from
throughout the world. Landing one of the 300 coveted slots in the
program is a highly competitive venture.
</P>
<P>
   Auditions are conducted at about a dozen sites around the
country, including New York City and San Francisco, Kennedy said.
In addition, some candidates send in videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a ``pre-professional program,'' the program has
students ranging in ages from 13 to 22. Many hope the exposure and
concentrated study will help launch their professional careers.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet has had 332 students in its summer program this year,
including 294 females.
</P>
<P>
   The students stay in a dormitory at Emerson College, where 13
resident advisers are on hand to supervise, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The students are divided among 10 skill levels, not by age,
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which started in 1980, includes one group that
meets for the six-week span and two others that meet for three
weeks each.

TREASURY SECURITIES RISE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities rose for the second consecutive
session Thursday, as the pricing of a huge debt issue by Wal-Mart
Stores failed to hurt the sale of U.S. government paper.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond gained 23/32 to a price of 89 7/32; its yield,
which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 6.04
percent, down from 6.09 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted the strong investor demand for the debt of
Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer. The size of the issue
increased twice before pricing, to $5.75 billion. The debt
offering, handled through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers, is
the first AA-rated deal paper to be sold in about four months. It
drew buyers by the sheer visibility of its name, its credit quality
and the yield spread over Treasury securities with a similar
maturity.
</P>
<P>
   The debt was sold in three maturities, with $1.25 billion of
two-year global bonds priced to yield 6.179 percent, or about 65
basis points more than a similar Treasury security. A basis point
is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The second maturity included $1.25 billion of a five-year
maturity, priced to yield 6.586 percent, or 85 basis points more
than a similar Treasury, with the longer maturity totaling $3.25
billion of 10-year debt priced to yield 6.93 percent, or 103 basis
points more than a comparable Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Traders expect that Treasuries could have a difficult time
pushing higher in the weeks ahead, with about $44 billion more in
debt sales scheduled to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's advance was likely tied to investors buying back
Treasuries that had been sold ahead of the Wal-Mart deal.
Securities firms tend to sell their most liquid government paper
before underwriting large issues as a hedge against a rise in
interest rates while investors absorb the new securities, then buy
back the Treasuries as the sale is completed.
</P>
<P>
   With investors worried that the Fed may raise interest rates
later this month, there is a chance that the appetite for more debt
is dwindling. Still, that was not apparent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rally, investors continue to watch the labor markets
for any hint that the economy is picking up and that inflation
might thus become a threat. Friday's July employment report should
give more clues about what to expect from the Federal Reserve
policy makers at the Aug. 24 meeting of the Fed's Open Market
Committee.

REVOLUTION HOPE TO SURVIVE RAPIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Revolution might be in the midst of another down
cycle, but John Harkes is taking the situation in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be all right,'' Harkes said while preparing for
Friday night's game against the Colorado Rapids. ``You look around
the league and this happens to most teams. Even with D.C. United
there were times when we would lose two or three games in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, though, have taken losing to extremes, setting
MLS records with nine-game losing streaks in 1997 and '98. In 115
MLS games, the Revolution have earned 117 points, the lowest
per-match average in the Eastern Conference and tied with San Jose
for all-time lowest. Further, the Revolution's all-time goal
differential is worst in the league, though the problem appeared to
have been solved until the last three matches.
</P>
<P>
   But after losses of 5-2, 2-0, and 4-1 in the first three games
of the second half of the season, many questions have been raised
about the Revolution. Certainly, the Revolution have missed Harkes
and Joe-Max Moore, who returned from US national team duty this
week. But both were in the lineup when the Revolution losing streak
started against Los Angeles July 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the best situation when you are missing players,''
Harkes said. ``But we won games when I was out before and when Joey
missed a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think about what happened last year or before that.
This is a whole new team and we have a whole new attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkes's career has rebounded from a year ago, when he had been
dismissed from the United States national team by former US coach
Steve Sampson during preparations for the France '98 World Cup.
Last month, Harkes was chosen for the MLS All-Star Game, then
performed for the national team that finished third place in the
Confederations Cup in Mexico, where he was reunited with his former
D.C. United coach Bruce Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing is that Bruce has faith in the team's depth,''
Harkes said. ``From what I saw during training sessions, Bruce and
his coaching staff are on the right track. We had some good
success, beating Germany and we had a good chance to beat or tie
Brazil. We just didn't finish our chances the whole tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied with my performance, but who knows where Bruce
stands? I know him well but he is still juggling players, so we'll
see. I don't think I have to prove anything to anyone. One person
(Sampson) made a decision on me. But I've continued to play the way
I know how and I'll always play the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Revolution has lacked Harkes's competitive spirit,
especially in a 4-1 loss at Tampa Bay. But even with Harkes, Moore,
and newcomer Ariel Graziani, the Revolution have yet to address
their defensive shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a problem when I left,'' Harkes said. ``Maybe
we need to change things around, go back to a 4-4-2. We have enough
good players on this team to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Harkes consider moving into central defense, especially if
Dan Calichman continues to struggle with groin and hip injuries?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever I'm needed, I will play there,'' Harkes said. ``But
we have a lot of experience in defense. Mike Burns is our captain
and he can work out a lot of things back there.''

WOMAN WHO GOT L.L. BEAN CALLS TO GET GIFT CERTIFICATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She became Bean For A Day _ L.L. Bean, that is.
</P>
<P>
   But the Northern Virginia woman who suddenly found her phone
ringing off the hook with orders from customers wanting to outfit
their children in the latest outdoor Beanwear wasn't discomfited by
the experience, a company official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was extremely gracious and good &UR;  &LR; natured and wonderfully
helpful,'' said spokeswoman Mary Rose MacKinnon, describing the
still unidentified woman who found herself accidentally at the end
of L.L. Bean's toll-free line last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``She even took orders for us, so no sales were lost,''
MacKinnon said, happily.
</P>
<P>
   The mixup occurred last week when L.L. Bean's new children's
catalog, ``L.L. Kids,'' arrived in customers' homes. The toll-free
order number, which was supposed to read 877-LLB-KIDS, was changed
to 800-LLB-KIDS on some pages in the catalog.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor gear company provided more details of the snafu
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 800 number was originally assigned to ``a kids' business
which had become inactive,'' MacKinnon said. But through what she
described as ``a technical phone-company glitch,'' the number
actually rang at the private residence of a woman who lived in
Virginia. Additional details about the glitch were not provided.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials declined to identify the woman, saying ``she
has been through enough'' as the recipient of an avalanche of
calls. ``We choose not to inconvenience her further,'' MacKinnon
said.
</P>
<P>
   L.L. Bean acquired the inactive toll-free number immediately at
no cost, MacKinnon added. She initially denied reports that the
company financially compensated the good samaritan who cheerfully
fielded all the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Later she said the company is ``sending her a very generous gift
certificate to express our regret for the inconvenience and to
thank her for being such a good sport.'' She declined to disclose
the amount.

   The children's catalog was one of about 50 published this year
by the Freeport, Maine mail-order giant, whose net sales in 1998
amounted to $1.03 billion. Nearly 90 percent of these sales came
from catalog customers, MacKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives declined to say how many catalogs were mailed
out bearing the faulty phone numbers. But they said the company
distributed about 150 million catalogs of all kinds last year.

ABERCROMBIE &AMP; FITCH WILL TRY ITS SEXY ADS ON CABLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the most successful current print campaigns _
notorious among some for its youthful sensuality _ is arriving on
video with a celebration of singlets, sweat and skin.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, the clothing retailer that
aims its apparel at college-age consumers, has been centered on a
quarterly ``magalogue'' or magazine-style catalog featuring
lubricious images of toothsome campus types. Those ads, shot by the
fashion photographer Bruce Weber, have stimulated significant
revenue gains as well as heated debate over whether they show too
much of the comely models and not enough of the A&AMP;F brand of
shirts, shorts and swimwear.
</P>
<P>
   Now the playful sexual attitude that infuses the print campaign
_ popular enough to generate sales of about 220,000 copies of each
quarterly issue of the magalogue _ is coming to life in commercials
that will run on cable television and on monitors in Abercrombie &AMP;
Fitch stores nationwide. The theme of the spots, scheduled to begin
Sept. 4, is college wrestling or, as it is described in so-called
teaser ads appearing in Vanity Fair and Rolling Stone magazines,
``what men do during boys' basketball season.''
</P>
<P>
   Using sex as a weapon in mainstream marketing dates to when
Lillian Nordica, the turn-of-the-century opera singer, posed for
Coca-Cola ads. Still, the Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch campaign, which is
created by Shahid &AMP; Co. in New York in collaboration with Weber, is
notable for its continuous baring of buff bodies _ mostly male _
with a devil-may-care style and tongue-in-cheek tone.
</P>
<P>
   The executives responsible for the print campaign and its leap
into television, where the theme will be ``When you're young,
you're golden,'' take issue with suggestions that the commercials
may be deemed salacious by the growing ranks of critics who
complain that television is increasingly exploiting sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would we worry about that?'' asked Sam Shahid, president
and creative director at Shahid. ``It's not that kind of
commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real wrestling, kids in school,'' he added. ``This is
about brotherhood, training to be part of a team, building
character, helping one another.''
</P>
<P>
   As for complaints that the campaign objectifies young men as
beefcake in the same manner that advertising has long objectified
young women as cheesecake, Mr Shahid said: ``Fine. Let them
complain. The kids love it; it's for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to everyone, it's for everybody,'' Shahid continued.
``They all want to be a part of it. Gays love it; straights love
it; girls love it. Gay friends tell me, `That guy is incredible.'
Girls write, `Where do you meet these guys?' It's in the eye of the
beholder.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrestling theme of the commercials echoes the themes of the
magalogues, which are focused on collegiate matters like a semester
abroad (the subject of the back-to-school issue, now out), spring
break or summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a life-style brand, projecting inside the store and
outside the store the life style of a very specific target
customer, the 18-to-22-year-old American college student,'' said
Michael S. Jeffries, chairman and chief executive at Abercrombie &AMP;
Fitch in Reynoldsburg, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   As for the undressed models, as typified by magalogue pages
showing streakers, ``that's part of college life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun. Every college has a Naked Day,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Though A&AMP;F concentrates on college-age consumers, Jeffries said,
``some of our customers are younger'' because they want to emulate
their older siblings. As a result, a children's division with
stores called Abercrombie is being developed; there are 14 now with
plans to open 20 more in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The magalogues and related catalogs, distributed free to 800,000
to one million customers each quarter, will remain devoted to the
core college-age consumer, he added, because of the nature of their
contents.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers of A&AMP;F are older, Jeffries said, ``because we
live in a society where everyone aspires to be young'' _ and
besides, ``college was a very wonderful time of life for most
people.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 190 Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch stores, with an
additional 30 or so planned to open in the fall. Sales for the
first quarter of fiscal 1999, which ended April 30, totaled $188
million, up 40.3 percent from $134 million in the corresponding
period a year earlier. Second-quarter results are to be reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The planning of the budget for the commercials and the decisions
on which cable networks will run them are not finished, Shahid
said. Print ads to promote the magalogues, which run in Interview
and Out magazines in addition to Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair,
have an estimated annual budget of $2 million; Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch
does not discuss the costs of producing the magalogues and
catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   What's next for the campaign after print and TV? A real
surprise, Shahid hinted: ``Radio will come, too. That would be so
great.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not unlike the riddle asking about the sound of one hand
clapping. What does a college student tugging off his boxers sound
like?

 &HT;    Elvis' hometown spotlights famous son with music, film fest and
more
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUPELO, Miss. _ Before Elvis Presley wore sequined jumpsuits,
gave away Cadillacs and created a Jungle Room in a mansion in
Memphis, he lived in a shotgun shack in this Mississippi town.
</P>
<P>
   But Tupelo, 100 miles southeast of Memphis, tends to be in the
shadow of Graceland and Elvis Presley Enterprises, the family
corporation that zealously guards the rights to the use of the
King's name, likeness and image. His birthplace is a museum, but
the town is otherwise pretty quiet about its claim to fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought the birthplace was all we could do,'' said
Jim High, assistant manager of Tupelo's Main Street Association.
``Graceland guards his image pretty closely.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the town that gave birth to the King will come out
of the shadows and spotlight its legacy with the first-ever Elvis
Presley Festival. Set downtown, the street fair and music fest come
just before ``Death Week,'' when thousands of Elvis fans journey to
Memphis for seven days leading up to the anniversary of his death
on Aug. 16, 1977. High and others are hoping the festival will
entice folks to spend a few days here before heading north to
Graceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``People going to Memphis for Death Week usually come here for a
few hours, but then they get back on the tour buses and leave,''
High said. ``We want them to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival kicks off tonight with a tribute to the jumpsuit
years: Trent Carlini, an Elvis ``stylist'' from Las Vegas, will
perform at the Tupelo Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the music will be true to the spirit of the young
Elvis Presley, who sang gospel and loved the blues. There will be a
gospel singing contest and a performance by a local group called
the Landmarks Gospel Quartet. Acts on outdoor stages include
bluesman Bobbie ``Blue'' Bland and several recording artists who
worked with Elvis at Sun Records in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Besides music, there is a film festival featuring seven of his
33 movies and an exhibit of his movie posters. There's a classic
car show called Cruising With the King, a 5K run called Running
With the King, and a bicycle race, called _ what else? _ Riding
With the King. A Harley-Davidson motorcycle rally begins Saturday
morning at the birthplace. There's even an Elvis ballet performance
planned.
</P>
<P>
   One lucky festival attendee will receive a new Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvis gave away Cadillacs to his friends and it didn't matter
who it was, even if it was a waitress,'' High said.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing missing are the peanut butter and banana
sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   High, who is the festival's activities director, said the idea
for the event came from Linda Butler, Tupelo's new Convention and
Visitors Bureau director.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came last fall and asked us why we didn't promote Elvis
Presley, and we didn't have a very good answer,'' he said. ``She
suggested we go to Memphis and ask permission to have a festival.
We got the permission.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival, sponsored by the Main Street Association and
Downtown Tupelo, is free except for certain events, such as the
Carlini show, the poster exhibit and the movies. Ten percent of the
proceeds goes to a nonprofit foundation owned by Elvis Presley
Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Aron Presley was born on Jan. 8, 1935, in a narrow shotgun
house in East Tupelo. About 100,000 fans visit the home annually.
The only other Elvis ``shrine'' in town is Tupelo Hardware, where
the King of Rock 'n' Roll got his first guitar. A classic Main
Street establishment with high tin ceilings, wood floors and red
wagons on display, the store doesn't bear a sign advertising its
part in history.
</P>
<P>
   The store is owned by the son and grandson of the man who owned
it when Gladys Presley brought her son to buy his 10th birthday
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvis wanted a rifle but his mama wouldn't buy him the rifle,
so she said she'd buy him the guitar,'' said George Booth, who owns
the store with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The guitar cost $8.
</P>
<P>
   Booth sells T-shirts commemorating the sale, but since he can't
legally use the name Elvis Presley, they simply say, ``Where Gladys
bought her son his first guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Booth is excited about the festival, although he wonders how
many people will show up. He stocked up on T-shirts in case there's
extra demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've wanted to promote Elvis but we didn't know
how,'' he said. ``There's so much hype around Graceland, it's hard
to break into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Chadwick, who began an annual Elvis academic conference
some years back, said the birthplace always has been overshadowed
by the big home in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tupelo has been competing with Memphis ever since Elvis became
the celebrity that he is,'' said Chadwick, whose conference, now
more of a small gathering, also begins today. Called ``Elvis
Unplugged,'' it will be in a cafe in Memphis called the Map Room.
This year's theme is Elvis in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to visit President Nixon in 1970, and ever since, his
spirit has been residing in the Oval Office,'' Chadwick said.
``Look at President Clinton: Elvis is alive and well in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick says he believes Mississippi has a history of mixed
feelings about her most famous native son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mississippians feel the stigma of the so-called redneck, and
Elvis represents that, and he reminds them of the whole history of
poor white families in Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Elvis was controversial: He was overtly sexual, and he
sounded black when he sang on the radio, which upset segregated
1950s Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father thought he was terrible,'' High said. ``It was rock
'n' roll, you wiggled your hips. People like my father never
changed how they felt about him, and it was people his age in town
who could have jumped on the legacy and promoted it, but didn't.
They probably just hoped the legacy would die when Elvis died. But
he just keeps getting more famous.

NEGOTIATORS FOR HOUSE, SENATE AGREE ON PLAN FOR ENERGY DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., S.C., Texas) (rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate negotiators reached agreement
Thursday on a significant revamping of the Department of Energy,
establishing a new agency within the department to oversee nuclear
weapons programs in response to accusations of Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said the proposal constrained the
energy secretary's authority. They indicated that Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson would recommend that President Clinton veto the
Pentagon's $289 billion budget bill that contains the provision
unless lawmakers modified this aspect.
</P>
<P>
   Vetoing the military budget bill would be politically risky for
the president, and many senior Republicans in the House and Senate
predicted he would not take that gamble. Lawmakers and
administration officials were scrambling Thursday night to work out
language acceptable to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in marathon sessions all week, lawmakers hammered out
one of the most far-ranging legislative responses to the
allegations that China stole some of the country's most sensitive
nuclear secrets because of lax security at weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement Thursday sets up a new agency with some autonomy
within the Energy Department _ the National Nuclear Security
Administration. It gives the agency's director, an under secretary
of energy, with broad authority over policy, budgeting, security
and counterintelligence for nuclear programs. The director would
report to the secretary of energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation will provide for cleaner lines of authority
and accountability to ensure that our nation's most vital nuclear
secrets are properly managed and secured,'' said Rep. Floyd Spence,
R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, the measure would represent the most dramatic
restructuring of the department since it was formed in 1977.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The changes, House Republicans said, would eliminate tangles in
the lines of authority and replace what Rep. Mac Thornberry of
Texas called ``a dysfunctional bureaucracy'' with a military-style
chain of command from the secretary through the new agency's
director to the field directors of weapons laboratories like Los
Alamos and Sandia.
</P>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee, a former scientist at Los Alamos, has been
questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the
possible theft of nuclear secrets by China. Lee has denied that he
divulged atomic secrets to China or ``any unauthorized person.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Senate overwhelmingly approved the Energy
Department reorganization as part of a bill authorizing the
government's intelligence programs. The bill won bipartisan support
only after Democrats won concessions that they said strengthened
the secretary's authority over the new agency.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans criticized their Senate colleagues for giving
in to Democratic demands, and took a much harder line during a
House-Senate conference reconciling differences between competing
versions of the military budget bill. Much of department's budget
is included in the Pentagon bill because of the nuclear weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's accord, which still requires formal approval by both
the House and Senate after the summer recess, dealt a setback to
the administration and to Richardson initially resisted the idea of
a semiautonomous nuclear stewardship agency before he grudgingly
accepted the plan in order to avert alternatives he considered even
worse, like splitting the agency from his department altogether.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For his part, Richardson has tried to blunt the growing calls to
revamp his department by reorganizing and centralizing its
far-flung security functions. Richardson appointed a retired
four-star Air Force general to be the department's first security
czar.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the secretary ordered a one-day hiatus at many of the
department's research and military-related operations for training
in counterespionage and security.
</P>
<P>
   But in a stinging report in June, a presidential review panel
said the administration's efforts to tighten security at the labs
were hamstrung by bureaucratic arrogance and foot-dragging.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, by the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board, which studies sensitive intelligence and national security
matters, concluded that the department was a ``dysfunctional
bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel, headed by a former Republican senator, Warren Rudman
of New Hampshire, recommended either a semiautonomous agency like
the one approved Thursday or an independent agency like the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to oversee nuclear
programs.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to blunt accusations of partisanship, House and
Senate Republicans have said they were modeling their proposal
after the presidential advisory board's recommendations.

ALLMANS, NEVILLES HAVE ENDURED AND THRIVED DESPITE TRAGEDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERTA PENN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Musical families have been around at least as far back as the
Bachs. But few in American pop culture have thrived through hard
times and shifting tastes like the Allman Brothers Band and the
Neville Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   These two Southern-bred clans headline shows at Seattle's
waterfront this weekend, and the sold-out sign on both concerts
attests to their staying power. Their music may be as old-fashioned
as family values, but no one wants to give them up.
</P>
<P>
   The Allman Brothers Band began its ascent to the pinnacle of
Southern-fried blues rock with its self-titled album in 1969.
Taking their name from guitarist Duane and organ-player and singer
Gregg Allman, the group grew from an experience that the two
brothers had in Nashville when they were teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother dropped me and my brother off at one of those rhythm
and blues revues,'' Gregg Allman recalled in a phone interview.
``It was Jackie Wilson, Otis Redding, Patti LaBelle and the Blue
Belles. And B.B. King, who had a guy with a big red pompadour
sitting behind the first Hammond organ I ever saw. Man, me and my
brother looked at each other and said, `We gotta get into some of
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   With drummers Butch Trucks and Jaimoe, bassist Berry Oakley and
guitarist Dickey Betts, the two brothers stretched the blues out
with extended guitar solos while the two drummers revved up the
rhythm. But tragedy struck just as the Allmans were about to break
into the big time. On Oct. 29, 1971, Duane Allman was killed in a
motorcycle accident, and just a little over a year later Oakley met
the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   The four original Allmans took the tragedy and turned it into
gold by continuing to tour and record, drawing other musicians into
the group. Though no one has ever added quite the charismatic
presence of Duane Allman, the band has remained together off and on
over the years. And now with the addition of guitarist Derek Trucks
(the drummer's nephew), Gregg Allman believes the group has been
re-energized for this summer's 30th anniversary tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek just wails, and that brings on a great amount of
spontaneity,'' Allman said. ``Though we are not all brothers, we
consider ourselves a family band, and like families we have our ups
and downs, but we are a collective decision-making organization and
we sit down and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Art, Charles, Aaron and Cyril Neville didn't begin making
music together until 1976, when they came together to record the
landmark Mardi Gras Indian album ``The Wild Tchoupitoulas,'' their
individual history reaches back to the '50s and '60s when
keyboardist and singer Art and vocalist Aaron were part of New
Orleans' vital R&AMP;B scene, and saxophonist Charles was playing jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But once they began blending the rich Caribbean, blues and R&AMP;B
roots of the Crescent City, the Nevilles created a sound like none
other, funky yet ethereal. And though the Nevilles have yet to
reach the top of the pop charts as a family band, they have a
following wherever they go.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started out with the Neville Brothers we were
just doing it because we wanted to,'' Aaron Neville said before a
recent concert at the Myrtle Beach House of Blues. ``Now it is the
way we make our living.''
</P>
<P>
   The family band's latest CD, ``Valance Street,'' reaches back to
the brothers' childhood experiences in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valance Street means a coming together of family because that
is where we grew up,'' Neville said. ``And if it wasn't family we'd
go our own ways, but we have a bond and we're always gonna do stuff
together.''
</P>
<P>
   That bond can be best felt in the live shows of both the Allman
Brothers Band and the Neville Brothers. When these groups perform
there is an intensity stronger than sibling rivalry, a primal kind
of communication and a commitment that far surpasses the fickleness
of the pop music world. Like family they are anchors, holding true
to their musical beliefs and taking in fans even if they have no
place else to go.

<TEXT>
<P>
   EATONTOWN, N.J. _ By the door to his disheveled office in a
thoroughly standard office park, Satish Sharma has posted a form
letter he received a few months ago from the Katharine Gibbs
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Year 2000, what will you be doing?'' the letter reads.
``What kind of job will you be working in?''
</P>
<P>
   Among a list of occupations for which the school offers
training, Sharma has wryly highlighted a few: ``Executive
assisting,'' ``Legal executive assisting,'' ``Computer technical
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Since founding Tachion Networks in 1996, Sharma, now 42, has
performed all those jobs _ and more. He has even served as cook.
For two years before moving into the office here in central New
Jersey, Sharma made Indian food at lunch and dinner most days for
the dozen people toiling in the basement of his home in Asbury
Park.
</P>
<P>
   If Tachion was yet another hardscrabble Internet start-up, there
would be nothing unusual about any of this. But instead of
marketing plans and ``dot-com'' addresses, Tachion deals in circuit
boards and industrial-grade systems. Instead of MBAs and
20-something code jockeys, Tachion is stocked with middle-aged
engineers _ some immigrants from abroad, some self-imposed exiles
from Lucent Technologies' Bell Laboratories unit, some both.
</P>
<P>
   They think they have come up with something at least as flashy
as the latest e-commerce site. Later this month, Tachion intends to
announce that it has developed what it calls a ``collapsed central
office,'' an integrated communications system that can allow
carriers to switch and transport both phone calls and different
data formats in a fraction of the space required for traditional
communications gear.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast Corp., the cable television giant, and MCI Worldcom, the
long-distance carrier, have agreed to try the new system.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred on by lush capital markets and the voracious global
appetite for advanced data services, quite a few new companies like
Tachion are vying to supply the new technologies underlying the
blending of computers and telecommunications, even as they try to
avoid being crushed by titans like Lucent and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   But the emergence of Tachion, with its core of ex-Bell Labs
engineers, may underline the beginning of a new trend. While many
Web companies have drawn talent from established enterprises in
computing and finance, the communications behemoths traditionally
have lost little of their intellectual capital to start-ups. There
are a few exceptions _ Newbridge Networks of Canada was founded by
former Nortel Networks executives _ but in general the established
giants of the communications equipment industry have not pollinated
many new players.
</P>
<P>
   That absence has been particularly striking in New Jersey.
Including Bell Labs, AT&AMP;T Corp. and Science Applications
International Corp.'s Telcordia unit (formerly Bellcore, the
research unit for the Baby Bell local phone companies), many
thousands of communications engineers are at work in New Jersey.
But New Jersey has hardly become a hotbed of technology
giant-killers along the lines of Silicon Valley and Route 128 near
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, perhaps, that New Jersey may not have fostered as
many spinoffs is that AT&AMP;T, for all its struggles, managed to avoid
the mass layoffs and bankruptcies that hit minicomputer leaders in
the Boston area like Data General, Digital Equipment and Prime
Computer in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey hasn't gone through the forest fire we had here in
Massachusetts,'' said Daniel Smith, chief executive of Sycamore
Networks Inc., an optical networking company in Chelmsford, Mass.
``The forest was burnt, but then a lot of green shoots started
coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is now home to at least a dozen highly regarded
communications equipment start-ups. ``New Jersey doesn't have that
yet,'' Smith said. ``It's dominated by large companies, and the
people there haven't seen how to do it, how to start a company in
this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   That situation may change in a hurry if Tachion, with its base
in Monmouth County, and the handful of other recent New Jersey
communications upstarts succeed, and if the Tachion team eventually
reaps millions from a public stock offering. Those thousands of
engineers still inside the mothership may start getting ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent in this county alone has 20,000 engineers,'' Sharma
said in an interview, with perhaps a touch of hyperbole. ``Lucent
has very bright people, but it has been mismanaged, mismanaged
extensively, and the people don't think they can leave to start
their own company.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors who have doubled, tripled or quadrupled their money by
investing in Lucent since that company was spun off from AT&AMP;T in
late 1996 would probably disagree with Sharma's assessment of
Lucent management. But given Sharma's particular experience, his
frustration is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma still remembers the employee number he received when he
joined Bell Labs in 1985: 116825. He emigrated from India in 1981,
and after stints designing blood analysis equipment for a small
company in Westchester County, N.Y., and postal scales for Pitney
Bowes in Connecticut, he joined Bell Labs to help design medical
imaging systems. By the early 1990s he was helping develop software
for microchips to be used for a new communications protocol called
asynchronous transfer mode, or ATM.
</P>
<P>
   Though Internet protocol, or IP, has become a buzzword known
even to casual technophiles, ATM is forming the core of most new
networks being built by giant communications carriers like AT&AMP;T and
Sprint Corp. Like IP, ATM splits communications into small pieces.
But unlike IP, which creates data packets of varying length, ATM
generally creates data cells of uniform size. That uniformity,
coupled with ATM's ability to create ``virtual circuits'' that can
enhance reliability, can be a powerful advantage because it allows
ATM to carry voice, video and data traffic together without
sacrificing much efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Together with AT&AMP;T's (later Lucent's) microelectronics unit,
Bell Labs created perhaps the leading ATM chipset, the Atlanta.
This chipset was so good, in fact, that it was used by the upstart
Ascend Communications Inc. to turn itself into a world leader in
the ATM industry.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent did a great job of developing the core technology in the
chips, but it did an awful job of moving it from the laboratory to
the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being good at making the chips doesn't make you good at
the system piece,'' said Daniel Stanzione, president of Bell Labs
and executive vice president of Lucent. ``What was then part of
AT&AMP;T focused on the wrong segment of the market, the very high end,
instead of the Internet and companies that were looking to support
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Lucent agreed to acquire Ascend for $20
billion. But, frustrated by Lucent's troubles in spinning ATM
technology into ATM products, Sharma had already left, departing
shortly after Lucent's split from AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said there is a great opportunity to build a product to
address the convergence of data and voice and Lucent is not the
place to do it,'' Sharma said. ``So I decided to do it in the
basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Isolated from Silicon Valley's venture capital community, Sharma
put almost all of his savings, $250,000, into his new endeavor. At
first, it did not seem an auspicious decision. About a week after
Sharma quit his job, his father was hospitalized with brain trauma.
He died a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first few months I spent the days in the basement and
the nights at the hospital,'' Sharma said.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not alone in the basement for long. Soon after
starting Tachion, he was joined by Sunil Malhotra, a Bell Labs
colleague and former Bellcore engineer, who is now vice president
for software engineering at Tachion. A few months later, John
Kolchmeyer, another Bell Labs engineer, joined the company. And by
the spring of 1997 about a half-dozen people were working in
Sharma's basement.
</P>
<P>
   By last summer, however, Sharma was borrowing cash to keep
Tachion afloat. Driving home from an unsuccessful meeting with a
potential investor in New York, he thought he might have to fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very difficult,'' Sharma said recently about
starting his company in New Jersey. All of the venture capitalists
are in California, he said, ``and they have too much money and not
enough time, and if they can fund three companies locally they
don't want to spend all this time out of the office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of VCs told me, `Move to California and we'll fund you
tomorrow,''' Sharma said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanzione, the Bell Labs president, says that experience is
common. ``In California, not only the corporate cultures and the
regional cultures are different, but also the infrastructure was
really in place for start-ups,'' he said. ``You can rent a PR
person for two days. You can get a patent attorney for a day. And
of course you're close to a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharma found salvation right after his failed meeting when he
received a phone call from an ``angel investor,'' Raj Singh,
chairman of Stratumone Communications Inc., a networking company in
Santa Clara, Calif. By the end of the day, Singh had agreed to wire
Sharma $100,000. Singh, whose company has since agreed to be
acquired by Cisco, soon persuaded Raj Parekh, a former vice
president at Sun Microsystems Inc., to contribute another $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged, perhaps, by the angels, venture capitalists
eventually came through. In exchange for roughly 50 percent of the
company, Tachion has received about $8 million from Walden
International Investment Group and Morgenthaler Ventures. Perhaps
as important, Tachion got an experienced executive, Jeff Matros,
45, to run the company.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Walden last summer, Matros was vice president for
marketing and business development for the data communications
group of Siemens AG, the German conglomerate. Matros helped Sharma
search for a chief executive for a few months before he was asked
to take the job himself. As the company prepares to introduce its
product, he is raising an additional $30 million. (Sharma is now
senior vice president for engineering.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any new investors will want to see results from
Tachion's trials with MCI Worldcom and Comcast. But the real target
market for Tachion's product is new local communications carriers
that do not have the money or space for truckloads of equipment
from traditional providers.
</P>
<P>
   Tachion says its product is particularly appealing because it
provides a combination of software and hardware design that allows
it to handle multiple communications systems within one
modest-sized chassis. Among other companies trying to develop
similar systems are Taqua Systems in Centerville, Mass.; Transmedia
Communications, which recently agreed to be acquired by Cisco, and
Castle Networks, which has agreed to be acquired by Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   In building products that can do so much, companies like Tachion
have to remain focused on making their products reliable and able
to connect seamlessly to older systems.
</P>
<P>
   John Sidgmore, vice chairman of MCI Worldcom, refused to comment
on Tachion. Speaking generally, he said: ``This isn't as true
today, but people were always worried about having the fastest
hardware, and in the end of the day the hardware isn't as important
as the software. We don't want to manage a bunch of little science
projects that are the fastest.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential pitfall is that technology companies sometimes
begin to suffer what some military strategists call mission creep,
with new features being added to a product helter-skelter.
</P>
<P>
   Tachion's executives say, however, that they have remained
focused by using only proven components in their system. ``The
world is our competition,'' Sharma said. ``We have to win.''

DEMOCRATIC DEMAGOGUERY POISONS THE TAX CUT DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing; moved July 29)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have gotten so used to the bitter rhetoric of the enemies of
tax relief _ liberals and Democrats, mostly, plus much of the
national media _ that we no longer notice how it poisons the
national discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that could explain this love of tax cuts is a
lowered IQ.'' Thus Margaret Carlson of Time magazine, venting on a
television program last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cutters are ``mostly Republican ideologues like Bill Archer
and Dick Armey, whose primary interest is in giving tax breaks to
affluent Americans.'' Thus leftist economist Barry Bluestone in the
current issue of The New Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have created the illusion of paying back their
wealthy supporters and corporate special interests in a bill that
will never become law.'' Thus US Representative Pete Stark in the
House debate last week.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over we hear them _ the insults, the slanders, the
appeals to resentment and envy. It is ugly stuff, political sewer
talk, and we've been listening to it for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be damned if I am going to let a bunch of supply-side
extremists destroy our middle class to pay for tax cuts for the
wealthy,'' declared Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader,
in 1996. That was about the time Ted Kennedy was barking, ``Keep
your tax-cutting, greedy hands off our Medicare'' and Nina
Totenberg was telling TV viewers that ``there is another word for
the way they are behaving. They are behaving like whores.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to imagine tax-cut advocates talking this way.
``The only thing that can explain their aversion to tax relief is
mental retardation.'' ``Democrats want taxes to stay high so they
can keep giving money to inner-city welfare leeches.'' Republicans
would be savaged, and deservedly, if they said anything so foul.
Yet the demagoguery of the liberals goes unrebuked.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for tax relief is simple: Taxes should be cut
because taxes are too high. Only once before has the federal
government confiscated so great a proportion of the nation's
economic output. That was in 1944-45, when the United States was
fighting a two-front world war. Today we are not at war. Nor are we
in a recession, or struggling with some natural catastrophe, or
burdened with high unemployment. Yet Washington takes nearly 21
cents of every dollar of new wealth Americans create. When state
and local taxes are added in, the typical family spends close to 40
percent of its income on taxes. That is more than it spends on
food, clothing, shelter, and transportation _ combined.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, what a ``typical'' family spends in taxes can be a
misleading statistic. The overwhelming share of income taxes
collected in this country comes from the well-to-do. The top
federal tax bracket is 39.6 percent, more than 2 1/2 times the rate
for lower-income taxpayers. Millions of working Americans near the
bottom of the income ladder pay no income tax at all thanks to the
earned-income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom 60 percent of all taxpayers account for just 6
percent of the income taxes collected. By contrast, the top 8
percent of all taxpayers _ anyone earning more than $100,000 _ pay
62 percent of the total. This is known as soaking the rich. And it
explains why any honest tax cut is going to return more dollars to
the well-off than to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ran for office promising a ``middle-class tax
cut.'' Like so much of what he says, that promise was a lie. What
he (and congressional Democrats) delivered in 1993 was not a tax
cut but a punitive tax increase _ necessitated, he said, by the
federal budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Now that deficit is gone and the federal government is awash in
surplus cash. No longer is there an excuse for taxes to be jacked
up so high. It has been 18 years since Congress last enacted
serious tax relief. What possible objection can there be to doing
so now?
</P>
<P>
   Well, says Clinton, a tax cut like the one the Republicans
propose _ a little under $800 billion, phased in over 10 years _
``would require dramatic cuts in vital areas, such as education,
the environment, biomedical research, defense, and crime
fighting.'' But this, too, is a lie. The GOP tax cuts would have no
effect on spending; their impact would simply be to reduce the $1
trillion surplus in income tax revenues that Washington now
anticipates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, in the House of Representatives, they passed an
irresponsible tax bill that would spend our surplus,'' Clinton said
on Tuesday. Hear that? ``(itals)Our(unitals) surplus.'' That is how
the liberal mind works: The money belongs to the government, even
if the government doesn't need it.
</P>
<P>
   And the government (itals)doesn't(unitals) need it, as Clinton
himself admitted on one of the rare occasions when he actually told
the truth. Speaking of the 1993 tax hike, he told a Houston
audience in 1995: ``You think I raised your taxes too much. Well,
it might surprise you to know I think I raised them too much,
too.'' (A few days later Clinton retracted his statement; his
unaccustomed lapse into the truth was caused, he said, by ignoring
his mother's advice to ``never give a talk after 7 o'clock at
night.'')
</P>
<P>
   The tax debate boils down to a straightforward question: Should
you be allowed to keep a little more of your own income?
Republicans vote yes; they trust you to spend the extra dollars
sensibly. Democrats, with some honorable exceptions, vote no; they
think you are too stupid to be trusted. But the Democrats can't say
what they really think. So they resort to insults instead.

CELTICS SIGN CALBERT CHEANEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Ind.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- There are a few things that make Calbert Cheaney an
unusual NBA player. He used to sing in a choir. He was a track star
at his Indiana high school. He once donated money to an Evansville
church so it could build a new gymnasium, except he didn't want
anyone to know how much he contributed. And then there was what he
did Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaney signed a three-year contract with the Celtics, his
first-year salary being what the NBA calls its middle-class ($2
million) exception. What's so unusual about that? Well, Cheaney
took less money when he easily could have had more.
</P>
<P>
   Six other teams were interested in signing the 6-foot-7-inch
guard/forward. The Miami Heat were prepared to offer him much more
cash in a sign-and-trade agreement with his former team, the
Washington Wizards. Cheaney rejected the trade because, he said,
``It was just a gut instinct I had.'' The 28-year-old Cheaney
became one of the rare players to tell Pat Riley, ``You're a great
coach and I appreciate your interest, but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, a notorious Celtic-hater, will now have to see Cheaney
playing against him rather than for him. The only question is if
Cheaney will be the replacement for the departed Ron Mercer at
shooting guard. If not, the team now has the option of playing
Cheaney at small forward, where he played last season, and staying
with Paul Pierce at shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pitino, that's part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several players who can play two positions,'' he said
before the team announced the signing of Cheaney. ``Danny Fortson
can play power forward and center; Antoine (Walker) can play two
positions. So can Tony Battie and Paul (Pierce).''
</P>
<P>
   Now they have Cheaney, who went into last season as a career
13-point scorer (including 47 percent from the field). He had the
worst season of his career last season for the Wizards, averaging
only 7.7 points and coming off the bench. When the Wizards drafted
University of Connecticut swingman Richard Hamilton in June,
Cheaney began to believe that he needed to leave Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a time for a change,'' he said. ``The six years were
nice in Washington, but it was time to move on. It was time for a
fresh start.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheaney never complained about coming off the bench last season,
but one of the obvious things that attracted him to the Celtics was
the team's absence of an experienced shooting guard. Pitino said he
thought the signing of Cheaney would ``rejuvenate'' the player's
career.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last season, Pitino said he wanted the Celtics to
get a veteran in the 25- to 28-year-old range as well as a solid
defender and scorer. He has all of those traits in Cheaney, who is
a good shooter and athletic defender. At Harrison High in
Evansville _ where he was a teammate of Walter McCarty's _ Cheaney
ran the 110- and 300-meter hurdles. The Wizards took him with the
sixth pick in the 1993 draft and immediately put him at shooting
guard, even though forward was his college position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a multidimensional talent who can score from the
perimeter or low post,'' Pitino said. ``He's an outstanding
defender and throw all that into the equation with the fact he is
an outstanding young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said he has been a fan of Cheaney's since the early
1990s, when the swingman played for Indiana University. In '93,
Cheaney earned the Wooden and Naismith Awards, which recognize the
top college player in the country.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: Cheaney won't have to worry about being the
new teammate who stands out. There are lots of new men in green.
With Cheaney's signing, the team now has 15 players under contract
and only room for 12 on the roster. And the Celtics still are not
done dealing. It was pointed out to Pitino that a starting
frontcourt of Walker, Fortson, and Potapenko would seem to be
slower than he would like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who says that's going to be our starting frontcourt?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino and general manager Chris Wallace prefer to emphasize
their depth rather than their starters. In the past week, they have
added Cheaney, Fortson, Eric Williams, Adrian Griffin, Wayne
Turner, and Eric Washington. They are also excited about the summer
play of Battie and McCarty. The team's problem is not having enough
basketballs; the true dilemma is where do they get enough uniforms?
</P>
<P>
   There still is a chance that Walker could be moved, although
Pitino was not pleased Thursday when he learned that the Pacers
went public with their private trade talks with the Celtics. ``They
won't be getting a call from us anymore,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   But the team will continue making phone calls, looking to deal
and add players. The Celtics have tried to trade Dana Barros since
Pitino arrived in 1997. Greg Minor's injury may not allow him to
play. And Pervis Ellison still is recovering from an ankle injury.
It is unlikely, but if the Celtics were to move all those players
and Walker, there would be no members remaining from Pitino's
Opening Night Celtics of '97.

STEPHENSON SEEKS CLOSURE TO A SUCCESSFUL CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUTTON, Mass. _ A throng of golfers crowded the Pleasant Valley
practice range at mid-day, whacking balls under the hot sun. As
time wore on, the group began to dissipate, until one swung alone,
giving the impression she had no plans to leave anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Stephenson is on a chase. She is trying to track down a
sense of closure.
</P>
<P>
   Hers has been a most-successful golf career, one that has placed
her among the most popular athletes in any professional sport, one
that has been highlighted with triumphs over setbacks and
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Stephenson won a tournament was in 1987. She is
competing in this week's areaWEB.com Challenge with the same
purpose she has had at every tourney she has entered since: to win
one more title. Only then would she be able to walk away from the
pro circuit with what she believes is the perfect epilogue to a
storybook career.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's first round, the 48-year-old Australian fired a
4-under-par 68 to place her among the leaders. Then it was off to
practice area, where she is usually among the last to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work so hard because I want that one win. I am probably more
hungry for a win than anyone out there,'' said Stephenson, who
bogeyed the third hole then came back to eagle the fourth and
birdie the fifth. She missed an 8-foot eagle putt on 11 (birdie)
and birdied 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (eagle) just turned around my round,'' Stephenson said.
``I started playing like I normally do. I played well from there in
and on the back nine; I was really steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a little frustrating,'' said Stephenson about the
season. ``I feel like I haven't scored as well as I've played. So
today was kind of nice to get off to a bad start and then bring it
back. I feel like I'm so close (to winning a tournament). That's
why I came.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson began her pro career in 1974 and won three majors in
the 1980s _ the LPGA Championship (1982), the du Maurier Classic
(formerly the Peter Jackson Classic) in 1981, and the US Women's
Open (1983). She became one of the most popular players in golf,
becoming the first woman pro to design golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   Then her career was hit with setbacks. In 1990, she was mugged
while attending a Phoenix Suns basketball game in Miami. The mugger
broke her ring finger in two places. She came back to play in 13
tournaments afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1987 season was hampered by a car accident early in the
year, but she came back to win three times that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone keeps saying, `I can't believe you haven't written a
book yet all the things that have happened,' things I have done,''
said Stephenson, who produced an exercise video for people with
arthritis which sold 100,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been times when I say, `This year, I'll get the Ben
Hogan award because I've fought back from injuries,' and I don't
get it. So I say, `OK, when I win a tournament.' For one thing, it
will mean so much to me personally. It would mean more to me than
anything I've ever won _ even the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because, I mean, I've had horrible injuries, and I keep coming
back. I think that would make it all worth while. I've worked
really hard because I really want that one win. That would be
closure, in all aspects in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she would give up golf after winning a tournament,
Stephenson said, ``I'd give up full time, yeah. Because I've put a
lot of work into this. I don't do a lot of much else. I've just
worked so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson said she is merely hoping to remain healthy in the
meantime because ``I can't come back from any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest Stephenson has come this year to winning was fourth
place at the Hawaiian Ladies Open in February and a tie for sixth
at the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to ruin my whole life or career if I don't''
gain the victory, said Stephenson. ``I can't do that, because that
would put too much pressure on me. But people who know me know how
much it will mean to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite having not won a tournament in 12 years, Stephenson is
still among the most popular names in women's golf and still
receives fan mail.
</P>
<P>
   Although she said she enjoys the notoriety, she said other young
players, particularly last week's du Maurier Classic winner Karrie
Webb, should now be household names similar to women's players in
other sports. She said more must be done to market such players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustrating part to me is that there are so many neat
personalities out here and young girls who are incredibly
talented,'' said Stephenson.

BAENA DISAPPOINTS IN FIRST ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUTTON, Mass. _ Even in leaving college early, Marisa Baena said
she was late. ``My father wanted me to turn pro after my first year
(at the University of Arizona). But I told him I wasn't ready.''
</P>
<P>
   So last summer, when she opted to turn pro and skip her senior
year, all Baena was doing was sticking to the plan _ albeit two
years behind schedule. The young lady from Pereira, Columbia, has
been groomed for a professional golf career since . . . well, since
as far back as she can remember.
</P>
<P>
   The plan called for a move to the United States to complete high
school. Check.
</P>
<P>
   The plan called for her to improve her English. Check.
</P>
<P>
   The plan called for a brilliant amateur career. US Women's
Amateur finalist, NCAA champion, first-team All-America. Triple
check.
</P>
<P>
   The plan called for a smooth transition into the pro game. Call
it a work in progress, though Baena is a bit harder on herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell the truth, I'm disappointed,'' said Baena, just two
months removed from her 22d birthday. ``It's been a little bit
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   It was tough again Thursday in the first round of the
areaWEB.com Challenge at Pleasant Valley CC. Though her impressive
talents shined through for most of the morning, Baena turned what
should have been a decent round into something disappointing,
making double bogeys at the par-3 seventh and par-4 17th. A 70 or
71 was, instead, a 3-over 75, and she is in danger of missing the
cut for the seventh time in nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   Baena concedes the learning experience has been tougher than she
figured, but just as the Friday departures have piled up, the
confidence has not left her. Though she has cashed two checks for a
grand total of $10,967, Baena is not yet making reservations for
Qualifying School this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hitting it pretty good. There are five or six tournaments
left and I feel I have it in my bag,'' she said with just a hint of
cockiness that great golfers must have.
</P>
<P>
   The man carrying the bag thinks so, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has great talent,'' said Ralph DelVecchio, who usually
caddies for Stefania Croce. But she is in Europe preparing for the
Women's British Open, so DelVecchio and Baena have teamed up, just
as they did at the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   That was a successful effort, one of the two cuts Baena has
made, but DelVecchio thinks there are plenty more in the young
woman's future. Just as soon as she believes in herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Toldeo, we were in the next-to-last group and she was
hitting balls on the range with Karrie Webb, Meg Mallon, Kelly
Robbins, Dottie Pepper. She said, `I'm scared. I'm going to throw
up.' It's a growing experience,'' said DelVecchio.
</P>
<P>
   Baena didn't throw up that day, but she did blow up, shooting 75
and fading from one shot off the lead to a tie for 21st. ``I keep
telling her she's a good putter,'' DelVecchio said, ``but she
doesn't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   At just a shade over 5 feet tall, Baena would not appear to be
capable of hitting it long enough to play at this level. But
indeed, length is no problem. Constantly she was 20-30 yards ahead
of Laurie Rinker-Graham and Donna Wilkins, ``about 250 yards
consistently,'' said DelVecchio.
</P>
<P>
   What is a problem, said Baena, are the bad holes. Like the
395-yard 17th where her 5-iron approach started right, just as she
likes. It was beginning to draw when it hit a tree and splashed
into the water that guards the green.
</P>
<P>
   Making the turn to the front, Baena birdied the par-5 fourth to
get back to just 1-over. At the 134-yard seventh, ``I thought I hit
a good shot, but I guess not,'' said Baena of the shot that went
splash.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed, yes. But certainly not discouraged. She bombed
drives on her final two holes, the eighth and ninth, and had great
birdie chances at each. The first rolled over the right edge; the
next one stopped a roll short.
</P>
<P>
   Each time she hung her head, but each time she picked it up and
flashed a smile, trying to rationalize the pain that is golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much luck is involved. I got a lot of breaks as an amateur,
but not as a pro. What can I tell you. I'm trying, I'm really
trying.''

BUSH DENIES INVOLVEMENT IN FIRING OF FUNERAL COMMISSION DIRECTOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday formally denied
involvement in the February firing of the highest-ranking regulator
of the Texas funeral industry.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general filed a motion to nullify a subpoena
seeking to force Bush to testify in the whistle-blower lawsuit
filed by the ousted director of the Texas Funeral Service
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   An Aug. 30 hearing in a Travis County district court has been
set to sort out the complex allegations. Former commission director
Eliza May claims she was wrongly fired _ with Bush's blessing _
after she aggressively pursued allegations against Houston-based
Service Corp. International, the world's largest provider of
funeral services.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, SCI officials and Bush, who is not a defendant,
contend she was not targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never asked anyone to take a role or to become involved
in any way in this investigation, or any dispute arising from it,
or given direction to anyone who might be involved in the SCI
investigation or dispute,'' said Bush's affidavit signed July 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no personal knowledge of relevant facts of the
investigation, nor do I have any personal knowledge of relevant
facts concerning any dispute arising from this investigation,'' the
presidential candidate said.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, Bush was subpoenaed by May to give an oral deposition
Aug. 26. But in his motion filed Thursday by Attorney General John
Cornyn, the deposition was described as unnecessary, onerous and
``sought purely for purposes of harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said that May ``cannot show that the governor has unique
or superior knowledge which cannot be obtained through less
intrusive means. In fact, the only evidence before this court
clearly demonstrates that there was no personal involvement in this
matter on the part of Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn asked the court for a protective order to require a
judge's approval before any more subpoenas are delivered to Bush.
Cornyn said Bush and his staff ``have already responded to
approximately 250 document requests in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush and his top aides were handed another subpoena
commanding them to produce several records related to May's ouster.
The lengthy subpoena seeks 61 types of documents in an effort to
tie Bush to the dismissal of May to appease political supporters
who worked for SCI.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the governor avoids direct questioning, his top aides
could still be required to submit to questioning and may have to
produce notes, letters, reports, memos and e-mail mentioning May's
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   In her lawsuit against the state and SCI, filed under the Texas
Whistle Blowers Act, May alleged that Bush and his staff pressured
the commission to fire her because of her scrutiny of two Dallas
area funeral homes affiliated with SCI. May claimed workers at the
two homes were embalming bodies without having proper licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorneys are seeking access to any schedules and written
communications generated by meetings among Bush staff, SCI
officials, SCI lobbyists and Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston, who
interceded in the regulatory dispute. May's attorney, Charles
Herring Jr., asked that the records be produced Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier subpoena to Bush and his staff demanded phone records
that could relate to SCI discussions. Herring also requested
campaign finance records that would show how much money Bush
received from a long list of SCI executives and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush received $35,000 in 1996-97 from SCI chairman Robert
Waltrip, and several other executives donated $1,000 or less to
Bush in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   SCI's initial legal response said it did not precipitate May's
firing. The company attributed her dismissal, in part, to a ``loss
of trust and confidence in her ability to lead the commission'' and
cited documents indicating May had planned to leave her post
voluntarily anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It also said she was being criticized for failing to collect
fees, not adequately supervising staff and contributing to ``a
constant exodus of employees,'' according to court filings.
</P>
<P>
   Further, SCI's response to May's suit said that she
``spearheaded an ill-advised, unfounded prosecution of SCI. Her
tactics included the issuance of overbroad subpoenas of dubious
legality; an oppressive and intimidating unannounced raid of SCI's
facilities on Good Friday; and other abusive tactics never before
seen at the Texas Funeral Service Commission.''
</P>
<P>
   May contends in her lawsuit that she was fired after she
``repeatedly reported violations of the law involving the
commission, commissioners, SCI ... Waltrip and SCI affiliates and
involving Gov. George W. Bush and his staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Hired Aug. 1, 1996 and fired Feb. 8, 1999, May claimed she began
fearing for her life in April 1998 when an SCI-affiliated funeral
home worker, who was being investigated for embalming without a
license, made a telephone threat to ``kill all of you'' at the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, SCI chairman Waltrip complained to May and
Bush chief of staff Joe Allbaugh about the tenor of the Dallas area
investigations. Those contacts coincided with Whitmire's efforts to
resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In late summer 1998, the saga took a mysterious turn. That's
when May claims she was told by friends that SCI was using a
private investigator ``to dig up dirt'' on her. That's also when an
unidentified man tried to gain unauthorized entry to the commission
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 3, 1998, the commission issued its findings regarding
the SCI facilities in question, one in Dallas and one in Hurst. It
assessed a $450,000 fine against SCI _ a penalty that SCI is still
seeking to challenge in an administrative hearing. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But that dispute is on hold. On Sept. 1, the commission _
harshly criticized by legislators during their session last spring
_ will be reconstituted from a funeral industry-dominated
nine-member board to a six-member panel dominated by non-industry
citizens.

FCC EASES LIMITS ON TV STATION OWNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission voted Thursday to relax
rules that have limited television station ownership for most of
the century, allowing for the first time a single company or
network to own two separate stations in the nation's largest
cities.
</P>
<P>
   One immediate result of the decision may be a rush by big
television companies like the broadcast networks to sweep up any
available television stations in cities where they already own a
station. As put in one memo to the top corporate officers at one of
the four big broadcast networks, ``The race is on.''
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William Kennard, who said the commission was acting
to update regulations that were largely put into place in the 1930s
and 1940s, called the changes ``common-sense rules that recognize
the dramatic changes that the media marketplace has undergone''
over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The new FCC standards will allow dual ownership in cities where
there are a sufficient number of ``media voices,'' which include
all radio and TV stations, large daily newspapers and cable
systems. Specifically, a city must have at least eight
independently owned television stations for one company to own two.
</P>
<P>
   All of the country's top 50 cities have that many, but many have
only eight, which may mean ``an intense game of musical chairs,''
as one senior network executive put it. ``The voice test means you
know you may have to get in fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a land rush to some degree,'' the executive
added.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision will not result in a wholesale changeover in
the control of stations, which had been feared by some station
owners six months ago, many industry executives said that the
opportunity for owning two stations in a single market was likely
to spur a surge in station sales in the coming months. Companies
like Fox and CBS were predicted to be especially aggressive is
seeking to add second stations in cities where they already own a
broadcast outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Reif-Cohen, a media analyst for Merrill Lynch, said dual
ownership in a single market would appeal to networks because of
the opportunities for cross promotion, for finding secondary uses
for programming a network already owns and for savings on staff and
program costs.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said the FCC enacted the changes because television
station ownership had become a morass of confusing waivers from
regulations, with numerous stations being run by companies under
local marketing agreements, a ``kind of artifice'' designed to
circumvent existing limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bringing some certainty and coherence to a situation
plagued by confusion and rule by waiver,'' Kennard said in a
telephone interview. ``The marketplace was crying out for
coherence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The FCC voted 4-1 for the new system, which institutes a series
of new rules that spell out more clearly what will constitute
ownership of a station, how many stations a single company can own
and under which circumstances it can own multiple stations in a
single market.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also affected radio station ownership, limiting one
company to six stations in a city with at least 20 total stations
(seven if the company does not opt to own two television stations.)
The ruling did not affect cross-ownership of other media outlets,
such as newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was widely praised by both industry executives and
public interest advocates. CBS senior vice president Martin Franks
called the decision ``a big win for Bill Kennard and truly a nice
piece of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Jay Schwartzman, the president of the Media Access
Project, a Washington-based public interest firm, said that while
he had hoped for more in the way of insuring diversity in station
ownership, the commission deserved to be praised for succeeding in
the most important area of closing loopholes in stations ownership
restrictions that had rendered the existing rules unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if you run it, you own it,'' Schwartzman said. ``It had
become like the Wild West. People who played by the rules were
being penalized. I think overall Bill Kennard did a good job under
severe political pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most pleased of all were the owners of stations who
may now become the subjects of bidding wars by suddenly unfettered
buyers. Among the logical targets is KCAL, an independent station
in Los Angeles, which had been put up for bid (along with other
stations) by Young Broadcasting several months ago only to be
withdrawn when no satisfactory bid was forthcoming, and the
enormous station holdings of Bud Paxon.
</P>
<P>
   Paxon, who owns stations in all the 20 biggest cities and 43 of
the top 50 said he was about to uncork champagne Thursday night.
``If we're going into the duopoly game, we're the prettiest girl at
the du-op dance,'' Paxon said.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling for the last two years to launch his own
seventh network, based on family programming, Paxon said he he
would now consider an offer to sell his holdings, ``if I got the
right price _ I would owe that to my shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would also consider a joint venture with a partner
who, under the new regulations could purchase up to 32 per cent of
his company. Paxon said he had already had some preliminary
discussions with potential bidders.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The big station owning groups, which include all of the four big
network, have been actively seeking deregulation in order to expand
their holdings. They have argued that with the ever-multiplying
array of viewing choices, including hundreds of cable channels,
satellite channels and coming digital channels, they need to be
able to compete by adding more channels of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the FCC still limits station groups to owning stations
that cover 35 per cent of the country. (Thursday's ruling did not
address that regulation. Kennard said it is likely to be taken up
in the fall and he has not taken a public position on that
ownership cap. ``I will have something to say about it then,'' he
said.)
</P>
<P>
   All the networks are close to that cap, with Fox and CBS right
at the limit. Only through this decision on dual ownership can they
expand in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the economic model it's great to own two stations in one
market,'' said Paul Sweeney, a media analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney. ``I think we are going to start seeing a lot of big ticket
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Reif-Cohen noted that in the biggest cities there are more than
enough station to go around for acquisitive networks _ 16 in New
York, 19 in Los Angeles, 13 in Chicago. She said the networks could
buy a second station for such purposes are adding news programs
produced by the existing station's news department, or repeats of
shows that network owns, and especially for finding a home for
sports programs.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has such wide interests in sports, especially in Los
Angeles, where the company owns the Dodgers, that KCAL may be an
especially inviting prize. ``Fox has sports and kids' programming,
it could fill that channel easily,'' Ms. Reif-Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also has a large library of other programming including
films. One Fox executive noted that Fox started an all movie
channel on cable that has had little impact so far. ``Would that
programming be better served on a second broadcast outlet in major
cities?'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive noted that Paxon had 19 stations in cities
where Fox already has a station. One of those is in New York, where
Fox again has wide sports interests, including broadcast rights to
Yankee games. Those are now placed on Channel 5, the Fox flagship
station. Presumably they could be located on another broadcast
outlet if Fox owned one in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Not every network executive saw Friday's ruling as momentous.
One senior executive called the changes ``small potatoes'' in terms
of what the networks need to protect themselves financially in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman, the public interest advocate, called that position
nonsense saying ``The networks are thriving businesses that are not
suffering and dying.'' He argued against further regulation that
would open the industry to only to owners ``with deep pockets.''

CHINA ESPIONAGE INQUIRY WAS PLAGUED BY MANY MISTAKES, SENATE REPORT
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government's investigation into how China got
American nuclear weapons secrets was plagued by widespread mistakes
and misjudgments but there was no political interference, according
to the two ranking members of a Senate committee that held closed
hearings on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators issued a 32-page critique, the most detailed
public examination of how the Energy Department, the Justice
Department and the FBI handled the investigation into the apparent
disclosure of design information on America's most sophisticated
nuclear warhead, the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   There were ``no heroes'' and a ``shocking lack of thoroughness,
competence and urgency'' in the investigation, said Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman, D-Conn., and the ranking minority member on the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, which held 13 hours of hearings on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and chairman of the committee,
expressed displeasure at the management of the Justice Department
under Attorney General Janet Reno. At a briefing on Thursday with
Lieberman, he questioned why Reno ``was out of the loop'' on such
an important investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The senators' findings could prove to be a mixed blessing for
Wen Ho Lee, the former scientist at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory who has been the chief suspect in the case. He was
dismissed by the Energy Department last March.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the report questions why investigators focused
so quickly on Lee and his wife, Sylvia, even though there was no
direct evidence linking them to the transfer of W-88 design
secrets. But the report also discloses new information about the
Lees that led the FBI to believe they might be improperly involved
in helping China.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the couple have said they have done nothing wrong,
and Lee, in an interview on ``60 Minutes'' on CBS, suggested that
he was picked out because he was the only Asian-American in the
weapons design group. In the interview, Lee said he had spent the
``best years of my life'' trying to strengthen the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Lees did not return a telephone call on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Justice Department does not have sufficient
evidence to bring espionage charges in the case, but they also said
the department is weighing whether to indict Lee for transferring
large archives of classified data to an unprotected computer
system.
</P>
<P>
   A key problem for the government is the difficulty prosecutors
face in keeping classified information from being exposed if they
bring an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said in his CBS interview that the transfers were routine,
but Energy Secretary Bill Richardson dismissed that as ``pure
bunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, in a meeting with reporters on Thursday, declined to
discuss Lee's case. She defended the department's handling of the
matter but also said that her lawyers should have pursued the case
with the FBI and that procedures are now in place to insure better
coordination.
</P>
<P>
   John Collingwood, a spokesman for the FBI, said: ``We accept the
criticisms concerning the early portions of this investigation.
Director Louis J. Freeh has reacted in a massive way to the
shortcomings apparent from this case.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, the Energy Department had determined that it was highly
likely that China had illegally obtained W-88 secrets. Though other
parts of the government had access to the W-88 information,
investigators focused on Los Alamos, where the weapon was designed
and where Lee and his wife worked.
</P>
<P>
   Taking such a narrow approach was the beginning of a ``tragedy
of errors,'' Lieberman said; by focusing solely on Lee, he said,
investigators may be missing unknown American officials still
spying for China. But, he noted, if Lee was responsible, he was
allowed to stay in his sensitive job for two years after coming
under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The next error, according to the senators, was the failure of a
Los Alamos counterintelligence official to supply accurate
information about access to Lee's computer. The FBI was told that
Lee had not signed a form permitting access. The bureau was also
told his computer did not contain a notice on the monitor warning
about the lack of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Both assertions were wrong, but the FBI agent did not pursue the
matter, the senators found.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, the bureau sought Justice Department approval to
secretly monitor Lee. They had no direct evidence of espionage. But
their evidence, according to the senators, did include these items:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Deceptive answers'' by Lee in 1984 in another espionage
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lee's admission in 1984 that he had passed unclassified
information to a foreign government, contrary to government
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   _ An FBI lead in the 1990s that ``could be reasonably
interpreted to indicate that Lee had provided significant
assistance'' to China.
</P>
<P>
   _ Close contacts between Sylvia Lee and Chinese scientists, and
Lee's aggressive efforts to act as an interpreter for a visiting
Chinese scientific delegation ``despite his inability to perform
this function very effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Department officials were not persuaded, and the
request to monitor Lee was never approved. They thought the
evidence was too dated and asked the bureau to take a closer look
at other suspects, according to testimony before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The senators faulted the FBI for waiting 18 months to get back
to the Justice Department and found it ``remarkable'' that the
director, Freeh, never contacted Reno about such an important case.
</P>
<P>
   But the senators were also critical of the Justice Department.
They thought the department's denial of the bureau's request for
monitoring was wrong, though defensible. They asked why crucial
records were missing. And they also found it ``remarkable'' that
officials never personally engaged Reno in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The senators said that they were still studying the issue, but
that they hoped the relevant agencies could hold officials
accountable for the mistakes. Internal inquiries are under way at
the various departments, which could lead to disciplinary actions.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Anderson, the Energy Department spokeswoman, said that
Secretary Richardson would soon take disciplinary action to address
the mistakes, and that Thursday's report ``validates the importance
of many of the reforms we've already undertaken to strengthen
counterintelligence and security.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson dismissed Lee earlier this year for security
violations. According to the senators, Lee failed a polygraph test
last February that included questions about whether he had given
nuclear weapons data or W-88 information to any unauthorized
person. While they declined to say whether Lee had given deceptive
answers to those particular questions, an American intelligence
official said Lee's answers were deceptive.

LYCOS TO BUY INTO WEB MUSIC CRAZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lycos Inc. plans to announce a $38.8 million acquisition Friday,
based on a surprising traffic pattern it says it has noticed lately
on its Internet search engine: Music is more popular than sex.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the digital music format known as MP3 has become
the term most often used in requests to the Lycos search engine,
said Ron Sege, executive vice president of the Waltham, Mass.
Internet portal firm.
</P>
<P>
   Sex was the traditional leader, Sege said, but Lycos has been
building up its music-oriented section lately because of the shift
in interest. Lycos will detail plans to issue 1.1 million
additional shares of its stock to acquire closely-held Internet
Music Distribution Inc. of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos may make additional payments to Internet Music, based on
the popularity of the company's music-playing software, known as
Sonique. It allows Internet users to download music files from Web
sites and play them on their personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos will give away Sonique through free downloads, but hopes
the software will help boost the popularity of its music-oriented
Web sites and draw in more viewers and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was introduced several weeks ago, Sonique has become
the second-most popular MP3 player on the Internet, according to
the C-Net news service; as of last late Thursday, had been
downloaded 75,987 times this week alone.
</P>
<P>
   Sonique competes with other software products such as Winamp,
whose maker, Nullsoft Inc., was recently acquired by America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   The deals reflect the increased use of the Internet as a music
distribution channel, said Al-Riaz Adatia, one of four young
cofounders of Internet Music in California who plan to join Lycos
to develop the service.
</P>
<P>
   Sege said the acquisition will complement the Lycos radio
programming service, introduced in April.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Lycos rose 2 3/8 to close at 35 15/16 in Nasdaq
trading Thursday, giving the Internet Music deal an initial value
of $38.8 million. Approximately 45 million shares of Lycos stock
now are outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Lycos said the on-line news service Salon.com will
provide editorial content for its Lycos.com Web site. Terms weren't
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Salon.com said the Salon-Lycos cobranded area will carry content
from several of Salon.com's 10 original content sites, including
Salon News, Salon Books, and Salon Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Salon Books, which includes author interviews and daily reviews,
will be the first site to provide content as part of the Lycos
Entertainment Web Guide.

WAR COLLEGES NOW TRAINING SOLDIERS IN ART OF PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FT. BRAGG, N.C. _ Once, soldiers who hoped to become generals
came to the military's colleges to study the theory of war and the
history of military alliances, and to hone their skills to survive
_ and kill if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Today, while those fighting instincts must still be uppermost,
learning the art of war has come to include making and keeping
peace.
</P>
<P>
   At the nation's war colleges, here at Ft. Bragg and at the Army
War College in Pennsylvania, there is a growing demand for courses
in peacekeeping as American ground forces are more often called
upon to keep the peace in hot spots like Kosovo, Bosnia and Angola
rather than fight prolonged wars.
</P>
<P>
   In a classroom here at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare
School, a group of Army captains and other mid-level officers are
learning negotiating skills in an elaborate role-playing exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Feuding Bosnian mayors, played by two members of the class, are
stubbornly refusing to compromise. So NATO's political adviser,
played by another student, must step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just create a mixed military patrol and put both your
police _ Muslim police and Croat police _ in charge of the zone of
separation,'' said Capt. J. Franck, a French trainee sent here by
his Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   When the exhortation fails, Franck chastises the fractious
mayors. ``Look, in the end you're the ones responsible for the
peace,'' he said. ``We're only the facilitators.''
</P>
<P>
   But the talks fall apart, and James S. McCallum, the instructor,
pulls Franck aside to tell him that while his ideas are sound, his
manner is too brusque. ``Don't point fingers,'' he instructs the
young captain.
</P>
<P>
   Taken directly from NATO's first year trying to keep the peace
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, this classroom exercise ended a week of
intensive course work in negotiating skills. Before the day was up,
the 30 officers playing roles from factory owners to education
ministers had learned what sounded like obvious lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to wire the meetings and turn Kupres, Bosnia,
into Fayetteville, N.C., overnight,'' said Capt. Robert Watwood,
who was playing the role of a military civil affairs officer. ``You
can't do that _ just say `kumbaya' and make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the four years since Bosnia jolted the Pentagon into
accelerating its ad hoc peacekeeping training, the Army has made
peacekeeping an integral part of the study of war, turning out
officers here and at the Army War College who can command what are
officially known as ``operations other than war.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is relatively new. Last year the negotiating class
was added to the syllabus at Ft. Bragg, where the catalog of
peacekeeping courses has bulged over the last four years. The Army
started its own Peacekeeping Institute five years ago at the War
College at Carlisle, Pa., to instruct officers throughout the
services, and its instructors make an annual visit to Washington to
brief the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the art of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first briefing for the chiefs in 1995 was like grammar
school,'' said Douglas Campbell, the institute's director. ``The
last one we were already at the master of arts level. Now we're
discussing the real hot-button subjects, like force protection.''
</P>
<P>
   While proving mettle on the battlefield and receiving a command
post in wartime were once the surest routes to the top,
peacekeeping has also become its own career track in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a pass for promotion, just as if someone had commanded
in war,'' said Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon's spokesman. ``The
importance and complexity of major peacekeeping operations today
makes the officers who command them prime candidates for
promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon cited as an example Gen. Montgomery Meigs, the second
general to command American forces in Bosnia, who was promoted to
four-star status as commander of the Army in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   At Ft. Bragg, the most advanced program of its kind, there are
courses in negotiation, relief assistance, property control,
procurement law and how to work with translators. All are intended
to instill the gifts of peacemaker in soldiers trained in the use
of force.
</P>
<P>
   Instructors here derided the notion that they need courses to
undo a soldier's fighting reflexes. The teaching here, they say,
merely adds new skills to ingrained instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we don't retrain soldiers not to kill, no way,'' said Lt.
Col. Michael D. Clay, who helped develop the program. ``There isn't
any problem of soldiers making that mental leap from wartime to
peacekeeping missions. That's just gibberish that comes from
watching too many Sylvester Stallone movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the Clinton administration, policymakers began
encouraging the Pentagon to take peacekeeping more seriously, said
James Schear, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for
peacekeeping. After hundreds of meetings debating what peacekeeping
required _ whether to have a unit dedicated solely to peacekeeping,
where and how to train the troops _ the Pentagon settled on an
approach in 1994 and refined its training program.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after seven subsequent peacekeeping missions, the Army can
begin fielding a peace force within days, not weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to have trained forces who can fight if necessary
but who are also skilled at working with the local population,
international organizations, aid groups and the former warring
armies. They end up knowing not only how to set up and operate
roadblocks but also how to think and act like practical small-town
mayors.
</P>
<P>
   They have become so adept that William Cohen, the secretary of
defense, fears the military is being drawn into doing too much in
missions like Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, are
vocal critics of the United Nations, saying it had failed to set up
a civilian peacekeeping administration in Kosovo, even six weeks
after the military arrived. In particular, Cohen said NATO forces,
including the U.S. Army, are being forced to serve as police and
civil administrators in Kosovo, and he fears that ``the more we do,
the less incentive there is for the U.N. to come in and assume that
burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Promising senior officers are sent to the Army War College for a
year of training that includes a mandatory peackekeeping course.
Ft. Bragg's programs last from three months to two years and are
aimed at mid-level officers.
</P>
<P>
   A civil-military affairs division at Ft. Bragg was established
in 1942 with a mission that was not all that different from the one
today: to train troops who were to enter and occupy Germany and
other countries after World War II. But the school's focus shifted
during the Vietnam War when Green Berets came to Ft. Bragg for
training in counterinsurgency and other special battle techniques.
</P>
<P>
   There is no official count, but hundreds of active and reserve
officers have been through the Army's peackekeeping courses. The
Air Force also offers limited training but there is not much demand
in the other services because peacekeeping has remained the
province of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``We routinely have to fill the vacuum until the U.N. arrives,''
said Clay, who was chief of civil military operations of American
forces in Bosnia. ``Then once the U.N. sets up, you find they've
got some guys who don't have a clue how to work with the U.S. Army
or any other military. So we have to train our soldiers to work
with all of them and make their humanitarian organizations so
successful that we can go home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army's courses are also attracting foreign officers whose
ministries want to play roles in international peacekeeping
operations, which for some nations is the main reason to maintain a
standing army. Only Canada has a similar program.

ISMAIL'S INJURY SEEN AS `MINOR'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Clarence E. Hill Jr. and Ray Buck 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ A day after wide receiver Raghib Ismail
suffered a sprained left shoulder, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey was
still looking on the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Ismail, listed as day-to-day, is getting treatment
and should be back to full speed in a week or so. He missed last
night's Blue-White scrimmage and will miss Monday's preseason
opener against the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ismail said that the injury is a setback, he said
``it's just a minor problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It always sets you back a bit because he's not getting an
opportunity to work with \Rquarterback\S Troy \RAikman\S,'' Gailey
said. ``That's something you always like. But if we were talking
about a three-week or four-week deal, then we would be talking
about a real problem. This is just a minor problem.''
\Nsubheds:Gailey's sees progress
</P>
<P>
   Much of has been made of the Cowboys' being more comfortable in
Gailey's offense this year as opposed to last season.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the difference has manifested itself at training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about things, we talk about where someone should
be and where they run their routes,'' Gailey said. ``We are all on
the same page. We have gone through and seen what it should look
like. When we first started everybody had in their own mind how it
should look like. Now we are much more of the same mind on a pass
pattern, a running play or a blocking scheme should look like. That
just helps everybody's comfort level.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the Cowboys coaches are spending most of their time
teaching the new guys, ``which is how it should be.''
\Nsubheds:Lafleur to return Injured tight end David LaFleur, who is
recovering from back and ankle surgery, should start running pass
routes this weekend, Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gailey said LeFleur likely won't seen any full-time
action until the third preseason game against the New England
Patriots on Aug. 21. Stepnoski 6-for-9 Center Mark Stepnoski
returns to the Cowboys after a four-year stint with the
Houston//Tennessee Oilers-turned-Titans. Between Emmitt Smith and
Eddie George, Stepnoski has blocked for an NFL top-five running
back in six of his nine pro seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, there's a big difference \Rbetween Smith and
George\S. That's apparent to everyone,'' Stepnoski said. ``Not that
Emmitt is weak and not that Eddie is slow, but you have two
different packages. Look at their body sizes. Yet, they both have
all the superlative traits to be great running backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepnoski made the Pro Bowl five consecutive years from 1993
through 1997 _ three with the Cowboys, two with the then-Oilers.

CONGRESSIONAL CONFERENCE ON GUN CONTROL BREAKS FOR RECESS WITHOUT A
COMPROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mass., Mo., S.D., Utah) (rk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate and House lawmakers on a conference that is
expected to hammer out new gun control legislation held their first
meeting Thursday, only to postpone the bulk of their work until
they return on Sept. 7 from a monthlong congressional recess.
</P>
<P>
   The decision meant that most schoolchildren would return to
classes before the enactment of any of the new restrictions on
firearms that began to be debated in the aftermath of the massacre
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., on April 20.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the conference said that this was inexcusable, and
offered a motion that lawmakers on the conference work into the
recess, which begins Friday, to reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Democrats knew would happen, Republicans rejected this.
Republicans accused Democrats of vacuous grandstanding and said the
issue of gun control was too volatile and sensitive to be handled
with haste.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an easy, itty-bitty thing to do,'' said Sen. Orrin
Hatch R-Utah, the chairman of the conference, which is expected to
iron out the differences in different juvenile crime bills that
passed the Senate and the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill included an array of gun control provisions. The
House bill technically had none, but its members did approve
several new restrictions on firearms before a final package of
those measures was defeated, largely by Democrats who were
protesting the relative weakness of that package in comparison with
the Senate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are wide differences here,'' Hatch said at the
conference Thursday. ``I don't know how you bridge these
differences, but it's going to take time.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that lawmakers _ and, more specifically,
America's children _ did not have that luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only 11 days before the students at Columbine return to
school,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who is one of the
five Senators on the conference. ``The inability of Congress to act
more quickly on this important legislation is shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference earlier, President Clinton, Senate Minority
Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota and House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt of Missouri all assailed Republicans for the
absence of gun control legislation. Clinton later issued a
statement urging lawmakers on the conference to stay in Washington
and meet during the recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's show our children that when it comes to their safety,
Washington will not take a break,'' the president said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This full-court press underscored Democrats' continued
confidence that most Americans share the party's advocacy of more
stringent gun control, and it signaled that many Democrats would
devote considerable oratory to the issue in their home districts
over the recess.
</P>
<P>
   But they will not be the only ones using the many weeks before
any final disposition of the gun debate to try to rally opinion to
their side.
</P>
<P>
   James Jay Baker, chief lobbyist for the National Rifle
Association, said that the organization would probably spend at
least as much on lobbying and advertising in the coming months as
the $1.5 million it had poured into the gun control debate since
early May.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is particularly concerned about the
conference's handling of any measure to regulate gun shows that
approaches the strictness of a provision approved by the Senate.
That measure defined gun shows broadly, mandated all vendors _ not
just the 60 percent who are federally licensed dealers _ to conduct
background checks on customers and allowed three business days for
the completion of those checks.
</P>
<P>
   Although lawmakers in the House rejected this approach,
Democrats in both chambers have continued to insist that it be
included in whatever compromise legislation the conference
negotiates.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hatch and Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the senior House
Republican on the conference, said at a joint news conference
Thursday that this was both impossible and foolish, because it
would guarantee the failure of the legislation when it returns the
House for a new vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde also suggested a willingness to craft something as
close to the Senate gun show provision as was politically feasible.
Possible alterations to that provision include a shortened period
for the completion of background checks and a narrower definition
of gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good beginning is the Senate bill,'' Hyde said. ``But it is
a beginning. As you know, compromise is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic advocates of gun control have yet to say just how
much of a dilution to the Senate gun show provision they will be
willing to accept and dodged questions about that at a news
conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Democrats' dilemma is that any gun show provision
would be attached to other restrictions on firearms, like child
safety devices on handguns and a prohibition on firearm ownership
by adults convicted of violent crimes as juveniles, which are
likely to emerge from the conference and that Democrats as well as
many Republicans want.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch has repeatedly accused Democrats of deliberately refusing
to compromise on sensible, meaningful legislation so that they can
stake what they believe to be the moral and political high ground.
He urged them not to do that when the conference resumes its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not play for political points,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lawmakers themselves will not formally meet again
until the second week of September, Hatch instructed them to have
their staff members spend the time until then negotiating common
ground between the Senate and House juvenile crime bills so that
the conference can send compromise legislation back to the Senate
and House as soon after the recess as possible.

GOP-CONTROLLED CONGRESS PASSES $792 BILLION TAX-CUT BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-controlled Congress narrowly passed
a $792 billion tax-cut bill Thursday that is unlikely to survive
President Clinton's promised veto.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 221-206 in favor of the measure and the Senate
gave its approval by a slim margin of 50-49.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, the largest tax cut proposal since the 1981
reduction during the Reagan administration, would lower the five
income tax brackets by one percentage point over 10 years, cut the
capital gains tax for individuals, phase out the so-called death or
estate tax on property holdings and eliminate the ``marriage
penalty'' on couples who file jointly.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure is opposed by the president and most Democrats,
who say it could prove disastrous for the country if the $3
trillion in projected budget surpluses fails to materialize over
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made that point Thursday morning during a Democratic
rally on Capitol Hill as he sought to build public support for
using most of the anticipated revenues to finance a Medicare
prescription drug reimbursement program, shore up Social Security
and pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Any left over, Clinton said, should be used to fund a modest tax
cut of $300 billion and to boost spending on education, defense and
other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not be doing this until we figure out how we're
going to save Medicare, save Social Security and pay the debt
off,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When times are easy we are vulnerable to making our biggest
mistakes, and that is what this decision before us is about,''
Clinton said, referring to the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now what (Republicans) have said is, let's pass this big tax
cut first, make everybody happy tomorrow, and then we'll talk about
these long-term challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders plan to send the bill to Clinton in September
after Congress returns from its month-long recess, which begins
today. Polls show that most Americans appear to favor Clinton's
approach to handling the budget surplus. But GOP lawmakers are
hoping to change their minds with a heavy lobbying campaign that
they believe could force the president to sign their tax cut rather
than veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans held their own rally before the votes Thursday and
accused Clinton of ignoring ``the fine print'' in their bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read the fine print. It's all there for America's working
people. That's who will benefit from this tax bill,'' said House
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Archer ticked off a number of breaks that Americans, whether
low- or high-income earners, could expect to get from the bill,
including not only a reduction in rates but credits for education,
child adoption and care, retirement savings and home care for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   By gradually doubling the deduction for married couples alone,
he said, Americans could reap $150 billion in tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, the chief architect of the legislation, also said he was
``proud'' that the bill would eliminate the death tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ... not right ... when an individual dies to face the
undertaker and the IRS on the same day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill has so much good in it that we're going to go across
the country in August and we're going to let the American people
know, number one, it's their money, not Washington's money. And
they're going to get to keep more of it to spend the way they see
fit,`` the Texan said.
</P>
<P>
   He called the coming decision over whether to give taxpayers
``the right to spend their own money,'' as he put it, ``the
dividing line'' between Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the leading Republican presidential
candidate, picked up on that theme during a campaign appearance in
West Des Moines, Iowa. Saying he was ready to help Republican
lawmakers get the measure signed into law, he encouraged Clinton to
reconsider his veto threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my judgment, we ought to pass back the money to the people
who pay the taxes,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate votes were split pretty much along party
lines. In the House, four Republicans voted against it. Five
Democrats crossed the aisle to support it.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, all 45 Democrats and four Republicans _ Sens.
George Voinovich of Ohio, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Olympia
Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine _ voted against it. Republican
Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas voted in favor
of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared from the 50-49 Senate tally that Vice President Al
Gore, who is constitutionally designated as president of the
Senate, should have been on hand to cast a tie vote, which would
have killed the bill. But Republican leaders announced earlier in
the day that they would use a parliamentary maneuver known as
``vote pairing'' to ensure victory.
</P>
<P>
   The rarely used tactic, which the Democrats agreed to, would
have allowed Specter, who voted no, to switch his ballot in support
of the measure on behalf of Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, who would
have cast a yes vote had he not been absent because of his
daughter's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   During the daylong floor debate on the bill Democrats kept
referring to it as ``a political statement'' that Republicans would
use against them in next year's presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of these great posturings,'' declared Sen. John
Kerry, D-Mass., ``from the very people who gave you the great
deficit of the `80s and predicted that (Clinton's 1993 deficit
reduction plan, which passed with not a single Republican vote)
would increase unemployment...and ruin the country.''
</P>
<P>
   They also said the bill would provide more benefits to big
corporations and the affluent than to lower-income taxpayers. They
cited such items as a $1.6 billion break for multinational oil and
gas companies, an increase in the deduction for the so-called
``three-martini'' business lunch from 50 percent to 80 percent, and
the fact that higher income earners would reap bigger tax savings
than average families to make their point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to say upper income earners don't deserve a tax
break. But it is fair to (ask) who needs it the most?'' said Sen.
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, citing his Senate salary of a $136,000, said he would
average at least $800 more in tax cuts than a family of four with a
$35,000 income.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm and other Republicans asserted, however, that there was
nothing wrong with giving ``most of the tax cuts to the people who
pay most of the taxes.'' He defended the bill as balanced and fair.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats got some help in trashing the bill from an
unlikely source _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is challenging
Bush for the GOP presidential nomination. But in the end, McCain
voted for it in hope, he said, of forcing Clinton to negotiate a
better tax cut deal for average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In a floor speech before the vote, McCain said Democrats were
right to attack the Republican measure because it further
``complicates the tax system...with carve-outs for special
interests that go into effect immediately'' while delaying most
reductions for individual taxpayers until 2005.
</P>
<P>
   To make his point, he cited two special provisions that would
give an immediate credit to fishing tackle box companies to help
them compete with tool box manufacturers and to poultry farmers who
burn chicken manure to generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priorities in this bill are seriously skewed in the wrong
direction,'' McCain said, calling it ``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Special interests get the biggest breaks, and they get them
right away. All the American families get are the leftovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Thursday that he's ready to negotiate. White House
Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton was even flexible on how
tax cuts should be implemented. But he insisted that Clinton would
not ``go much beyond...the $300 billion range'' over 10 years that
he has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he says there's no middle ground. I think he
says that we can talk and negotiate about how you cut taxes and how
that works into your overall budget,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart acknowledged that before talks start, Clinton will
use his veto authority to kill the GOP tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully once we get past the political posturing, we'll get
down to a discussion that involves the real numbers,'' he said.

INTERNET STOCKS REBOUND AND DOLLAR AND BONDS RALLY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Internet stocks rebounded Thursday, lifting the
Nasdaq composite index for the first time in six sessions, as
investors sought bargains and both the dollar and bonds rallied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a major rebound in the Internet stocks today,'' said
Timothy M. Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp. Even
so, many investors appear to be awaiting Friday morning's report of
unemployment figures for July.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average gained 119.05 points, or 1.12
percent, to close at 10,793.82, in a turbulent session that saw it
drop as much as 108.59 points in early trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rallied 8.38 points, or
six-tenths of a percent, to 1,313.71. The Nasdaq, which had its
biggest intraday upswing since mid-April, closed up 25.83 points,
or 1.02 percent, to 2,565.81.
</P>
<P>
   Many technology issues swung wildly during the trading session.
Ebay, for example, traded as low as 70 9/32 before closing at 92
7/8, up 17 1/8. Amazon.com was ahead 8 13/16 for the day, to 97
1/4. Yahoo slumped to 110 before rallying to end at 128 3/8, up 7
3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Even America Online, which suffered from word that it may face
Internet competition from Microsoft, regained some lost ground. The
stock, which was the most actively traded of the day with 57.1
million shares changing hands, plunged to 76 15/16 before climbing
back to 83 15/16, down 3 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Although many analysts had eagerly awaited productivity figures
from the Labor Department, they seemed to have had minimal impact
in a session marked also by a flight to quality in the bond market,
the successful completion of a huge Wal-Mart financing and
lingering glow from Wednesday's disclosure that the Treasury plans
to redeem some debt early.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity gain, which Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the
Federal Reserve, cited in his recent Congressional appearances, was
at a slower-than-expected 1.3 percent pace in the second quarter.
But unit labor costs, which are considered a crucial measure of
wage pressures, grew faster than economists had forecast. They
surged to an annual rate of 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kinds of data _ the combination of increased
compensation and lower productivity _ that are confirming the Fed's
fears,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at the Bank of
America.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve policy makers are scheduled to meet Aug. 24
to decide whether the economy is slowing enough on its own _
without further interest-rates increases _ to avoid a pickup in
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosanne M. Cahn, equity economist at Credit Suisse First
Boston, contended that productivity ``wasn't bad'' considering the
quarter's slowdown in output.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opens Friday the Labor Department will report
on the employment situation for July, one of the most important
government economic statistics each month.
</P>
<P>
   Among the winners Thursday was IBM, which set the pace for the
Dow Jones blue chips, rising 4 11/16, to 123 3/16. IBM said its
scientists made a major, though early-stage, breakthrough in
storage technology.
</P>
<P>
   American Express gained 3 5/8, to 127 1/8, as it announced heavy
investment in Internet products and facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Union Carbide, which will be acquired by Dow Chemical, gained a
further 3 9/16, to 62 15/16, while DuPont rose 2 1/2, to 74. Dow
Chemical rebounded 5 11/16, to 124 5/16, after losing 6 1/16 on its
Wednesday bid for Union Carbide.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors was down 1 13/16 to 61, and Goodyear declined 1
5/16, to 52 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Several oil stocks posted hefty gains, with Royal Dutch up 2
3/16, to 62 9/16, with the help of a better than expected 4.7
percent profit gain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Thursday's upturn, said Peter J. Canelo, a Morgan
Stanley strategist, the market is likely to continue to be
pressured by forced liquidation in Internet issues. That ``bubble
is bursting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues held a 3-2
margin over advancing ones, with 203 stocks making new lows and
only 40 new highs. Volume was 854.2 million, up from 781.2 million
on Wednesday.

SUBJECT MATTER OF KOKO DOCUMENTARY OVERCOMES THE SHORTCOMINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francine Patterson's specialty is gorilla linguistics. That's
gorilla, as in Magilla, not guerrilla, as in warfare, though there
probably have been times when Patterson deserved a little combat
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1972, when Patterson was a doctoral student in
developmental psychology at Stanford and a gorilla named Koko was
an infant at the San Francisco Zoo, Patterson has devoted herself
to teaching Koko sign language on the assumption that the great
apes are smarter than your average bear, and certainly bright
enough to communicate with humans.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt you've heard of it down through the years. From
features in National Geographic to appearances on ``Mr. Rogers'
Neighborhood'' to exhibits of gorilla ``artwork'' at reputable
galleries, the initiative informally known as Project Koko has
captured the imagination of anyone who's ever wondered what it
would be like to talk to the animals _ and actually have the
animals talk back.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday at 8 p.m., PBS's ``Nature'' presents ``A
Conversation With Koko,'' a one-hour capsulization of Patterson's
experiment in interspecies communication.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics who think Koko is merely mimicking Patterson's
gestures, which incorporate a modified version of American Sign
Language, may not be convinced that actual communication is taking
place. For instance, Koko's word for ``girl'' is said to be
``lip,'' but the program doesn't explain why or how humans have
made this interpretive leap.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with subtitles helping to explain Koko's ``thoughts,''
those who want to believe should have no trouble accepting her
reasonably precise gestures as evidence of an astounding
communications breakthrough. Patterson says Koko knows about a
thousand words and can use 500 of them regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad she can't talk. Martin Sheen's stilted narration is a
distraction, and the writing of producers Bonnie Brennan and Robert
Visty is a tad overblown. Early on, Sheen describes the documentary
as ``the true tale of a young woman and a gentle giant walking hand
in hand into a whole new world of understanding.'' Blechh. Later,
he says the project ``allows (Koko) to speak as an ambassador on
behalf of her endangered species.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheesh. Koko hasn't had the opportunity to say (or sign), ``If
nominated I will not run, if elected I will not serve,'' and we've
made her poohbah of primates? Aren't we putting too much pressure
on her? She's only 28.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the subject matter in ``A Conversation With Koko''
overcomes the obvious shortcomings. The story of Patterson's
relationship with Koko, now approaching three decades in length, is
fascinating. And even the most hardened skeptic will have a hard
time dismissing Koko's enormous capacity for affection and
attachment.
</P>
<P>
   As Sheen says, accurately this time, ``She has challenged us to
acknowledge that we share this world with other intelligent
animals.''

 &HT;    Traditional services held for Muslim victim of Atlanta office
shootings
 &HT;    By Diane R. Stepp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eight time zones away in Tehran, friends of Jamshid
Havash's family tried vainly to keep him alive last week by
sacrificing some livestock and giving the meat to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a custom in our country when someone is in very much
danger. It's a way of thanking God that he is still alive,'' said
brother-in-law Mori Sarshar, a Shiite Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't know their appeal could do no good. Havash was
already dead, cut down last week in the Buckhead shootings, on the
floor of Momentum Securities.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Roya, and daughter, Tannaz, 7, were visiting relatives
in Tehran when the fatal gunshots rang out. They learned Wednesday
night _ six days after the shooting _ when they arrived back in
Atlanta that Havash was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told her that Jamshid had been shot, that he was in a
coma,'' said Sarshar. ``We knew it would take a long time to get
home, a 20-hour flight from Tehran, and we wanted to give them some
hope,'' said Sarshar. Havash's mother also came to what she
believed would be her son's bedside. Instead, it was his funeral
they would attend the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 family members and mourners attended the
traditional Muslim service Thursday. On Sunday, there will be
another opportunity to remember and mourn Havash at a memorial
service.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's funeral service was led by a mullah who offered
prayers in Farsi and Arabic and read from the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives carried Havash to his grave in Greenlawn
Cemetery in a wood coffin borne on their shoulders. As they
proceeded, they stopped to place the coffin on the ground three
times ``to acquaint him with the ground he will be buried in,''
explained Saeid Sadri, a professor of architecture at Georgia Tech
who attended the funeral. Traditionally Iranians are not buried in
coffins, but are wrapped in cloth, said Sadri, ``but wood which is
degradable is also acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Havash's wife and mother wept openly as family and friends
filled the grave with soil, then poured water on it for
purification and placed their fingers on top of the grave while
offering prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is still in shock. It's totally unbelievable. We never,
ever dreamed something like this would happen,'' said Havash's
niece Leyla Sarshar, 22, a student at Georgia State University who
helped break the news to Roya Havash.
</P>
<P>
   As improbable as Havash's death seemed, Sarshar said she
believes her uncle was fated to die in the way he did, shot in the
back in circumstances no one could imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the day he was born it was predetermined. If you don't
believe that, you're bound to go crazy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Events of the summer reinforce Sarshar's belief. Havash had
planned to travel to Tehran with his wife and daughter in late
June, she said, but changed his mind at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   New business ventures kept him home _ the start-up of his own
environmental engineering consulting firm, and a residential
home-building enterprise. Few realized Havash was also day trading
stocks. ``It may have been the first time he was there. He had just
started day trading,'' said Sarshar.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the shooting, a 3 p.m. appointment to look at
property that would have placed him far from Buckhead fell through.
``He would have been at Momentum in the morning, instead,'' said
Sarshar. ``It was almost like an invitation to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Havash, 44, ``was no ordinary man. He was a leader in our
community,'' said Sarshar. ``He was a disciplined and well-educated
man who earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering and two
graduate degrees from Georgia Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   John Oster, an environmental consultant with Lockwood Greene
Technologies, worked side-by-side with Havash for more than 10
years. Havash was a senior engineer there until he left a few
months ago to begin his own firm.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many projects they worked on together, Oster said,
was designing a waste water treatment plant for a Coca Cola syrup
plant on the Amazon River in Manaus, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   His longtime co-worker remembers Havash as a sports fan who
relished reading the newspaper sports pages.
</P>
<P>
   Oster also remembers Havash's generosity. ``Few people ever
realized it, but he would slip money to people, like the cafeteria
workers who needed it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Havash and many of his close-knit family fled Iran in the late
1970s during the political upheaval that led to the overthrow of
the shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. ``That brought most of us here,''
said Sarshar. Havash's two sisters, Shahnaz Cangari and Shahla
Khosravi, and their families and many of Roya's relatives live in
the Roswell and Dunwoody area. A brother, Amir Havash, recently
returned to Tehran. They are part of metro Atlanta's Iranian
community that is estimated to number more than 16,000, said Sadri,
the Georgia Tech faculty member.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's shooting was not the first time disaster has visited
the Havash family. Sixteen months ago, a tornado that ripped
through Dunwoody destroyed the new two-story European style home
the Havashs had saved to build.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of rebuilding, the Havash family moved
back in about two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even though that part of their life has been fixed, Tannaz, who
does not know her father is dead, knows something is again wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked why her daddy wasn't at the airport to meet her,''
Sarshar said.

COURT RULES U.S. MAY EXTRADITE MINISTER ACCUSED OF GENOCIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A three-judge panel ruled Thursday that the United
States may hand an elderly pastor over to a United Nations tribunal
to face war crimes charges stemming from ethnic unrest in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-0 ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans found that a federal judge in Laredo, Texas, was correct
when he decided there was evidence that a crime had been committed.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the judges rejected defense arguments that
Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, 75, could not be turned over for trial
because the U.S. Senate has ratified no treaty with the United
Nations over extraditions.
</P>
<P>
   The case marks the first time the United States has arrested
someone on its soil to be handed over to a U.N. tribunal.
Ntakirutimana has been in and out of custody since September 1996
when he was arrested by FBI agents in Laredo, where his family
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The war crimes tribunal, based in Tanzania, has accused
Ntakirutimana of leading attackers armed with machetes, grenades
and guns in an April 1994 rampage that killed dozens of people who
were hiding in his Seventh-day Adventist church.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rwanda was in the throes of a bloody feud between
the country's dominant ethnic groups, the Hutus and Tutsis, strife
that killed an estimated 500,000 and sent 2 million refugees
fleeing to neighboring nations. Most of those killed, including
those in Ntakirutimana's church, were Tutsis. Ntakirutimana is a
member of the Hutu ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   One judge, who agreed that he could be turned over to the U.N.
tribunal, nonetheless blistered the State Department and said the
defendant is likely innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am persuaded that it is more likely than not that
Ntakirutimana is actually innocent,'' Judge Robert Parker wrote in
a concurring but separate opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully understand that the ultimate decision in this case may
well be a political one that is driven by important considerations
of state that may transcend the question of quilt or innocence of
any individual,'' Parker continued.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations against Ntakirutimana ``defied logic'' said Parker,
who called on Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to review the
case before handing the man over to the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said they are not charged with evaluating
Ntakirutimana's guilt, but that the United States has an obligation
to enforce U.N. mandates, and that there is more than enough
evidence to warrant his standing trial.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court decision set the stage for a possible
Supreme Court battle between the Justice Department and a former
U.S. attorney general, Ramsey Clark, who is defending
Ntakirutimana.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has said the tribunal was created illegally and that the
United States needs a congressionally ratified treaty before it
could surrender his client.
</P>
<P>
   He has said the charges against Ntakirutimana were the result of
tribal hatred and the wrath of a government that despised his power
as head of a church with approximately 300,000 members in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Clark could not be reached for comment Thursday night, but he
has vowed to take the case to the Supreme Court and represent
Ntakirutimana before the Tanzania-based tribunal, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not seen the opinion, so he is not going to make any
comment,'' a staff member at Clark's New York office said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Don DeGabrielle, the assistant U.S. attorney who is
handling the case, nor officials of the State Department could be
reached for comment.

 &HT;    Southern Party denounces racism, but flag is controversial
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The Confederate flag is rising again, this
time as the symbol of a new political party that says it represents
Southerners in the battle against declining morals, government
intrusion and ``cultural bigotry and oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the Southern Party, which plans to unveil its
national platform at a rally in Flat Rock, N.C., on Saturday, say
the group's flag _ a historic Confederate government flag that
incorporates the familiar Confederate battle flag _ discredits the
group's political goal of reclaiming the South's sovereignty from
the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, in and of itself, would serve as an exclusionary symbol
for a lot of people,'' said George Allison, executive director of
the North Carolina Conference of NAACP branches in Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
has renewed its attack on the Confederate battle flag, urging
tourists to avoid South Carolina because the flag flies atop its
Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the red-and-blue battle flag _ also incorporated in
Georgia's state flag _ is a racist reminder of slavery. Supporters
say it pays tribute to the Confederacy and its fallen warriors.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Party claims the Confederate flag as the ``most
instantly and widely recognized symbol of Southern sovereignty,
valor and independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling that message a ``rhetorical change of great
significance'' in the flag debate, political observer John Reed
Shelton questioned whether the Southern Party can change critics'
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Southern nationalist movement, especially one that wraps
itself in the Confederate flag, is going to be viewed with
suspicion, given the historical record,'' said Reed, director of
the Institute for Research in Social Science at the University of
North Carolina. ``But they are vehemently denying that
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 180 people from across the nation have signed up for
the rally, according to the Southern Party. Formed in recent
months, it espouses limited government, low taxes, a return of God
to public schools, and an end to South-bashing by ``Washington and
Hollywood elites.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the party hopes to elect candidates in 16 states to
local and state offices. But if that grass-roots campaign fails to
reverse what party leaders call a slide toward federal tyranny, the
party would advocate creating a separate Southern nation.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say such a move, accomplished at the ballot box by
voters of individual states, would return power to states. That's
preferable to the ``corrupt two-party system that fails to
represent Southern interests in Washington,'' according to the new
party's Web site (www. southernparty.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a party for all Southern people,'' Jerry Baxley, the
Southern Party's first vice chairman, said in an interview
Thursday. ``We do not hold to the rancor of people running around
and screaming, `I do not like this group and I do not like that
group.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site, the group distances itself from racial hate
groups and decries such groups' ``attempt to pervert the symbols of
Southern freedom and valor into symbols of racial malice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site of the party's North Carolina chapter says
``racists of ANY stripe, including the KKK and other white
supremacist groups ... are NOT welcome'' at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of its flag, the party says the Confederate Congress
adopted the ``last official national flag of Dixie'' in March 1865,
a month after it allowed blacks to enlist as Confederate soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this reason, we believe it is a symbol that all
Southerners should be able to embrace and support as our national
symbol of independence and freedom,'' the Web page says.
</P>
<P>
   Such ideas have run into criticism this summer as the party's
officials have made public appearances around the South.
</P>
<P>
   Baxley complained about one appearance in July on a talk radio
program in Gulfport, Miss., which he said resulted in ``very
hostile and, at times, exceedingly rude'' reactions from callers
and the show's hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very gracious to him,'' said one of the hosts, Rip
Daniels, owner of the station, WJZD.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels said Baxley became upset after they disagreed over
historical details about the Confederate flag and the role of
blacks as Confederate soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The argument revealed a fundamental divide over the Civil War,
one that Daniels said he believes the Southern Party won't be able
to bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confederate history is not synonymous with Southern history,''
he said. ``There is no way that an educated African-American can
identify with the Confederacy. It was a system of white supremacy.

TEXAS TEACHER PAY RAISE BIGGEST IN U.S. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas public schoolteachers are heading back to
the classroom in the next couple of weeks with the highest
across-the-board pay raise in the nation, one teacher group said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the $3,000 increase the Texas Legislature mandated,
though, Texas teachers are still likely to remain below the
national average wage paid to teachers, said the head of the Texas
State Teachers Association. And they are leaving the profession in
droves, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``These raises are giant steps in the right direction,'' said
TSTA president Ignacio Salinas Jr. ``But even with these major
increases, we're still, at our best estimate, $2,845 below the
projected national average of $41,377.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined with raises that local districts are adding, teachers
will see an average increase of $3,800 this school year, according
to the TSTA survey of school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``School is off to a good start,'' said Salinas, who is also a
Democratic state representative from San Diego. ``Teacher morale is
the best in years and expectations are high for a good year at
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boost in pay and spirits, however, teachers continue
to leave the profession in large numbers, Salinas said, and most
school districts will open in the coming days with teacher
shortages. About half of all teachers leave the profession after
five years, in large part because of higher pay and better benefits
in non-teaching jobs in the private sector, Salinas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improvements in salaries, benefits and working conditions are
absolutely essential if we are to stem the critical teaching
shortages plaguing Texas schools and circumventing real reform in
public education. Certainly we must create a quality health
insurance program for all school employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston schools face the Aug. 16 opening with more than 500
vacancies, according to the TSTA leader. By comparison, the Spring
Branch school district has only 24 openings, due, in large part to
the $5,000 raise its teachers will see. Local school officials
added $2,000 to the state amount, giving teachers in that district
the largest hike in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other professional educators in Texas, however, will
not be seeing the state-mandated raises because the Legislature did
not specify they should be included.
</P>
<P>
   Among those left out are 2,700 diagnosticians _ teachers who
test and develop individualized educational plans for students
whose learning disabilities or other problems place them in special
education _ and the 3,300 speech and physical therapists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were excluding them,'' said state Rep. Paul Sadler,
D-Henderson, who chairs the House Public Education Committee.
``There are a number of different categories of employees ...
(many) of which are not included on the minimum salary schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosticians and therapists are among the categories of
employees not on the teacher minimum salary schedule and,
therefore, not guaranteed the $3,000 increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature required school districts to give the raise to
nurses and counselors by putting those employees back on the
teacher salary schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have loved to include all of (school employees),''
Sadler said. However, the more categories of employees added to the
minimum salary schedule, the less money teachers would have
received, he added.

`KOKO' SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT AFFECTION BETWEEN RESEARCHER, APE

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorists, unite. Or at least find somebody who gets
Cinemax premium cable so you can sit for a couple of hours in front
of Nick Broomfield's controversial documentary, ``Kurt &AMP;
Courtney.''
</P>
<P>
   It airs Friday night as part of Cinemax's ``Reel Life'' series,
raising once again the question of whether Cobain's death was a
suicide or something else. Seattle Post-Intelligencer rock critic
Gene Stout reviewed the film last year during its theatrical
release. Here's his take: ``Nick Broomfield's documentary on rocker
Kurt Cobain and his widow, Courtney Love, takes the viewer through
a bewildering parade of interviews with the couple's family members
and friends. It provides a luridly entertaining portrait of Love _
who kept the film from being shown at Sundance _ as ruthless,
scheming, manipulative, even murderous. But it also portrays Cobain
as a lovable but troubled man whose suicide was not implausible.''
</P>
<P>
   Farewell to `MST3K'
</P>
<P>
   Fans of ``Mystery Science Theater 3000'' will be gathering for
entirely different reasons this weekend. Sunday's installment on
Sci-Fi Channel (6 and 8 p.m.) will be the last original broadcast
of the show, which over 10 years has lampooned 176 pretty horrible
films with some of the best-written sarcasm anywhere on TV.
</P>
<P>
   It is our good fortune that host Mike Nelson and his sidekicks,
Crow T. Robot and Servo, will live on in rerun perpetuity. This
week's target: a 1967 film titled ``Danger: Diabolik.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC alters fall schedule
</P>
<P>
   The fall season is still more than a month away, but NBC is
already fiddling with its lineup. Buoyed by healthy summer ratings
for the freshman comedy ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' the network has changed
its Tuesday lineup, which originally had ``3rd Rock From the Sun''
at 8, the new ``Mike O'Malley Show'' at 8:30, ``Just Shoot Me'' at
9, ``Will &AMP; Grace'' at 9:30 and ``Dateline NBC'' at 10.
</P>
<P>
   Stronger shows always lead off the hour, so ``Just Shoot Me''
will move to 8 and ``Will &AMP; Grace'' to 9. ``3rd Rock'' gets the
8:30 slot and ``The Mike O'Malley Show'' will go to 9:30.
``Dateline'' stays put at 10.

SENATE CONFIRMS HOLBROOKE FOR U.N. POST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Iowa, Del., Conn., Texas, N.C.)  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted Thursday to confirm Richard
Holbrooke as chief American delegate to the United Nations, ending
a 14-month nomination battle that left the Clinton administration
without a high-profile representative to the United Nations during
military conflicts in the Balkans and the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved Holbrooke, the former American ambassador to
Germany and the architect of the 1995 peace agreement in Bosnia, on
a vote of 81-16.
</P>
<P>
   No Democrats opposed the nomination. Among the senators voting
against confirmation _ 15 Republicans and one independent _ was the
majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lott, who in the past had questioned Holbrooke's
fitness for the U.N. post, said that the senator `'was too
concerned with the apparent ethical lapses of this nominee to give
him his vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke was the subject of a pair of federal ethics
investigations over the last year, one of which ended with his
paying $5,000 to the Justice Department to settle civil charges
that he had violated federal lobbying laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration hopes that Holbrooke will inject a
new sense of American leadership at the United Nations and that he
can repair some of the damage done in recent years to the
relationship between the United States and the world organization.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship has frayed as a result of the administration's
failure to persuade Republican leaders in Congress to pay more than
$1 billion in back dues to the United Nations, and because of a
perception among senior U.N. officials that the administration sees
the organization as a backwater, with diminishing importance to
American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   That perception worsened as Holbrooke's nomination languished
month after month, leaving the United States without a permanent
representative to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials also were dismayed at the administration for
cutting the United Nations out of the decision-making as waves of
NATO warplanes devastated Yugoslavia. They also felt slighted
during last December's American-led military strikes against Iraq,
set off by Baghdad's decision to expel international weapons
inspectors, suggesting the strikes were conducted without explicit
U.N. approval.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials believe that Holbrooke _ whose friends
routinely describe him both as the most talented American diplomat
of his generation and as a Machiavellian bully of unparalleled
ambition _ may be able to find a way to get the back dues paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has worked on occasion with Milosevic might work with
Capitol Hill,'' said a senior administration official, referring to
Holbrooke's intense negotiations over the years with President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   When he moves into his office suite at the U.S. mission, across
First Avenue from the U.N. headquarters in New York, Holbrooke will
find himself confronted almost immediately with the problems of
rebuilding Kosovo, an issue he knows well from his long service as
a diplomatic troubleshooter in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has been given the task of administering
Kosovo in the aftermath of the NATO-led military assault that
forced the Yugoslav military out of the province, a peacekeeping
operation that is among the most complex and expensive ever
undertaken by an organization that is already strained for money
and resources.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be left to Holbrooke to defend American interests
on a range of other foreign policy disputes involving the United
Nations, notably with Iraq, which has found important foreign
allies in its effort to have economic sanctions lifted despite
Washington's objections.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Thursday was made possible when the last of four
Republicans to invoke senatorial privilege to block the nomination
announced earlier this week that he would allow the vote to take
place.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker, Charles Grassley of Iowa, had delayed the vote
over a State Department personnel issue unrelated to Holbrooke.
Grassley voted Thursday in favor of confirming Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   The president announced in June of last year that he intended to
nominate Holbrooke for the U.N. job, replacing Bill Richardson, who
became energy secretary.
</P>
<P>
   But the nomination was plagued by delays _ first as a result of
federal ethics investigations of Holbrooke, then as a result of
procedural maneuvers in the Senate unrelated to Holbrooke's
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the administration are waiting eagerly to see what sort
of relationship develops in the Cabinet between Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Holbrooke, who was runner-up in the race to
become secretary of state during President Clinton's second term.
Holbrooke, 58, is close to Vice President Al Gore and is seen as
likely to lead the State Department in a Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   Although Holbrooke will technically answer to Albright in his
U.N. post, many who know the hard-charging veteran diplomat well
believe he will not fit comfortably into the role of her
subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   Albright released a statement Thursday welcoming the
appointment. ``I feel certain that Ambassador Holbrooke will serve
the American people well at the U.N,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In his own statement, Holbrooke, who was reported Thursday to be
on his way to Alaska for the start of a two-week vacation, said
that he was ``deeply gratified'' by the confirmation vote.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While members of Congress might have questioned Holbrooke's role
in policy-making in the Balkans or his larger philosophy of
statecraft, they did not dispute that his resume is one of the most
impressive of any member of the Foreign Service since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the State Department shortly after graduating from
Brown University in 1962. He rose quickly up the department's ranks
after his first foreign posting as a junior diplomat at the U.S.
Embassy in Saigon, South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1968, he was sent to Paris as a junior member of the
American delegation led by W. Averell Harriman to embark on the
Vietnam peace talks. In the 1970s, he left government to edit
Foreign Policy magazine but rejoined the State Department in 1977,
while still his his 30s, as assistant secretary of state for Asian
and Pacific Affairs in the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who has long been allied with the Democratic Party,
left government again with the election of President Reagan and
went to Wall Street as an investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   He remained in New York until the 1992 election of Clinton, who
named Holbrooke ambassador to Germany and then assistant secretary
of state for European and Canadian Affairs. It was as assistant
secretary that Holbrooke oversaw the arduous negotiations that led
to the Dayton peace agreement in 1995, ending the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   During a 35-minute debate before the Senate vote, Sen. Joseph
Biden of Delaware, ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations
Committee, said that he knew of no nominee to a foreign policy post
``more qualified for the job for which was nominated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said that Holbrooke is ``one of
America's great natural resources'' and a man of ``enormous energy
and talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, was the only senator to
speak against the nomination during the debate. She called
Holbrooke a ``principled man'' and said she admired ``his
dedication, his tenacity.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said that Holbrooke, long the Clinton administration's
chief diplomatic troubleshooter in the Balkans, was responsible for
a policy in the region that had failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe our policy in the Balkans is to force factions to
live together in an American model when the circumstances are
different from anything we have ever had in our country,'' she
said. ``I cannot in good conscience vote for someone who has taken
our country in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the powerful Republican chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   His staff said that Helms was notified of the vote only a few
minutes before the roll call began and could not get back to the
Senate chamber in time. A spokesman had no comment when asked how
the senator, who supported the nomination when it came before the
committee, would have voted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The larger of the federal ethics investigations of Holbrooke
began only days after Clinton announced his intention to nominate
Holbrooke to the U.N. post, when an anonymous letter arrived at the
offices of the State Department's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The letter questioned whether Holbrooke, who is now an
investment banker in New York at the firm of Credit Suisse First
Boston, had done favors for the firm even before resigning from the
State Department in 1996 as assistant secretary of state for
European affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation ended in February, when Holbrooke agreed to
pay $5,000 to the Justice Department to settle civil charges that
he had violated federal lobbying laws in his contacts with the U.S.
Embassy in South Korea shortly after his resignation to join Credit
Suisse.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke denied any wrongdoing in his contacts with the
embassy, which included a request that the American ambassador in
Seoul set up a meeting for him with South Korea's president.

ANALYSIS: UNKNOWN RISKS LOOM AS PARTIES SPLIT SHARPLY ON TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM CLYMER  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Are the Republicans, or perhaps the Democrats,
driving off a political cliff on the $792 billion tax cut adopted
by Congress on Thursday?
</P>
<P>
   Almost all Republicans in Congress and their presidential
candidates favor it. Almost all Democrats and President Clinton are
against it, and there is an election next year.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely have both parties sounded so contradictorily confident
about the political benefits they think their policies, which they
insist have been decided on principle alone, will bring. With each
side sated with polling data and focus-group results, the conflict
suggests that at least one side is taking a big chance on the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the polling data are not that clear. People think their
taxes are too high, but are not very excited about it.
</P>
<P>
   That offers room for ideology. And, in fact, most Republicans,
though probably not the 98.2 percent represented by the 216-4
Republican vote in the House, believe in cutting taxes and federal
spending. Similarly, most Democrats, though not the 97.6 percent
their 201-5 negative vote represents, worry that big tax cuts could
starve the government of revenue they think it needs to spend.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would cut all five income tax rates by one percentage
point, lower capital gains rates and eliminate taxes on estates.
The Senate's 50-49 approval vote Thursday night, following House
approval by a vote of 221-206 (one independent voted no), completed
congressional action. But the bill will not be sent to Clinton for
the veto he promised again Thursday night until September, when
Congress will be back from vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's votes, especially in view of the expected veto, have
almost nothing to do with national politics. As veteran Republican
pollster Robert Teeter observed Thursday, ``What's happened is they
have both lost sight of the fact that most American politics is
decided in the middle.'' Instead, he said, ``what they are both
doing is playing base politics,'' appealing to their more
ideological, most reliable voters.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as many as 400 of the 435 House members are in safe
seats, where they do not have to worry about swing voters. In the
Senate, some Republican moderates represent swing states, and
Thursday night four defected, but the Republican leaders not only
come from safe seats, but most of them served in the House and
reflect its way of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   But why should Republican presidential candidates have a similar
perspective when the White House is not a safe seat for anyone? On
Thursday, Texas Gov. George W. Bush's spokesman, Scott McClelland,
said Bush ``commends'' the effort to cut taxes, and believed that
``the money should be sent back to the people who earned it: the
taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Buchanan even complained, ``The Republican tax plan has
been delayed too long in implementation and it is too modest.''
But, he said, the ``Republicans are on the right side of this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the candidates' situation is similar to that of their
congressional allies. None of them is yet running for president,
after all. What they are running for is the Republican nomination
for president, and the voters who make that decision are among the
most conservative Republicans around.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side gives the other much credit for intellectual
honesty. Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said the Republicans were not
passing a tax bill but ``a political press release'' that they knew
would be vetoed. Then, he said, they could go to small-business
leaders or their favorite lobbyists and say that they had tried to
help but that Clinton had stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   He said Democrats, while they would like to be for tax cuts,
too, knew from the 1981 tax cut that serious deficits hurt the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., who heads the Rules Committee, said
he thought the Republicans were showing courage in cutting taxes
when polls did not indicate the public strongly favored the action.
Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., said Democrats' opposition to cuts
that might curb spending was so intense that they would spend
August telling lies about the bill.
</P>
<P>
   If the pollsters did not provide clear policy directives for the
parties, it was clear that their focus groups had helped write
their scripts, as some words and phrases kept reverberating through
the serial speechmaking that passed for debate.
</P>
<P>
   The tax on large estates, which the bill would gradually
abolish, was repeatedly called a ``death tax'' by Republicans. The
increase of deductibility of business meals from the current 50
percent to 60 percent by 2007 was labeled by Democrats as
government sponsorship of the ``three-martini lunch,'' a bibulous
interlude too much for even the Senate on a slow day.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats, Rep. David Bonior of Michigan and Karen
McCarthy of Missouri, kept calling the bill ``risky.'' Rep. Rosa
DeLauro of Connecticut said it was an ``irresponsible special
interest tax giveaway.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, the message was that the money was the
people's, not the government's. ``It's their money, give it back,''
Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, said: ``The Democrats believe Washington knows how to
spend the people's money better than the people do. We disagree. We
think it belongs to the people who earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, 1999 is not forever. Even if the bill
dies this year, this Congress has another 18 months to go. In
September 2000, for example, if polls that really matter to
candidates suggest that a somewhat smaller tax cut would help
incumbents of both parties, compromise could materialize in a great
big hurry.

GONZALEZ TRADE TALK WAS JUST THAT ... TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's how these things get started: A coach from one team spots
an old friend who now scouts for another American League club. They
start throwing names around like baseball cards at a card show.
</P>
<P>
   The trading deadline is fast approaching so the two baseball men
start playing the ``Would-Ya Game.'' Would-ya trade so-and-so for
so-and-so?
</P>
<P>
   The two are basically just pulling each other's chains _ they're
certainly not authorized to make a deal, just feeling things out _
and the deadline slips by uneventfully for both clubs.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later someone whispers something to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The names he's hearing are big; big enough to raise the hack's
eyebrows. This, he thinks, could be a nice story. The source, he
knows, is a good one, someone who ought to know what's going on,
who's going where and when.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, Juan Gonzalez is back in the headlines and
on his way to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   That's what a story in the Detroit Free Press _ and bantered
about on local talk radio _ strongly implied yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sources say talks of more than a preliminary nature already
have begun between the teams about a Gonzalez trade,'' the story
said. ``A deal couldn't get completed before the July 31 trading
deadline, but it has a realistic chance of happening this
off-season _ especially if the Rangers make another early playoff
exit.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad nobody bothered to let the teams' general managers _ the
Rangers' Melvin and the Tigers' Randy Smith _ in on the secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't spoken to Randy Smith since about a month before the
trading deadline,'' Melvin said yesterday from Port Charlotte, Fla.
``The last \RGMs\S I talked to on that \Rdeadline\S Saturday were
Frank Wren \Rin Baltimore\S about Juan Guzman, Herk Robinson \Rin
Kansas City\S about \RKevin\S Appier and Bill Bavasi \Rin Anaheim\S
about \RChuck\S Finley. Then I called \Rowner\S Tom Hicks and told
him we wouldn't be making a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith echoed Melvin's statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about getting a face player, a name guy but Doug
and I haven't talked in over a month,'' Smith said. ``Coaches and
scouts trade players all the time. It's certainly nothing we have
ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make the story total fabrication. Far from it. The
same Gonzalez-to-Detroit rumors were floating around here earlier
in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers are looking for a middle-of-the-order hitter to get
fans excited about the beginning of the Comerica Park era next
season, and Gonzalez, who has only a year left on his Texas
contract, fits their profile perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, however, was, or is, imminent. You really think Melvin
is dumb enough to risk shaking up the chemistry on the hottest team
in baseball right now? You think he'd trade a two-time MVP, his
cleanup hitter, in the middle of a pennant race?
</P>
<P>
   Get real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy talked to me more than a month ago about the type of
player he's looking for, and obviously Juan's name came up,'' said
Melvin, who added that five other teams phoned to ask about
Gonzalez before the deadline. ``I think that all they do is try to
get a feeler out there for him. When it gets down to it, clubs
realize a deal can't be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like calling Atlanta to see if Greg Maddux might
be available. You pretty much know the answer before you ask the
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in this case, the Tigers had heard that Gonzalez was
having some trouble with manager Johnny Oates and might be more
available than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of the story, as I understand it, is that they'd
like to get a Gonzalez type, a \RJim\S Thome type, for the middle
of their lineup,'' Melvin said. ``\RThe media\S throw out names of
a lot of players but some of them have no-trade clauses to certain
teams, too, so it makes no sense to talk about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has a list of 10 teams he can't be traded to, and
Detroit may well be on the list. Still, that's often just a clause
with a certain monetary value. Stack the money high enough and it
goes away.
</P>
<P>
   Something could happen this off-season, depending on a number of
factors. Can the Rangers re-sign Gonzalez themselves? Juan has
already dispelled one concern, saying he's not switching agents to
join the hated and difficult Scott Boras. That's a positive sign.
Whatever others might think, he wants to stay in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Who would the Tigers give up? The package would start with
left-handed pitcher Justin Thompson, but he has struggled this
season. The Tigers would certainly throw in other players, like
outfielder Bobby Higginson, another disappointment, but the Rangers
likely wouldn't start paying much attention unless young outfielder
Juan Encarnacion's name was included, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even then they'd have to ask themselves: Does it all add up to
an MVP?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if you're seriously thinking of trading a Juan
Gonzalez, don't you owe it to yourself to shop him everywhere, just
to see what might get offered?
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, by the way, would also be interested in Rusty Greer,
Ruben Mateo and Lee Stevens. And who wouldn't?
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said he brought up the subject of trade rumors when he
met with Gonzalez in his office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to forget about those kinds of things, like the
Albert Belle and Mike Mussina stuff that came out while we were in
Baltimore,'' Melvin said. ``You can't worry about those things. I
don't think it will affect him or the club any.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trading deadline's past. I don't think this is anything
he's going to get bothered by.''
</P>
<P>
   This story, I have a hunch, was just two old baseball friends,
passing each other in the night.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they laid the groundwork for a blockbuster deal this
winter. More likely, unless they're about to get some heavy-duty
promotions, they just swapped air.

RENO AGREES TO DISCUSS IMMIGRANT OVERSIGHTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno agreed Thursday to meet
with a Texas lawmaker about the Justice Department's failure to
provide information on illegal immigrants with criminal records who
commit more crimes after they are released from custody.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the information sought by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas,
does not exist and would have to be created from individual files
kept in separate computers by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``To run the (INS) records check through the FBI would take
months,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's inquiry, driven by the release of two illegal immigrants
suspected in subsequent Houston killings, resulted in a party-line
vote Wednesday by the House immigration subcommittee, chaired by
Smith,to subpoena the attorney general, and demand that she provide
the information within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee's action was spurred by the case of Angel
Maturino Resendiz, who was wanted in two slayings when INS agents
apprehended him entering the U.S. illegally and sent him back to
Mexico. He later surrendered to U.S. authorities and has been
charged in four killings _ including the death of Houston teacher
Noemi Dominguez _ that occurred after he was released by INS.
</P>
<P>
   Also fueling the committee's decision were reports that
Colombian national Guillermo Castillo _ accused in the August 1998
beating death of Joel Gerhart _ was apprehended a month later at
the Texas-Mexico border by INS agents who three days later flew him
back to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the INS has records about the 26,870 criminal
immigrants who are sent back to their home countries and the FBI
has records on some but not all felony convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we do not have a connection, a ready documentary
connection, between those that were released (by INS) and whatever
subsequent criminal history they may have,'' the attorney general
said.

 &HT;    Calloway injury may force moves
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ A Falcons team already thin at wide receiver
got thinner Thursday afternoon when starter Chris Calloway sprained
his left ankle and had to be carted off the field.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known much of training camp he'll miss, but he won't
practice this morning, and won't participate in Saturday's joint
practices with the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   He will be re-evaluated today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some swelling, and that's not good,'' coach Dan Reeves
said. ``He probably won't be ready for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Harris, who has eight regular-season catches in a
six-year career with New England, Seattle and Atlanta, will move
into Calloway's split end spot.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway went down as cornerback Ray Buchanan crashed into him
from behind while attempting to break up a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``My foot kind of bent all the way back, and somebody landed on
it,'' said Calloway, who was sporting crutches at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway was cut by the Giants despite leading the team in
receptions for the fourth straight year, with 62. The 5-foot-10,
188-pounder has caught 359 passes in nine NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons pursued Calloway with the idea for him to work
primarily out of the slot, with Terance Mathis and Tony Martin
working outside as starters.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin, who led the Falcons last year with 66 receptions and
1,181 yards, was waived after he refused to allow the Falcons to
postpone payment of a $400,000 March 1 roster bonus.
</P>
<P>
   That made Calloway a starter.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-11, 188-pound Harris has above-average speed. His NFL
claim to fame was the 29-yard reception he made on the Falcons'
tying drive at the end of the NFC championship game at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any opportunity is a good opportunity, but you don't like to
see a teammate get hurt,'' Harris said. ``On most teams, the
weakside receiver, which is the (split end), tends to have deeper
routes. There's more blocking at the wing (where Mathis starts).''
</P>
<P>
   If Calloway is out any length of time, ``Tim (Dwight) has been
(a reserve) on the other side,'' Reeves said. ``Now, we may make
some moves.

 COBAIN FILM DOESN'T PAINT PRETTY PICTURE OF COURTNEY LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorists, unite. Or at least find somebody who gets
Cinemax premium cable so you can sit for a couple of hours in front
of Nick Broomfield's controversial documentary, ``Kurt &AMP;
Courtney.''
</P>
<P>
   It airs Friday night as part of Cinemax's ``Reel Life'' series,
raising once again the question of whether Cobain's death was a
suicide or something else. Seattle Post-Intelligencer rock critic
Gene Stout reviewed the film last year during its theatrical
release. Here's his take: ``Nick Broomfield's documentary on rocker
Kurt Cobain and his widow, Courtney Love, takes the viewer through
a bewildering parade of interviews with the couple's family members
and friends. It provides a luridly entertaining portrait of Love _
who kept the film from being shown at Sundance _ as ruthless,
scheming, manipulative, even murderous. But it also portrays Cobain
as a lovable but troubled man whose suicide was not implausible.''

   Farewell to `MST3K'

   Fans of ``Mystery Science Theater 3000'' will be gathering for
entirely different reasons this weekend. Sunday's installment on
Sci-Fi Channel (6 and 8 p.m.) will be the last original broadcast

films with some of the best-written sarcasm anywhere on TV.
</P>

   NBC alters fall schedule
</P>
<P>
   The fall season is still more than a month away, but NBC is
already fiddling with its lineup. Buoyed by healthy summer ratings
for the freshman comedy ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' the network has changed
its Tuesday lineup, which originally had ``3rd Rock From the Sun''
at 8, the new ``Mike O'Malley Show'' at 8:30, ``Just Shoot Me'' at
9, ``Will &AMP; Grace'' at 9:30 and ``Dateline NBC'' at 10.
</P>
<P>
   Stronger shows always lead off the hour, so ``Just Shoot Me''
will move to 8 and ``Will &AMP; Grace'' to 9. ``3rd Rock'' gets the
8:30 slot and ``The Mike O'Malley Show'' will go to 9:30.
``Dateline'' stays put at 10.

GROUP OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS REACH ACCORD WITH DEMOCRATS ON HEALTH
CARE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of dissident Republicans reached agreement
with House Democrats Thursday on a comprehensive bill to regulate
the managed health care industry and predicted they would have
enough support to force the Republican leadership to bring their
measure to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which would cover all 161 million Americans with
private health insurance and give them expanded rights to sue
insurance companies, was hastily made public by a bipartisan group
of House members late Thursday afternoon, as they scrambled to
introduce it and get the edge on the potent health issue before
Congress left for its August recess.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., who negotiated the measure with
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said he simply did not think that the
Republican leadership, which favors a more limited approach, was
assembling a measure that could meet with President Clinton's
approval and become law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a law on the books that will protect patients,'' said
Norwood, who practiced dentistry for more than 20 years and is
usually a staunch conservative. ``Not a bill that protects
politicians at the November ballot box. And this in my opinion is
the only bill that can accomplish the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had vowed to veto the Senate's version of managed
care legislation, quickly endorsed the proposed measure and called
on House Speaker Dennis Hastert to schedule a vote as soon as
Congress returns in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's action proves that patient protections need not and
should not be a partisan issue,'' he said. ``It is time to do what
this bipartisan coalition has done _ put the well-being of patients
before politics and special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all House Democrats were expected to coalesce around
the bill. Their support, together with the nine Republicans listed
as cosponsors, would provide enough votes to insure passage.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's spokesman, John Feehery, said the House would address
the health care issue in the fall, but declined to specify what
legislation would be brought to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Of the bipartisan legislation he said: ``What about the
uninsured? They don't address that issue at all.'' He said the
speaker had been looking at an array of tax incentives to include
in a Republican leadership measure to help the 43 million people
without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon after meeting with the speaker, several of
his senior lieutenants on health issues met with business and
industry officials opposed to the bipartisan approach. Rep. John
Boehner, R-Ohio, who has been working with the speaker said the
lawmakers had urged business groups to tell employees that the
bipartisan bill would ``increase costs and end up with less
affordability which is going to create more uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   Several industry groups immediately denounced the bipartisan
legslation on just those grounds, saying that cost would rise
because the measure would expand the right of patients to sue
health care plans in state courts for their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is built on the erroneous premise _ rejected
this year alone in 24 states _ that trial lawyers are the sole
guardians of good medical care,'' said Karen Ignagni, the president
of the American Association of Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders have been searching for an approach to
regulating managed care since Senate Republicans earlier this month
approved a bill that would provided some protections for patients
but complied with their party's desire for only limited regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Senate bills guarantees would apply only to the 48
million people whose employers provide the kind of self-insured
health plans that are not regulated by the states. Such people are
rarely in health maintenance organizations and do not often face
the kind of ``gatekeeper'' arrangement that has led to many
consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans had been struggling for a broader bill that
applied to all 161 million Americans with private health insurance,
some dissident Republicans, led by Norward and Rep. Greg Ganske of
Iowa, who is a surgeon, accused their leaders of bowing to the
insurance industry and began negotiating with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The measure they agreed to on Thursday would include an array of
protections for Americans with private health insurance _
guaranteeing that patients would be covered for emergency room care
outside their health network, giving women direct access to
obstetricians and gynecologists and children to pediatricians. The
bill would require that health plans have a process in place for
guaranteeing that people have access to clinical trials, if that is
the only treatment for their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In cases in which a health plan has denied a patient a course of
care, the legislation would give individuals the right to go to an
external appeals panel made up of independent doctors to resolve
disputes. They would make their judgment based on generally
accepted medical practice, not on the insurance plan's definitions
of what is medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also give patients the right to sue a health plan
in state courts. However, the measure provides that if a health
plan complies with a decision of an external review panel, it can
be sued for compensatory damages but not punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the health care debate are expected to use the
August recess to press their point with the public. Norwood had
seven Republicans at his side and named two more Republican
co-sponsors. If Democrats, as expected, unite behind the bill, that
would be enough votes to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   The dissident Republicans backing the bill proposed on Thursday
ran the gamut from moderates like Reps. Marge Roukema of New Jersey
and Amo Houghton of New York to conservatives like Reps. Lindsey
Graham of South Carolina and Bob Barr of Georgia. And Norwood and
Ganske predicted many more Republicans would join them.

 &HT;    Martin gains despite pain
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Martin Martin limps to the garage area at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 40, is NASCAR's tough guy this summer. His left leg is
wrapped in a brace, while the left wrist is covered by a small pad.
With every hobbling step, Martin's facial expression never changes.
With every hobbling step, it It displays his famous focus and
intensity, with no sign revealing signs of the apparent pain.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford No. 6 driver makes it to his destination slowly but
without breaking stride. As others have seen this season, most
notably in the last three Winston Cup races, Martin never lets pain
get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Despite suffering extensive injuries during a practice-session
wreck at Daytona on July 2, Martin has not missed any time on the
track. He even raced the next day at the Pepsi 400 after learning
that he had torn knee ligaments and broken several bones.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who has driven in NASCAR's major-league series since
1981, provides a candid answer about his tolerance of pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, (my tolerance) could be confused with stupidity; I'm
not that smart,'' Martin said. ``What hurts one man is just an
irritation to another. People are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have a race team that has dedicated their lives to the
effort and have sponsors who have dedicated their budgets. I'm
going to drive the car and do a good job. I don't care if I have
broken bones or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Martin continued to stay behind the wheel, he also
has been able to stay around the top of the Winston Cup points
standings. In the three races after the Daytona crash, Martin has
moved from third in the standings to second. He trails leader Dale
Jarrett by 254 points entering Saturday's Brickyard 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the marks of a true professional in any sport,'' team
owner Jack Roush said, ``is for the person to be able to give it
their best, regardless of pain and days when they don't feel well _
and Mark is the best example of that I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Driver Jeff Burton said,``Mark has shown how tough he is from
what we've seen in the last month. There are a lot of people who
drive hurt. Some people can do it with success and some people
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin refused to surrender his seat to Matt Kenseth at Daytona
and drove his car to 17th place. The ensuing race schedule assisted
Martin in the healing process. He finished sixth at New Hampshire
and third at Pocono, with a week off in between.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the races, Martin was lifted in and out of the car by
crew members. Other drivers can't help but notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``(What Mark) has done in the last few weeks is really
unbelievable,'' Jarrett said. ``I've been there; I've had a broken
bone in my knee and some cracked ribs, similar to Mark's but not to
his extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do except dig down a little deeper and
that's what Mark has done,'' Jarrett said. ``It's been tremendous
to watch him. You wouldn't expect anything less from him, but,
still, it's pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Martin's victory over pain should be no surprise. Roush
recalled a story from Martin's teenage years when he broke both
feet and later competed in a race with a pair of foot casts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's tolerance for pain, I'm sure, is unsurpassed,'' Roush
said. ``I'm proud of him for making this effort. Knowing him the
way I do, this is what I expected.

 &HT;    Tearful day for Waltrip
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Darrell Waltrip's retirement announcement at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway had been planned for at least two
months, but the advance notice didn't make things any easier for
the legendary NASCAR driver Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, who said the 2000 season will be his last behind the
wheel, choked up with emotion several times during the news
conference. At one point, with tears strolling down his face,
Waltrip motioned for his wife, Stevie, to stand by his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be leaving a sport that has meant so much to me and my
family _ the business side I can talk about,'' Waltrip said. ``The
racing side, leaving the sport, hanging up my helmet _ that's hard
to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Waltrip regained his composure, the confidence and swagger
of the relentless competitor nicknamed ``Jaws'' reappeared quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into this sport in 1972, and I've been a headliner ever
since,'' Waltrip said. ``I always like to say that when I'd go to a
town, people would say, 'Are you here with the show?' And I'd say,
'No, I am the show.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kmart Racing, Waltrip's primary sponsor, and owner Haas/Carter
Motorsports will team up with the veteran driver for a season-long
commemoration next year referred to as ``Victory Tour 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole goal for the next 18 months is to win a race _ more
than one, but at least one,'' said Waltrip, who last won in 1992.
``Winning a race now would be as big as winning that first one in
1975.''
</P>
<P>
   Clean-shaven icon
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt, one of Waltrip's peers, is attracting tons of
attention this week, but it has nothing to do with any retirement
plans. ``The Intimidator'' shaved off his trademark mustache for
the first time in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was down in the Bahamas last weekend, snorkeling,'' he said.
``I couldn't get a tight seal on my mask because my mustache was in
the way. So I shaved it off.''
</P>
<P>
   As simple as that, Earnhardt is without the bushy lip for the
first time since 1982. He insisted that the new look won't affect
his racing skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did up here,'' _ he pointed to his face _ ``won't
affect what I do out there,'' Earnhardt said, pointing to the
track. ``It didn't in '82, anyway. We still won races.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Saturday's Brickyard 400, Earnhardt is
participating in tonight's International Race of Champions (IROC)
series. He won each of the first three races and could become the
first to sweep all four since the series started in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Just do it
</P>
<P>
   Nike made its grand entrance into the NASCAR world on Wednesday.
Winston Cup drivers Dale Jarrett, Bobby Labonte and Tony Stewart
will wear footwear specifically designed by the shoe company to
handle the rigors of auto racing. ... Ford unveiled its latest race
car, nicknamed ``Taurus 2K,'' which will debut at February's
Daytona 500. The car features new designs for the hood, rear window
and front and rear fascias.

 &HT;    Gordon rolls to third pole in six years at Indy
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Perhaps Jeff Gordon had the wrong Indiana street
named after him this week.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who captured the pole on Thursday for the Brickyard 400,
was honored the day before by his hometown of Pittsboro, Ind. The
town, 10 miles west of Indianapolis, renamed a road after the
three-time Winston Cup champion.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Gordon's streak of domination at Indianapolis Motor
Speedway _ including a track-record qualifying speed of 179.612 mph
_ the dedication maybe should've taken place at racing's famous
oval track.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin, who had the second-fastest time, will also be on
the front row for Saturday's race. David Green, third-fastest,
earned his best starting position since Rockingham last year.
Rounding out the top qualifiers are Winston Cup points leader Dale
Jarrett at fourth and Michael Waltrip at fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has flourished since NASCAR began racing at IMS in 1994.
He is the Brickyard 400's only two-time champion, winning the
inaugural event and taking the checkered flag again last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you win at Indy, it's a big deal,'' Gordon said. ``To
me, winning that first Brickyard was like living through a fantasy,
like you're really not sure if you're sleeping and dreaming or it's
really happening. Nothing will ever compare to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who is sixth in the points standings, established the
new qualifying mark despite minor control problems. The No. 24
Chevy slipped in turn 1, but Gordon held on to break the record of
179.394 mph set by Ernie Irvan last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had a good car today, that we ran well and had a shot
at the pole,'' Gordon said. ``When I ran the lap, it wasn't my best
lap. We're dealing with the best race-car drivers in the world ...
(but) maybe they were fighting the same things I was fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in six years that Gordon has won the No. 1
position at Indianapolis. Ironically, Gordon's pair of victories at
the track came after he started at the No. 3 position.
</P>
<P>
   After qualifying ended, Martin and Rusty Wallace were involved
in a freak wreck during the evening practice. Wallace was driving
from the garage area to the track, with Martin going in the
opposite direction, when the two had a minor collision at the track
entrance. Each car suffered slight damage, but both drivers were
unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't Mark's fault, it's wasn't my fault,'' Wallace said.
He put the blame on track officials directing traffic in and out of
the garage.

TALKING UP TELECOMMUTING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8)
</HEADLINE>
 (af) 
By MICHELLE COTTLE  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)You're a manager at a midsized company. Some of your
employees have approached you about the possibility of working from
home one or two days a week. You see no obvious reason to say no,
but wonder how to broach the subject with upper management, which
tends to have a stubbornly old-school attitude about work
schedules. How can you sell them on the idea?(end italcs) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To convince skeptical superiors to allow telecommuting, a
manager needs to show how it can benefit the company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, you have to prepare a business plan like with any
other initiative,'' said Gail Martin, executive director of the
International Telework Association and Council, a nonprofit group
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Managers should arm themselves with examples of how
telecommuting arrangements can improve productivity and reduce
costs, agreed John Birstler, the executive in charge of the
telework program at Merrill Lynch, where about 2,500 employees
participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to think about what strategy or business objective
you can point the program toward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin agreed that telecommuting should be pursued as a way
to solve problems. Do employees spend too much time commuting by
car? Are they coming in late and stressed out? Telecommuting could
ease the strain.
</P>
<P>
   And is the company having trouble recruiting and training
people? ``We're all competing for the same workers,'' she noted,
``so a telework program could prove a helpful recruiting tool,
especially for younger folks, because they're comfortable with the
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to emphasizing the positives, be prepared to soothe
worries about potential negatives. ``You need to convince senior
managers that it is not anarchy,'' Birstler said. ``It's not
undisciplined. It's not unregulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Make clear to employees and managers that telecommuting is not
an alternative to finding outside child care, both experts
emphasized. If you have young children at home during the workday,
Ms. Martin said, you need to arrange for the same type of care as
if you were in the office.
</P>
<P>
   Birstler noted that Merrill Lynch requires its telecommuters
with dependents to provide documentation of these arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Managers and employees will need to define objectives and ways
to measure telecommuting's success, he said. ``Get down to the
nitty-gritty,'' he urged, by defining work hours and how often
employees must come into the office.
</P>
<P>
   Rules and memos can help clarify expectations. Merrill Lynch,
Birstler said, has chosen a highly structured program: Employees
apply formally for telecommuting, undergo training and participate
in regular follow-ups like focus groups and surveys.
</P>
<P>
   All this may be more trouble than employees thought they were
bargaining for. But if they are serious about winning the freedom
to work from home, they should be willing to jump through a few
hoops. &QL;

 DeLAY: IT WAS THE REPUBLICANS' PLAN TO SPEND NEXT YEAR'S SURPLUS(rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tom DeLay, the House majority whip and conservative
field marshal, said Thursday that Republicans would spend next
year's anticipated $14 billion budget surplus _ and had intended to
do so all year long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to spend it, and then some,'' he said. ``From the
get-go, the strategy has always been we're going to spend what's
left.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, DeLay said, was for Republicans to drain all of the
surplus out of next year's budget and force President Clinton to
pay for any of his additional spending requests out of the Social
Security surplus, which both parties have pledged to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no money left,'' he said. ``The only way he can get
all that spending is to spend the Social Security surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican strategy, DeLay said, will force Clinton to sign
their spending bills _ which, except from the defense budget, have
been cut by roughly $26 billion from this year's levels _ or break
his pledge to keep his hands off Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president wants to spend the Social Security surplus,
he's going to have to go to the American people and convince them
that's important,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's comments, made in an interview in his office, were the
first explanation of such a plan to come from the House Republican
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks came as a surprise to some senior members of the
House Appropriations Committee, which is in charge of the spending
bills that finance the government. But none of those members would
publicly criticize or question DeLay or his strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The spending described by DeLay would turn the projected surplus
into a deficit. He said the first federal budget surplus in 30
years was almost certainly going to disappear as a consequence of
the Senate's passage on Wednesday of a $7.4 billion emergency aid
package for farmers. The House will have a similar bill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that even if the spending swallowed up the budget
surplus, the Republicans had a plan to use various budgetary
mechanisms that would allow them to say they had stuck to the
strict spending caps they imposed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do everything we can to hold on to the caps,''
he said. ``But what's more important to us is not spending a dime
of the Social Security surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation that DeLay anticipates has high stakes. The
fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, and Clinton has indicated that he
will veto some of the spending bills because of the deep cuts
imposed by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   If the argument over spending is not reconciled by Sept. 30,
Congress must pass a continuing resolution to allow federal
agencies to spend money, or shut down the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have had two showdowns like this with Clinton
since taking control of Congress in the 1994 elections. Each time,
the Republicans have lost. In October 1995, Clinton embarrassed
Republicans by forcing them into a politically disastrous
government shutdown. And last October, he outmaneuvered them again.
Congress crammed $21 billion in ``emergency'' spending into a
last-minute bill, mostly for programs the president favored.
</P>
<P>
   Not this year, DeLay vowed. ``We will negotiate with the
president, after he vetoes the bills, on his knees,'' he said. Bill
by bill, he said, ``we will try to resist every one of his spending
proposals.'' And he indicated that if the spending caps were
lifted, that was acceptable ``as long as the American people
understand it's the president busting the caps, not us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard for the president to explain to the American
people that he's shut down the government because he wants more
spending than last year,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay spoke as Congress, staggering toward an August recess,
struggled to pass two more spending bills. The Senate, after days
of negotiations over amendments favoring the oil, gas and mining
industries that were attached to the $14.1 billion Interior
Department spending bill, gave up work Thursday night. The House
prepared to pass a $37.7 billion bill financing the Commerce, State
and Justice Departments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has vowed to veto both over spending cuts and policy
issues.
</P>
<P>
   With 18 working days left before Sept. 30, only one of the 13
spending bills financing the government is ready for Clinton's
signature. The House has passed 11 of the bills, and the Senate
nine, but a House-Senate conference must smooth out differences
before the bills can be sent to the White House.

   Finding an Early End To Mortgage Insurance &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For consumers who have railed against private mortgage
insurance, a recent hard-won triumph may be even sweeter than they
thought.
</P>
<P>
   The Homeowners Protection Act, which took effect on July 29,
gives people obtaining mortgages the right to request cancellation
of the insurance when their equity reaches 20 percent. At 22
percent, the insurance is to be canceled automatically. The
insurance, intended to protect a lender against default, typically
costs $25 to $80 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some proponents of tougher legislation were not satisfied,
noting that the law does not require increases in a home's value to
be included in the 20 percent equity plateau, makes an exception
for undefined ``high-risk'' loans and excludes existing loans.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a case in which an industry is going beyond what's
required. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered
private companies that are the biggest sources of home financing,
will require that private mortgage insurance end for existing loans
halfway through the term of the mortgage; smaller lenders are
expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will allow borrowers who
want to drop the insurance at 20 percent equity to factor in
appreciation when making their case, and the lenders have decided
to forget about designating some mortgages as high risk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Hershey Jr. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's Easier by e-Mail &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You want a colleague to rewrite a report. Or you need to inform
your assistant that someone else is getting that promotion. If your
interest is in telling a co-worker the whole bitter truth, you may
want to do it by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In a study by Stephanie Watts Sussman, an assistant professor of
information systems at Case Western Reserve University, and Lee
Sproull, a professor of business at New York University, 117 Boston
University students were asked to give other students comments
about their resumes from the campus career center.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the student messengers reported positive
feedback faithfully. But when there were negatives, they tended to
soften them when speaking in person or by phone, distorting the
facts. In e-mail, the distortion was significantly less.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not focus on how recipients might feel about
getting bad news from the computer, rather than from a human voice.
The professors, however, say face-to-face delivery is always best.

   Brazilian model  &UR; Luciana Morad &LR; , 29, whose child was proven via
blood test last month to be the offspring of  &UR; Mick Jagger &LR; , told
the British magazine Hello! that the Rolling Stone is a ``loving
father.'' Jagger has yet to lay eyes on his 4-month-old son.
</P>
<P>

said Morad. ``He does not blame Lucas for being born. He is a very

cubicle to say hello.
</P>
<P>
   They talk a bit, then Gotti suggests that the boy might become a
lawyer. He'd rather be a professional athlete, the boy tells his
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a good basketball player or baseball player, first of
all, you got to be a good liar,'' says Gotti. ``A good lowlife and
an imbecile.'' The boy is seen to squirm in his chair. ``And you
got to take steroids,'' Gramps continues. ``You must take steroids,
and anybody who takes steroids is a garbage pail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine,'' says the boy, ``then I will be a crook.''
</P>

cross-dressing was the result of his father abandoning him and his

 &HT;    Thumbs up To Wally Dallenbach
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wally Dallenbach turned in his finest performance of
the NASCAR season at Pocono, less than a week after being told he
would not return next season as the driver of the No. 25 Chevy for
Hendrick Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-place finish at the Pennsylvania 500 was Dallenbach's
first top-five finish the season. It came right after a strong
showing in the previous race, seventh place at New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't drive any harder when I'm out of a job or with a
job,'' Dallenbach said. ``(The crew) work hard all year, and I know
what we had and what kind of team we have. I drive my guts out for
them every time we go racing. I don't need any motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To Jerry Nadeau, who will take over the No. 25 car for Hendrick
Motorsports next season. In his first race after learning the good
news, the rookie from Danbury, Conn., looked more like a bumper-car
driver than a stock-car driver.
</P>
<P>
   At Pocono, Nadeau's first victim was Bill Elliott, who was
running third at the time. As the two cars sped through turn 3,
Nadeau tapped the left rear of the No. 94 Ford and sent the car
spinning into the wall. (However, the rookie did make a public
apology to Elliott after the race).
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Wallace was hit by Nadaeu on lap 168 of 200, knocking both
drivers out of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau should've known it wasn't going to be his lucky weekend
after wrecking a car during pre-race practice.
</P>
<P>
   HOMETOWN FELLAS
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis native John Andretti returns home this week for the
Brickyard 400. The hometown hero ran among the leaders in last
year's race and finished seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everybody there, from (track president) Tony George to
the guys who sweep the garage,'' Andretti said. ``I know all of the
gate guards, mainly because I've tried to sneak past every one of
them at some point when I was a kid. We'd sneak into the garage,
they'd find us and throw us out. Then we'd sneak back in again.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they built the new garages, it became almost impossible
to sneak in.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that point, I had to become a driver, because it didn't
look like I was getting back into the garage any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin, another homegrown product, is giving the local fans
plenty of opportunities to watch him drive this week. Irwin, who
turned 30 today, participated in a USAC Silver Bullet Series race
on Wednesday. He'll run in tonight's Grand National race and then
will drive the No. 28 Ford for Robert Yates Racing on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, I get to stay at my mom and dad's house,''
Irwin said. ``My mom already knows my favorite dinner and is
working on it. I enjoy getting to see all my family and friends.
They'll all get to see me race while I'm here and will support me
at every race I'm in all week.''
</P>
<P>
   THEY SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any plans for the Sterling Marlin Museum but,
with an Indy trophy to go along with those Daytona 500 ones, maybe
we'd have to start thinking about one.''
</P>

WILLIE MORRIS LIES IN STATE IN MISSISSIPPI'S OLD CAPITOL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ The mourners said the same thing, over and
over. Willie Morris should have been here, to write about this.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, one of the most beloved writers of the modern South, lay
in state in the rotunda of the Old Capitol Thursday as hundreds of
people circled round and round, gazing at the closed dark-wood
coffin, covered in white flowers, before moving on to hug his wife,
JoAnne Prichard, her tired face drifting somewhere between a smile
and a sob.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie would have loved this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' said his 39-year-old son, David Rae Morris, ``he does.''
</P>
<P>
   A man who believed in ghosts, especially the Mississippi kind,
would certainly come back to hear what was being said about him,
old friends mused, many of them renowned writers who came to pay
their last respects and to tell one last story of hard drinking in
Manhattan, graveyard walks in Mississippi and the lovely words he
wrote about it all. That is why so many people here smiled, and
even laughed out loud, in his still presence.
</P>
<P>
   His ghost, they said, or his spirit, or _ this being
Mississippi, where people talk about God without feeling funny
about it _ his soul, will fly free every time someone cracks open
one of his books about home, about family, about cats and dogs and
about finding peace in all of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie liked the graveyard,'' said one longtime friend, David
Halberstam, who wrote about Vietnam for Harper's when Morris, in
self-imposed exile from Mississippi, was the magazine's editor in
chief, in the late 1960s and early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came from the South at a time when you had to leave the
South in order to find your voice,'' Halberstam said. ``This,'' he
said, looking around at the dignified Old Capitol and the line of
people moving through the door, ``may be the train that brings him
home.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been years since state government occupied the Old
Capitol, which is now essentially a museum. By unanimous decision
of the board of the state's Department of Archives and History,
which runs the place, Morris, who died in Jackson on Monday at the
age of 64, became the only writer ever to lie in state in its
rotunda, and only the third person in this century. (The others
were former Sen. John C. Stennis, who died in 1995, and former Gov.
J.P. Coleman, in 1991.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of Mississippi knows how to treat a writer,'' said
Pat Conroy, the best-selling author of ``Prince of Tides'' and
``The Great Santini,'' among other works.
</P>
<P>
   Morris was one of this state's best-known names, known for his
``North Toward Home'' _ an anthem for countless writers who have
turned toward New York as a validation of their craft, their worth
_ and for other works that painted a vivid picture of a man who
badly wanted to love a flawed, angry place, and ultimately did.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he reached the heights of literary society by becoming,
at the age of 32, the youngest editor in chief Harper's has ever
had. He led the magazine through a golden era, hiring some of the
best writers in the nation to examine civil rights, Vietnam and the
time's other issues. He was the talk of New York, and he loved it.
When he resigned in 1971, at war with management, almost the entire
staff quit with him.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials say it was not anything he accomplished in
New York that earned him the place here in this rotunda. Rather, it
was what he accomplished here, for Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw us overcome by all that bitterness, bigotry and rage,''
said William Winter, who was governor in the early 1980s and later
Morris' neighbor on a quiet Jackson street. From the 1960s on,
Morris wrote ``about civility, kindness and tolerance, as an
antidote,'' the former governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people who came to see him Thursday were writers he
had helped somehow along the way and perfect strangers who had read
his words and just wanted to say goodbye. One of them, a house
painter from Tuscaloosa, Ala., shook his head when asked why he had
come, and said, ``How could I not?''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam came to see an old friend. ``I think of his
sweetness,'' he said, ``of the little boy who lived too long and
too well.'' He remembers a Chinese restaurant with terrible food
where Morris insisted on eating in the New York days. Morris, he
said with a smile, liked the bar. The food did not much matter.
</P>
<P>
   After the event in the rotunda Thursday, Morris' coffin was
driven to his hometown, Yazoo City, about 35 miles to the north,
the setting for many of his stories.
</P>
<P>
   Among a crowd of some 800 people that filled the First United
Methodist Church there for a funeral service was Harriet DeCell
Kuykendall, who told the mourners that Willie had always been a
great storyteller, though not particularly good at math.
</P>
<P>
   ``I taught Willie algebra,'' she said. ``He said he liked me
better than algebra. And I knew that to be the gospel truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she read a passage from ``North Toward Home,'' in which
Morris talked about how much dignity there was in dying in a small
town, as against dying in a big one, and about the Yazoo City
graveyard where he liked to walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cemetery itself held no horror for me,'' he wrote. ``It
was set on a beautiful wooded hill overlooking the whole town. I
loved to walk among the graves and look at the dates and the words
on the tombstones. I learned more about the town's past here, the
migrations, the epidemics, the old forgotten tragedies, than I
could ever have learned in the library. Sometimes we would bring
our lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon his friends laid Willie Morris to rest in
that same cemetery. As a member of the marching band he had played
taps for the American Legion whenever a soldier was buried here,
and at the end of the graveside service two buglers played taps for
him.

SEC SAYS BEAR STEARNS SUBSIDIARY HAD CENTRAL ROLE IN FRAUD

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Securities and Exchange Commission charged
Thursday that a subsidiary of Bear Stearns Cos., Wall Street's
sixth-largest brokerage firm, was a major force behind a fraud that
led to millions of dollars in investor losses.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns settled the fraud charges with the commission and
the Manhattan district attorney without admitting or denying the
allegations, and agreed to pay $38.5 million in fines and
restitution. The commission also brought securities fraud charges
against Richard Harriton, the president of the subsidiary, who
resigned and plans to fight the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement ends a three-year investigation into Bear
Stearns' role handling securities trades for A.R. Baron, a small
New York brokerage firm that collapsed in 1996 and caused $75
million in investor losses.
</P>
<P>
   By holding Bear Stearns accountable in the Baron case, the SEC
makes clear that any firm, legal, accounting or financial, that
helps another commit a fraud must take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In its settlement, the commission described a pattern of
misconduct that is surprising for a firm of Bear Stearns' stature.
The SEC said that Bear Stearns took extraordinary steps to keep
A.R. Baron, an obviously troubled firm, in business. It knew that
Baron completed numerous trades that were unauthorized, yet the
larger firm took money from accounts to pay for the unauthorized
trades and refused to return the funds to the customers even after
Baron admitted as much.
</P>
<P>
   Although the $38.5 million that Bear has agreed to pay is
immaterial to the wealthy firm, the settlement will damage its
reputation among clients, creditors and competitors. Of that
amount, $5 million is a fine paid to the SEC, the sixth-largest
fine ever levied against a brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the investigation, Bear Stearns maintained that it
did nothing wrong. Bear Stearns said Thursday that the fraud
charges were merely technical in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, director of enforcement at the SEC, disagreed.
``Bear Stearns Securities Corp. is charged with causing a massive
fraud, a fraud that cost investors millions,'' Walker said. ``There
is nothing new in the proposition that those participating in a
fraud should be held accountable for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is by no means the end of the investigations into
Bear Stearns' activities as the Wall Street leader in clearing, the
business of processing securities trades for other smaller firms
and providing them with capital to operate. Federal prosecutors in
Brooklyn and Manhattan continue to examine Bear Stearns' clearing
relationships with two other small brokerage firms charged with
bilking investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in lower Manhattan Thursday, Robert
Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, said that his criminal
investigation into Harriton's conduct also remains active. In a
statement, Harriton's lawyer called the SEC civil complaint
baseless and said that his client would fight the charges.
</P>
<P>
   James Cayne, the chief executive officer of Bear Stearns who has
vigorously defended Harriton throughout the investigation, said:
``We are disappointed that Dick is leaving, but we understand that
his considerations as an individual are different than ours as a
corporation. We respect his decision.'' Asked if Bear Stearns is
paying Harriton's legal bills, a firm spokeswoman declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The details laid out in the SEC's 23-page cease and desist order
belie past claims by Bear Stearns' management that its powerful
clearing subsidiary had only a passive role, if any at all, in the
Baron fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the commission began imposing new rules for
clearing firms that require them to notify regulators of customer
complaints, rules intended to prevent such transgressions in the
future. Historically, clearing firms have argued that they simply
process trades and are therefore not responsible for policing
practices at the smaller brokerage firms they count as customers.
Those days are over. ``This case establishes that clearing firms
cannot simply turn a blind eye to fraud,'' Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC, Bear Stearns did that and more. Although
Bear Stearns was aware of excessive unauthorized trading in Baron
accounts, Walker said the firm helped keep A.R. Baron in business,
allowing it to defraud customers.
</P>
<P>
   The violations upon which the SEC order are based took place
from September 1995 through July 1996. The SEC alleges that many of
Bear Stearns' violations came as Harriton tried to protect the
company from large losses as a result of its clearing relationship
with the financially troubled A.R. Baron.
</P>
<P>
   It took only two months of transactions with A.R. Baron for Bear
Stearns employees to see signs of fraud in Baron's practices.
Almost immediately, Bear Stearns began taking steps to insulate
itself from the smaller firm's fraudulent activities. On Sept. 22,
Harriton required that all Baron's trades in customer accounts be
faxed to Bear Stearns; only those trades that the firm determined
would not increase its credit exposure to Baron were allowed. This
meant that many trades ordered by Baron's customers were not
completed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC, Bear Stearns not only disregarded the
instructions of Baron's customers, but repeatedly charged those
customers with trades that it knew were unauthorized. In one case,
involving a Baron customer Diaward Steel Works Ltd., Bear Stearns
took it upon itself to sell $1 million of the customers' securities
to cover trades that the clearing firm knew to be unauthorized and
that Diaward refused to pay for.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC, Bear Stearns also refused to return
securities and funds that it had taken to pay for unauthorized
trades to their rightful owners, even though Baron had told Bear
Stearns the trades were unauthorized. Bear Stearns also repeatedly
asked for credit extensions to cover Baron's unauthorized trades
and helped Baron to operate even when the firm's capital fell below
the amount required by regulators for it to be able to continue
conducting business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Harriton encouraged employees to discard documents
relating to A.R. Baron's operations, a violation of securities laws
that require firms to maintain such records.
</P>
<P>
   When HMA Investments Inc., a Baron customer, complained to Bear
Stearns about unauthorized trades in its account and provided Bear
Stearns with a letter from two Baron brokers admitting the trades
were unauthorized, Harriton refused to reverse the transactions. He
also froze accounts HMA held at another brokerage firm whose trades
Bear Stearns cleared. In January 1996, Harriton directed Bear
Stearns to liquidate HMA's accounts at the other brokerage firm and
credited Baron with the payment.
</P>
<P>
   Fiduciary Management Services Ltd., a private company based in
the Bahamas, lost $890,000 in the A.R. Baron fraud. Ian Barry, the
firm's investment manager, was vigilant about notifying Bear
Stearns when unauthorized trades showed up in its account. But Bear
Stearns simply referred him back to A.R. Baron.
</P>
<P>
   Barry initially felt confident that the problems would be
addressed. He said: ``I had a definite comfort level knowing Bear
Stearns was there. I feel I acted in accordance with the
requirements and I was let down.'' Fiduciary took its case to Lewis
Lowenfels, a prominent securities lawyer who was one of the first
to recognize that clearing firms were not completely insulated from
liability stemming from the behavior of their clearing firm
customers. When told of the settlement, Barry said: ``We hope that
this will finally bring our recovery efforts to a satisfactory
conclusion. We always felt that Bear Stearns bore certain
responsibilities in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In its charges against Harriton, the SEC alleges that Harriton
had a deal with Andrew Bressman, chairman of A.R. Baron, to profit
personally from initial public offerings underwritten by the firm.
Only the fact that Baron failed before the stock offering could be
completed prevented Harriton from making good on this arrangement,
which would have been outright securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   William McLucas, partner at Wilmer Cutler &AMP; Pickering in
Washington and a former director of enforcement at the SEC when the
case began, called the Bear Stearns settlement a warning flag to
others. ``It says to a clearing firm you cannot ignore clear and
unequivocal evidence of violations of the law and abuse of
customers by the introducing firm, and if you do, you do so at your
peril.''
</P>
<P>
   In settling with the SEC, Bear Stearns agreed to cease and
desist from committing or causing any such frauds in the future. It
also agreed to retain, within one month's time, an independent
consultant, to be appointed by the SEC, to conduct a review of the
firm's supervisory and compliance policies.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement announced Thursday, Bear Stearns
agreed to pay $1 million to the state of New York, $1 million to
the City of New York and $1.5 million to the district attorney's
office to cover the costs of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   That Bear Stearns was a direct cause of a significant securities
fraud is a black mark on the record of its chairman, Alan
Greenberg, and president, James Cayne, upon whose watch these
transgressions took place. The board of directors could be
vulnerable to charges that it was not attending to details as well.
</P>
<P>
   A clue to how a firm as big and well-known as Bear Stearns could
have been an integral part of such a fraud may lie in a promotional
piece Bear Stearns published celebrating its scrappy corporate
culture. Among the firm's self-avowed cultural mottoes is this one:
``Protect the Money Machine.''
</P>
<P>
   State securities regulators have already begun to look into
matters involving clearing firms. Joseph Borg, the Alabama
securities commissioner, said, ``I am concerned that the facts in
the order clearly point out that Bear Stearns knew of the problems
that were existing and rather than recognizing their civic
responsibility to the investing public, they apparently went the
other way.''

CONGRESS PASSES TAX CUT BILL, BUT A CLINTON VETO LOOMS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress gave its final approval Thursday to a
Republican plan that would lower the taxes of all Americans who pay
income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill stands no chance of becoming law, because President
Clinton has said he would veto it. But its merits and failings are
sure to be hashed out time and again between now and next year's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the measure early Thursday afternoon,
221-206, with all but four Republicans voting for the bill and all
but five Democrats voting against it.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate cleared the bill Thursday evening, 50-49. Four
Republicans joined all the Democrats in opposition. Sen. Michael
Crapo, R-Idaho, a supporter of the bill, was absent because of his
daughter's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Some moderate Republican senators who had threatened to vote
against the measure, raising the possibility of its defeat, were
appeased with changes made the night before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   With the outcome a foregone conclusion, the day was spent in
political positioning rather than serious debate. Both parties seem
to feel they have the political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   As the House was convening Thursday morning, President Clinton
arrived at the Capitol for a Democratic pep rally in a Senate
office building. He sought to make a distinction between Democrats
and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we say is: Deal with the big challenges first,'' Clinton
said. ``Deal with the aging of America. Save Social Security. Save
Medicare. Add a prescription drug benefit. Add the preventive
tests. And get America out of debt for the first time since 1835.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they have said,'' Clinton continued, speaking of
Republicans, ``is: Let's pass this big tax cut first, make
everybody happy tomorrow and then we'll talk about the
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans held their own rally at the same time on the Capitol
lawn. ``We have a good deal for the American people,'' declared
Speaker Dennis Hastert. ``It's fair, responsible and balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the legislation, Hastert said, was so that ``the
American people can decide how to spend their hard-earned dollars,
and not the bureaucrats in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than send the bill to the president at once, as is
usually done when Congress completes work on legislation,
Republican leaders put the tax bill on the shelf until September.
The delay, they said, will enable them to tout the measure over the
August recess, which begins this weekend, and will deny the
president the spectacle of a veto ceremony while Congress is not in
session.
</P>
<P>
   The main elements of the bill would reduce income tax rates by 1
percentage point, lower the capital gains tax, give more favorable
tax treatment to retirement savings, gradually abolish the
inheritance tax, eventually end the so-called marriage penalty and
the alternative minimum tax, and give generous tax breaks to a
range of commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   Calculations by Deloitte &AMP; Touche, the accounting firm, showed
that a couple with two children under 17 and an income of $50,000,
which is near the national median, would receive an annual tax cut
of $265, less than enough for a movie a week in most cities.
</P>
<P>
   A similar couple with an income of $200,000 would get a tax cut
of $2,720.
</P>
<P>
   The bill seems likely to be among the big measures, including
Social Security, Medicare and spending bills, that will be part of
negotiations between the president and Congress this fall.
President Clinton has insisted that he cannot accept tax cuts of
more than $300 billion over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   At $792 billion over 10 years, the tax reduction approved by
Congress Thursday is the biggest since 1981. It was put together in
slapdash fashion, the details not really mattering since everyone
knew it was not going to become law.
</P>
<P>
   When the bill's drafters, freed from the constraints of reality,
determined that all the tax cuts they had put into the measure
would exceed their target of $792 billion, they simply ended the
rate reductions and many other cuts in 2008 instead of 2009, as had
been planned.
</P>
<P>
   To win over moderate Republican senators who were threatening to
bolt, party leaders added provisions involving low-income workers,
affordable housing and dependent care.
</P>
<P>
   The four Republicans who voted against the bill were George
Voinovich of Ohio, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Olympia Snowe
and Susan Collins, both of Maine. All but Voinovich waited until a
majority had been achieved before casting their votes, indicating
that they would have supported their party if their votes had been
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Not taking into account the 2008 end of the provisions, the
Treasury Department estimated Thursday that the most affluent 10
percent of taxpayers, those with incomes above about $90,000 a
year, would receive about 60 percent of the tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, top Republican leaders did not even bother to
speak about the measure. The job of closing the debate, usually
performed when important legislation is at stake by the speaker or
the majority leader, Dick Armey, went to Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. of
Florida, a party stalwart. He proclaimed the legislation ``as near
a perfect tax bill as I've seen in my years in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, did close
the debate for his side. Republicans, he said, reminded him of
himself when he was a boy and would immediately spend his allowance
on candy bars and baseball cards, rather than save it for the
bicycle he wanted. He implored the House to ``reject instant
gratification and save this money for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican
leader, summarized the Republican position. ``We have trillions of
dollars in surplus,'' he said. ``Let's give a quarter of it back to
the American people.

GORDON WINS BRICKYARD POLE IN RECORD FASHION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Jeff Gordon said there's no mystery to his
mastery when it comes to qualifying at the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no `mastery' to it. If the car sticks, it sticks. If
it doesn't, it doesn't,'' Gordon said after pasting together a
record-shattering, pole-winning 2.5-mile lap for tomorrow's
Brickyard 400. ``I'm shocked. Yes I am, believe it or not. I was
waiting for somebody to get that perfect lap today.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth of 54 drivers to make a qualifying attempt, Gordon's
time of 50.108 seconds/179.612 mph withstood all challenges and
wiped Ernie Irvan's year-old records of 50.169 seconds/179.394 mph
off the NASCAR record book at IMS.
</P>
<P>
   The pole was a series-leading seventh in 20 races for Gordon,
the three-time and reigning series champion who stands sixth in
points and virtually out of title contention. But IMS continues to
remain Gordon's domain on several fronts. Before he became a NASCAR
superstar, Gordon won the inaugural Brickyard 400 in 1994. Last
summer, he became the race's first two-time champion.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's pole was Gordon's third at this event, and his fifth
start of third or better in six Cup races at the historic
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is a native of California, but grew up in nearby
Pittsboro, Ind., and began his racing career there while a
teen-ager. On Wednesday night, the people of his adopted hometown
10 miles west of here honored him by naming a stretch of highway
Jeff Gordon Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have stuck me with some little road, but they got
me an exit off the highway,'' Gordon said of a ceremony that
reunited him with many former high school classmates and racing
friends. ``It was pretty neat. That's how my weekend got started,
and I think that was added inspiration today _ the reaction I got
from the fans and the race car I had out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Gordon in the two-car front row is Mark Martin at
178.941 mph in the No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   Journeyman David Green will start third, his first top-10
qualifying effort of 1999, after a lap at 178.902 mph in the No. 41
Kodiak Chevrolet Monte Carlo. Green's previous best qualifying
effort in 1999 was 17th at Dover, Del., and he had failed to
qualify twice. Green tied his Cup career-best, set at Rockingham,
N.C., in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup points leader Dale Jarrett, who has a comfortable
254-point lead on Martin, took the fourth spot at 178.859 mph in
the No. 88 Quality Care/Ford Credit Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   The top 25 spots were locked-in, with second-round qualifying
and provisionals to fill out the remainder of the 43-car field
today.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who has won four races this season, ripped off his
record after posting only six practice laps in a new No. 24 DuPont
Automotive Finishes Chevy yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we were ready,'' said Gordon, who reminded that
he and his Hendrick Motorsports crew had put in a rigorous test
session here with General Motors teams last month. ``They wore me
out here testing for two days _ two cars and I don't know how many
miles. But it was a lot, a lot more than we'll run on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who is 254 points behind Jarrett, earned his 15th top-10
qualifying effort of the season and fourth top-10 start in six Cup
races at IMS. But as usual, he was overshadowed by Gordon, his
nemesis from last year's points chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's \RGordon\S a better driver than most of us, if not all of
us,'' Martin said. ``And I think he drives a better car than most
of us, if not all of us. I mean that as a compliment in both
respects, not only for the team, but for the driver as well.''

A GIFT TO AMERICA'S HEALTH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8)

<P>
   We all make health care choices every day. For most of us, the
decisions come down to spreading margarine instead of butter on our
toast, climbing out of bed early for a morning jog rather than
hitting the snooze button or saying yes or no to that piece of
blueberry pie.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who live in America's poorest urban and rural
communities, health care decisions can be considerably harder. I
know better than most. I practice medicine in Detroit's inner city.
</P>
<P>
   Would you undergo an annual physical examination, for instance,
if paying the health insurance deductible left you short at the
grocery store? How long could you stand an aching tooth if getting
treatment meant not covering this month's rent?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, my patients know that money is not an obstacle to
health care. I am here for them, no matter their circumstances.
Many other doctors, in Detroit and elsewhere, take a similar
approach. But in inner-city and rural America, there are fewer and
fewer of us to go around.
</P>
<P>
   That's what keeps me up at night. I'm 65, and I tell my patients
I'll live forever. But actuarial tables say otherwise, and I worry
about having someone to hand my stethoscope to.
</P>
<P>
   The need grows daily. Census figures show that one of three
Americans live in what I call medically underserved inner-city and
rural communities. People in those areas suffer disproportionately
from cancer, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, kidney disease and
AIDS, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there is an urgent need for greater numbers of
competent, compassionate primary care physicians for these
communities. But where will they come from?
</P>
<P>
   Many come from four traditionally African-American medical
schools: Morehouse in Atlanta, Howard in Washington, Drew in Los
Angeles and Meharry Medical College in Nashville. My research shows
that significant numbers of all physicians who practice in
underserved communities are African-Americans. For the last 130
years, about 75 percent of African-American doctors have trained at
these four schools.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, like communities they serve, Morehouse, Howard,
Drew and Meharry have big financial needs, and all have modest
endowments.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, I decided to do something about it. I attended a
seminar on charitable giving and found that I could make a
difference, not just with my time, but also with my money.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in my life, I am financially secure. I was able to
donate two variable life insurance policies with a total death
benefit of $1 million to the Morehouse School of Medicine. Why life
insurance? Because making a gift of it makes me feel like a million
bucks without spending a million bucks. Now, while my patients
worry that I won't live forever, the president of the medical
school and my longtime friend, Dr. Louis Sullivan, worries that I
will.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another benefit. Paying monthly insurance premiums
_ as opposed to writing a check for $1 million _ affords me the
financial leverage to preserve the bulk of my estate for my two
grown sons and two nieces. They wholeheartedly support my
philanthropy because they understand that it's the right thing to
do. But they also know that by remembering Morehouse, I'm not
forgetting them.
</P>
<P>
   The gift to Morehouse, as well as the overwhelming need of these
schools, has inspired me. Last year, with help from the Hartford
Life Insurance Co., I established a foundation, with the goal of
raising $3 billion to $4 billion over 10 to 20 years to benefit the
endowments of Morehouse, Howard, Drew and Meharry.
</P>
<P>
   The goal sounds optimistic. But consider the potential donor
pool. The American Medical Association alone has more than 291,000
member physicians. If just 1 percent of them donated $1 million
each in life insurance, we would be near our goal. And that doesn't
count the hundreds of thousands of other professionals and business
executives across America who could make a difference for our
poorest communities. &QL;

 McGWIRE SAYS HE ENDED USE OF ANDRO MONTHS AGO  
(rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire disclosed Wednesday that he has stopped using the
androstenedione dietary supplement because he was worried about the
possible influence that his continued use could have on children.
But McGwire also added that he still does not believe there is
anything wrong with it and that adults should be permitted to use
the legal supplement.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who acknowledged that he took androstenedione while
establishing a major league record of 70 homers in one season with
the St. Louis Cardinals last year, said that he has not taken the
supplement for the last four months. Sales of androstenedione
increased dramatically after McGwire disclosed during his historic
season that he used the supplement to help intensify his workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought long and hard about it, and I don't like the way it
was portrayed, like I was the endorser of the product, which I
wasn't,'' McGwire told reporters at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. ``I
don't like how it's portrayed that young kids take it because of
me. I always discouraged children from taking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Andro, as the supplement is commonly known, is sold legally over
the counter and on the Internet in the United States, even though
some medical experts believe it is essentially an anabolic steroid.
The supplement is banned by the NFL, the NCAA and the International
Olympic Committee because these organizations believe it enhances
performance and could be a potentially harmful drug. But baseball
has not banned it and has publicly refused to condone or condemn
it.
</P>
<P>
   While Commissioner Bud Selig praised McGwire's decision by
saying he has ``a lot of faith in Mark,'' he said that it would not
influence baseball's neutral stance on the supplement. Major League
Baseball and the Players Association are jointly funding a research
study by Harvard University on andro, and the findings are expected
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go forward with the study,'' Selig said.
``There has been a lot of time put into the study.''
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of McGwire's surprising decision reached the White
House, where Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of national drug
control policy, lauded McGwire Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message Mark McGwire sends to our young people by walking
away from this substance is a powerful one,'' McCaffrey said in a
statement. ``We thank McGwire for his leadership and hope that
other athletes will follow his lead.'' McCaffrey has asked the Drug
Enforcement Administration to label andro a steroid so it can be
removed from stores.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was so thrilled by McGwire's announcement. Dr.
Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor and co-author of ``The
Steroids Game,'' said: ``It's too little, too late. I have nothing
against the guy. He seems like a good guy. I really believe that he
wants to do the best by kids. But the fact of the matter is he
dropped the ball on this one. When it was first made public a year
ago that he did this, he should have said, `Even though I'm not
breaking any of baseball's rules, I'm going to quit because this
sends a bad message to kids, and I'm sorry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Andro is a synthetic form of a male hormone that occurs
naturally in the body and is converted to testosterone. Those with
higher levels of testosterone usually have increased muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Iowa State University study of 30 men found that andro
did not help build muscle, but instead raised the risk of heart
disease, pancreatic cancer and breast enlargement. Doctors have
maligned the study because the test subjects took dosages far
smaller than body builders routinely ingest.
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire said in spring training that andro was legal and
seemingly indicated he would keep using it, he said Wednesday that
he had stopped. With 42 homers, the 35-year-old McGwire was tied
with Chicago's Sammy Sosa for the major league lead entering
Thursday night's games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This showed that andro is irrelevant,'' McGwire explained.
``I've done this season what I've done my whole career. I've been
saying it all along that you don't hit homers because of andro.
It's my hands and my eyes and my brain. There have been studies
proving that it doesn't do anything to improve strength anyway,
which has always been my claim.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's timing of the revelation was curious because he is one
homer away from his 500th career homer, the majority of which were
hit without using andro. While McGwire said that he did not
disclose that he had given up andro because no one had asked him
until Wednesday, a reporter from a New York newspaper tried to
interview him for an extensive article on andro last month and he
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   If McGwire had made his disclosure before the season and then
did not produce homers as prodigiously as he has while averaging 60
over the last three years, there surely would have been more
speculation that andro had helped him in 1998 and that may have
influenced his timing. Without using andro, McGwire is on pace to
hit 63 this season.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with more than 75 players, team trainers and club
officials earlier this season, it was estimated that 5 to 10
percent of the 750 major leaguers use andro. Medical experts
estimated that the number is higher, but baseball does not test for
any substances so it is impossible to know who is using andro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe there's nothing wrong with it,'' McGwire said.
``But if I have a message for kids, it's that you don't necessarily
have to follow what somebody who's in the public eye does. If
you're an adult, you elect to choose your own destiny.''

ARMS SALES DECLINE GLOBALLY BUT U.S. STILL LEADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States remained the world's biggest arms
exporter in a sluggish market last year, as the weak economies in
Asia and among oil producers in the Middle East dragged global
sales to developing countries to their lowest level since 1991,
according to an authoritative government report.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Thursday by the Congressional Research
Service, an arm of the Library of Congress, showed that the United
States negotiated new agreements to sell $7.1 billion worth of
weapons in 1998, nearly 31 percent of the $23 billion in sales
worldwide. The United States easily surpassed Germany, which sold
$5.5 billion, and France, which had $3 billion in new sales.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also led the world in delivering arms ordered
in previous years, making $7.8 billion worth of deliveries in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which four years ago briefly knocked the United States
out of the spot as the world's top arms merchant, has seen its
exports steadily drop, despite increases in sales of fighter
aircraft and other weapons to China. In 1998, Russia reached
agreements to sell only $1.7 billion worth of arms, compared with
$3.3 billion in 1997 and $5.3 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The $23 billion in worldwide arms sales showed a slight increase
over 1997, when the worst of the Asian economic crisis hit, but it
was far below the levels in the early 1990s, when the collapse of
the Soviet Union and the Persian Gulf war led to an arms-buying
spree. In 1993, arms sales worldwide reached $37 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Arms sales to the developing world _ defined as those countries
outside Europe and excluding Russia, Japan, Australia and New
Zealand _ dropped sharply overall. But the United States increased
its sales to those countries to $4.6 billion, from $2.6 billion the
year before.
</P>
<P>
   The report predicted that the Asian economic troubles and the
relatively low prices for crude oil would prolong the slump in arms
purchases by developing countries, which until recently have
accounted for a majority of international arms sales.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Saudi Arabia, in particular, was struggling to
keep up with purchases made earlier in the decade. It said the
country, the world's largest arms buyer, ``has even had problems
meeting its monthly payments'' for existing contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Cardamone Jr., an analyst for the Council for a
Livable World Education Fund, which advocates arms control, said
the report's findings underscored the fact that the United States
was continuing to put more arms into the hands of others than any
other country.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that United States retained its dominance of the
international arms markets without any multi-billion-dollar sales
being completed. Instead, most sales involved less costly items,
including upgrades to existing systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's $7 billion worth of spare parts,'' he said. ``Without a
major arms sale last year, the U.S. still leads the world.''
</P>
<P>
   This dominance is likely to grow, he added, if the United States
completes pending deals with Israel and the United Arab Emirates.
Israel is to purchase $2.5 billion worth of F-16s, and the Emirates
nearly $8 billion worth of the planes.

 &HT;    2 dead after workplace shooting in Alabama
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PELHAM, Ala. _ As Jerry Shinault, general manager of the Taco
Bell at the Cahaba Valley Road exit off Interstate 65, arrived at
work at 8 a.m. Thursday, he noticed ``about 20'' police cars up the
hill at an air conditioning business. He asked a Federal Express
driver who stopped in what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not something like what happened in Atlanta _ and
sure as hell it was,'' Shinault said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Allen Eugene Miller, 34, allegedly shot to
death two people at the air conditioning business where he worked,
then shot another person to death at a nearby specialty gas
distributor where he had previously worked, said Pelham Police
Chief Allan Wade.
</P>
<P>
   Police charged Miller with three counts of capital murder.
Authorities captured Miller as he allegedly tried to escape in his
car on I-65.
</P>
<P>
   The Pelham slayings came one week after Mark O. Barton of
Morrow, Ga., shot to death nine people at a pair of Atlanta stock
brokerages. Police later discovered the bludgeoned bodies of
Barton's wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting closer to home,'' said Shinault, who lives in
this suburb 20 miles south of Birmingham. ``But what are you going
to do about it? I don't think people are shocked by it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelham, a town of about 10,000, is a mix of upscale subdivisions
and rural landscape sculpted in the foothills of the Appalachians.
Signs on some highways warn of rock slides. But the interstate exit
where police say Miller's shooting spree started is pure commercial
suburbia, marked by a Cracker Barrel, KFC, McDonald's and Best
Western.
</P>
<P>
   After allegedly killing Lee Holbrooks, 32, of Pelham, and
Christopher Yancy, 28, of Alabaster, at Ferguson Enterprises,
Miller drove five miles to Post Airgas, which sells gases like
oxygen and helium. On the loading dock of the sea-green building,
slender tanks stood like 5-foot-high bullets _ brown, bronze, black
and green.
</P>
<P>
   At the gas office, police said, Miller killed former co-worker
Terry Jarvis, 39, of Montevallo.
</P>
<P>
   Police offered no motive for the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me nervous,'' said Richey Henninger, a serviceman for
Sunset Homes, one of the several mobile home dealers on U.S. 31
near Post Airgas.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Miller, the suspect's mother in rural Billingsley 50
miles away, said her son, who lived with her, had no history of
bothering people. On Thursday, she told reporters, he ``went off to
work just as he always does. He left here like he always does, with
a 7-Up and a couple of things of biscuits and sausage.''
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon sun heated up the black pavement, Reba Sulava
filled up her Olds Eighty-Eight at the combination Shell station
and Sunny food convenience store across from Ferguson Enterprises,
where the shootings started. A Houston resident, she was in town
visiting her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there's a shooting, you just cringe because you
wonder if it's someone you know,'' Sulava said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Barton opened fire in Atlanta, Sulava had reason
to cringe: Her stepson lives in Atlanta and she immediately thought
of him. He was nowhere near Barton's rampage, but Sulava's heart
raced till she confirmed he was OK.
</P>
<P>
   To Sulava, such violent rampages represent a national sickness.
``It just says our country is going to pot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Virginia headquarters of Ferguson
Enterprises called the Pelham shootings an ``act of senseless
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are greatly appreciative of the support and assistance we
have received from the police and the community, and we are fully
cooperating with the police investigation,'' the company release
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prayers and condolences are with the families of the
victims. Our focus today is to do all that we can to support the
families of our slain associates and other associates at our Pelham
location.

trades for A.R. Baron, a small New York brokerage firm that
collapsed in 1996.

   William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, said the group has decided to relax rules that have
limited television station ownership. The new provisions will allow
a single company or network to own two stations in the nation's

BENTSEN, CARTER, FORD TO RECEIVE MEDAL OF FREEDOM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lloyd Bentsen, a former Treasury secretary and
senator from Texas, has been selected along with former Presidents
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter to receive the Presidential Medal of
Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is to present medals to Bentsen, Ford and
seven others Wednesday at a White House ceremony. Carter and his
wife Rosalynn, who also was chosen for the award, will receive
their medals from Clinton on Monday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Ford and Carter leaves former George Bush as
the only living president who has not received the award. Bush
presented the medal to President Reagan in 1993 only days before
leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen, Clinton's first Treasury secretary, was the Democratic
Party's vice presidential nominee in 1988. When he joined the
administration, he had served 22 years in the Senate and six years
as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. His Senate career
began in 1970 when he defeated Bush, the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Bentsen left Clinton's Cabinet to work as an
international business consultant in the Houston office of Verner,
Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand, a Washington-based law
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen suffered two strokes in 1998, the second of which kept
him in the hospital and a Galveston, Texas, rehabilitation center
for 3 1/2 months.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, a Republican who became the 38th president with the
resignation of Richard Nixon, will be recognized for ``his honesty
and integrity'' and his efforts to restore confidence in government
after the Watergate scandal that led to Nixon's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Carter will be cited for his four years as the nation's 39th
president and for pushing humanitarian causes, human rights,
democracy and peace since leaving the White House in early 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Other Medal of Freedom recipients are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., president of the World Jewish Congress,
who is being cited for working to ensure basic rights for Jews,
fighting anti-Semitism and pushing for retrieval of the assets of
Holocaust victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
   _ Evy Dubrow, an advocate for more than 50 years of laws to
improve domestic labor conditions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sister M. Isolina Ferre, founder of community service centers,
clinics and programs to empower the poor in Puerto Rico, New York
and Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oliver White Hill, a civil rights lawyer best known for
litigating one of the school desegregation cases that became the
landmark Brown vs. Board of Education case in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   _ Max Kampelman, lawyer, diplomat and negotiator in Democratic
and Republican administrations who, according to the White House,
helped lay ``the foundation for long-term arms reductions between
the United States and the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Edgar Wayburn, five-time president and a member of the board
of directors of the Sierra Club for almost 40 years.

BOTHA NEEDS TO GET BY BRIGGS TO MOVE UP LADDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ Francois Botha had never been knocked out.
He wondered what it would feel like, and he feared it more than any
opponent. His fear did not make him more cautious because he walked
chin-first into Mike Tyson's right hand and awoke with the referee
standing over him delivering the 10 count.
</P>
<P>
   It was even more painful for Botha because he was completely in
control of the fight and had won all four of the previous rounds
before the fateful punch. Six months after his first knockout
experience, Botha (39-2) is looking to avoid a repeat as he takes
on Shannon Briggs (31-2) on Saturday night at Trump's Taj Mahal in
Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   The fight will be broadcast on pay-per-view by Showtime
Entertainment Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knockout did him good,'' said Jan Botha, Francois' father
and training camp cook. ``He was fooling around and he paid for it.
He lost his concentration. Now he's concentrating more than he ever
has.''
</P>
<P>
   The knockout also shook up Botha's corner. He fired trainer
Panama Lewis and hired Abel Sanchez, who worked in Botha's corner
as a second when Botha defeated Axel Schulz for the International
Boxing Federation heavyweight championship in 1995. Lewis is able
to train fighters, but he cannot work their corners because he was
convicted of taking the padding out of a boxer's gloves during a
bout.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Botha said his son never made any progress as a boxer under
Lewis. ``Panama let Francois do whatever he wanted to do, because
Francois is a good athlete,'' Jan Botha said. ``But he never
improved. He was doing the same things every fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez has been working with Botha for eight weeks and has been
trying to help him improve his punching ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've revamped his stance to get him leverage on his punches,
especially his left hook,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, who weighed in at 232 pounds, and Briggs, who weighed in
at 230 pounds, are in similar positions heading into the fight.
Like Briggs, Botha, 30, is trying to work his way back up the
ladder of heavyweight championship contenders. After he defeated
Schulz, Botha held the title for one month before he was stripped
for testing positive for steroids. Botha said he was taking
medication for a shoulder injury, and he should not have been
stripped of the title.
</P>
<P>
   He fought Michael Moorer for the IBF title and was stopped on a
technical knockout in the 12th round. Botha took a tremendous
beating in the fight, cementing his reputation as a durable
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The Moorer fight was the brink-of-death-type fight that Briggs
has not been in. That is why Botha would like to take Briggs' into
the later rounds.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Bay Area Agencies Buy Green Power  &HT;     By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Calpine Corp. will light the Golden Gate Bridge and dozens of other
government facilities with green power as a result of a deal struck
this week by the San Jose power company and the Association of Bay
Area Governments.
<P>
   The ABAG contract calls for Calpine to provide renewable power
to some 59 cities, counties and public agencies including the
Golden Gate Bridge district. Taxpayers are expected to save $1
million a year as a result of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Power from Calpine's Geysers steam field in Lake and Sonoma
counties will be earmarked for ABAG members. ABAG expects to buy
roughly 5 percent of The Geysers' (CQ) &LR; output, providing a market
for that power, at least for bookkeeping purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The actual electricity ABAG members use could come from any
power generator, since once it goes into the transmission system,
electricity from all sources gets blended together. But for every
kilowatt hour of energy burned by ABAG members, one kilowatt hour
of power from The Geysers must be put into the system.
</P>
<P>
   Calpine bought 18 of the 21 power plants operating in The
Geysers field last May from Pacific Gas and Electric Co. They
produce enough electricity to light 1.2 million homes, making
Calpine the largest geothermal power producer in America.
</P>
<P>
   The ABAG-Calpine contract looks like a good deal for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ABAG gets to support clean energy and do so at a savings to its
member agencies. Calpine gets a ``marquee customer,'' whose
association will lend credibility to its green power marketing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If local governments get their power from renewable sources,
it sends out the message to citizens that renewables are legitimate
and that consumers should care about who gets their electricity
dollars,'' said John White, executive director of the nonprofit
Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ABAG members could save roughly $1 million a year, collectively,
as a result of the decision to move to renewable energy, said ABAG
power pool manager Elena Schmid in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because the state's deregulation law created a
$540 million pot of money to lend temporary support to renewable
power production in this state.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that money is earmarked for rebates to customers using
renewable power. It reduces the cost of that power by 1.5 cents per
kilowatt hour, enough in some cases to make renewable power cheaper
than power coming from natural gas and coal that carry an
environmental cost due to pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidies come from ratepayers and will expire in 2002.
Schmid said it makes sense for public agencies to take advantage of
the ratepayer-funded program, while it's available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're providing jurisdictions that want to go completely green
with a way to do so economically,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 200,000 California residents and businesses have
switched to renewable energy since the state deregulated the
production and marketing of electricity 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The renewable energy rebate is intended to help the renewable
industry make the tough transition from utility contracts to a
competitive market _ as well as protect California's diverse energy
mix.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 10 percent of the state's electricity comes from
renewable sources such as geothermal fields, wind farms,
hydroelectric plants, solar energy and burned waste.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature considers the survival of renewable energy
important. Toward that end, it has been tinkering with rules that
appear to have inhibited the expansion of the green marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   A new law says that consumers who sign up for green power over
the Internet or at public forums like county fairs need not be
contacted subsequently for ``third-party verification.'' That
waiver, proposed by state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, saves green
power marketers $5 to $10 per customer.
</P>
<P>
   Under SB1159, independent verification still is required for
people switched as a result of telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   ABAG is not the first aggregator to move to green energy. The
San Diego Association of Governments recently signed a green power
contract with Commonwealth Energy.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Calpine sees an opportunity to create a brand
identity with consumers that it hopes will build its customer base.
</P>
<P>
   It's planning to build a visitor's center at The Geysers that
will explain how natural steam fields are harnessed to create
electricity _ and how the reinjection of treated waste water can
perpetuate the field's productive life.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Microsoft, AOL War May Involve Net Access  &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Microsoft and America Online, already locked in a bitter fight over
instant messaging, soon may be battling on another front: Internet
access.
<P>
   In an attempt to snatch some of AOL's 18 million subscribers,
Microsoft may slash or even eliminate all fees for its Microsoft
Network, according to a report in yesterday's Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here clearly is a clash of the titans,'' said Joe
Laszlo, an analyst with Jupiter Communications. ``These are two big
forces who are trying to shape the computing and online experiences
of consumers for the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Journal quoted Microsoft Vice President Brad Chase
saying the firm will be ``aggressive'' with Net access, the company
yesterday was more circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe access to the Internet can be easier
and simpler, because AOL has not set the standard there,'' said a
Microsoft spokeswoman. ``However, it is pure speculation that we
will lower the price of our Internet access or offer free access.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL currently is the undisputed leader in Internet access. It
charges $21.95 a month for its service, which includes an e-mail
account, Web browsing and access to proprietary content such as
online games and a daily horoscope. Microsoft offers similar
features through MSN, which has 1.8 million subscribers each paying
$19.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers believe that if Microsoft lowers its price to
zero, many AOL customers will defect. ``If I could get a reliable,
brand-name service to offer free Internet access, then I would
switch and I would make everyone in my family switch,'' said Hany
Nada, a technology analyst with investment firm U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray.
</P>
<P>
   The news that Microsoft may be lowering prices hit AOL hard. In
a day when most technology stocks happily rebounded, AOL bucked the
trend and fell $3.50, to $83.94.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from Internet access now accounts for about two-thirds
of AOL's business. Unlike Microsoft, AOL does not have a
diversified product line to offset any losses that surely would
follow a price war.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is adamantly against lowering its subscription fee. ``We
raised our price a year ago from $19.95 to $21.95 while all around
us everyone was dropping their prices,'' said AOL spokeswoman Ann
Brackbill. She added that the company still managed to sign on more
new customers than ever.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's position is that price is irrelevant. Brackbill said
customers choose AOL for its ``value-added'' services such as
proprietary content, parental control and round-the-clock customer
support. And for consumers who still prefer low cost over anything
else, AOL offers a scaled-down offering, CompuServe, for $9.95 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a multiple brand strategy and are bounding ahead on
all fronts,'' Brackbill said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has attempted to wrest customers from AOL in the past
without much success. In 1995, Microsoft began bundling its MSN
online service with its Windows 95 operating system. The logic at
the time was that consumers quickly would turn away from AOL in
favor of the preinstalled Microsoft service.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly fours years later, AOL has 10 times as many
subscribers as MSN, according to Jupiter Communications statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over Internet access is just the latest twist in an
escalating turf battle between Microsoft and AOL. Two weeks ago,
Microsoft launched new instant-messaging software that let users
chat in real time with users of AOL's market-leading messaging
software. AOL accused Microsoft of strong-arming its way in;
Microsoft, in turn, said AOL was blocking competition. That battle
is still unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe that Microsoft is getting more aggressive about
the Internet precisely because the future of its dominant operating
system is now in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the potential that AOL could become an operating
system and that people will no longer need the Microsoft OS,'' says
Nada. ``Right now, I get an AOL CD in my mailbox every week, not an
MSN CD. But if Microsoft gets more aggressive, they could be a real
force here.''
</P>
<P>
   Free _ or much cheaper _ Internet access is not new. Gateway and
Dell have been offering free Internet access to people who buy
their computer products in Europe. In America, a number of smaller
firms, including Freewwweb and Bigger.net, have launched free
Internet access services, supported by an advertising-model, to
limited degrees of success. Bigger.net went out of business.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8)  
 (af)  
 By BOB KNOLL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HADLYME, Conn. _ A decade ago, when I made my daily visits to
the Hadlyme Country Store and Post Office, the vehicles parked
there were mostly passenger cars and station wagons _ Peugeots were
most common locally _ with a smattering of sport utility vehicles.
If there were pickup trucks around, they mostly belonged to local
contractors and lawn services.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. Subarus have supplanted the Peugeots,
high-end sport utilities are everywhere and the pickups are more
common and less blue-collar. Not only do many have the deluxe
features of the best passenger cars, the addition of a rear door,
or doors, has broadened their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But while Dodge, Ford and General Motors have thrived on the
booming truck market, Toyota has struggled to keep up, even though
it has sold pickups in the United States for 35 years. The majority
were smaller models, like the current Tacoma. Toyota added a
slightly larger truck, the T-100, in 1993, but it never really
caught on, perhaps because it was not really full sized, perhaps
because it did not offer a V8 engine. It was discontinued last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company _ fiercely competitive in most segments _ has
decided to get serious in full-sized pickups. It has a new $1.2
billion assembly plant in Princeton, Ind.; a new truck, the 2000
Tundra, and a V8.
</P>
<P>
   The plan seems to be working. The company says the Tundra has
had the best initial sales of any new Toyota product, and demand is
far outstripping supply. But the plant's capacity, 100,000 units a
year with plans to upgrade to 150,000, falls far short of its
homegrown rivals'. Ford sold nearly 850,000 full-size trucks last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Tundra comes in three price lines: base, SR5 and Limited,
with four-wheel-drive versions of the two fancier models. Cab
configurations include a regular cab with an eight-foot cargo bed
and a four-door Access Cab with a six-and-a half-foot bed.
</P>
<P>
   The standard engine is a 3.4-liter, 24-valve V6 rated at 190
horsepower and 220 foot-pounds of torque. It is available with
either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic
transmission. But the engine that most Americans will want is the
V8.
</P>
<P>
   A modern design with 4.7 liters, dual-overhead cams and 32
valves, it is basically the same power plant used in Toyota's
luxurious Land Cruiser. Called the I-Force, it develops 245
horsepower and 315 foot-pounds of torque and qualifies for
classificiation as a low-emission vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   With this engine, which comes only with an automatic
transmission, the Tundra is rated to carry about 2,000 pounds or
tow a 7,200-pound trailer. An engine this sophisticated is uncommon
in a light truck, and the I-Force is unusual in another respect:
The throttle is electronic _ like the ``fly by wire'' controls of
some new jetliners _ instead of being directly connected to the
accelerator with a cable, the usual practice.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Tundra is a new design for Toyota, it is cut from
the same mold as its competition from Chevrolet, Dodge and Ford.
Toyota says the full-frame chassis is the most rigid in the field.
There is nothing unusual about the independent front suspension or
rear leaf springs, but the rack-and-pinion steering gives better
road feel than the systems used on many light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But Toyota has combined large disk brakes up front with drums in
the rear, and anti-lock brakes are only an option. This is a
disappointing combination, considering that all Chevrolet
Silverados have four-wheel disk brakes with an anti-lock system.
</P>
<P>
   So how does the Tundra measure up in normal use? In the course
of this evaluation, I drove four-by-four versions of the Chevrolet
Silverado 1500, Ford F-150 and Dodge Ram 1500, and both two- and
four-wheel-drive versions of the V8 Tundra. The two-wheel-drive SR5
listed for $26,038, the four-by-four SR5 for $29,548.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the box, this new Tundra definitely lives up to
expectations and sets some benchmarks for the rest to shoot at.
</P>
<P>
   First, it is about as easy to get into (or as difficult, if you
are small) as the Silverado, which is the easiest of the
domestic-brand pickups. The Dodge is the worst, requiring a heave
of 39 inches up to the front edge of the seat. (The Tundra's rise
is 36 inches.) The Tundra cabin is roomy, the driving position is
comfortable and the visibility is excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Seat choices are a split bench with a large folding armrest or
two buckets with a center console. I much prefer the split bench,
which felt more comfortable, offered three-across seating and, when
the center seat is not used, offers a large storage bin and two
convenient cup holders in the armrest.
</P>
<P>
   The usual safety features are here: a depowered air bag for
driver and front-seat passenger with a key-operated lockout for the
passenger side; pretensioners for both front outboard belts, and
devices that protect the chest from the force of the belts. The
rear seat has two head restraints, two lap-and-shoulder belts and
hook anchors for a child seat with a top tether.
</P>
<P>
   The instruments and controls are clear and well placed, with the
exception of a windshield wiper stalk nearly as long as the gear
shifter protruding from the steering column. (I occasionally turned
on the wipers when shifting into reverse.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The air-conditioning handled humid, 100-degree days with ease.
The stereo _ radio, tape, CD _ was simple and easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   All the new pickups are quieter inside, but the Tundra is
clearly the most hushed, with a noise level comparable to many
cars'. Road noise was commendably low and wind noise was subdued up
to 70 miles an hour. The new V8 makes a nice noise when
accelerating but is inaudible at cruising speed.
</P>
<P>
   The steering does retain some road feel, with steering response
typical of big pickups _ not as quick or responsive as the Ford,
not as vague and wandering as the Dodge. The ride is softer than
one expects from a pickup, especially the four-wheel-drive version.
</P>
<P>
   Ride motions are relatively slow on better roads, deteriorating
only on broken secondary highways. All large pickups have body
shake on rougher roads. The Tundra is better than the others, but
still far worse than a passenger car.
</P>
<P>
   Without formal testing it is impossible to determine just how
good the brakes are, but the Tundra's have a good, responsive
``feel.'' They are much like those in the Silverado (which are
vastly better than those of previous Chevy trucks) and far superior
to the Dodge's.
</P>
<P>
   A convenient push-button selector on the instrument cluster
operates the four-wheel-drive system. One can select two- or
four-wheel drive while moving at any reasonable speed. Another
button selects low-range gearing for slow going off road. Although
simple to use, this is only a part-time system that should not be
used on dry, paved roads. The Silverado, alone among the big
pickups, has the full-time all-wheel drive that I much prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Poor rear traction is an inherent pickup characteristic. The
Silverado's all-wheel drive takes care of this problem with ease.
The Tundra's advantage is its electronic throttle, which applies
power so smoothly that you need not spin the rear wheels even with
the powerful V8.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota calls its four-door the Access Cab. The small rear doors
have conventional outside and inside handles rather than latches in
the door jamb; like the others', the back doors are hinged at the
rear, so they cannot be used unless the front door is opened first.
The rear doors open a bit wider than the others and getting in and
out is easier. But the rear seat is the least comfortable of any
big pickup's. The seatback is essentially vertical _ a park bench
has a more comfortable angle. Knee room is tight.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo box is well finished, and though a bit smaller than
the others', it can hold a 4-by-8-feet sheet of plywood flat on the
floor between the wheelhouses in the regular cab models. The Access
Cab has a six-and-a-half-foot box, typical of those in the other
pickups with a rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few problems that will no doubt be worked out as
the Tundra ages. Both test trucks vibrated slightly at moderate
speeds. The gasoline filler door has a seemingly clever clip to
hold the cap while refueling, but inserting the nozzle knocked the
cap to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup truck of today is certainly not the truck of
yesterday. As sport utiliites have become more civilized, rivaling
luxury cars in their appointments if not in their driving
characteristics, so has the current pickup taken on the trappings
of the luxury utilities. In fact, the only real difference will
soon be the cargo area _ open for a pickup and closed for an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   The Tundra was obviously designed to be this kind of truck. Its
ride and interior noise level set new truck standards. Its smooth
V8 and seamless automatic transmission provide response that any
owner will appreciate. And, of course, one can expect the high
level of quality typical of a Toyota. &QL;

 PUC Sets Guidelines to Help Rival Phone Firms Compete With
Pac  Bell, GTE 
 &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
State regulators set guidelines yesterday that will help local
phone companies compete with Pacific Bell and GTE in California.
<P>
   The regulators set performance standards to measure how
efficiently Pac Bell and GTE process orders for phone service from
competing carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Many carriers, such as MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T, are eager to offer
local phone service to customers in the Bay Area and other parts of
California.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of building their own networks, companies will lease
pieces of Pac Bell's system and resell service under a different
brand name.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, the computer networks of competitors must be able to
communicate with the networks of Pac Bell and GTE. This ensures
that a customer who orders local service from MCI, for example, can
get a dial tone and can use 911.
</P>
<P>
   For this to happen, Pac Bell and GTE must make sure that their
systems are compatible with those of their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The new standards from the state Public Utilities Commission
offer a way to gauge how well the systems of Pac Bell and GTE
operate. The standards also will ensure that Pac Bell and GTE treat
orders from competitors the same as they would treat orders for
their own service.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is important in the wake of problems that
competitors like AT&AMP;T and MCI experienced when they tried to roll
out local service in California several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies ran into problems with Pac Bell when trying to
process new orders from customers. Customers who signed up with a
competitor often were told that they couldn't get phone service for
several weeks, and others were billed by more than one company.
</P>
<P>
   The problems cost MCI and AT&AMP;T millions of dollars and forced
the companies to stop marketing their local service here and in
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's ruling should prevent a similar occurance because it
spells out how much time Pac Bell and GTE have to respond to orders
from competitors. The PUC also may set penalties that Pac Bell and
GTE will face for failing to meet the standards.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, the commission is expected to approve a
test to see if Pac Bell's systems are compatible with those of new
rivals for the local market. Pac Bell, which wants to offer
long-distance service in California, must prove that its systems
are compatible before it can win approval to handle long-distance
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell and other local phone companies said they supported
yesterday's PUC ruling because it moves local phone competition
closer to reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very important from our perspective because prior to
the adoption, there was really no way for the commission to know
whether incumbents were meeting the level of service they need to
provide,'' said Evelyn Lee, senior attorney for MCI.

 SPORTS COLUMN: BASEBALL MUST LISTEN TO McGWIRE  
(jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question is not what took Mark McGwire so long to get off
the stuff. The real question is what is taking baseball so long.
</P>
<P>
   Given baseball's laissez-faire attitude toward just about
anything, McGwire became a visible symbol of chemical
experimentation last year. He hit 70 home runs, 9 more than anybody
else ever had, while stoking up on the muscle-building supplement
androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   Now, McGwire says, he has not been using andro this season
because he did not want to set an example for young people. Of
course, he waited four months to inform the impressionable youth of
his decision, but better late than never. The owners who run
baseball are still locked in the ``never'' mode.
</P>
<P>
   Going straight has not cost McGwire his touch. He had 42 home
runs and was tied with his old pal Sammy Sosa for the major league
lead going into Thursday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe there's nothing wrong with it,'' McGwire told
reporters Wednesday night. ``But if I have a message for kids, it's
that you don't necessarily have to follow what somebody who's in
the public eye does. If you're an adult, you elect to choose your
own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has every right to ``choose your own destiny'' because
there is nothing in the rules of his business to force him to stop
taking andro, even though an Iowa State University study suggests
risk for heart disease, pancreatic cancer and male breast
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball, says he is awaiting the
results of a study by Harvard University. But since McGwire's use
became public knowledge last summer, thousands of young people have
undoubtedly ingested copious portions of the stuff, which does not
need a prescription. This frightening thought should weigh on the
alleged consciences of the owners and their hired executives.
</P>
<P>
   With preliminary evidence like the Iowa State study, baseball
could easily have called a temporary ban on andro, which is
prohibited by the International Olympic Committee, the National
Collegiate Athletic Association, as well as professional football
and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to charge that baseball has been slow in confronting
andro because it might somehow cheapen the epic season of 1998. I'd
give baseball the benefit of the doubt and assume that leadership
is merely indecisive and undisciplined and shortsighted without
resorting to such Machiavellian thinking. That's a compliment, I
think. Baseball, after all, is still mulling over the gross income
differences between teams in major television markets and teams in
the smaller regions. The result is that only four or five of the
teams have any shot at being in the World Series. What's the rush?
</P>
<P>
   So baseball dithered while thousands of young people went out to
the drug store and purchased as much andro as they could afford.
The lack of moral authority from the owners left McGwire to work
out his own zig-zag take on the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the fact that some young high school kids think
they need to do something to follow in the steps of a professional
athlete,'' McGwire said. ``But when you're an adult, you can make
your own decisions. When you're young like that, you can make wrong
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire never planned to be a symbol of andro. It was not as if
he had an endorsement contract. Nor did he seem to feel guilty
about using it, since he did not hide his involvement very well.
</P>
<P>
   Last season he left a container in his locker, at eye level,
where visitors would inevitably glance. One curious but not
unscrupulous reporter noticed a label that said ``androstenedione''
and asked a few questions, putting McGwire in a public position he
had not sought.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how much worry McGwire had about the chemical
before the controversy began last year. Once it was revealed, he
did not change his routine while he continued to hit homers under
intense pressure and scrutiny, but he was surely aware of the
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is a public figure who took advantage of counseling
after a painful divorce and has forged an adult relationship with
his son, his former wife and her husband. His father is a dentist,
and he and his siblings have college educations. As the conflicting
information about andro piled up, McGwire surely received some
advice to give it up, lest to do damage to himself and also to
others.
</P>
<P>
   To McGwire's credit, he stopped taking the stuff, and ultimately
felt comfortable revealing it. It took Mark McGwire awhile, but he
did the right thing. His industry gave him no moral compass, no
guidelines, no help at all. Why am I not surprised?

 &HT;    Security at the workplace is getting more attention
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Atlanta day trader Mark Barton made nationwide
headlines last week when he killed nine people in a murderous
stroll through two office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, George Edward Moore walked into the trucking
company office in Charlotte, N.C., where he worked and killed his
supervisor. It merited just a few paragraphs deep inside The New
York Times the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Guess which one corporate security directors were paying
attention to?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't spend a lot of time worrying about Atlanta,'' said
Bryan Smith, who works for American Protective Services as security
director at two downtown Austin office buildings. ``I don't see how
we could change things to prevent something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The type of shooting in North Carolina, where an employee exacts
revenge against a co-worker, is a far more common and bigger
concern among security professionals and building owners and
managers.
</P>
<P>
   About 120 people are slain by co-workers each year, according to
the National Safe Workplace Institute in Charlotte. Three more
people were killed at two Alabama businesses Thursday, and police
arrested a man who had worked at both places.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there were 709 workplace homicides nationwide in 1998,
which include workers killed in robberies and other incidents, the
Labor Department reported Wednesday. In Texas, there were 60
homicides on the job.
</P>
<P>
   While there's a lot of talk about biometrics and glitzy gizmos
like retina scanners and fingerprint readers, the hottest topics in
office security are common-sense, low-tech solutions, such as
locking doors and checking ID badges.
</P>
<P>
   Walk into a swank downtown high-rise or a bland strip-mall
office in Austin and you'll probably be exposed to more security
than you realize: a security station in the lobby, card readers at
unmanned entrances, cameras in parking lots, loading docks and
stairwells, a keypad or another reader at individual offices,
employees wearing IDs.
</P>
<P>
   Security cards and other electromagnetic devices have been
around for more than a decade, but they've become more
sophisticated and more affordable. In some Austin buildings, for
example, tenants must use small electronic key fobs to access
individual floors from the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose company handles security at about 45 buildings in
Austin, said one local law firm installed a panic alarm out of
concern over a disgruntled client. Another tenant installed an
alarm out of fear about an employee's ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, there's always been some concern about security,''
said Steve Everbach, director of asset services in Texas for the
Cushman &AMP; Wakefield real estate firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's been any huge design change to
buildings, but tenants are demanding certain areas have restricted
access: parking garages or loading dock structures where entry
could be obtained without going through the front door,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The front door isn't so easy, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``In individual suites, we've definitely noticed an increase in
secure reception areas,'' Everbach said. ``You can't just walk into
most offices anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's simple awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Property managers and tenants themselves spend a lot more time
today thinking about workplace violence and other security threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago it was a blip, nothing like it is today,'' said
Joseph Ricci, director of the American Society for Industrial
Security, a professional association for security individuals.
``It's been the No. 1 issue among our members for last five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In large part, businesses are concerned about workplace safety
because of money.
</P>
<P>
   And with good reason. In May, a North Carolina jury found a
tool-distribution company was negligent in failing to protect
employees and awarded $7.9 million to the family of two workers
slain by a fired worker in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Government estimates put the cost of workplace violence at more
than $4 billion annually in legal expenses and lost work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the number of people employed and the number
killed at work, it's actually pretty small, like terrorism,'' Ricci
said. ``But it can be a huge liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most large companies, the new rule of thumb is zero
tolerance, just like drugs: Make one threat, and you're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Several workers, however, said they didn't think much about
their safety or building security even in light of several office
shootings. Instead, it was viewed as a far-away problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isolated incidents happen,'' said Fleming Terrell, who works
at a law firm at One Congress Plaza in downtown Austin. ``It's
unfortunate, but you can't let it control what you do and spend
your life worrying and being afraid.''

 (af)  
 By DEBORAH STEAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer vacation reading, at least when it comes to fiction,
usually involves one of two choices: a breezy romp through a few
novels or a sweaty commitment to the Worthwhile Project _ an
attempt, say, at Proust, ``Moby Dick'' or even Dos Passos'
``U.S.A.''(a mere 1,300 pages or so in the edition I own).
</P>
<P>
   So here is a suggestion, in this last summer of our century: Why
not combine those two impulses, and get some Year 2000 perspective,
by revisiting three business novels from the late 1800s and early
1900s? The total number of pages is under 1,000, quite manageable
for a month's worth of lolling in a hammock or on a sandy towel.
</P>
<P>
   The novels _ ``Ragged Dick'' by Horatio Alger Jr., ``The
Financier'' by Theodore Dreiser and ``Babbitt'' by Sinclair Lewis _
are portraits of American archetypes who still reside in our
collective capitalist unconscious: the self-made man, the robber
baron, the Rotarian conformist.
</P>
<P>
   If you need a more practical reason to read these bracing if not
breezy novels, heed the word of Robert A. Brawer, the author of
``Fictions of Business: Insights on Management From Great
Literature'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Brawer, a former chief executive at Maidenform Inc. who holds a
PhD in English, said his years as a reader of such classics helped
him make some crucial business decisions. And what better way, he
asks, to get a hint of the creativity that seems to be demanded in
business today?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ragged Dick: Or, Street Life in New York With the Bootblacks''
is the earliest book in our summer-school course. Published in
1868, it was the first of more than 100 young-adult novels by Alger
in which poor but virtuous boys ultimately gained respectability
and, sometimes, riches. I like the Signet paperback edition
($5.95), with its excellent introduction by Alan Trachtenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Dick Hunter, an orphaned shoeshine boy and street
denizen (he lives in a cardboard box as the story begins) is a
Protestant Ethic parable. Burdened only by his shabby clothes and a
few forgivable vices _ like smoking and spending his earnings
immediately _ he rises, propelled by both luck and pluck.
</P>
<P>
   A potential benefactor witnesses our hero's honesty and ambition
and provides a new suit, a taste for Sunday School and, perhaps
most holy of all, lessons in thrift and delayed gratification (Dick
opens a savings account). The happy ending: After even more
self-improvement, our erstwhile urchin gets his first ``real'' job.
</P>
<P>
   As simplistic as it sounds, this short book is an entertaining
cultural artifact that offered inspiration to generations of young
Americans. Indeed, as Trachtenberg reminds us, the writer Nathanael
West once proclaimed that Alger was to America what Homer was to
the Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   Brawer says that may be stretching it a bit. But he points out
that ``they both worked in established myth; that's the key here.''
A novel like ``Ragged Dick'' is fascinating, he says, because it
makes plain the beliefs Americans have unconsciously absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, ``it's in a strange way typical of the illusions we
harbor,'' he said. ``We want to believe that in an era of
self-interest and me-first, the traditional virtues are very much
alive and will get us where we want to get.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Financier'' harbors no such illusions. (Published in 1912,
it is available as a Meridian paperback at $14.95.)
</P>
<P>
   Based on the life of Charles Yerkes, a 19th-century financier
and transportation magnate convicted of stealing city funds in
Philadelphia, this gripping novel both celebrates and excoriates
the ruthless self-interest of its fictional hero, Frank Cowperwood,
a born businessman who becomes an unstoppable force in the time of
the robber barons.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Dreiser's best book. Both ``Sister Carrie'' and ``An
American Tragedy'' are arguably better reads. But it is powerful
nonetheless _ an obsessively detailed account of the corruption and
the charisma of its main character, who first appears as a young
boy intoxicated by the financial frontier of the Gilded Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost the polar extreme of Horatio Alger,'' Brawer said.
``Here's Dreiser looking at what really makes success in American
business.'' The book is ``absolutely contemporary,'' he said, in
its description of the social Darwinism in business culture. And
Dreiser's genius, he added, ``is that he makes us like Cowperwood
despite ourselves.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to ``Babbitt,'' Sinclair Lewis's 1922 satire of a
smug, conformist real-estate salesman ensconced in a comfortable
middle-class life in Zenith, ``the best ole town in the U.S.A.''
(The Penguin paperback, with illuminating commentary by James M.
Hutchisson, is $9.95.)
</P>
<P>
   Today, the novel's denouement _ Babbitt's slow realization that
his shallow life is meaningless _ is less relevant than the
characters' choice of discourse: Reflecting on the prosperous
1920s, the book skewers America's obsession with brand names,
advertising slogans and business jargon. Hilariously for modern
readers, Babbitt even prattles on about ``Vision,'' his
generation's version of a mission statement.
</P>
<P>
   As a rave review in this newspaper noted back in 1922, ``Though
nobody will recognize himself in George F. Babbitt, everybody will
recognize somebody else.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    3 dead after workplace shooting in Alabama
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PELHAM, Ala. _ As Jerry Shinault, general manager of the Taco
Bell at the Cahaba Valley Road exit off Interstate 65, arrived at
work at 8 a.m. Thursday, he noticed ``about 20'' police cars up the
hill at an air conditioning business. He asked a Federal Express
driver who stopped in what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not something like what happened in Atlanta _ and
sure as hell it was,'' Shinault said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Allen Eugene Miller, 34, allegedly shot to
death two people at the air conditioning business where he worked,
then shot another person to death at a nearby specialty gas
distributor where he had previously worked, said Pelham Police
Chief Allan Wade.
</P>
<P>
   Police charged Miller with three counts of capital murder.
Authorities captured Miller as he allegedly tried to escape in his
car on I-65.
</P>
<P>
   The Pelham slayings came one week after Mark O. Barton of
Morrow, Ga., shot to death nine people at a pair of Atlanta stock
brokerages. Police later discovered the bludgeoned bodies of
Barton's wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting closer to home,'' said Shinault, who lives in
this suburb 20 miles south of Birmingham. ``But what are you going
to do about it? I don't think people are shocked by it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelham, a town of about 10,000, is a mix of upscale subdivisions
and rural landscape sculpted in the foothills of the Appalachians.
Signs on some highways warn of rock slides. But the interstate exit
where police say Miller's shooting spree started is pure commercial
suburbia, marked by a Cracker Barrel, KFC, McDonald's and Best
Western.
</P>
<P>
   After allegedly killing Lee Holbrooks, 32, of Pelham, and
Christopher Yancy, 28, of Alabaster, at Ferguson Enterprises,
Miller drove five miles to Post Airgas, which sells gases like
oxygen and helium. On the loading dock of the sea-green building,
slender tanks stood like 5-foot-high bullets _ brown, bronze, black
and green.
</P>
<P>
   At the gas office, police said, Miller killed former co-worker
Terry Jarvis, 39, of Montevallo.
</P>
<P>
   Police offered no motive for the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me nervous,'' said Richey Henninger, a serviceman for
Sunset Homes, one of the several mobile home dealers on U.S. 31
near Post Airgas.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Miller, the suspect's mother in rural Billingsley 50
miles away, said her son, who lived with her, had no history of
bothering people. On Thursday, she told reporters, he ``went off to
work just as he always does. He left here like he always does, with
a 7-Up and a couple of things of biscuits and sausage.''
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon sun heated up the black pavement, Reba Sulava
filled up her Olds Eighty-Eight at the combination Shell station
and Sunny food convenience store across from Ferguson Enterprises,
where the shootings started. A Houston resident, she was in town
visiting her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there's a shooting, you just cringe because you
wonder if it's someone you know,'' Sulava said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Barton opened fire in Atlanta, Sulava had reason
to cringe: Her stepson lives in Atlanta and she immediately thought
of him. He was nowhere near Barton's rampage, but Sulava's heart
raced till she confirmed he was OK.
</P>
<P>
   To Sulava, such violent rampages represent a national sickness.
``It just says our country is going to pot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Virginia headquarters of Ferguson
Enterprises called the Pelham shootings an ``act of senseless
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are greatly appreciative of the support and assistance we
have received from the police and the community, and we are fully
cooperating with the police investigation,'' the company release
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prayers and condolences are with the families of the
victims. Our focus today is to do all that we can to support the
families of our slain associates and other associates at our Pelham
location.

 _ SF CHRON   Getting a Grip on the New Economy  
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Ill-defined yet oft-repeated, the New Economy is  &LR; the  &LR; label on the
lips of economists and politicians these days.
<P>
   Even if all they know is that it has something to do with
high-paying, high-tech jobs, civic and state leaders believe the
New Economy is the wave of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Now two recent studies, using slightly different approaches,
offer a detailed look at what this New Economy is all about _ and
some surprising insights about which communities are leading the
new economic sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   One report, which rates states as competitors, actually places
Massachusetts ahead of California as the top New Economy state.
According to the Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C.,
think tank, Massachusetts is ahead of California in such key
measures as patent filings, scientific brainpower and R&AMP;D spending
on a per-capita basis.
</P>
<P>
   The other study, by the Milken Institute of Santa Monica, ranked
metropolitan areas in the new economic order. Although San Jose
predictably dominated the list, the study put Oakland ahead of San
Francisco in creating high-tech dollars and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Though they used different measurements, the two reports share a
common view of how to describe this New Economy, contrasting it
with what has come before. Gone are the days when riches arose from
raising crops, harvesting forests, mining ores or manufacturing
widgets.
</P>
<P>
   In the New Economy, wealth is spun out of bright ideas,
protected by copyrights or patents and swiftly fashioned into
products as ephemeral as software programs or as short-lived as hit
songs _ all based on the new raw material of brainpower.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Ross DeVol of the Milken Institute chose cities as his
statistical landscape, studying 315 metropolitan areas and
selecting 50 with the highest concentration of jobs and product
dollars in 14 industries, including drug discovery, computing,
software, aerospace and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   By his measures, San Jose had nearly four times the
concentration of tech industry as second-place Dallas. But DeVol's
127-page analysis also contains this surprising observation: In
1998, Oakland firms booked more tech sales and created nearly as
many tech jobs as San Francisco _ making Oakland 14th in city
rankings compared with San Francisco's 22nd-place showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out of my way to highlight Oakland's showing,'' said
DeVol, adding that the East Bay city has won spillover business
from Silicon Valley and San Francisco with lower rents and better
commuting and housing characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Studying the New Economy in a different geographic contour,
regional planning expert Robert Atkinson of the Progressive Policy
Institute analyzed the competitive advantages of the 50 states in
luring and keeping New Economy companies.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson and fellow author Randolph Court, a former Bay Area
journalist, based their rankings on 17 characteristics, including:
the average education levels of a state's workforce, the number of
fast growing companies, newly public companies, and other measures
of the ``innovative potential'' of a state's economy, such as the
number of patents filed, the number of scientists and engineers,
and research and development spending.
</P>
<P>
   In the study by Atkinson and Court, Massachusetts nudges ahead
of California as the state best suited to fostering the New
Economy.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the two studies reinforced each other. States
like California, Colorado and Arizona, which included several
tech-centric cities in DeVol's ranking, also placed high on
Atkinson's state-based list.
</P>
<P>
   The different geographic focal points of the two studies
reflected their most profound divergence. According to Devol, ``The
centers of the New Economy tend to cluster around research
institutions or universities that create a pool of knowledge
workers who fuel innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   In his view, cities and their surrounding suburbs constitute the
basic units of the New Economy. Roughly 70 miles in diameter, these
urban-suburban rings must not only feature the colleges that turn
out ``knowledge workers'' for the New Economy. They also must
foster the willingness to change, adapt and take risks _ key
psychological characteristics of successful New Economy
communities.
</P>
<P>
   In marked contrast with DeVol's metropolitan focus, Atkinson's
survey examines which states seem best at creating this culture of
risk-taking and rapid change that both studies consider hallmarks
of the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   Their differences in geographic view stem in no small part from
the differences between the sponsors of each study. DeVol's Milken
Institute is named after former financier Michael Milken who, since
his release from prison on charges relating to his 1980s junk-bond
antics, has underwritten a variety of good works, including DeVol's
well-regarded economic analyses.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by Milken's money, DeVol is free to step on political
toes by observing that ``there's been a disconnect between the New
Economy and government institutions,'' with the economic action
occurring in regions _ like the tech sprawl from Santa Cruz to San
Rafael _ areas beyond the grasp of local and state governments.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson's Progressive Policy Institute, on the other hand, is
an intellectual offshoot of the Democratic Leadership Council. The
DLC is a group of national and state officials whose self-professed
goal is finding a middle ground between ``the liberal impulse to
defend the bureaucratic status quo and the conservative bid to
dismantle government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary audience is federal and state government officials
who want to know what they can do to enhance the prospects for New
Economy companies,'' said Atkinson.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, despite their differing geographic foci, the two
studies suggest that the factors hospitable to the New Economy are
so subtle and complex that government officials have only limited
powers to lure and sustain these desirable industries.
</P>
<P>
   Writes DeVol: ``Overly active government intervention and public
policy may be counterproductive and even harmful to the long-term
development of high-tech industries.''
</P>
<P>
   Court, speaking for the state-based study, put it like this:
``In the old style of economic development, government played the
hunter-gatherer, going out to recruit target companies armed with
tax breaks, free land and other incentives.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic development in the New Economy should be more like
``cultivating a garden,'' he explains, making states fertile for
knowledge-based industries like software or biotech by improving
public education or promoting job-specific training programs.
</P>
<P>
   But such observations, on the limited role of government in
economic development, should not be construed as proof that the New
Economy is less greedy for government favors than its smokestack
predecessors, as some of its promoters suggest.
</P>
<P>
   After all, national and state governments currently are awash
with tech-backed initiatives to:
</P>
<P>
   _Increase the import of foreign professionals under H-1B visas.
</P>
<P>
   _Extend the R&AMP;D tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   _Freeze sales taxes on e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   _End overtime pay after an eight-hour workday.
</P>
<P>
   _Enforce U.S. copyright and trademark protections worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   _Negotiate trade rules that favor globalization, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Although both studies overlook such ``government
intervention(s)'' sought by New Economy firms, the authors do have
reservations about the new order.
</P>
<P>
   DeVol, the economist, sums up his reservations in a word:
volatility. ``Community leaders need to be aware that the New
Economy will not make them immune to future business cycles,'' he
said. ``In fact, in a severe recession, some of these communities
will be hit even harder.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVol estimated the extent of that volatility for each of the 50
top tech metropolitan areas by running an economic model that
simulated a recession similar to the one that hit in the early
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   In his model, the nation saw its output of goods and services
slide 1.6 percent in this imaginary downturn. But San Jose's
economy slipped by twice as much, falling 3.3 percent. Oakland's
output fell 1.26 percent, less than the national average but still
negative, while San Francisco emerged as one of only three cities
nationwide to survive this mathematical recession with a positive
growth rate, of .5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seen through Atkinson's more political lens, wage-income
disparity emerges as the New Economy bugaboo. In a companion study
of the national New Economy, Atkinson notes that between 1980 and
1996, the wealthiest five percent of Americans saw a 58 percent
increase in real income. The 60 percent of Americans lower on the
real-income scale eked out a mere 4 percent gain.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, nearly everyone in the pharmaceutical industry was
talking about Viagra, the tiny blue impotency pill from Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Viagra appear in millions of medicine cabinets
virtually overnight, but it also became fodder for the late-night
monologues of Jay Leno and David Letterman. Men who would have
never before admitted that they were impotent could not call their
doctors fast enough for prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   With this demand, Viagra racked up 5.3 million presciptions in
just six months, the most successful introduction ever for a drug
in the United States. Analysts said last year that decades could
pass before Viagra's sales record would be eclipsed.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, less than 12 months after Viagra's debut, its
record run has already been surpassed, by a capsule to treat
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   In its first six months on the market, Celebrex, a drug
manufactured by Monsanto and marketed with Pfizer, rolled up 6.86
million prescriptions, according to IMS Health, an industry
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The only tie between Viagra and Celebrex is that both drugs have
been sold by Pfizer, generally regarded as the best marketer in the
drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   David Saks, a managing director and pharmaceutical analyst at
Gruntal &AMP; Co., the brokerage house, has long applauded Pfizer and
its marketing strategies. He recently took time to discuss what it
takes to create a blockbuster drug today. Here are excerpts. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Why was Celebrex the most successful drug ever
introduced?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. &UR;  &LR; Celebrex walked onto a great platform of opportunity. The
market for arthritis drugs was very large, and many patients with
arthritis were not satisfied with the drugs that were available.
There was a huge demand, and Celebrex was a novel medicine. Of
course, it didn't hurt that you had Pfizer selling the drug. They
are really effective at getting a message across. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Pfizer is the co-marketer of Celebrex with Monsanto.
Just what exactly does a co-marketer do?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. &UR;  &LR; In this case, Pfizer sells the drug the same way they would
sell a drug they created. They set up a specialty group to sell to
primary-care physicians and rheumatologists. Pfizer, to its credit,
does not fall victim to the not-created-here syndrome. If they see
a market where they can see a big profit, they are willing to help
it into the marketplace. Pfizer realizes that no one company can be
everything in drug discovery. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How important is consumer advertising in selling
drugs like Viagra and Celebrex?(end italics0 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. &UR;  &LR; It has become extremely important in education and
awareness. Consumer campaigns have played a big part in the push in
prescriptions for drugs in the past three years. It is becoming a
huge multibillion market, where every company knows there is a high
take-out at the pharmacy for the drugs that were the subjects of
consumer ad campaigns. The message gets a response, but it's a new
phenomenon. These ads help people who are undereducated learn about
new pharmaceuticals and maybe see their doctors. That helps
everybody. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Pfizer used Bob Dole to promote Viagra. Who do you
think would be the ideal spokesperson to promote Celebrex?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It would have to be a mature person who the population knows
and respects. They could say that they had used Celebrex or that
they have arthritis and understand the condition. Personally, I
think Ted Williams, the baseball player, would be great. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How surprising is it that a treatment for arthritis
would outsell a treatment for erectile dysfunction?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That's very simple, really. When you have restriction from
pain and suffering, you want to get relief, and you want it now.
You don't want to live with any incumbrances. With Viagra, as great
as it is, it is certainly a choice. It's a life-style drug. With
Viagra, you don't have to use it. But with any sort of pain and
suffering, you want relief yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrex also had more insurance coverage than Viagra. The big
issue with Viagra was giving it insurance coverage, when
contraceptives were not covered for women.

CSUN NOTEBOOK: EX-AD RUBBED WRONG WAY BY PROBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One of the two very serious reasons Cal State
Northridge gave head football coach Ron Ponciano for his
termination was the allegation he had misappropriated state funds
as an assistant in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN accused Ponciano of fudging expense receipts. On July 16,
the day Ponciano was fired, interim university President Louanne
Kennedy said the internal investigation into the football program
discovered ``a lack of institutional control.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bubb, CSUN's former athletic director who hired Ponciano as
head coach in 1998, spoke out about that accusation on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I kept hearing about Ron was (his)
expenditures,'' Bubb said. ``Those were all things that were signed
off on by the vice president of student affairs' office. To me, if
there was a problem with anything back then, why wasn't it
uncovered back then?
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president of student affairs (Ron Kopita) was signing
off on all that paperwork, as well. The athletic department budget
was under control of the student affairs office. I didn't have
control of our budget until '97-'98.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubb, who resigned last November, said he was interviewed only
briefly by internal auditor Peter Dinauer during the course of the
investigation. Dinauer's report hasn't been released, though it has
been three weeks since Ponciano's firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he spoke to me about was very specific,'' said Bubb, who
said he couldn't mention the nature of Dinauer's questions. ``(But)
I don't know where they're going with this. I think it's
interesting to me that they fired Ron.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubb has pursued a few jobs since he left CSUN, but he still
lives in the San Fernando Valley. He received $79,475 in the
settlement stemming from his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking a look at different opportunities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kopita left CSUN this past spring for Witchia State. His
responsibilities had diminished under former president Blenda
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   __ In the dark: Sam Jankovich, who succeeded Bubb as the
athletic director on an interim basis, said he heard ``rumors''
that Ponciano's job was in jeopardy before Jankovich's term ended
on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is ever shocking,'' said Jankovich, who lives in
semi-retirement in Idaho. ``I feel bad for all the people involved,
that's for sure. I feel bad for Ponciano, because the guy is an
excellent football coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich said he wasn't consulted during the investigation
because of his interim status. The inquiry began in mid-May, just
six weeks before Jankovich was going to leave as interim athletic
director.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ready to go: With football practice beginning next Wednesday,
two more coaches have been added to interim head coach Jeff
Kearin's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin said Thursday that David Robinson, son of former USC
coach John Robinson, has agreed to coach the defensive linemen and
Brent Huff is returning as a part-time defensive-backs coach.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 36, was a USC assistant from 1993-97. He coached the
tight ends for three seasons and linebackers from 1996-97 under his
father. Huff, a 1992 graduate of Oregon State, has been a part-time
coach at CSUN the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rankings: CSUN is ranked No. 149 out of 237 teams in the
Sagarin Ratings published by USA Today. Four Big Sky Conference
teams _ Montana (100), Eastern Washington (126), Northern Arizona
(130), and Montana State (131) _ are ranked ahead of Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, which plays CSUN on Sept. 11, is ranked 57th by Sagarin.
Southern Methodist, which hosts CSUN on Nov. 13, is 70th.
</P>
<P>
   __ Two-a-days: The Matadors will practice twice per day through
August and in the afternoon during the season. Kearin decided to
drop Ponciano's plan for 6 a.m. weekday practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably go at 4 o'clock,'' Kearin said. ``I don't want
any kids here before 7:30 (a.m.).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ass'ad applies: Former Northridge men's soccer coach Marwan
Ass'ad, in an attempt to maintain ties with the local soccer
community, has applied for the vacant Chatsworth girls' job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for a full-time day job,'' Ass'ad said. ``Trust
me, it's not the income. I'm hoping to stay close to my kids and
I'm hoping I'll be able to teach. Chatsworth's my school and that's
where (son) Charlie will go in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ass'ad, who won 192 games in 14 seasons at CSUN and won
conference Coach of the Year honors in 1993, hopes to interview
next week. Chatsworth, under Jack Sidwell, won nine City titles in
11 years. &QL;

17 YEARS LATER, BAD COMPANY SINGER GETTING GOOD VIBES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY RODGERS   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Paul Rodgers, whose soulful voice fronted the popular
'70s rock act Bad Company, has waited more than 15 years to ``set
the record straight.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the group in 1982 and watching others tour using
the Bad Company moniker without his distinctive vocals, Rodgers is
ready to clarify who brought the magic to radio hits like ``Can't
Get Enough,'' ``Feel Like MakinLove,'' ``Movin' On'' and ``Rock and
Roll Fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Yakima, Wash., on a tour break with the reunited Bad
Company, Rodgers admits, ``I did become a little upset when they
did not make it clear to the fans that I wasn't there'' in the Bad
Company lineup of the '80s and mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   But after a chance meeting a few years ago _ at a funeral, of
all places _ the four original band members decided to issue an
anthology to mark a quarter-century since the group's self-titled
debut album took England and America by storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know that the band still had it, had what it
takes,'' says the 49-year-old Englishman. ``So going into the
studio did two things: It created four new tracks (for the hits
disc) and told me that we could tour and support this.''
</P>
<P>
   The results include the radio-friendly ``Hammer of Love,'' which
doesn't miss a beat from the band's straight-ahead, Grammy-winning
rock of two decades past.
</P>
<P>
   The new tracks find Rodgers still laying down gritty, soaring
vocals against Mick Ralphs' bright, concise guitar work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same sort of chemistry that existed in those old days
exists now,'' Rodgers says.
</P>
<P>
   The old days included arena sellouts, a record deal on Led
Zeppelin's Swan Song label and aggressive management by Zeppelin's
handler _ the late Peter Grant, whose funeral was the catalyst for
Bad Company's reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all mates together _ very Spinal Tap,'' Rodgers
chuckles as he recalls hanging out with his superstar label
cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   But the alcohol-related death of Zeppelin drummer John Bonham
touched Rodgers, who admits to plenty of ``fun and games'' on the
road in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to take a rest from Bad Company ... and was
influenced by the death of John Bonham. I had looked around and
could see bands under enormous pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers later joined ex-Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page in the
Firm, a band that enjoyed some radio and MTV success.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers forged a few other musical alliances, but as he prepares
to release a sixth solo album, his preference is clear: ``For me
it's very much more rewarding with the solo band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, I have an American (solo) band,'' says Rodgers, who
splits his time among Canada, the United States and a 200-year-old
cottage outside London.
</P>
<P>
   But there's little doubt Rodgers also enjoys revisiting Bad
Company _ which has no plans beyond its 30-city tour _ on his
terms.

FACING MIDNIGHT DEADLINE, BANK INVESTORS ARE UNDECIDED ABOUT
TAKEOVER BIDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ With only a day left before investors must choose sides
in France's three-way bank struggle, Banque Nationale de Paris
appeared to inch closer to victory in its hostile bid for Paribas,
one of two rivals it is seeking to control.
</P>
<P>
   But investors in Societe Generale, Banque Nationale's other,
larger target, appeared deeply split, raising the prospect that a
final verdict in the hostile-takeover war may fall to French
banking regulators.
</P>
<P>
   If Banque Nationale amasses more than 50.01 percent of Paribas,
it will wreck Paribas' planned friendly merger with Societe
Generale. If Banque Nationale ultimately gains control of Societe
Generale as well, it will merge all three banks into the world's
largest bank, with assets of more than $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Banque Nationale launched its $37-billion hostile bid for
Societe Generale and Paribas in March, about a month after the two
smaller banks had agreed on their own friendly merger.
</P>
<P>
   The bank bidding reflects the broader scramble by European
corporations to merge. Financial institutions in particular are
under pressure to come together to gain size and lower costs in
order to compete more effectively in rapidly unifying markets,
woven even tighter by Europe's new single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding also reflects a new series of aggressive deal making
in France. Last month, Total Fina SA, the French oil group, began a
surprise hostile bid for the much larger former national oil
company, Elf Aquitaine, in a move unprecedented in French industry
to create the fourth-biggest oil company in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the bank brawl, analysts said the bids
had already brought benefits to investors by sharpening the banks'
reporting practices. ``Now we have quarterly reporting, rather than
half-year,'' said Sheila Garrard, of Lehman Brothers Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she said, the banks are now disclosing capital
allocations, enabling investors to calculate for the first time
returns on equity in the banks' various business sectors. Bank
executives also have become more accessible, meeting with investors
and securities analysts and trying to answer their questions.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of Paribas shares may sell them to Societe Generale or to
Banque Nationale, or keep them; investors in Societe Generale must
decide whether to tender to Banque Nationale. Since Banque
Nationale launched its double-barreled bid in March, shares in
Paribas have risen 11 percent and Societe Generale 15 percent,
while Banque Nationale shares have lost about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Baudoin Prot, the No. 2 executive at Banque Nationale, said
today that equity holders in Paribas had given his bank commitments
to tender 49.6 percent of all Paribas shares to Banque Nationale.
Paribas disputed the claim.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts cited reports by several Paribas core shareholders
in recent days as indications that support for Paribas was
weakening. In Italy, the big commercial bank, Banca Commerciale
Italiana, and Mediobanca, the investment bank, were reported to
have shed equity holdings in Paribas equivalent to 2.64 percent of
the total. Their departure, along with the resistance to a two-way
merger by other big Paribas shareholders, including the French
insurer AXA SA, appeared to support the likelihood of Prot's
assertion.
</P>
<P>
   More complex is the behavior of holders of equity in Societe
Generale. French stock market rules require that Banque Nationale
obtain at least 50.01 percent of Societe Generale's capital and a
clear majority of votes to gain control. Complicating matters, some
Societe Generale shares enjoy double voting privileges. Thus,
roughly 29 percent of Societe Generale equity held by bank
executives and employees have 35 percent of total shareholder
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Hence both sides have been storming investors with flurries of
multipage newspaper ads in recent days. The Paris daily Le Monde
reported that Paribas and its partner had budgeted $15 million and
Banque Nationale $12.2 million for the ads, injecting an element of
American-style campaigning into historically secretive French
finance.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Prot said that tenders of more than 35 percent of
Societe Generale votes to Banque Nationale would give it
``effective control'' of Societe Generale. Though most
institutional investors _ mainly large United States and British
pension funds _ have refused to declare their preference, analysts
say they overwhelmingly support the three-way merger proposed by
Banque Nationale, for its potential to eliminate overlapping costs.
</P>
<P>
   But major core shareholders, notably large French industrial
investors like the Alcatel electronics group and the Peugeot auto
works that have cross shareholdings with Societe Generale, oppose
the three-way deal. Banque Nationale's hope, people close to the
bank said, is that a tender of between 35 percent and 50 percent of
Societe Generale voting rights will enable it to sway French
investors to support a replacement of Societe Generale's management
at a shareholder meeting after the tender.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tender expires at midnight Friday, provisional
results are not expected until Aug. 17.

AT&AMP;T AND BRITISH TELECOM INVEST $1 BILLION IN TORONTO COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TORONTO _ AT&AMP;T and British Telecommunications PLC said Thursday
they had agreed to invest almost $1 billion in a mobile phone
company controlled by Rogers Communications of Toronto, creating
the framework for a cable and phone communications network to take
on the domestic giant, Bell Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The investment in Rogers by AT&AMP;T and British Telecom is the
second foreign deal undertaken by the two phone giants since they
formed what was described as a $10 billion joint venture last year.
In April, they invested more than $1.8 billion in Japan Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers Communications owns Canada's largest cable television and
mobile phone companies. It also has a 16 percent interest in AT&AMP;T
Canada, which was created in June with the merger of four phone
companies that had been competing for long-distance service to
business customers. Rogers Cantel is an important subsidiary of
Rogers Communications, accounting for 40 percent of its revenue of
$2.5 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of phone and cable, following the recent pattern
of mergers and acquisitions in the United States, has given life to
Rogers shares over the last six months, even though the company has
seldom made money and has amassed almost $3.4 billion of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rogers Cantel, which had risen recently amid speculation
about possible ventures with foreign partners, fell on the news
announced Thursday. On the Toronto Stock Exchange the shares lost
4.9 percent to $31.95 (Canadian), or $21.36 (United States). The
parent company's B shares fell 1.6 percent to $27.90 (Canadian), or
$18.65.
</P>
<P>
   Although investors remain intrigued by the broad communications
potential of phone combined with cable, the partners in Rogers
Cantel are focusing on business customers. Canadian companies, said
AT&AMP;T's president, John D. Zeglis, ``will enjoy the seamless
worldwide services they need to compete in the economy of the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first of a two-step agreement, AT&AMP;T and British Telecom
will pay $934 million for a 33 percent interest in Rogers Cantel
Mobile Communications Inc., after which Rogers Communications will
own 51 percent of the mobile phone company. British Telecom will
then ensure that it participates in future developments by buying
one-third of AT&AMP;T's 31 percent stake in AT&AMP;T Canada for $402
million.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Holman, a vice president of the Dominion Bond Rating
Service here, said the investment gave Rogers' mobile phone company
more marketing power just as the use of wireless transmission for
data is expected to surge. ``This brings the international arena to
the domestic doorstep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The parent Rogers Communications also benefits, though
indirectly, through the ability to use some of the new investment
to help lower its debt, and by establishing a financial rather than
just a marketing relationship with the two global giants, Holman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Rogers Communications took an important step in that
direction when the Microsoft Corp. made a $400 million investment
in its shares.

EDITORIAL: KOSOVO'S COSTLY DISORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Aug. 6: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the arrival of the first NATO forces, Kosovo
remains lawless and violent. There are no local police or judges,
U.N. police are just beginning to trickle in and NATO is doing an
uneven and unsatisfactory job of preserving order. Unless the trend
toward anarchy is quickly checked, international plans for
constructing a democratic civil society in Kosovo could be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Local thugs, rogue fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army and
Albanian gangs slipping across an unpatrolled border have taken
advantage of the law enforcement vacuum to terrorize the Serbian
and Gypsy minorities and drive them from their homes. The same
violent elements also prey on Kosovar Albanians, subjecting
shopkeepers and other business people to extortion, and potential
political rivals and suspected collaborators with the former
Serbian authorities to intimidation and murder.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate response to this deteriorating situation must come
from NATO, the only organization capable of combating criminal
violence. The effectiveness of NATO law enforcement varies from
sector to sector; the British zone is doing reasonably well, while
others lag behind. Gen. Michael Jackson, NATO's Kosovo commander,
must impose more consistent and rigorous standards.
</P>
<P>
   NATO must also rethink its overly indulgent attitude toward the
KLA, which has been permitted to postpone the deadline for
surrendering heavy weapons and expects to see its former fighters
included in new local police forces. The KLA's political leadership
has condemned the recent killings of Serbs. But it must do more to
assert effective discipline, making clear that any members taking
part in such violence will be expelled from the group and turned
over to the authorities for prosecution. KLA leaders must also
press their members to surrender their heavy weapons immediately.
</P>
<P>
   NATO was meant to take on law enforcement duties only for a
brief period, while the U.N. recruited and trained an international
civilian police force. U.N. officials fought hard for this role,
but they have been much less aggressive in carrying it out. As of
today a little more than 500 of the more than 3,000 expected police
officers are available, most having arrived very recently. The
current target is to have 2,000 officers available by late
September. That is too little too late. The overall force needs to
be expanded to something like 5,000, and most of it needs to be
ready for action by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   If the criminal violence pervading Kosovo is not soon ended, the
province's economic assets will be controlled not by the most able
and entrepreneurial but by the most ruthless and heavily armed.
Fair elections will become impossible. Kosovo's economic recovery
and return to self-government could be indefinitely delayed. NATO
did not drive Slobodan Milosevic's brutal occupation army out of
Kosovo to allow a new era of disorder to commence.

RESENDING FOR ALL  
 `STUDENT-DRIVER' HANAUER PAYS HOMAGE TO MENTOR MUNCEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If Chip Hanauer had his way he would have retired in
1982 after winning his first Gold Cup _ unlimited hydroplane
racing's crown jewel. He genuinely doubted his racing career could
get any more magical.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hanauer's third victory and remains number one No. 1 in
his heart because of the emotional circumstances surrounding it. It
was his first win after replacing his mentor, the late racing
champion Bill Muncey, as driver.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades and seven driver championships later, Hanauer
comes to the Seafair General Motors Cup on Lake Washington this
weekend needing only one more victory in the Fred Leland-owned Miss
Pico to tie Muncey's all-time record 62 victories. Although you'd
think the occasion warrants great celebration and anticipation, the
Seattle native has mixed feelings about the feat.
</P>
<P>
   Hanauer strongly believes that not all records are made to be
broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways I wouldn't want to break the record,'' Hanauer
said. ``I already have more Gold Cups (11) and national
championships than Bill. Frankly, I don't feel all that good about
taking this record away. He's Bill Muncey; he's a legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it would be bittersweet. Bill's memory has more
of a good use for the record than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Muncey's widow, Fran, has always encouraged
Hanauer to stay after the record. She welcomed his return from the
sport this season after a 2{-year absence in hopes Hanauer would go
down in history alongside her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Muncey and Hanauer have remained close friends. She arrives
in Seattle Thursday to witness Hanauer's weekend run for the record
and for her induction into the Hydroplane Hall of Fame along with
George Henley and Bill Brow.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fran Muncey, Hanauer's competitors and those that have
followed the sport may be more enthusiastic about the impending
record than he is. Hanauer sees it more as another victory for his
team. Others believe Hanauer's quest has energized the sport and
drawn welcome welcomed attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like comparing apples and oranges for different sports,
but for our sport this is like him getting the home run record,''
said Dr. Ken Muscatel, commissioner of the Unlimited Hydroplane
Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think the home run record would stand longer. Then
again no one ever thought Bill's record would be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is newly- crowned home run king Mark McGwire
never competed alongside Roger Maris, whose record he broke. They
never spent long afternoons in the dugout talking about the nuances
of their sport, a veteran teaching the up-and-comer.
</P>
<P>
   Hanauer and Muncey did share that type of relationship, and
understanding their bond helps us appreciate Hanauer's reverence
for Muncey, if not for the record run itself.
</P>
<P>
   Muncey was about to clinch his sixth and final championship when
Hanauer came on the scene in the late 1970s and early '80s, but the
veteran liked the young driver so much they raced as teammates in
off-weekend endurance events around the West Coast. It wasn't so
much a tutorial in the art of driving a boat as a primer in being a
champion, in representing the sport with poise and personality.
</P>
<P>
   Muncey wasn't just a champion driver, he was hydroplane racing's
showman, a reporter's ideal interview, the series ambassador. As
Fran Muncey likes to joke, ``No one else needed to talk because
Bill did the talking for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   That couldn't have been a better situation for Hanauer at the
time. Although he is considered one of sports' best interviews now,
when Hanauer first started racing he was extremely shy, a
``yes-and-no'' answer kind of guy. Then Muncey started dragging
Hanauer along to his own news conferences and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Hanauer still laughs remembering a particular interview with a
Seattle television station after one of the pair's endurance races.
The boat broke with Muncey at the helm on the first lap of the
nine-hour event. With Hanauer sitting expressionless at his side,
Muncey told the reporter that Chip was driving at the time and made
a mistake costing them the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told this whole story that was untrue and so I finally had
to say, `Wait a minute, that's not how it was,''' Hanauer said.
``He had been prodding me to talk and take the initiative, and so
really he forced the issue on me. He had always told me that I had
the ability to drive, so we didn't need to go there. He wanted me
to learn not to be so shy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the lesson was put to the test earlier than anyone could
have imagined. Muncey was killed in a crash while leading the final
heat of the 1981 season finale, the Acapulco World Championship in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Bill cared so much about the sport, he always made me
promise that if anything ever happened to him that I'd get the boat
to the next race _ that the race must go on,'' Fran Muncey said.
``I felt I had to honor his request, and Bill always liked Chip
because he was such a good student of the sport. Chip was my only
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Fran Muncey and her new driver carried on with the Atlas
Van Lines team, and the results never reflected the great
challenges this new adventure handed them. Not only did Hanauer win
the 1982 Gold Cup, he won four other races en route to the season
championship and collected two more titles during his seven-year
tenure with Muncey's team.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Hanauer, who also had stints in the Circus Circus
and Miss Budweiser boats, successfully made the transition from
introverted young driver to experienced professional. He is
accessible to the media, popular with fans and Seattle's favorite
homegrown sports figure.
</P>
<P>
   And like Muncey, Hanauer has managed to protect his privacy away
from the racing circuit. He escaped to his beach home this week for
a little peace before the Seafair hubbub begins. And there's even a
slim chance Hanauer will take himself out of the cockpit this
weekend since his neck and back are still sore from a horrifying
flip-over last weekend at Tri-Cities.
</P>
<P>
   The chase for the record has almost become more a burden than a
notch in his belt. The expectations, the constant hype have Hanauer
eager to accomplish the feat as much for relief as for glory.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the rare moments Hanauer allows himself to reflect upon
the significance of this accomplishment, he is humble and
respectful.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it says was that I was fortunate enough to work with
talented people a whole lot of years, and I rode on their
shoulders,'' Hanauer said. ``I contributed my portion, and I'm
proud of that, but the thing that means the most to me is that the
guys that have worked so hard on the boat have entrusted it to me,
and I was able to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel if it (the record) would happen, we've kept it in the
family, and I hope Bill would look at it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fran Muncey assures the family would have it no other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often ask me who I think is the better driver,'' Fran
Muncey said. ``Bill was more a showman and cared about building the
sport. Chip is so focused and concentrated every time he goes out
in the boat, he could never just let even one heat slide. In seven
years he drove for us, he never made one driver error that caused
us to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Muncey and Chip Hanauer are both my heroes. Not only are
they the very best people in the world at what they did, they are
honorable and decent human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   It's likely Hanauer will cherish that legacy most _ not victory
No. 63.
</P>
<P>
   His return this season and the ensuing record run have
invigorated the sport and given it an element of intrigue that's
been waning the past few years. People across the world are
interested in hydroplanes again.
</P>
<P>
   And that, Chip, would also make Bill Muncey proud.

GOP-LED CONGRESS SENDS TAX-CUT BILL TO PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-controlled Congress Thursday
narrowly approved the largest tax-cut plan in history, hurtling
toward a showdown with President Clinton that party leaders said
could affect a generation of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the proposed $792 billion tax-break, 50-49, as
GOP leaders barely avoided an embarrassing setback. A preliminary
version passed the Senate last week, 57-43, but four moderate
Republicans joined the unified Democratic minority in opposing the
final package.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP defectors included both Maine senators, Olympia J. Snowe
and Susan M. Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The only senator who was absent, Republican Michael D. Crapo of
Idaho, would have voted for the measure if he were not at his
daughter's wedding, his office said.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the Senate vote, the House approved the final plan,
221-206.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP measure, which Clinton vowed to veto to not ``let
America go down the drain,'' would provide a potpourri of tax
savings over the next decade to every category of taxpayer and an
array of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans leaders said they will hold the bill until September
to try to build public support for the massive package before
sending it to the White House for Clinton's veto. Recent polls have
shown the public considers tax cuts a relatively low priority.
</P>
<P>
   The veto ultimately could be just the start of serious bargining
on a compromise, but so far, both sides are yielding no ground.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening salvos of the high-stakes struggle Thursday, both
parties staged last-minute unity rallies on Capitol Hill. GOP
leaders hailed the bill's final passage as a watershed moment in
their campaign to weaken Washington's control of the government's
pursestrings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really about downsizing the power of Washington and
upsizing the power of people,'' said Representative Bill Archer,
the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cast the plan as a looming economic calamity. By
granting nearly $800 billion in tax breaks, Democrats charged,
Republican leaders could leave the government too short on cash to
fund vital federal programs and maintain the nation's current
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This big luxury liner of a tax cut is headed for an iceberg,
and it just might take the American economy down with it,'' said
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is certain to surface in the 2000 elections for
Congress, as it did Thursday in the race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   While Vice President Al Gore was poised to block the Republican
plan by casting the decisive vote if the Senate had deadlocked on
the issue, Texas Governor George W. Bush was endorsing the GOP
measure during a campaign swing through Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my judgment, we ought to pass back the money to the people
who pay the taxes,'' said Bush, the frontrunner in the race for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The final tax package, crafted this week in closed-door
negotations among Republican leaders, would reduce each of the five
income-tax rates by 1 percentage point. The plan also calls for
cutting capital gains taxes for individuals, easing the so-called
``marriage penalty,'' abolishing inheritance taxes, and
establishing breaks for special interests as diverse as chicken
growers and maple syrup makers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and most Democrats said the best way to allocate a
projected $3 trillion federal surplus over the next 10 years would
be to shore up the Social Security and Medicare programs, reduce
the national debt, and preserve sufficient levels of government
spending.
</P>
<P>
   In accusing Republican leaders of playing politics at the
expense of sound ecomonic policy, Senator John F. Kerry denounced
the GOP plan as ``snake oil.'' Representative J. Joseph Moakley of
South Boston, the senior House Democrat from New England, described
the final package as ``an all-you-can-eat tax-break smorgasbord
that is unbelievably expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the measure's final passage was a prized moment for House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, who was seen as putting his job on the
line to muster support for the plan. ``We have a good deal for the
American people,'' Hastert said. ``It's fair, responsible and
balanced tax-relief bill.''
</P>
<P>
   In the House, only five Republicans and four Democrats broke
party ranks on the final vote. None were from New England.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the New Englanders voting was Representative
Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, who underwent quintuple
bypass heart surgery last week.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Snowe and Collins, the only Senate Republicans who
voted against the final package were Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania
and George V. Voinovich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe criticized leaders of both parties for their roles in the
tax-cut debate. A key supporter of a compromise, $500 billion tax
break, Snowe accused Clinton of refusing ``to negotiate in good
faith'' and blamed GOP leaders for holding ``one-sided
negotiations'' on the final package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of sending a tax bill to the White House that is DOA,
we should be doing CPR on the legislation here in Congress to agree
on a level of tax cuts that could become law,'' she said.

EDITORIAL: CRIME ON WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Aug. 6: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stealing money from investors is not nearly as simple as robbing
a bank. The criminals often need the cooperation of legitimate
professionals who are willing to look the other way.
</P>
<P>
   So it appears to have been with Bear Stearns, one of the
nation's largest securities firms and a leader in processing
transactions for smaller brokerage firms, a role known on Wall
Street as clearing. Bear Stearns served as the clearing firm for
A.R. Baron, a penny-stock firm that was later convicted of
defrauding its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns Thursday settled civil allegations brought by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and by the Manhattan district
attorney. It will pay a total of $38.5 million, most of which will
go to compensate Baron's defrauded customers.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations laid out by the SEC, which Bear Stearns neither
admitted nor denied, paint a picture of a firm that had clear
evidence that Baron was routinely committing fraud by making
unauthorized trades in customer accounts. Yet Bear Stearns aided
and abetted those crimes, the SEC said. At the same time, the SEC
said, Richard Harriton, the Bear Stearns executive in charge of the
clearing operation, entered into a side deal with Baron's top
officer designed to enrich Harriton. Harriton, who resigned from
his post at Bear Stearns, denies wrongdoing and says he will fight
civil charges brought by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC complaint says that Baron would have gone out of
business _ thus preventing it from defrauding many customers _ long
before it did had not Bear Stearns continued to process its trades
and failed to act on the clear evidence that fraud was taking
place.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC action establishes, in the words of Richard Walker, the
commission's enforcement director, that any brokerage firm ``that
engages in conduct enabling a boiler room like Baron to defraud
investors of millions of dollars is fully responsible for its
actions.'' It is sad that there was a need to teach such a lesson.

HOLE-IN-ONE HELPS LOVANDER TO TIE IN LPGA OPENING ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUTTON, Mass _ Marilyn Lovander is something of a golfing
vagabond, although she seems to have settled nicely in the Futures
Tour which is the women's equivalent of the Nike Tour. She's
currently the leading the money-winner, but with a short field in
the inaugural LPGA areaWEB.com Challenge she earned a spot in the
field and showed up for Thursday's opening round at Pleasant Valley
CC with high hopes.
</P>
<P>
   She seized the opportunity, putting together a round of minus-6
66 that was punctuated by a hole-in-one on the seventh hole when
she sank an 8-iron from 136 yards. She was eventually tied at 66 by
Australian Mardi Lunn, who had to sit out a storm delay of 2 hours,
19 minutes before returning to the sixth tee and promptly birdied
the hole to set up her 6-under-par round.
</P>
<P>
   This was a day of low scoring. Lovander and Lunn lead by just a
shot over New England's perennial winner Dotti Pepper, Jackie
Gallagher-Smith, and Caroline Blaylock. The storm soaked the course
briefly, and lightning in the vicinity further delayed play.
</P>
<P>
   Lovander, who has missed the cut in three of the five LPGA
events she has played in, made the turn in minus-5 32. She birdied
her first by sinking a 20-foot putt, her second with a chip to 4
feet, fifth (4-iron, 7 feet), 7th (5-iron, 12 feet) and ninth (sand
wedge, 10 feet). The bogey came on her sixth out of the left tree
line. After a birdie on her 11th (chip, 4 feet), she went to her
16th (the par-3 seventh) and holed her tee shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited,'' she said, ``but you still have the rest of
the round. It's fun to think about it later, like right now. But I
turned right around and bogeyed the next hole, so that brings you
back to earth. I'm missing an event on the Futures Tour, so they'll
all have a chance to catch up to me before the final event. This is
my 11th event in a row, so I'm just really tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the difference today. You just stand up and
see things how they are. OK, it's 136 yards. I guess it's an
8-iron. I was very relaxed out there. I started playing the Futures
Tour again this year because I just couldn't get into any
tournaments out here. Then I kept finishing in the top three every
week, so it became a bit of a priority. The top three get exempt
cards for the LPGA Tour next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunn, who grew up in the town of Liverpool and resides in Cowra
over the Green Mountains west of Sydney, has been cheered on by her
mother, Val, who has been here six weeks and seen her daughter post
a third and a second as she tries to zero in on making the top 30.
``I've played pretty well since she's been here,'' said Mardi Lunn.
``She comes once a year, and I always seem to play well. I have no
idea why that is.''
</P>
<P>
   She started on the 10th tee and had a bogey-free round of
33-33-66. She returned to the course and rolled in a 35-foot putt
for a birdie, and missed birdie putts of 8 feet and 10 feet on her
final two holes. Sister Karen is playing this week in the Scottish
Open since she's on the European Tour, but the two will be together
next week at the British Women's Open. ``I wanted to play here,''
she said. The big difference has been in the putter. ``I went to a
mallet putter for the first time in my life,'' she said, ``and then
I started to make a few.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, who won the old Welch's at Blue Hill CC, the LPGA
Friendly's at Crestview, and the LPGA Classic at Stratton Mountain
and was runner-up in the NCAAs on Cape Cod, started her round with
two birdies and had only one bogey (fourth) when she missed a
3-foot putt. ``I had some good chances out there,'' she said. I
left a few hanging. So it was nice to have those chances. I think I
was more comfortable with the putter in my hands today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher-Smith made the turn in minus-5 31, went to 7-under
with birdies on her 12th and 13th holes. She returned to earth with
a bogey out of trees on her 14th and a second out of the trees on
the next hole. She struggled early this year, but put it all
together to win the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic two weeks ago in
Warren, Ohio. ``I think it was a surprise,'' she said. Even while I
was playing I didn't realize I was going to win. So it never
totally sunk in. I always felt I could win, but for it to finally
happen was very special.''

disappeared off Martha's Vineyard, so reports of their passing were
buried inside most newspapers under truckloads of JFK Jr. and ``the

   Articles describing the accident that killed Army Sgt. William
``Gunz'' Wright, 27, and Spc. Sherwood B. Brim, 30, first appeared
July 20 on Page A14 of the ``Washington Post,'' and on Page A12 of
``The Arizona Republic,'' and on Page A7 of the Minneapolis ``Star

<P>
   The two men were in an armored personnel carrier that overturned
while on patrol, killing them and injuring three others. The

   The other soldier, William Wright, grew up in northern
California. He joined the Army while still a student at Fort Bragg
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Reports say that, earlier this year, he chose a two-year
deployment in Schweinfurt over a one-year stay in South Korea
because Germany was a place where he could bring along his family.

RARE CANCER IN AMOCO EMPLOYEES IS PROBABLY WORK RELATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ill., Md.)  (rk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After a three-year study, medical investigators
working for the BP Amoco Corp. said Thursday that an unusually high
incidence of a rare brain cancer among some employees at a research
center near here was most likely work-related.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, who were hired from the University of Alabama
and Johns Hopkins University, said that although the findings were
preliminary and did not pinpoint a cause, the statistical evidence
suggested that ``occupational exposure'' might have affected six
chemical researchers who in the last decade were found to have a
rare and often deadly form of brain cancer called glioma. At the
same time, the investigators said they found no evidence that about
13 other cases of nonglioma brain tumors were work-related.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing a large group of current and former
employees in lawsuits against the company criticized the
conclusions Thursday, saying that the Amoco study was neither
thorough nor independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study was bought and paid for by Amoco; it's hardly an
independent study,'' said Tilden Katz, a spokesman for Corboy &AMP;
Demetrio, a law firm in Chicago that is representing nonglioma
cancer victims. ``We have clients who had brain tumors who were
never contacted by Amoco,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, about 19 people who had worked at the Amoco Research
Center in Naperville, Ill., a Chicago suburb, were found to have
brain tumors. Officials of Amoco, the giant oil company, say they
have been working vigorously to find a cause, but even medical
experts say that the major difficulty in resolving the case is that
science has not found a definitive cause of brain cancer in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to spend three years studying something and
not to have a definitive answer,'' said Jim D. Lowry, the chairman
of BP Amoco's health investigation task force. ``We are hopeful
that the clues the investigators have uncovered will in some way
help health scientists in their efforts to identify the causes of
brain cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 19 brain tumor victims who have been identified by Amoco,
investigators say they have only found a pattern that would suggest
work-related causes among the six glioma victims, all of whom were
long-term chemical researchers often working on similar projects
with similar chemicals and in the same building. Amoco officials
said the investigators do not believe the other brain tumors were
work-related.
</P>
<P>
   There was no unusual pattern of workplace, time or common agents
used by others who had inter-cranial tumors, the company said. Of
the six glioma victims, five have died. All 13 other brain tumor
victims are alive, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Naperville Thursday, members of a health
task force formed by Amoco in 1989 said the university researchers
(who were not present at the news conference) had not identified a
specific cancer-causing agent, but they did find that two types of
chemical agents, low-level ionizing radiation and a solvent called
n-hexane, were used by the glioma victims.
</P>
<P>
   Those agents, which are not believed to cause cancer, are
probably not the cause of the brain cancers, officials said. But
they may hold clues to the mysterious outbreak here, which surfaced
in 1989. Amoco officials said both agents had been largely phased
out at the Naperville Research Center, and that the solvent
n-hexane is now little used because it is known to cause damage to
nerves in the hands and feet. It is not a carcinogen and not known
to damage the central nervous system, but it is toxic, Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two are not necessarily the cause but suspects,'' said
Michael S. Wells, a health manager at BP Amoco. ``The investigators
do not believe they could be the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen cancer victims _ mostly nonglioma _ have
joined a series of lawsuits arguing that in the 1970s and 1980s
Amoco knowingly exposed employees to toxic chemicals and unsafe
conditions despite repeated complaints about faulty ventilation
systems and dangerous storage conditions. Amoco officials, however,
have said that those problems were fixed long ago and have been
largely ruled out as possible causes of the brain tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco officials say they will continue working with victims but
have not decided whether they will offer monetary compensation.
``We're going to do the responsible thing,'' said Wells.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it has spent millions of dollars over the past
few years trying to determine whether the brain tumors were
work-related.Thursday, members of the task force said they had long
suspected that the cause of some of the cancers was work-related
and that they had known from earlier studies that the rate of
glioma at the Naperville center was about eight times higher than
that of the general population.
</P>

BAEZ PARALYZED FROM WAIST DOWN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Rudy Baez, injured in a spill at Rockingham Park in
Salem, N.H., Wednesday, is paralyzed from the waist down.
</P>
<P>
   Baez underwent seven hours of surgery at Massachusetts General
Hospital Thursday, and, while a hospital spokesperson would say
only that he is ``still in serious condition,'' Mike Szpuk, Baez's
agent, said the rider, who was in surgery from 11 a.m. until 6
p.m., ``had a severe spinal cord injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Szpuk was present when doctors informed Baez's wife, Judy, of
the situation following the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like he'll be able to walk at all,'' said
Szpuk. ``He has movement in his arms and his breathing is all
right, but his lower body is gone. He was unconscious when I saw
him after the operation. His face is swollen to twice its normal
size and his eyes are swollen shut. It was a terrible sight. He's
going to be confined to a wheelchair. His riding career is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in God's hands right now. Whatever happens, his recovery
will be a long process. I've been with him 15 years, and I've known
him for 25. As far as I'm concerned, he's one of my own family.
He's like a brother to me. It's heart-breaking to see this. Judy
has been great, and all of the family has been strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Baez, 49, was thrown from his mount, Gaitor Bait, during the
running of the second race Wednesday. The horse clipped the heels
of a horse in front of him as the field began to crowd a 16th of a
mile out of the gate. Baez was hurled forward as his horse fell and
appeared to land headfirst on the track.
</P>
<P>
   The injured jockey, perenially New England's leading rider, was
taken by ambulance to Holy Family Hospital in Methuen, where he was
stabilized, then airlifted to Mass. General.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 50 years, there's been nobody like Rudy in New
England,'' Szpuk said. ``He rides just as hard to get second,
third, and fourth, so he can get people checks. He's a God-fearing
guy. He's fighting for his life. If he comes out of this,
regardless of what happens, he'll pick his life up. He believes in
God, and he believes things happen for a reason. No matter how this
turns out, he'll make a good life for himself. I'll be with him,
whether he's riding or not. He'll always be No. 1 to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Szpuk, who was on vacation, was not at Rock when Baez went down,
but he has strong feelings about the way jockeys ride in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody to blame,'' said Szpuk. ``That's how this game
goes every day. Somebody squeezes somebody else. Stuff happens with
these horses. Nobody goes out to hurt anybody. He'd never put the
blame on anybody in a race. Once the gate opens, you never know
what will happen. The horses weigh 1,000 pounds and the jockeys
weigh 100 pounds. The other jockeys get aggressive and so does
Rudy. But nobody goes out with the intention to hurt anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Baez, who resides in suburban Wakefield with his wife and three
children, was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. He began
riding as a 13-year-old in his native country. He rode his first
winner in the United States at Detroit Racecourse in 1973, arrived
in New England in 1974, and was a star on the local circuit ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   He rode nearly 28,000 races and came home first 4,874 times,
with his mounts earning nearly $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Baez captured 13 riding titles at Suffolk Downs and 10 at
Rockingham. In '91, Baez rode seven winners on a card at Rock and
finished second in the nation in races won (to Pat Day) with 431.
Last Saturday, Baez rode Lambana to victory in the $100,000 Spicy
Living Sweepstakes, one of the biggest races of the year at Rock.
It was one of the biggest victories of Baez's career.

U.S. AGREES TO MORE THAN DOUBLE THE PRICE IT PAYS FOR ANTHRAX
VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (yn) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's plan to vaccinate every member of
the nation's armed services against the deadly biological agent
anthrax _ a program already buffeted by questions about safety and
effectiveness _ just became a lot more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the possibility of running out of vaccine, the
Pentagon announced Thursday that it had agreed to more than double
what it pays the nation's only licensed manufacturer of the
vaccine, Bioport Corp. of Lansing, Mich., to produce millions of
doses over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   The company _ a new corporation whose directors include William
J. Crowe Jr., the retired admiral who was chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and ambassador to Britain _ bought the laboratory
from the state of Michigan last year for $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the Pentagon's commitment to vaccinate all 2.4
million active-duty troops and reservists, the company had
financial trouble and in June warned that it could fail if the
Pentagon did not pay more.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of frantic negotiations, the Pentagon agreed to pay
$10.64 a dose for the vaccine, up from the $4.36 a dose under the
terms Bioport agreed to when it bought the laboratory last year.
The total cost of the contract, which requires the company to
produce fewer doses, will rise to $49.8 million over the next five
years, from $25.7 million now.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also agreed to advance Bioport $18.7 million to
help it cover debts.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials, who appeared at the Pentagon to announce the
agreement but then insisted that they not be identified by name,
justified the sharp increase in the contract, saying it was vital
to national security that Bioport, as the only producer of the
vaccine, remain solvent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action was taken to preserve the financial viability of
Bioport in order to ensure uninterrupted production of the anthrax
vaccine,'' the Pentagon said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is a naturally occurring bacterium that infects cattle
and sheep. When produced as dry spores, it can be incorporated into
one of the deadliest biological agents, capable of causing death
within days of being inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   Although no country has ever used anthrax in battle, the
Pentagon says that 10 countries, including Iraq and North Korea,
have the ability to make biological weapons; in December 1997,
Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered every service member to
be vaccinated against anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Thursday prompted criticism from lawmakers and
others who have opposed the program for a variety of reasons,
including concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., said the increase was ``a
classic example'' of the problems of having a sole source for a
product or service. Shays, whose subcommittee on government reform
met in June on Bioport's problems, said the Pentagon's
determination to move ahead with the vaccinations regardless of
questions forced the price higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no way of knowing what's a fair price,'' he said. ``My
recommendation would have been to put this program on hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the program began, the Pentagon has vaccinated 320,000
service members, beginning with those serving in the Persian Gulf
or Korea or in units likely to be called into combat. The
vaccination regimen requires six shots over 18 months, then annual
booster shots.
</P>
<P>
   Although the vaccine was approved for use by the Food and Drug
Administration in 1970, largely for veterinarians and others who
work with livestock, there has been scattered resistance to the
vaccination program, with scores of troops refusing to take the
shots, citing fears about the safety of the vaccine and adverse
reactions to it.
</P>
<P>
   At least 200 service members, have been disciplined for their
defiance, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   As it completed its purchase last year, Bioport negotiated its
contract with the Pentagon setting the price per dose at $4.36, a
price the company's spokeswoman acknowledged today grossly
underestimated the manufacturing costs and subsidies from the state
government. The law allows companies to seek ``extraordinary
contractual relief'' in certain instances like financial distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not begin to anticipate the cost of producing the
vaccines,'' the spokeswoman, Kelly Rossman-McKinney, said of the
company's executives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rossman-McKinney said Crowe did not take part in the
negotiations over the anthrax contract.

CUBAN JUMPER DENIES COCAINE USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _ Cuban high jumper Javier Sotomayor angrily
denied Thursday that he had taken cocaine before winning a gold
medal at the Pan American Games here last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have only seen that substance in the movies,'' Sotomayor
insisted in Granma, the Communist Party daily newspaper. ``I don't
need any kind of trick to jump 2.30'' meters (7 feet 6 inches). ``I
am a victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotomayor, the world record-holder and 1992 Olympic champion,
was stripped of his Pan Am medal after testing positive for cocaine
and is likely to be banned from both this month's world outdoor
track and field championships and next summer's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials, who say they will appeal Sotomayor's case, have
claimed that either his food or drink was spiked or that his urine
sample was manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans have been unhappy with everybody from the Games
organizers to the local newspapers, with president Fidel Castro
complaining about ``tricks and dirtiness'' designed to hurt them in
the medal count and to provoke their athletes into defecting.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans are especially angry at the tabloid Winnipeg Sun,
which is running a ``Come on Down to Cuba'' contest and offering a
week's vacation for two on the island for guessing the number of
defectors during the Games. While five Cubans have already sought
asylum with the Canadian government, at least three others are
reportedly missing from the delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the turmoil has hurt the Cubans in the standings.
They're sitting a strong third behind the United States and Canada
and will pick up another dozen medals in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A hasty retreat
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How determined were the Cubans to keep their ballplayers away
from agents and other provocateurs here? The team collected its
gold medals at 11 p.m. Monday. By 2 a.m., they were on a plane
bound for Havana . . . The US did little better than expected this
week in qualifying teams for the Olympics. The baseball team made
it by reaching the final and the men's water polo team grabbed its
slot by beating the Cubans for the gold medal. But neither the
men's nor women's field hockey teams qualified and both handball
teams fell short, losing to the Cubans Thursday. The women's field
hockey team gets another chance, though, at a special event in
England in March and should qualify there. Both basketball teams
are already set for Sydney, as are women's soccer and softball. The
indoor volleyball teams and men's soccer squad have qualifying
events ahead and the women's water polo team has a second shot
after missing out in the FINA Cup.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hired guns
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though virtually none of the US baseball players who earned the
Olympic berth here will get to compete in the Games (since they'll
probably be on 40-man major league rosters next summer), they
weren't just here for the love. Each man receives $9,000 plus $70
per diem _ and got to stay at the upscale Fort Garry Hotel instead
of in the University of Manitoba dorms . . . While the Pan Am
organizers were hoping to sell 600,000 tickets to the Games
(roughly one per Winnipeg resident) they'll be lucky to hit
500,000, their break-even point. As of Wednesday, the total was
450,000 . . . Yes, the US women's soccer program does have
something in the pipeline. The under-18 team, which outscored the
opposition, 22-2, blanked Mexico, 1-0, Thursday to win the gold
medal. ``People were asking us if we were the World Cup team,''
said Catherine Reddick, who scored the lone goal. ``We said, no,
we're their understudies.'' . . . Fall River judoka (and former
Detroit Lion) Joe Felton, after being thrown in the bronze medal
match by his Venezuelan rival: ``Judo is nothing like football. If
you screw up in football, you have the rest of the game. But
there's only a split second in judo.''

OUR HOUSE IS SOLD, BUT CAN I BUY BACK THE MEMORIES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When the house I grew up in went up for sale, I
couldn't blame anybody.
</P>
<P>
   My sister Lisa and her husband had been living in that house
after my parents moved several years ago, and, quite frankly, the
neighborhood had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the old neighbors started moving away. They sold
their houses to people who let their yards go, didn't water their
trees, and who considered their front yards to be extensions of
their living rooms, hauling out couches, chairs and tables and just
leaving them there until the weeds eventually hid them.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it was rather sad to see our neighborhood disintegrate
like that. For my sister, who still lived in it, it was a test of
faith. Across the street, her new neighbor had been mowing the lawn
when the motor seized. Apparently discouraged by the unfortunate
events, he simply gave up and left the lawn mower to rust in its
dead tracks, where it sat six months later.
</P>
<P>
   The folks who lived in the home behind Lisa developed something
of a chicken farm on their patio, which for a rural couple seems
quaint, but when you're living a block away from Squaw Peak
Parkway, it's a little disturbing, especially the time a nasty
chicken chased my sister down the alley while she was taking out
the trash.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose the last straw in Lisa's patience was when the
neighbor next door to the Chicken People dragged home a dilapidated
railroad car, parked it in his back yard and used it as a tool
shed. Although my sister quickly added two feet of height to the
block fence in her back yard, the damage was done. She was ready to
spike a ``For Sale'' sign into the same front yard where I once did
cartwheels under the huge olive trees.
</P>
<P>
   When she told me the house had sold, I was both relieved and
happy for her, but I wasn't really sad. It was just a house, after
all, and now it was a house in a crappy neighborhood. On the day
Lisa moved, I went over to help out. I was standing in the empty
kitchen, staring at the Z Brick my father had slapped onto the
walls, when it hit me.
</P>
<P>
   We were losing our house. OUR HOUSE.
</P>
<P>
   Our house, where up against that wall, my mom used to lie on the
couch with her hand over her eyes because she got a headache in
1972 that never went away.
</P>
<P>
   Our house, where, in this same spot, I came home drunk for the
first time at age 16, and despite the fact that I had vomit up my
nose and my unfortunate friend Doug had to hold me up with both his
arms, my mother ``insisted'' I was ``spaced out on LSD'' and
demanded that I confess. I guess she was too busy giving birth in
the '60s to know any better.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall is my bedroom, where, during a freak-out fit of
child anger, Lisa, then 8, blew a hole through the door with her
foot when she discovered I cooked and ate her last E-Z Bake Oven
cake. It was ``chocolate''.
</P>
<P>
   Across the hall is her room, where, as a fourth-grader, she
cried for nearly seven hours straight after my mother gave her a
home perm that made her look like a Harlem Globetrotter.
</P>
<P>
   The next door down is my parents' room, where she stood one
Sunday morning, screaming at age 5, ``OPEN UP, MOMMY! WHY IS THE
DOOR LOCKED? WHO IS GOING TO GET ME MY SUGAR SMACKS?''
</P>
<P>
   Across the hall was my other sister's room, where she ran after
a particularly gruesome fight, slamming the door so hard that it
broke the lock and we had to call my Uncle Jimmy to disassemble the
window to let her out.
</P>
<P>
   The back yard marks the spot where I taught Lisa, then in eighth
grade, how to smoke in lieu of eating her E-Z Bake Oven cake. I lit
it for her, told her to suck superhard and to hold it as long as
she could. Three seconds later, she threw up in the grass.
</P>
<P>
   I smiled. She's a non-smoker.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the same place that my other sister pinched (her
fingers had the strength of a lobster) and taunted me until I
picked up a dried-up, nearly white dog turd and hit her in the leg
with it, upon which she immediately threw up, ran to her bedroom
and slammed the door, which resulted in the call to Uncle Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the yard is the swimming pool, where Lisa,
then a 9-year-old full-fledged spaz, rode her bike into the deep
end because she couldn't see past her huge perm head.
</P>
<P>
   In the corner of the yard is a fig tree, sturdy, tall and
massive, producing figs that practically drip honey. My father
planted that tree almost 30 years ago, when it was a 12-inch sprout
taken from my great-grandfather's fig tree in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   On the side of the patio is the storage room, bearing a
puke-green door. On the inside face of that door, in pencil, are
the names of myself and my two sisters, and hash marks that
documented how we grew until we all peaked out at 5 feet 5. Lisa's
son, now 3, matches the exact height that she was when my dad
started measuring.
</P>
<P>
   Our house.
</P>
<P>
   I drove by our house awhile ago. The new owner hadn't moved in,
but she had hired people to chop down every tree in the front yard
and rented a massive Dumpster to place the debris of the demolished
Z Brick wall and other structurally important elements she was
ripping out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   I called Lisa that night and asked her if she thought the new
owner had pitched the green door into the Dumpster, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably,'' she sighed. ``She called Dad and offered to
``sell'' it to him. He told me to peek in the alley every now and
then to see if it was out there, but I'm too afraid of that damn
chicken. It's just a door with some marks on it, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's just a written-on door,'' I agreed, nodding,
although I understood that we both knew better. &QL;

WORK HARD. YOU MIGHT WIN A PRIZE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Tenn., N.J., Ohio)   (af)  
 By LIZ MURRAY GARRIGAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ In the tightest labor market in decades,
entrepreneurs are finding that keeping their best workers happy _
and loyal _ is one of their most compelling missions. And in going
beyond the usual thank-you notes and bonuses, creative cosseting
counts.
</P>
<P>
   At Assigned Counsel Inc., a kind of temporary-employment service
for lawyers, executives have, arranged lawn care for employees for
bringing in a large account and treated them and their spouses to
dinner when they have been working especially hard.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, based in Wayne, Pa., will even set up home offices for
the lawyers it places, ``as long as they're responsive to the
client,'' said Samuel A. Frederick, a principal at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick and other executives at Assigned Counsel, which made
Inc. magazine's 1998 list of the 500 fastest-growing companies in
America, met with their peers recently in Nashville for the
magazine's annual gathering of the winners. While the group tackled
more than a few heady topics during the three-day event, the most
pressing issue for the entrepreneurs _ whose companies, on average,
are just eight years old _ was simple: keeping good employees and
hiring others like them.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it was ideas like the free lawn care that really
got their attention, not the more predictable ones like private
equity finance, taking a company public and other ways to advance
their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody kind of has that aspect down,'' said William R.
Botti, founder of Computer Networks, a systems integration company
in Pleasanton, Calif. _ or they would not have been invited to the
gathering in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems we have in finding, motivating and keeping
quality people is an overall theme that everybody's talking
about,'' Botti said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more flamboyant gestures by small businesses to keep
their employees have made headlines. Arcnet, for example, a
Holmdel, N.J., company that designs and builds wireless
communications systems, recently gave leased BMWs, with fully paid
insurance, to 28 of its 57 employees, ranging from administrative
assistants to architects, who had been there at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Arcnet and other companies are finding that rewards, large and
small, prove much cheaper than new rounds of recruiting and
training.
</P>
<P>
   An Inc. roundtable on employee retention got Botti and his wife
and partner, Janet M. Botti, scratching their heads. As several
capitalists around the table talked with frustration about how
offering stock to employees made their companies run like
committees and made them feel that their influence had been
diluted, Gary L. Quick, founder and chief executive of Quick
Solutions, a computer consulting company in Columbus, Ohio,
suddenly raised his hand. What he said made the Bottis _ and
everyone else in the room _ wonder why they hadn't thought of the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Quick explained that after an employee has been aboard for three
years, the company pays to have the employee's house cleaned once a
month. It is an investment that costs $60 to $120 a month,
depending on the size of the house, but the payoff is much more
valuable, Quick told his colleagues,
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all just sitting there going, `Great idea,''' Botti
said.
</P>
<P>
   Quick was an executive recruiter for 18 years before starting
his own consulting business. If those years taught him anything, he
said, it was that ``the warm and fuzzy things really work with
employees.'' Pasta baskets for new employees and cookies on
birthdays _ all sent to employees' homes _ go further than cash, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes to the home, this goes to the spouse, and the way I
look at it, you get more bang for your buck,'' Quick said.
</P>
<P>
   Giving employees a $1,200-a-year vacation allowance, too, can
inspire loyalty in a way that a cash bonus can't, he said.
Originally, he said, he thought of offering an annual cruise to
employees with at least three years at the company _ there are
about 60 of them among its 250 consultants. ``Then some of the
people started asking when we announced it if they don't want to do
the cruise, can we do something else?'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission voted Thursday to relax
rules that have limited television station ownership for most of
the century, allowing for the first time a single company or
network to own two separate stations in the nation's largest
cities.
</P>
<P>
   One immediate result of the decision may be a rush by big
television companies like the broadcast networks to sweep up any
available television stations in cities where they already own a
station. As put in one memo to the top corporate officers at one of
the four big broadcast networks, ``The race is on.''
</P>
<P>
   Networks and other big station companies want to own more than
one station in a market because it increases their presence in
areas that are becoming increasingly crowded with other viewing
options, like cable and satellite channels. It also allows them to
save money on programming and personnel costs and gives them
another outlet for shows they own.
</P>
<P>
   For viewers in the biggest markets like New York, the change
could lead to more local news and sports programming, which the
networks said Thursday they would look to add to their new
channels.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William Kennard, who said the commission was acting
to update regulations that were largely put into place in the 1930s
and 1940s to ensure a diversity of media choices, called the
changes ``common-sense rules that recognize the dramatic changes
that the media marketplace has undergone'' over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The new FCC standards will allow dual ownership in cities where
there are a sufficient number of ``media voices,'' which include
all radio and TV stations, large daily newspapers and cable
systems. Specifically, a city must have at least eight
independently owned television stations for one company to own two.
And a company cannot own more than one of the four top-rated
stations in any market.
</P>
<P>
   All of the country's top 50 cities have that many, but many have
only eight, which may mean ``an intense game of musical chairs,''
as one senior network executive put it. ``The voice test means you
know you may have to get in fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a land rush to some degree,'' the executive
added.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision will not result in a wholesale changeover in
the control of stations, which had been feared by some station
owners six months ago, many industry executives said that the
opportunity for owning two stations in a single market was likely
to spur a surge in station sales in the coming months. Companies
like Fox and CBS were predicted to be especially aggressive is
seeking to add second stations in cities where they already own a
broadcast outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Reif-Cohen, a media analyst for Merrill Lynch, said dual
ownership in a single market would appeal to networks because of
the opportunities for cross promotion, for finding secondary uses
for programming a network already owns and for savings on staff and
program costs.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said the FCC enacted the changes because TV-station
ownership had become a morass of confusing waivers from
regulations. Numerous stations, for example, are operated under
local marketing agreements _ in which one company owns a TV station
and controls programming on another station ostensibly owned by
another company. Such exemptions, Kennard said, are a ``kind of
artifice'' intended to circumvent existing limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bringing some certainty and coherence to a situation
plagued by confusion and rule by waiver,'' Kennard said in a
telephone interview. ``The marketplace was crying out for
coherence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The FCC voted 4-1 for the new system, which institutes a series
of new rules that spell out more clearly what will constitute
ownership of a station, how many stations a single company can own
and under which circumstances it can own multiple stations in a
single market.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also affected radio station ownership, limiting one
company to six stations in a city with at least 20 total stations
(seven if the company does not opt to own two television stations.)
The ruling did not affect cross-ownership of other media outlets,
such as newspapers. Until now, the FCC had allowed one company to
own up to eight radio stations in one market, along with one
television station.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling did not affect ownership of other media, including
newspapers. Current rules prohibit newspapers and television
stations to have the same owner in the same market, but some dual
ownership situations were grandfathered in.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was widely praised by both industry executives and
public interest advocates. CBS senior vice president Martin Franks
called the decision ``a big win for Bill Kennard and truly a nice
piece of work.'' He said Kennard ``deserves a lot of credit for
cleaning up the mess accrued from seven to eight years of
regulating by waiver.'' Several station groups have been able to
operate two stations in markets, usually smaller ones, by winning
waivers from the FCC that allowed local marketing agreements.
``Once you create this class of waiver people, it becomes unfair to
people who are playing by the rules,'' Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Jay Schwartzman, the president of the Media Access
Project, a Washington-based public interest firm, said that while
he had hoped for more in the way of insuring diversity in station
ownership, the commission deserved to be praised for succeeding in
the most important area of closing loopholes in stations ownership
restrictions that had rendered the existing rules unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if you run it, you own it,'' Schwartzman said. ``It had
become like the Wild West. People who played by the rules were
being penalized. I think overall Bill Kennard did a good job under
severe political pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most pleased of all were the owners of stations who
may now become the subjects of bidding wars by suddenly unfettered
buyers. Among the logical targets is KCAL, an independent station
in Los Angeles, which had been put up for bid (along with other
stations) by Young Broadcasting several months ago only to be
withdrawn when no satisfactory bid was forthcoming, and the
enormous station holdings of Lowell W. ``Bud'' Paxon.
</P>
<P>
   Paxon, who owns stations in all the 20 biggest cities and 43 of
the top 50 said he was about to uncork champagne Thursday night.
``If we're going into the duopoly game, we're the prettiest girl at
the du-op dance,'' Paxon said.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling for the last two years to launch his own
seventh network, based on family programming, Paxon said he he
would now consider an offer to sell his holdings, ``if I got the
right price _ I would owe that to my shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would also consider a joint venture with a partner
who, under the new regulations could purchase up to 32 per cent of
his company. Paxon said he had already had some preliminary
discussions with potential bidders.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The big station owning groups, which include all of the four big
network, have been actively seeking deregulation in order to expand
their holdings. They have argued that with the ever-multiplying
array of viewing choices, including hundreds of cable channels,
satellite channels and coming digital channels, they need to be
able to compete by adding more channels of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the FCC still limits station groups to owning stations
that cover 35 per cent of the country. (Thursday's ruling did not
address that regulation. Kennard said it is likely to be taken up
in the fall and he has not taken a public position on that
ownership cap. ``I will have something to say about it then,'' he
said.)
</P>
<P>
   All the networks are close to that cap, with Fox and CBS right
at the limit. Only through this decision on dual ownership can they
expand in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the economic model it's great to own two stations in one
market,'' said Paul Sweeney, a media analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney. ``I think we are going to start seeing a lot of big ticket
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Reif-Cohen noted that in the biggest cities there are more than
enough station to go around for acquisitive networks _ 16 in New
York, 19 in Los Angeles, 13 in Chicago. She said the networks could
buy a second station for such purposes are adding news programs
produced by the existing station's news department, or repeats of
shows that network owns, and especially for finding a home for
sports programs.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has such wide interests in sports, especially in Los
Angeles, where the company owns the Dodgers, that KCAL may be an
especially inviting prize. ``Fox has sports and kids' programming,
it could fill that channel easily,'' Ms. Reif-Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also has a large library of other programming including
films. One Fox executive noted that Fox started an all movie
channel on cable that has had little impact so far. ``Would that
programming be better served on a second broadcast outlet in major
cities?'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive noted that Paxon had 19 stations in cities
where Fox already has a station. One of those is in New York, where
Fox again has wide sports interests, including broadcast rights to
Yankee games. Those are now placed on Channel 5, the Fox flagship
station. Presumably they could be located on another broadcast
outlet if Fox owned one in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Not every network executive saw Friday's ruling as momentous.
One senior executive called the changes ``small potatoes'' in terms
of what the networks need to protect themselves financially in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman, the public interest advocate, called that position
nonsense saying ``The networks are thriving businesses that are not
suffering and dying.'' He argued against further regulation that
would open the industry to only to owners ``with deep pockets.''

TEENS AT FILM CAMP PAN SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST BURKE, Vt. _ ``American Pie,'' the gross-out teen-age sex
comedy, may be one of the summer's blockbuster hits, but it bombed
at movie camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another movie that's nothing like high school,''
said Dan O'Reilly, 16, dismissing the crude bathroom jokes, the
drinking parties and the obsession of a group of high school senior
boys with losing their virginity. (Dan, and the other teen-agers at
the camp who are under 17, were accompanied to the R-rated
``American Pie'' by adult chaperones).
</P>
<P>
   Justin Stronk, 17, said he felt personally insulted by the
movie. ``It's just another typical teen-age movie that doesn't
apply to teen-agers,'' he said. ``It's what a bunch of adults in
Hollywood think about teen-agers. It's like they think teen-agers'
deepest feelings are about alcohol and sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Johanna Sorrentino, 16, delivered what she and the other
teen-age screenwriters, producers, directors and actors at movie
camp consider to be the worst possible judgment: ``American Pie,''
she said, was ``so cliched.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the discussion, Jay Craven, the Vermont filmmaker
who is the founding director of the Fledgling Films Summer
Institute, a nonprofit camp based here in Vermont's Northeast
Kingdom, said he was delighted. One of the reasons he started the
camp, he said, was to help teen-agers become analytical and
critical moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   This summer the teen-agers, who are from all over Vermont and
most of whom attend the institute on scholarships, made 10 short
films in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the subjects they chose, they are indeed thinking
about more than sex and alcohol. Their movies explored, among other
themes, a grandfather's waning interest in church, the relationship
between boys and guns, the relative merits of New York vs. Vermont,
teen-age homelessness, and the insidiousness of plastic surgery as
demonstrated by one teen-age boy's determination to turn his
girlfriend into a perfect, if artificially enhanced, beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the market potential,'' Craven said. ``It's
about kids' own voices. They don't really want to imitate
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Jay Bartrum, 16, wrote and directed ``Eat the Moon,''
about a young author battling writer's block who holes up in the
country with his typewriter and is visited by Optimis, Pessimus and
Cliche. ``It's based on me,'' Bartrum said. When he gets stuck, he
added, ``I just sit there and type `writer's block' over and
over.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Bartrum and the other young filmmakers were not staying up
till midnight shooting their own movies, they were watching them.
They requested multiple replays of the video of ``Rushmore,'' last
year's quirky, coming-of-age movie about an eccentric, iconoclastic
teen-age boy who gets kicked out of private school.
</P>
<P>
   A few of them drove two and a half hours to Montreal to see
``Blair Witch Project,'' a low-budget film about three filmmakers
who go into the woods to shoot a documentary about a witch and are
never heard from again. The movie has become an monumental hit
among teen-agers. They said they liked it because it did not rely
on gratuitous scary effects.
</P>
<P>
   Many at the institute are devotees of the film director Stanley
Kubrick, and they made a trip to a theater in Montpelier to see the
last film Kubrick made before he died, the highly publicized ``Eyes
Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my favorite Stanley Kubrick movie,'' said Bartrum, who
hopes to become a film director himself someday. ``It was subtly
creepy all the way through. The plot was unimportant. The mood was
so much more intense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gabe Calvi, 16, did find something to criticize in the
master. ``A lot of the sex was out of place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tyburski, 15, quickly became known at the institute for
his worship of Quentin Tarantino, the director, producer and
screenwriter who won celebrity for ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``Natural
Born Killers'' and is known for his stylized violence. ``Here's a
quote,'' said Tyburski, quoting the director. ```We're going to
sell you the seat, but you're only going to use the edge of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   By the second week of the institute, Melissa Edwards, 16, had
made up her mind. Her group had just wrapped ``Losing Sight,'' a
seven-minute film in which she plays the granddaughter of a man who
is not sure he wants to continue attending church.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my life,'' Ms. Edwards, the daughter of a small-dairy
farmer, said to Craven. ``I want to be an actress. What's the next
step?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step,'' Craven told her, ``is to go back to high
school.''

TO IMPROVE OFFICIATING, BASEBALL GETS POINTERS FROM NFL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, whose plan to establish an evaluation system for
major league umpires was a major reason for their mass resignation
last month, has quietly been exploring how that system might work.
</P>
<P>
   To improve what he sees as an outdated umpiring system,
Alderson, the executive vice president for baseball operations in
the commissioner's office, has spent months observing how other
sports train their game officials. Eventually, Alderson may blend
some of the officiating techniques from other leagues into
baseball's umpiring system.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson and members of his staff have met with officials from
the NHL, the NBA, the NCAA and the NFL, which has the most
extensive training for game officials in sports. His attention has
apparently been focused more on the NFL than on the other leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson has looked for ideas that he believes can be applied to
major league baseball's umpiring system, currently in a state of
crisis after the mass resignation of umpires on July 14 and the
subsequent dismissal of a third of the 68 umpires, effective Sept.
2.
</P>
<P>
   ``In looking at the other professional sports as well as the way
things are done in the NCAA,'' Alderson said in an interview
Thursday, ``there are common, positive things in terms of their
officiating we can apply to baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig has initiated plans to move control of
the umpiring system out of the two league offices and into the
commissioner's office. Alderson, a longtime Oakland Athletics
executive, wants to install an evaluation system that would, in
part, more easily allow for demotions and dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson is clearly preparing to add what he feels are the best
aspects of other sports' systems to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each sport presents a different set of problems for us to look
at or adapt,'' he said. ``There are other things that are not so
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said he would not describe his look at the officiating
of other sports as ``extensive.'' Yet one NFL executive said
Alderson has put the league's officiating system ``under a
microscope.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said he had spoken to his counterpart in the NFL
office, the senior vice president of football operations George
Young, and to Jerry Seeman, the NFL's senior director of
officiating. Alderson said other officials from his office have
spoken with additional representatives of the NFL's officiating
arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I took away from my discussions with the NFL is the
incredible amount of time they spend training their officials,''
Alderson said. ``In baseball, on the other hand, we put very little
time into training.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson declined to specify what ideas he might try to adapt to
baseball, but Alderson and others from his office expressed serious
interest in the NFL's training and its rules-testing program in the
off-season, NFL executives said. When an official enters the NFL he
is assigned a mentor, and later he receives a tape of an official
at his position working the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran officials have each of their calls graded and are
assigned a score during the season. At the end of the season they
are given tapes with every call they made during the season, so
that they can watch and study themselves. The NFL also buys its
game officials a satellite-television subscription so they can tape
games. In the off-season, NFL officials attend clinics run by
Seeman and take a series of take-home tests, one of which has 250
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson was also interested in the way the NFL tests the
conditioning of its game officials. The physical conditioning of
baseball umpires has long been criticized, while that of NFL
officials, who spend much of the game backpedaling and sprinting,
has rarely been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Every year the NFL gives its officials physical exams, which
include stress tests and checks of body fat. Officials who do not
make specified weights risk losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the baseball umpires union has concern for some of its
overweight umpires, it has resisted firm weight rules. Neither
major league has any off-season program for its umpires.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the NFL and its officials is amicable,
and the NFL has been able to convince its officials' union that its
guidelines are for the best. Given the bitterness between major
league baseball and its umpires, it is hard to predict what the
reaction from umpires would be to strict weight guidelines or
extensive training seminars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what will happen in terms of what ideas we use or
do not use,'' Alderson said. ``The main thing is doing what is best
for baseball.''

MAYOR BLAMES EMPLOYERS FOR IMMIGRANT WOES  
</HEADLINE>

 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Douglas'' &QL; 
The mayor of this border city is fed up.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Borane is sick of illegal immigrants dying in the desert as
they try to sneak past the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   He's sick of his city's notoriety as the place where ranchers
with rifles stand ready to shoot migrants off their property.
</P>
<P>
   He's sick of the tension, the trash and the tragedy accompanying
the never-ending flow of people through his small city.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of blaming the undocumented, he's lashing out at
those who entice them to come: employers and pampered Americans who
he says are exploiting desperate Mexican job seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our community can no longer cope,'' he says in letters
recently fired off to newspapers around the country. ``You are
ultimately to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   In Douglas, a city of 15,000, the residents are outnumbered
every month by the illegal immigrants passing through city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents at the Douglas station stopped 16,900
illegal entrants in July. And that wasn't even the peak month. The
numbers have been higher every month this year, except for May when
there was an unexplained drop to 15,477. March saw a record 27,225
apprehensions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night alone, agents intercepted a group of 240
stealthy crossers hiding in the brush northwest of the city. It was
the third time in just one week that a group of more than 200 had
been caught after cutting past Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, 240 illegal entrants, including three from
Guatemala, were apprehended by agents northwest of Double Adobe, a
small community about 15 miles northwest of Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Border Patrol agents detained 198 illegal entrants
east of Douglas. They were part of a group of about 600 people, the
largest mass crossing ever confronted by Arizona agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an invasion,'' says Borane, a retired state education
official. ``I blame the magnet of people pulling them here to
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was just as direct in the missive he sent to more than
a dozen papers in cities that attract large numbers of migrant
workers including the ``Las Vegas Sun,'' the ``Chicago Tribune,''
the ``Washington Post'' and ``The Arizona Republic''.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hire illegal immigrants because you have forgotten,
or never knew how to make your own beds, mow your own lawns or cook
your own meals, as we do ours daily, it causes our fields to be
littered with thousands of plastic jugs and pieces of clothing,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The terrain at the border between Douglas and Agua Prieta,
Sonora, is undeveloped desert where plastic water bottles and
grocery bags discarded by migrants who cross in the night clutter
the harsh landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Borane understands the frustration of the ranchers who complain
that their cattle die after eating the plastic trash or wander off
when their barbed wire fences are cut.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor, whose maternal grandmother was from Sonora, also
feels sympathy for the migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Borane was born and reared in Douglas. He speaks Spanish
fluently and easily slips into friendly slang when he calls his
counterpart in Agua Prieta. He wants those who hire illegal
immigrants to consider the crossers' sacrifice and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial writer for the ``Aspen Daily News'' thought
Borane's tough talk was right on target.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a haven for wealth and privilege, this entire region must
accept responsibility for the social and cultural upheaval it
perpetuates,'' Paul Andersen wrote. ``Construction and maintenance
of luxury homes and resort amenities are made profitable for
developers, investors and owners because of cheap labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have chafed at the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not stand all high and mighty, saying, `See, all these rich
people are the problem,' '' angry Aspen area resident Leslie
Stevens wrote about Borane. ``They have to go through you first in
order to get here no matter what route they take. . . . Take care
of your own policies before you start trying to make ours. We are
not the problem, sir, our government policies are.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Henzo, an artist who has lived in Douglas 10 years, says
there is some truth to what Borane says, ``but in terms of hysteria
created by (the illegal immigration), it's more of a nuisance, if
anything, to the ranchers and farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see a great horde invading the community, raping and
pillaging,'' he said while playing dominoes with a group of other
retired men at the Hotel Gadsen. ``They do leave behind trash,
plastic bottles and bags. . . . Most people in Douglas really
aren't affected by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the feedback, Borane is glad that his campaign is
drawing attention to his city's plight. But what he really wants is
a response from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, he went for broke, sending an angry letter to
President Clinton. In it, he accused Clinton of failing to address
the problem of uncontrolled illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write to tell you the border is bleeding,'' Borane's July 29
letter said. ``I simply cannot comprehend your inability to even
publicly recognize or acknowledge this invasion _ intrusion into
our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of our isolation, we feel disgusted, frustrated and
abandoned, wandering in the darkness without any expectation of
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, since Douglas became the focal point for
illegal crossings, the federal government has stepped up
enforcement. About 300 agents are now stationed in Douglas &UR; with an
additional 50 on temporary assignment.
</P>
<P>
   In May, ranch patrols were also organized by the Border Patrol
in response to complaints from ranchers and other rural residents.
</P>
<P>
   But Borane says enforcement alone will never stop the flow of
undocumented immigrants. The disparity between the poverty in
Mexico and the ``insatiable demand'' for cheap Mexican labor in the
United States, he says, fuel the flow.
</P>
<P>
   Borane's point is borne out across the line in Agua Prieta. It
is afternoon, and young men and women are milling about on the
sidewalks outside the dozens of cheap hostels that have popped up
to serve the growing numbers of border crossers.
</P>
<P>
   Storm clouds are churning overhead, but no one is deterred from
his or her plan to cross at nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   ````Hay mucho trabajo'' _ there's a lot of work waiting,'' said
Ramiro Reyes, a married father of two who's successfully crossed
illegally several times to work in California fields picking
grapes, melons, kiwis and watermelon.
</P>
<P>
   Borane's argument gets support from Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employers have jobs, but they don't have people to fill
them, so they have to hire Mexicans,'' he said. ``If it wasn't for
the Mexicans, who would do this work?'' &QL;

<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ With little significant rain in sight and calls
for voluntary conservation failing to slacken demands on New
Jersey's dwindling water supply, Gov. Christie Whitman Thursday
declared a statewide drought emergency and imposed strict rules on
outdoor water use.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations, which come as parts of the Eastern Seaboard
endure the worst drought in decades, prohibit the use of lawn
sprinklers, and mandate that trees, shrubs and flowers only be
watered with a can or a hose equipped with a hand-held nozzle.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency measures also forbid state residents to fill
swimming pools, use water to fill decorative fountains or
reflecting pools, clean their driveways and sidewalks or wash their
automobiles anywhere except commercial car washes using recycled
water. Restaurants are also prohibited from serving water to
patrons unless they ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman had hoped to avert the need for restrictions by
announcing a drought warning on Monday and asking for voluntary
conservation. But in the following days, water use continued at an
unusually high pace and reservoir levels fell at more than double
their normal rate.
</P>
<P>
   She also warned that New Jerseyans could face the prospect of
more stringent water limitations if the drought persists _
including restrictions on indoor water use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't taking this step lightly,'' she said. ``We must cut
down on our water use and unfortunately people weren't coming to
that understanding voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Violators could face penalities of up to $1,000 per incident and
repeat offenders could face fines of up to $5,000, the governor
said. Although it was unclear how police and elected officials in
New Jersey's 567 municipalities will enforce the rules, the head of
the state's Department of Environmental Protection suggested that
residents take it upon themselves to watch their neighborhood and
report any violations they see.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bergen County town of Tenafly, where mandatory
restrictions were imposed earlier in the week, a handful of
residents called the police to offer information about neighbors,
Police Chief Allen Layne said. In each case, he said, an officer
was sent to issue a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Layne and the mayor of Tenafly criticized the governor for not
acting sooner and said that the exceptions to the rules would
complicate enforcement. For instance, the restrictions on lawn
watering include an exception for lawns recently treated with
fertilizers or pesticides. In those cases, residents can use hoses
to water the grass for five days after their application, up to 45
minutes a day, as long as they do it between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. or
from midnight to 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Other elected officials in northern New Jersey were baffled that
Whitman waited until they enacted their own emergency restrictions
before superseding them with her statewide mandate.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in Bergen and Hudson County, government offices were
besieged Thursday with telephone calls about restrictions that only
allowed lawn sprinklers to be used on alternate days. When Whitman
made her announcement at 2 p.m. banning the use of sprinklers on
most lawns, those rules became moot.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's announcement came, oddly enough, on day when
violent thunderstorms passed through parts of northern New Jersey,
New York City and Long Island, knocking out power and dumping hail
and sheets of rain for a brief period in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   During her news conference at the State Museum here, a
minute-long cloudburst brought a few drops of rain to the parched
ground and brown lawns of the capital. But rainfall in New Jersey
has been below average for more than a year, and July was the
driest month since the National Weather Service began recording
precipitation, so meteorologists say it will take long periods of
sustained rainfall to replenish reservoirs and aquifers.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's reservoirs were at 69.8 percent of capacity
Thursday, far above the 55 percent level which would automatically
trigger a water emergency, but Mrs. Whitman said she authorized
mandatory water restrictions because use is so high in the summer
and because the National Weather Service says significant rainfall
is unlikely during the next five days.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania have already instituted
water restrictions and Virginia was adopting them Thursday. The
high temperatures and scant rain have wreaked such damage in the
region that West Virginia has been declared a drought disaster
area, along with parts of Kentucky, Ohio, Maryland, Virginia and
Pennsylvania. President Clinton has proposed $10.8 million in
emergency aid and federal loans for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The drought has had more limited effects in the upstate New York
counties that supply New York City's drinking water. Still, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani last week asked residents to practice voluntary
water conservation. Wildfires in Rockland and Orange Counties have
consumed 600 acres of forest.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has received just 2 inches of rain during the past
two months _ about a quarter of the normal amount during June and
July _ and Whitman estimated that there has been $80 million in
crop damage to 7,000 farms throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Some New Jersey environmentalists said the governor's
declaration was long overdue, and warned that the low water levels
would concentrate pollution in the state's drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman went out of her way to assure New Jersey residents that
the drought posed no threat to the safety of their drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no danger of water quality degradation,'' she said.
``With the low water levels there can be a concentration of
pollutants, but with the filters that is all removed.''

   A prosecutor filed an appeal criticizing Judge Baltasar Garzon's
warning to the Spanish government this week not to interfere with
his attempt to extradite the former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet from Britain on charges of crimes against humanity.
Prosecutors have repeatedly tried to block the case, whose latest

re-election. Chavez, who led a failed coup attempt in 1992, also
recommended the declaration of a ``national emergency'' and said
the assembly, which has a six-month mandate to produce a new
Constitution, should work overtime so that its task will be

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Aug. 6: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After decades of decay, Harlem's main business strip _ 125th
Street _ seems headed toward revival. Banking, insurance and
entertainment companies are planning to develop properties in the
area. But the linchpin of 125th Street is the Apollo Theater, a
music venue known around the world that has grown shabby and
technically obsolete through years of neglect. On top of these
troubles, the theater's board has been sued by the state for
questionable financial practices.
</P>
<P>
   The theater is owned by the state but operated by the nonprofit
Apollo Theater Foundation. The suit accused the foundation's board
of failing to collect millions of dollars from Percy Sutton, a
businessman and former Manhattan borough president whose company
produces a weekly variety program for television at the theater. If
ratified by all parties, a pending settlement would require Sutton
and his associates to repay $1 million to the foundation and would
also require that Charles Rangel, Harlem's Democratic congressman,
step down as the board's chairman. The board would then be
controlled by the Time Warner entertainment company, which would
appoint 10 of its 19 members and provide an infusion of cash.
</P>
<P>
   If approved at the Apollo Foundation's next meeting, on Monday,
the settlement should free an additional $2 million in badly needed
public and private development and preservation money that has been
frozen during this battle. By tying itself to Time Warner, the
Apollo would be able to draw on the company's management expertise
and its extensive holdings in the entertainment industry. The match
is all the more natural because Time Warner's president, Richard D.
Parsons, is chairman of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, which
is fighting to reinvent the area using federal, state and city
money.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Aug. 6: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rather quietly, it seems, major-league baseball has now worked
its way through two-thirds of the regular season and is now
entering that part of the year when each game seems to count for a
bit more than it did in the spring. But the season has already
produced some unexpected developments, especially in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   To the astonishment of pre-season forecasters, New York has two
teams in first place, the Yankees in their accustomed spot atop the
American League East and the Mets, surprisingly, at the top of the
National League East. Meanwhile, despite suspicions that they could
not possibly do it all over again, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa are
once again engaged in a thunderous artillery duel, swatting aside
several pretenders who, at midseason, had hopes of replacing them
as the premier home run hitters in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The old phrase about ``putting it all together'' certainly
applies to this year's edition of the Mets. Having added several
key players, the Mets now offer brilliant fielding and amazingly
consistent hitting. On Wednesday their lineup included six
.300-plus hitters. The net result is that the Mets have vaulted
above the Atlanta Braves, the perennial favorite in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Yankees have not been as interesting, there are still
some good stories in the Bronx, not least the emergence of the
phlegmatic Hideki Irabu as a competitive starting pitcher. The most
intriguing thing about the Yankees, however, is that for once they
are not a lock to win their division. The Toronto Blue Jays will
not go away.
</P>
<P>
   As for baseball generally, attendance is up by a few percentage
points in most ball parks, a good sign. Last year's jump in
attendance was attributed in part to the thrilling McGwire-Sosa
chase for the home run record. McGwire and Sosa are still a big
draw _ both are on pace to hit more than 60 home runs and are up to
their old trick of matching each other dinger for dinger on the
same day. And last night a huge crowd turned out in St. Louis to
see whether McGwire and San Diego's Tony Gwynn would reach two
baseball milestones _ 500 career home runs in McGwire's case, and
3,000 hits in Gwynn's.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe people are coming to the park just to see baseball. If
so, that is another indication of the game's recovery from its
strike-plagued past.

NEW LAWS NO LAUGHING MATTER (OR ARE THEY?)  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JON KAMMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's the day that eggs have to be chillier, tattoo artists
and body piercers had better start checking clients' age cards, and
police who think you're to blame for a traffic accident can give
you a blood-alcohol test even if you're unconscious or dead.
</P>
<P>
   Today is law day, the day more than 350 bills passed by the 1999
Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Jane Hall take effect. In
Arizona, legislation gets teeth 90 days after adjournment of the
Legislature unless the bill is passed with an ``emergency clause''
by a two-thirds vote, which puts it into effect immediately upon
signing.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the reams of legalese generated this year in the First
Regular Session of the 44th Arizona Legislature are found some very
serious, far-reaching laws that will shape the state for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Among them: laws requiring landlords to register their
properties and the
 &UR; state Board of Regents to hold public hearings before hiking
university
 &UR; tuition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; But there are some oddities, too.
</P>
<P>
   About those eggs: From now on, if they're for human consumption,
they have to be kept at 45 degrees Fahrenheit or colder, instead of
up to 60 degrees. No, a state inspector isn't going to come around
to your home with a thermometer; the law applies to dealers and
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, if your boy or girl is under 18 and gets a
tattoo, is branded or has a body part (except for ears) pierced
without your being there, you can have the person who did it
prosecuted on a Class 6 felony, for which the penalty is a year in
prison and a fine of up to $150,000. (Pierced ears require only
parental permission, not the parent's presence.)
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of signs of society's increasing litigiousness, the
Legislature has now removed liability from a healthcare
professional who, as a charitable act, provides free, used
eyeglasses to someone who winds up getting hurt because of them.
But that's only if the recipient has signed a medical-malpractice
release beforehand and acknowledged that the glasses weren't made
specifically for him or her.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone can now donate to a fire department what seems to be
serviceable firefighting or rescue equipment without fear of being
sued if it malfunctions and hurts or kills someone.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature devoted a lot of verbiage to auto license
plates.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a bill to clarify the language of who is
eligible for special ``Veterans,'' ``POW'' or ``Purple Heart''
plates became a law creating county ``citizen transportation
oversight committees.'' Then, a bill that would have allowed
members of an Indian nation to obtain customized plates became an
enabling act for the Grand Canyon Airport Authority.
</P>
<P>
   At last, from a bill that would have created ``animal population
control special plates'' came the final word on license plates:
Virtually any non-profit organization that is ``not offensive or
discriminatory'' and doesn't promote a commercial product, a
religion or atheism can have a special plate made for members who
pay extra. Even a group with fewer than 200 members qualifies (the
previous minimum was 500) if it will bear the extra production
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of licenses, you can now obtain a new marriage license
if you lose yours. Lose it before the ceremony and the replacement
will cost you. Afterwards, it's free, but you have to get
signatures of witnesses and whoever performed the ceremony, or go
to court to explain that they're not available.
</P>
<P>
   As it does every year, the Legislature also removed sexist
language from old laws in the process of amending them. The laws
always applied to both sexes, but didn't read that way.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in defining unemployment, the wording is no longer
(emphasis added) ``any week in which ``he'' performs no services .
. . for wages payable to ``him.'' '' It's now `` ``the
individual.'' '' Also, the requirement for an employer to pay ``
``his'' employees'' at least twice a month is now `` ``the''
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet figures in a couple of new laws.
</P>
<P>
   When a state university assigns an identification number to
faculty, staff and students, from now on it can't be the person's
Social Security number _ unless the person requests it. And it
can't be posted on the Internet. For some reason, Arizona's
community colleges ``can'' use Social Security numbers for ID
unless the person asks for a different number. The prohibition of
Internet posting still applies.
</P>
<P>
   One new law might appear to allow Arizonans to buy beer, wine
and liquor over the Internet from makers in other states who obtain
a ``direct shipment license,'' but there will be no rush of orders
by e-mail. The catch is, the ``direct shipment'' has to be to a
wholesaler, who has to deliver the order to a retailer, who has to
deliver it to the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, coming full circle, the Legislature this year had to
undo its undoing of a law three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in 1996 had meant to end a requirement for a cover
sheet to be filed when submitting certain documents to county
recorders, but accidentally repealed all document specifications as
of Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   With the repeal of the repeal, the law is right back where it
started, including the requirement for cover sheets. &QL;

DAVID J. SELIGSON, 92, PROMINENT REFORM RABBI 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rabbi David J. Seligson, a nationally known Reform
rabbi and an eloquent orator who held the pulpit at Central
Synagogue in Manhattan for 20 years, died Aug. 3 on the way to a
hospital in Manhattan. He was 92 and had lived for the last two
years at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Central Synagogue is in some senses a national pulpit. The
memorial service that Seligson led there after the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy was broadcast on network television. He
was also regularly heard on radio as host of the syndicated
``Message of Israel'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Seligson was among the first Jewish chaplains to volunteer to
serve overseas during World War II. As an Army chaplain, he held
Passover seders for hundreds of soldiers in Calcutta, India, and
comforted those hospitalized with jungle fever in Burma. He
traveled the old Burma Road in a jeep with Christian chaplains,
holding Sabbath services before sundown to avoid the
malaria-bearing mosquitoes that emerged at nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Although Seligson went on to achieve national prominence, his
chaplaincy to soldiers in wartime was his touchstone. ``I feel that
it was the greatest work that I have done in my entire ministry,''
he wrote in his memoir, ``Rabbi, Chaplain and Burra Sahib.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan on May 10, 1907,
and was brought up in the traditions of Orthodox Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated in 1929 from both Teachers College of Columbia
University and the Teachers' Institute of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan
Theological Seminary and Yeshiva College. But he decided that the
future of Judaism in America lay in the modern and adaptable Reform
movement, and he enrolled in the Reform-affiliated Hebrew Union
College in Cincinnati. He graduated and was ordained a rabbi in
1933.
</P>
<P>
   With pulpits scarce during the Depression, he moved to
Birmingham, England, to help a group of liberal Jews organize a
Reform synagogue. There he met and married an Englishwoman, Minnie
Cohen. He returned to the United States to enlist in the military
chaplains corps.
</P>
<P>
   On his homecoming in 1945 after 32 months overseas, he was
invited to assist the rabbi at Central Synagogue in Manhattan, an
East Side landmark that is the oldest temple in New York State in
continuous use by one congregation. He was made senior rabbi in
1950 and held that position until he was named rabbi emeritus in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   In the temple's magnificent Moorish-style sanctuary, which was
burned in a fire last year, Seligson delivered sermons about the
path to God, the likely success of the civil rights movement and
Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. In one sermon, he said God was not ``a
great heavenly bellhop who will satisfy our needs if we press the
button.''
</P>
<P>
   Seligson helped to expand interfaith relations between
synagogues and churches in New York, speaking in churches and
inviting them to join an annual Thanksgiving interfaith worship
service.
</P>
<P>
   Seligson was president of the New York Board of rabbis from 1952
to 1954 and president of the New York Association of Reform Rabbis
in 1954 and 1955.
</P>
<P>
   He never really retired from pastoral work, serving as interim
rabbi for congregations in Lawrence, N.Y., Westport, Conn., and
Tenafly, N.J., in the 1970s. For 10 years, until he was 75, he flew
to Dublin each year to lead High Holy Days services at the
Progressive Synagogue there.
</P>
<P>
   His wife died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Seligson is survived by his daughters, Michelle Seligson of
Boston and Jill Seligson Braver of Brooklyn, and three
grandchildren.

STANLEY STAHL, 75, REAL ESTATE INVESTOR AND BANK OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stanley Stahl, a New York real estate and banking
magnate, who prosecutors say was the target of a failed
murder-for-hire scheme devised by Abe Hirschfeld, another prominent
businessman, died Thursday at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 75
and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, said Richard Czaja, an executive vice
president at Stahl Real Estate Co. in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl was the sole stockholder of Apple Bank for Savings, a bank
with more than 30 branches, which he acquired for $174 million in a
hostile takeover in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   His real estate investments include about 4 million square feet
of office space, residential buildings with more than 3,000
apartments and numerous retail buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Among his commercial real estate holdings is 277 Park Ave., at
48th Street, also known as the Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
Building, a 1.74-million-square-foot, 50-story tower. He started
the building in 1957 and finished it in 1964. Chemical Bank was a
longtime tenant.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl also owns an interest in the landmark Ansonia building, on
Broadway at 74th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hirschfeld, who made a fortune in garages and has
become well known for various publicity stunts, was indicted on
charges of paying a hit man $75,000 to kill Stahl in 1996.
Prosecutors say the plot fell apart. Hirschfeld is scheduled to be
tried later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld has denied the allegation, attributing it to a
conspiracy mounted against him by Stahl and others. The two men had
been feuding bitterly since 1993 and, prosecutors say, were
business partners on some real estate properties that had
``survivor take all'' clauses.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl was born on June 16, 1924, the son of a Brooklyn butcher.
He graduated from New York University with an accounting degree and
served in the U.S. Army. He began as a Manhattan real estate broker
and parlayed his commissions into properties bought with his
father, Max.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a ferociously tough negotiator, Stahl bought several
Broadway theaters. He also once owned the original Lindy's
restaurant in the theater district in Manhattan and kept his office
above it.
</P>
<P>
   He was an intensely private man who rarely allowed photographs
to be taken, an unusual trait in a profession crowded with
skyscraper-size egos. He went through a messy divorce in the early
1960s and faced bad publicity over a 1977 indictment on charges of
bribing an IRS official. He was found guilty, but the verdict was
thrown out on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court said that prosecutors had made prejudicial
remarks to the jury about Stahl's wealth; a 1990 Newsday article
estimated that he had a net worth of $430 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl is survived by his wife, Cherie; a son, Gregory; a
stepson, Peter Neger; a stepdaughter, Simi Matera, and a sister,
Beatrice Marans, all of Manhattan.

MOHAMMED HADID, 92, AN IRAQI WHO LONG BACKED DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mohammed Hadid, an Iraqi economist and cabinet minister who
advocated democracy but was buffeted by his country's autocratic
governments, died on Tuesday in London, where he moved in 1995. He
was 92.
</P>
<P>
   He had an asthma attack, The Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
   Hadid received a degree in the 1920s from the London School of
Economics.
</P>
<P>
   For years he was a leader of the opposition National Democratic
Party, which called for the restoration of democratic processes in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed minister of supply in 1946, when his country
was a monarchy, but he soon quit because elections were held that
were flagrantly manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958 the Iraqi military mounted a coup. The monarchy was
overthrown, Iraq was proclaimed a republic and Hadid was appointed
finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1960 he stepped down from the cabinet, and by 1961 almost
all the other ``political ministers'' were gone from it, replaced
largely by followers of the country's strongman, Abdul Karim
Kassim.
</P>
<P>
   Hadid stayed active in party politics. But then, in 1963, the
Kassim government was ousted by another military coup, born of a
partnership between the Baath Party, whose goals included Arab
unity, and nationalist army officers.
</P>
<P>
   The party set up a National Council of Revolutionary Command,
but the real power was wielded by the party leader, Ali Salih as
Saadi. The Baathists stayed in power less than a year, but are said
to have kept Hadid under detention for months.
</P>
<P>
   Later he stayed out of politics and was active in the business
world. The Saddam Hussein dictatorship kept him from leaving Iraq
until 1995, when he joined his family in London.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are two sons, Haithem and Fulath, and a daughter,
Zaha.

JUDGE DECLINES TO FREE WITNESS IN TERRORISM CASE WHO SAYS HE WON'T
TESTIFY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Manhattan refused Thursday to
release a man who was jailed in May for refusing to testify, on
religious grounds, before a federal grand jury investigating Osama
bin Laden and the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Africa last
August.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Ihab M. Ali, a taxi driver from Orlando, Fla., had
said in U.S. District Court in Manhattan last month that testifying
would be ``a major sin'' because the Koran prohibited Muslims from
giving testimony that might harm other innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   Ali said he feared that if he testified, bin Laden would
retaliate against him, or his family in Egypt. ``What I've heard
and seen in the media,'' Ali said, ``is that he's a very dangerous
person.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. rejected Ali's contentions and
said more time in jail might encourage him to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confinement, which unfortunately is by its nature coercive,''
Patterson wrote, ``and which is undoubtedly resented by potential
witnesses, either material witnesses or those held in civil
contempt, also allows for reflection and reconsideration. Here,
Ali's decision not to testify calls for reconsideration.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came two days before the first anniversary of the
embassy attacks, which killed 223 people and wounded more than
4,000. In the investigation, over the last year, a number of
witnesses _ including some Muslims _ have testified before the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Ali, 36, who was jailed last May 19, is the only witness who is
known to have refused, and been held in contempt. Under the law, he
may be held for up to 18 months, the term of the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Ashraf W. Nubani, said Thursday night, ``It's
unfortunate that the decision didn't recognize what was manifestly
clear, that Ihab had already made up his mind not to testify.'' He
said that Ali would not change his mind about testifying, ``and if
he has to spend the 18 months'' in the Metropolitan Correctional
Center, ``that's what will end up happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Hadad, a spokesman for Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney
in Manhattan, said, ``The office has no immediate comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson's consideration of the issues in the case mirrored a
simmering debate in recent years, in which some Muslims and their
supporters in the United States have sharply criticized the
government as unfairly singling out Muslims in terrorism
investigations, an assertion the government has denied.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Muslim scholars interviewed this week about Ali's
refusal to testify seemed divided. Several experts on Islamic law
said they saw no basis in the Koran for Ali's stance. But some
religious figures, including an imam who testified in court in
support of Ali, disagreed, saying Ali's religious objections were
sound.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In making his ruling, Patterson had to decide whether Ali was
likely to budge from his refusal to testify. If the judge found
that further confinement would not change his mind, he could order
him released.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge made clear that he did not believe that was the
case. He said that he disagreed with Ali's interpretation of how
the Koran viewed giving testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The judge quoted from the Koran: ``Hide not testimony. He who
hideth it verily his heart is sinful. Allah is aware of what ye
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge also said that Ali had not fully explored the measures
the authorities could take to protect him if he testified. The
government has offered to immunize Ali from prosecution and place
him and his family in the Witness Protection Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may become apparent to him with the passage of time,''
Patterson wrote, ``that the fear he is presently experiencing is
misplaced, or that steps can be taken to protect his family.'' The
judge also cited Ali's testimony last month that the goal of trying
to solve the bombings ``is a just goal if it is done in a just
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   At one hearing last month, Ali had responded to a question posed
by a federal prosecutor about why he would not testify, saying, ``I
fear the same persons that you're targeting.'' But Ali also said he
distrusted the U. S. government, felt that Muslims were
discriminated against and believed that prosecutors would misuse
his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said that the courts were there to ``prevent unfair
prosecution and conviction of persons regardless of race or
religious beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge added that Ali should reconsider his beliefs about
discrimination, ``recognizing that there are thousands of Arab
Muslims working and living in this city in all manner of
occupations free from discrimination exercised against them by
agencies of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge did have some veiled criticism of the government.
Citing accusations by prosecutors that Ali had lied to
investigators before going into the grand jury, Patterson said in a
footnote: ``If Ali is to gain trust in the prosecution's good
motives, it is important that the prosecution, in view of the
magnitude of the crimes, not get carried away with the justness of
its cause and suggest he has been lying.''

 &HT;    Southern Party denounces racism, but flag is controversial
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The Confederate flag is rising again, this
time as the symbol of a new political party that says it represents
Southerners in the battle against declining morals, government
intrusion and ``cultural bigotry and oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the Southern Party, which plans to unveil its
national platform at a rally in Flat Rock, N.C., on Saturday, say
the group's flag _ a historic Confederate government flag that
incorporates the familiar Confederate battle flag _ discredits the
group's political goal of reclaiming the South's sovereignty from
the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, in and of itself, would serve as an exclusionary symbol
for a lot of people,'' said George Allison, executive director of
the North Carolina Conference of NAACP branches in Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
has renewed its attack on the Confederate battle flag, urging
tourists to avoid South Carolina because the flag flies atop its
Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the red-and-blue battle flag _ also incorporated in
Georgia's state flag _ is a racist reminder of slavery. Supporters
say it pays tribute to the Confederacy and its fallen warriors.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Party claims the Confederate flag as the ``most
instantly and widely recognized symbol of Southern sovereignty,
valor and independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling that message a ``rhetorical change of great
significance'' in the flag debate, political observer John Shelton
Reed questioned whether the Southern Party can change critics'
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Southern nationalist movement, especially one that wraps
itself in the Confederate flag, is going to be viewed with
suspicion, given the historical record,'' said Reed, director of
the Institute for Research in Social Science at the University of
North Carolina. ``But they are vehemently denying that
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 180 people from across the nation have signed up for
the rally, according to the Southern Party. Formed in recent
months, it espouses limited government, low taxes, a return of God
to public schools, and an end to South-bashing by ``Washington and
Hollywood elites.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the party hopes to elect candidates in 16 states to
local and state offices. But if that grass-roots campaign fails to
reverse what party leaders call a slide toward federal tyranny, the
party would advocate creating a separate Southern nation.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say such a move, accomplished at the ballot box by
voters of individual states, would return power to states. That's
preferable to the ``corrupt two-party system that fails to
represent Southern interests in Washington,'' according to the new
party's Web site (www. southernparty.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a party for all Southern people,'' Jerry Baxley, the
Southern Party's first vice chairman, said in an interview
Thursday. ``We do not hold to the rancor of people running around
and screaming, `I do not like this group and I do not like that
group.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site, the group distances itself from racial hate
groups and decries such groups' ``attempt to pervert the symbols of
Southern freedom and valor into symbols of racial malice.''

   The Web site of the party's North Carolina chapter says
``racists of ANY stripe, including the KKK and other white
supremacist groups ... are NOT welcome'' at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of its flag, the party says the Confederate Congress
adopted the ``last official national flag of Dixie'' in March 1865,
a month after it allowed blacks to enlist as Confederate soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this reason, we believe it is a symbol that all
Southerners should be able to embrace and support as our national
symbol of independence and freedom,'' the Web page says.
</P>
<P>
   Such ideas have run into criticism this summer as the party's
officials have made public appearances around the South.
</P>
<P>
   Baxley complained about one appearance in July on a talk radio
program in Gulfport, Miss., which he said resulted in ``very
hostile and, at times, exceedingly rude'' reactions from callers
and the show's hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very gracious to him,'' said one of the hosts, Rip
Daniels, owner of the station, WJZD.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels said Baxley became upset after they disagreed over
historical details about the Confederate flag and the role of
blacks as Confederate soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The argument revealed a fundamental divide over the Civil War,
one that Daniels said he believes the Southern Party won't be able
to bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confederate history is not synonymous with Southern history,''
he said. ``There is no way that an educated African-American can
identify with the Confederacy. It was a system of white supremacy.

 &HT;    Atlanta Olympic report revisited
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Former U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell, prominent
member of King &AMP; Spalding, one of the nation's most powerful law
firms based in Atlanta, has taken the remarkable step of personally
asking congressional investigators to let him amend an official
report on Atlanta's bid for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-page report, provided to Congress in June, purported to
detail inappropriate gifts and favors from Atlanta officials to
International Olympic Committee members.
</P>
<P>
   After investigators reviewed 38 boxes of documents, including
eight boxes that Olympic officials have refused to make public,
U.S. Rep. Tom Bliley (R-Va.), House Commerce Committee chairman,
said Thursday his committee was ``concerned that their written
response ... was not totally accurate or complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators said they found evidence of
additional _ and more expensive _ gifts that were not included in
the report, which was signed by Billy Payne and Andrew Young,
co-chairmen of the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did not specify publicly what those questionable
items are.
</P>
<P>
   After studying evidence compiled by investigators, Bell, a
former federal appeals court judge and now a top-ranking attorney
with King &AMP; Spalding, requested the opportunity to amend the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Committee's subcommittee on oversight and
investigations, which is looking for possible violations of federal
bribery laws in Atlanta's Olympic bid, granted Bell's request.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers indicated they were ``encouraged'' that Bell and
several members of King &AMP; Spalding's Washington, D.C., office had
taken over the troubling situation. The law firm served as pro bono
legal counsel for the Olympic bid effort and paid counsel for the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee is encouraged that the Atlanta Olympic Committee
and their lawyers understand the importance of this investigation
and are taking it seriously,'' Bliley said in a prepared statement.
``We are particularly pleased to learn that someone of the stature
and reputation of Judge Griffin Bell has assumed the leadership
over this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Bell clearly signals the seriousness of the
accusation that Congress was provided with inaccurate information
in response to an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Further indicating King &AMP; Spalding's level of concern, Bell has
been joined in the effort by Eleanor Hill, a new partner in the
Washington office. Her practice focuses on white-collar criminal
matters, corporate internal investigations and congressional
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Three partners of King &AMP; Spalding in Atlanta were on the
original nine-member Olympic bid team: Horace Sibley, Charlie
Battle and Charlie Shaffer. Battle has since left the firm. Linda
Stephenson, wife of another partner in the firm, was a charter
member of the bid team and remains GAAF's executive director. All
four were intimately involved in the Olympic lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   Bell approached the chief counsel for the investigative
subcommittee Tuesday. At that time, he said he had reviewed the
evidence and asked to amend the Olympic officials' report,
according to a senior committee staff member.
</P>
<P>
   Bell indicated it would take approximately two weeks to complete
the work. A staff member of the subcommittee said Bell told him ``a
team of King &AMP; Spalding attorneys were working 24 hours a day'' to
prepare an accurate response.
</P>
<P>
   Bell told the subcommittee he is unaware who authored the
original report, signed by Payne and Young. He also said he does
not know who compiled the documents contained in the eight boxes in
question.
</P>
<P>
   King &AMP; Spalding's managing director, Ralph Levy, who announced
he was stepping down from his leadership post last week, declined
to comment, referring questions to Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who declined to answer questions Thursday, did comment:
``It is true we are representing GAAF and are looking forward to
working with the House Commerce Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's investigation of the Olympic lobbying effort has
been tense from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The initial report provided by the Atlanta group detailed some
three dozen personal gifts for IOC members that exceeded the IOC's
$200 individual limit and totaled $15,156.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts ranged from a $948 carburetor kit for the member from
Libya, to clothing totalling $937.66 for the member from Finland.
Both have since resigned or been expelled from the IOC in the wake
of the widening influence-peddling scandal that erupted in Salt
Lake City last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Payne and Young acknowledged handing out 113 additional gifts
that cost more than the $200 limit. They categorized those as
``group gifts'' _ the same items for multiple or all IOC members _
and included $202 wooden tulip bowls designed by artist Philip
Moulthrop and $215.97 electronic organizers.
</P>
<P>
   All told, group gifts totaled an average of $3,000 per IOC
member and cost the bid team $190,482.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sincerely hope that our report will demonstrate that
Atlanta won the 1996 Olympic Games fairly,'' Payne said upon the
release of the report in June. ``Although we occasionally exceeded
the IOC's guidelines, our work was always done with honest
intent.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has since abolished the $200 limit. A new rule allows
gifts of ``nominal value.''
</P>
<P>
   Revelations of exorbitant gifts, scholarships and cash payments
from Salt Lake City officials, in their successful bid for the 2002
Winter Games, touched off a global Olympic bribery scandal that has
engulfed Atlanta and forced major reforms in the IOC's site
selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Payne, who has just returned from an overseas trip, declined to
comment about the charges of inaccuracies in his report. A GAAF
spokesman said no gifts were intentionally left out of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was compiled in a short time frame,'' said Lee Echols, the
spokesman. ``We did not exclude anything from the initial report
that we felt should have been in there. Now, at the committee's
request, we will clarify some of their additional questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee plans to hold public hearings in September,
according to Chairman Fred Upton (R.-Mich.). ``It is essential we
have a complete and accurate picture of the entire bidding
process,'' Upton said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee had publicly reprimanded Payne for earlier
attempting to thwart their investigation when he refused to allow
investigators to copy the contents of eight boxes of documents he
claimed were personal and not relevant to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The committee demanded unrestricted access to the files. Payne
had allowed investigators to examine the papers in the eight boxes,
but he had forbidden them from making copies, fearing they would
become public.
</P>
<P>
   Payne later agreed to ship the disputed boxes of files to King &AMP;
Spalding's Washington office and allow investigators to copy
whatever they needed.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said much of the material in the boxes was
relevant to the investigation, and they questioned lawyers in the
Washington office last week about discrepancies between evidence of
excessive gifts in the boxes and what was listed in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The eight boxes of documents withheld from the public are the
subject of a GAAF lawsuit against state Attorney General Thurbert
Baker and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which argue that the
Olympic records are subject to the Georgia Open Records Act. The
judge in the case has yet to rule.

SCOUTS' DISHONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Jersey court ruling that it is illegal for a Boy Scout
troop to exclude gays will probably be appealed to the US Supreme
Court, where its fate is uncertain. Quite apart from the legal
issues, the Boy Scouts of America should drop the vile lesson of
intolerance it is teaching the future community leaders it purports
to groom.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's top court said civic organizations like the Boy
Scouts fall under the state's public accommodations laws, which
prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Boy Scouts
of America says being forced to admit gays would violate scouts'
First Amendment rights to free association and expression.
</P>
<P>
   This distinction is key. In 1995 the Supreme Court ruled in
favor of a South Boston veterans group that wanted to bar gays
activists from marching in its St. Patrick's Day parade. The court
said a parade is a form of expression that would be abridged by
forcing organizers to accept a ``message'' that clashed with their
own. But in 1984 the court ruled that the Jaycees, a service
organization, could not exclude women under the public
accommodation laws. Are the Boy Scouts more like a parade or more
like the Jaycees? The New Jersey court made a convincing case for
the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Civic organizations in particular, the Supreme Court found, have
a higher responsibility to uphold the state's interest in
preventing discrimination. In his 1984 majority opinion, Justice
William Brennan said the leadership skills and community contacts
promoted by the Jaycees are ``goods and advantages'' to which the
law clearly requires all Americans have equal access. So, too, with
the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination against homosexuals is, sadly, still common in
this country and sometimes leads to ugly and tragic ends. At a
prestigious prep school in Gill last month, police arrested two
students for grabbing a classmate and carving a gay slur into his
back with a knife. The Boy Scouts of America, founded 90 years ago,
says it promotes leadership, citizenship, and character development
among a million young men. Scout law should not teach them to be
brave, clean, and bigoted.

TEARFUL WALTRIP SETS SIGHTS ON VICTORY TOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Darrell Waltrip has given himself 18 months to do
something he has done 84 times during a distinguished NASCAR
Winston Cup career _ win another race.
</P>
<P>
   Choking back tears and sharing the moment with his wife and two
daughters, Waltrip and sponsor Kmart outlined plans for the
``Victory Tour 2000'' that will carry him into retirement after the
upcoming Cup season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done this for 40 years,'' Waltrip said during a news
conference at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where he called upon
wife Stevie to help get him through an emotional presentation.
``We've gotten up and we've put on our racing gear ... I've done
that for 40 years and she's done that for 30 years. So when I tell
you that next year is my last year, it's not an easy thing to do.
I've always thought about the future. `Well, if I don't win today,
I'll get them next week.' Well, you know, I'm running out of
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Of more immediate concern for the three-time Cup champion is
today's second round of Brickyard 400 qualifying. Waltrip stood
32nd after the first round, and is out of provisionals heading into
today's second session of hot laps. He will need to place in the
top 36 on speed in order to compete tomorrow _ the same scenario he
faced at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth in March.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip rallied there to qualify 32nd and finish 25th in the
Primestar 500.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip's 84 Cup victories are most among active drivers and
tied with Bobby Allison for third on the all-time list. But Waltrip
has not won a Cup race since Sept. 6, 1992 at Darlington, S.C., a
span of 213 consecutive races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anyone else does or not, but I believe that
\Rcar owners\S Travis Carter, Carl Haas and Kmart can provide me
over the next 18 months an opportunity to win a few more races,''
said Waltrip, who began his Cup career with a five-race stint in
1972. ``That's our goal. That's why this is called `the Victory
Tour.' It would be kind of a fake tour _ it would be kind of a
farce _ if we said it was a Victory Tour and we didn't produce a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning a race now would be almost as big as winning that
first one in 1975.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip scored his first Cup victory at Nashville (Tenn.)
Speedway on May 10, 1975, in his 50th career start. But long before
that, he had developed a reputation as ``Jaws'' _ an upstart,
handsome kid from Owensboro, Ky., who was not afraid to tell the
NASCAR establishment how good a driver he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into this sport in 1972 and I've been a headliner ever
since,'' said Waltrip, 52, who won Cup championships in 1981, 1982
and 1985 for legendary driver/car-owner Junior Johnson. ``I always
like to say that when I'd go to town people would say, `Are you
here with the show?' And I'd say, `No, I am the show.' That's kind
of been my career in a nutshell, and it's hard to be just with the
show like I have been the last two or three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip is 38th in points, with 12th-place finishes at
Martinsville, Va., and Sonoma, Calif., his best in 18 starts. His
771 career Cup starts have produced 59 poles, 276 top-fives and 390
top-10s. He has led laps in 400 races for a total of 22,700.725
miles and earned $17,852,923.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip said one of his motivations for winning another race is
to allow daughters Jessica Lee, 11, and Sarah, 6, to enjoy a
Victory Lane celebration with their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean a lot to them,'' Waltrip said. ``I'd like for
them to realize that I haven't done this all my life for no
reason.'' \Nsubheds:Ford stars collide They made it through
qualifying unscathed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway yesterday
afternoon, but Mark Martin and Rusty Wallace couldn't avoid trading
paint during practice.
</P>
<P>
   The two stars were involved in NASCAR's version of a
fender-bender late yesterday afternoon at the south end of pit road
near Turn 1. Wallace was heading out of the garage area and
attempting to turn left when he ran into the side of Martin's car
as he was heading down pit road.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who qualified on the outside of the front row for
tomorrow's Brickyard 400, sustained significant sheet metal damage
to the left side of the No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus. But his Roush
Racing crew immediately began making repairs, with no intention of
going to a backup car.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who qualified the No. 2 Miller Lite Ford 17th, ended
the session with sheet metal damage to the right front fender.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Wallace are locked-in among the top 25 qualifiers.
Had they opted to go to backup cars, they would have been forced
under NASCAR rules to start at the back of the 43-car field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't Mark's fault, it wasn't my fault,'' Wallace said.
``If anything you could put the blame to the stop-and-go guys
\Rdirecting traffic\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the impact damaged the car's right spindle. As a
precaution, Wallace said all suspension parts on the right front
corner would be changed overnight and ready for practice today.

WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION CHIEF: NOT THE USUAL C.E.O. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are not many corporate headquarters where you wait in a
marble lobby on tan leather couches next to boxes of Castrol GTX
40-weight motor oil.
</P>
<P>
   Where workers push around clothes racks draped with yellow and
red rhinestoned capes. Where, upstairs, just outside the office of
the chairman of the board, you can pass the time watching two
sweat-soaked guys with a combined weight of almost 600 pounds
pummel each other on a dozen television screens.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are not a lot of businesses like the World
Wrestling Federation, which employs people known as Stone Cold
Steve, Sexual Chocolate and Meat and yet which said this week that
it planned an initial public offering of its stock, with the help
of Bear, Stearns, in the neighborhood of $172 million.
</P>
<P>
   There are also not many board chairmen like Vince McMahon, who
strode out into the waiting room in Stamford, Conn., Thursday in a
silky blue suit with a bright gold shirt, looking a whole lot like
Vince McMahon, the evil corporate-boss character he has played on
World Wrestling Federation broadcasts for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   In that incarnation, he has been attacked weekly by his nemesis,
Stone Cold Steve Austin. He has had beer poured on his
salt-and-pepper pompadour. Big men in suits have restrained him as
he lunges across the ropes, wielding a microphone like a club, the
bleeped-out curses flying like bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he looked much as he does on screen: an almost
cartoonish bodybuilder's physique, a cocky smile. He introduced
himself in his rumbling ringside baritone, but he did so almost
gently, shaking a reporter's hand and sipping a cup of coffee. Then
he and his wife, Linda, the company's president and chief
executive, spoke in his sunny office in the muted tones of
accountants about subjects that seemed to have no earthly
connection to piledrivers and full nelsons.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about their ``demos'' _ viewer demographics _ which
have helped the World Wrestling Federation and its parent company,
Titan Sports, dominate cable television ratings. They talked about
sharpening their television production values. And they mused about
their creation over the last several years of what they call a
perfect ``hybrid entertainment product,'' one that cobbles together
pieces of almost every television genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``You introduce more soap opera elements than you had before,''
he explains. ``You introduce more action-adventure elements than
ever before. You do _ I won't say comedy _ but you do some humor.
You introduce pyrotechnics. You introduce music, being a very, very
strong part.''
</P>
<P>
   And where does wrestling fit into all of this? McMahon looks
almost embarrassed. ``When you look at the amount of time of actual
wrestling in the ring,'' he admits, ``it's not very much. The
stories are more important sometimes than what you're going to
resolve physically in the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories? Resolve physically? It is hard to reconcile such
focus-group language with the image of professional wrestling, long
the domain of local television affiliates, run-down arenas and
scrappy promoters like Vincent Kennedy McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the kind of reconciliation that McMahon says he has
been working hard at, with occasional success, for almost his whole
adult life.
</P>
<P>
   He comes to the job with a long pedigree. His grandfather, Jess
McMahon, the son of a saloonkeeper who had immigrated from County
Clare in Ireland, became a well-known boxing promoter in New York
and then moved into wrestling promotion.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon's father, Vincent J. McMahon, took up where his father
had left off and formed the Capitol Wrestling Corp., which came to
control much of early televised wrestling in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon's parents were divorced shortly after he was born, and
he was raised in North Carolina by his mother (``I basically grew
up in an 8-foot-wide New Moon trailer _ which was not bad; a little
cramped from time to time'') and did not meet his father until he
was 12. But as soon as he met him, he knew exactly what he wanted
to do: wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Which was one reason why his father sent him to military school.
He suffered through college and a series of dead-end jobs _
salesman, worker in a rock quarry _ before he finally persuaded his
father to let him take a crack at what he really wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a promoter in Bangor, Maine,'' he explained, ``who was
stealing too much money.'' (They all stole a little, he said.)
McMahon was sent to take over the franchise, with the threat that
if he did not make it successful he would not be allowed to
continue in the business.
</P>
<P>
   His performance career came later, when one of his father's
announcers quit and McMahon filled in as an announcer at a
wrestling match in a Quonset hut in Hamburg, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest,'' he said Thursday grinning and chewing on a
chocolate protein bar, ``is history, as they say.''
</P>
<P>
   He has hit more than a few snags along the way. In 1993, the
U.S. attorney in Brooklyn charged him and his company with
conspiring to distribute steroids to wrestlers. He was acquitted by
a jury the following year, but the bad publicity helped drive down
his ratings.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon has also been heavily criticized by parents' groups,
because while his main audience is 18- to 34-year-olds, the
violence and increasingly adult themes of his shows have become
very popular among teen-agers and younger children.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his growing legitimacy in the money world, McMahon _
sounding a little more like his onscreen alter ego _ professes not
to think much about whether he is liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, I can't imagine me doing something to earn someone's
respect, to be legitimate,'' he said. ``I could care less what they
think. I'm going to be a regular guy, and I'm going to work my buns
off because I love what it is we do.''

CEDENO HAUNTS DODGERS WITH MAGICAL N.Y. SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One lap around the New York Mets clubhouse and
it's eerie how often you run into the ghosts of Dodgers past.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner is Mike Piazza, the one-time cornerstone with big
numbers and the big contract. In another is Orel Hershiser, still
pitching more than a decade after winning a Cy Young Award and a
World Series ring. Across the way is Bobby Bonilla, a grim reminder
of last year's transition from Peter O'Malley to Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in manager Bobby Valentine and pitching coach Dave Wallace
and it's the Dodgers the way they were supposed to be, in first
place with the best record in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the starkest connection to the past is quietly
sitting at his locker, lost in the sound of Latin music under a set
of head phones.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno gives a big smile and a wave, but it is still
scary. He is the ghost of Dodgers future.
</P>
<P>
   For years they pictured him doing what he's doing this year for
the Mets, batting .314, stealing 52 bases and securing a place as
one of the league's most exciting players.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno clearly is not the player who made every fly ball an
adventure, every dash from first to third a dance through land
mines. He is the one who pulled hamstrings and misplayed fly balls,
suffered broken toes and broken dreams.
</P>
<P>
   This year he nearly made the All-Star team and leads the league
in stolen bases heading into tonight's series opener against the
Dodgers at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a place that believed in me,'' Cedeno said. ``I'm on a
team where I'm not always looking over my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be simple to check off Cedeno as another Dodgers
disaster, another Pedro Martinez who was buried under a language
barrier and crushing expectations. But Valentine, who came up in
the Dodgers organization in the late 1960s, says it's more
complicated than that. For the first time, Cedeno excelled because
no one was waiting for miracles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen very often that a player comes to New York
with less pressure on him than the place he came from,'' Valentine
said. ``But that definitely was the case with Roger. When we traded
for him last winter, we saw him as a fourth outfielder at best. We
didn't see him as a savior. He came into spring training knowing
that there was no pressure. He just took off from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, who turns 25 later this month, was acquired in a
three-team trade with the Dodgers and Baltimore on Dec. 1. When
veteran free-agent Rickey Henderson started slowly, Cedeno became
the offensive catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I never saw in Los Angeles was his speed,'' said
Bonilla, who played just over a half-season with the Dodgers after
coming over from Florida in the Piazza trade. ``He just has a
confidence here that wasn't there before. But I don't blame the
Dodgers. Where was he going to play with (Raul Mondesi) in right,
(Devon White) in center and (Gary Sheffield) left? Sometimes you
have to let a guy move on and hope it doesn't come back to haunt
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno played parts of four seasons with the Dodgers. In 1996,
he took over in center when Brett Butler underwent surgery and
treatment for throat cancer. He played 86 games, batting an
unspectacular .246 and stealing just five bases.
</P>
<P>
   He also was tentative defensively and injury prone. He missed
the final 30 games of the 1997 season with a fractured left big toe
and was sidelined all of spring training and the first 20 games of
1998 with a strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think back to him in those days, that is what you
remember,'' Piazza said. ``He was getting an opportunity, but
things always got in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of it all, Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone says he
was reluctant to trade a switch hitter with speed regardless of his
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My scouts said he couldn't play center field,'' Malone said.
``There was no other place to put him in our outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem goes back even farther than that.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have an unofficial rule that any player signed out
of Latin America must spend at least two years playing for the
club's rookie-league team in the Dominican Republic. The move is
designed to give the players a chance to mature and develop before
arriving in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, a Venezuelan, played only 58 games for Santo Domingo
before heading to Great Falls, Mont., and the Dodgers minor-league
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anything I would do over, it would be keeping him
in the Dominican the full two years,'' said Dodgers chief Latin
scout Ralph Avila. ``He was just such a complete player, we forgot
how much he still had to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno and Valentine credit former Mets center fielder Mookie
Wilson, now a coach with the team, with the turnaround. Wilson took
over the project with only one goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there to restore his confidence,'' Wilson said. ``We
talked a lot about what happened with the Dodgers, but we didn't
dwell on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Cedeno's rebirth with the Mets, Valentine says Malone's
scouting report was accurate. Although Cedeno often is dazzling
defensively in right, he is shaky in center. Valentine hopes to put
Cedeno there some day, but when he traded starter Brian McRae at
the July 31 deadline, he got center fielder Darryl Hamilton in
return.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno got three hits Wednesday in Milwaukee after going through
his first extended slump with the Mets. Since July 17, he had gone
11 for 56 (.196) with 17 strikeouts, dropping his average from
.336.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine stayed with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't criticize the Dodgers and we certainly didn't have all
the answers,'' he said. ``We had some coaches who would have rolled
their eyes when Roger would make a mistake. But one thing we did
during the instruction was get him to answer us when we asked him a
question. A lot of times, a Latin player will just nod because he
doesn't understand the questions. We tried to communicate more and
I guess it got through.''

SWISSAIR AND BOEING TO JOINTLY SHOULDER DAMAGES FROM CRASH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (yn) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK In an unusual move, Swissair and Boeing agreed Thursday
to jointly assume financial responsibility for any monetary damages
that might result from last September's crash off Nova Scotia of a
Swissair jet in which all 229 people aboard died.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the airline and Boeing, which manufactured
the MD-11 jet, said they were not admitting guilt in the crash of
Swissair Flight 111, which took off from Kennedy International
Airport on Sept. 2, bound for Geneva, and crashed off Peggy's Cove,
Nova Scotia. Swissair and Boeing described Thursday's action as ``a
significant step in accelerating the process of settling damage
claims and enabling swift compensation of family members in cases
of proven damages.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Kreindler, a lawyer who represents about one-third of the
families of the Swissair passengers, said, ``It was a complete
shock and a reversal of what was said'' in previous court
proceedings by lawyers for Boeing and Swissair. ``I praise them for
it. It's what they should have done much earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 167 lawsuits were filed after the Swissair crash,
seeking a total of $16 billion in damages. Thursday's action does
not mean that Boeing or Swissair will pay damages to the victims'
families in the near future, nor does it specify how much in
damages they will pay, spokesmen for the plaintiffs and the
defendants said Thursday. The cause of the crash has not been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and Swissair also retain the ability to sue others for
any money they may pay to passengers. The damages are likely to be
covered by Swissair's and Boeing's insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing and Swissair announcement was made Thursday before a
judge in Philadelphia presiding over the lawsuits, Judge James
Giles, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Kreindler, who was the lead lawyer in the lengthy litigation
after the 1988 crash of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, said
Boeing's and Swissair's action was extremely rare. ``It is
extraordinary,'' he said. ``I have not seen it in 45 years of
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The move essentially eliminated the need for a trial to
determine who was at fault, Kreindler said, and moved the process
forward to future trials for damages.
</P>
<P>
   Kreindler said he expected damages in the case to exceed the
$550 million in payments in the Pan Am 103 case because more adults
and heads of households were on Swissair 111, making economic loss
somewhat easier for lawyers for the passengers to prove than in the
cases of children or young single adults.
</P>
<P>
   While the cause of the Swissair crash has not been determined,
Canadian investigators have found extensive wiring problems on
several MD-11 airplanes, which are manufactured by Boeing's
McDonnell Douglas division. Safety inspections of MD-11 wiring have
been ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   While generally praising Boeing's and Swissair's assumption of
financial responsibility, Kreindler said he also saw ``a dark
side.'' He said that a large number of Swiss and other Europeans
had sued in U.S. courts and that the Boeing and Swissair action
might be a legal maneuver to short-circuit the kind of lengthy
investigation that comes from a trial to determine liability and
thereby reduce the amount of any damages paid. Boeing and Swissair
might even move to dismiss the foreigners' lawsuits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a method to their madness,'' Kreindler said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Pash, a spokeswoman for Swissair North America in
Melville, N.Y., said, ``We approach every claim against us as an
individual claim. Our aim here is to expedite claims for family
members, period.''

GEENA DAVIS ZEROS IN WITH BOW AND ARROWS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If everything goes her way, Geena Davis, the Oscar-winning
actress, will be at the 2000 Sydney Olympics as a member of the
U.S. archery team.
</P>
<P>
   Despite taking up archery a little more than two years ago,
Davis finished 29th among the 300 women at the national
championships July 12 to 16 in Oxford, Ohio. She and the others in
the top 32 qualified for the U.S. Olympic trials semifinals Aug. 22
to 24 in Bloomfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``My archery hadn't become public knowledge until now,'' she
said by telephone Thursday from Los Angeles, ``and I'm grateful for
that. This was my little secret. I'm just considered one of the
archers, but at the beginning, when people saw me shooting, they
said, `What?' That was kind of fun, just seeing their reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was on vacation in Italy recently, I entered a
tournament in Florence. The other archers said, `What?' I won the
tournament. They didn't expect that, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that growing up she was hardly an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the girls' track team in high school,'' she said. ``I
did the high jump and the hurdles, the tall people's events. I was
6 feet tall by the time I was 18, but in track I stood around
mostly. I never considered myself athletic or coordinated.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who won an Oscar for her role in ``The Accidental
Tourist,'' was introduced to archery by watching the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics on television. She was impressed by Justin Huish, the
21-year-old Californian who won two gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fascinated by how he shot arrows across the street at
home and through his garage,'' she said. ``It was kind of cool. He
made it sound like fun, and that inspired me eventually to look
into it. I met Justin at the beginning of 1997. He hooked me up
with his coach that spring and I started taking lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started competing in tournaments after the first six months.
My first tournament was in Tucson. I don't remember how I did.
Unless you go in with the intention of winning, it's just seeing
how well you can do. And how good was I going to do? I thought it
was tremendous fun. Everybody was so welcoming and encouraging and
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one problem there. I tried to figure out when to go to
the bathroom. I thought I had picked the right time, but I didn't
and I missed a chance to shoot against the No. 1 archer. She felt
so bad that she went to the judge and said, `This is her first
tournament. Can she shoot?' They let me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Davis said, she is practicing five hours a day, six days a
week, shooting 300 arrows a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I just got hooked,'' she said. ``It's really fun to
try to see how good you can get, and I don't know how good that is.
I haven't maxed out. I haven't peaked. I'm trying to get better.
The last movie I made, I had them set up a target on an empty stage
and I shot arrows between movie shots.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows her chances to make the Olympic team are slim. Only
the top eight in the semifinal trials will qualify for the final
trials Sept. 4 to 5 in Chula Vista, Calif., and those finals will
produce the three female Olympians and one alternate.
</P>
<P>
   Her competitors have enjoyed her presence. ``She is totally
accepted,'' said Christine McCartney, the National Archery
Association's program director. ``She is a competent archer who
knows what she is doing, and the others have a lot of respect and
regard for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The others are also grateful that Davis will bring attention to
what is considered a second-tier Olympic sport. And Davis says she
is grateful for what archery is doing for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn a lot about yourself,'' she said. ``You're spending
a lot of time alone with yourself practicing. You get to know
yourself, how calm you can be, how long you can focus. You have to
be very self-motivated. You have to have faith in yourself and
believe in your abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she is not giving up one career for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm between movies now,'' she said. ``I have to keep making
movies. I have yet to make a lot of money from archery.''
</P>
<P>
   With her archery skills, how about a Robin Hood movie?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't matter,'' she said. ``You can fake stuff in
movies. I played fake baseball in `A League of Their Own.' After
the movie came out, I got an invitation from people organizing an
all-star baseball game. They said, `You can obviously play.' I
said: `You're going to throw a 94-mile-an-hour fastball at me? No,
thanks.' It would have been a massacre.''

UNHAPPY DEMOCRATS  
 DOING A REVERSE FORBES  
 KEEPING GORE'S CANOE AFLOAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, N.H., Va., S.C., Mich., Ore.)  (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under rules set by the Democratic National Committee, no state
may hold a Democratic presidential caucus or primary before next
March 7, with the traditional exception of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Pleas from a number of states for a waiver to vote earlier, and
thereby gain more influence in the nominating process, have been
repeatedly rejected. Democratic leaders in those states have been
warned that if there are violations, sanctions will be applied,
including perhaps a loss of some seats at the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Over on the Republican side, the rules are less restrictive. As
things now stand, it appears that efforts by states to front-load
the nominating process mean that at least half a dozen states will
hold caucuses or primaries before March 7, among them Delaware,
Michigan, Arizona, South Carolina and Washington, with Louisiana,
North Dakota and Virginia likely to join that list.
</P>
<P>
   So much early Republican voting has so upset five leading
Democrats whose states want waivers that they have sent the DNC a
letter in which they complain that Iowa and New Hampshire have been
extended ``undemocratic privilege,'' and warn that such special
treatment will have a ``negative impact on the fortunes of
Democratic candidates in the 2000 campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, signed by Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina, Sen.
Carl Levin of Michigan, Phil Kiesling, the secretary of state of
Oregon, and two Democratic state chairmen, Mark Fleisher of Arizona
and Paul Berendt of Washington, demands that the committee grant
waivers in the short term and then rewrite the party's nominating
rules before the 2004 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowa and New Hampshire will hold their contests on Jan. 31 and
Feb. 8, respectively,'' the letter says. ``Then, while the
Democratic Party is immobilized on the sidelines by its own rules,
the Republicans will dominate the news for four weeks, with
primaries in Delaware, South Carolina, Arizona, Michigan and
Washington. By the time the DNC-mandated window opens March 7, the
GOP may not only have established its presumptive nominee but will
have framed the political debate in a manner that will harm our
state parties and could disadvantage our ultimate nominee. We are
loyal Democrats. But we cannot remain silent if blind obedience to
unworkable party rules is the DNC's response.''
</P>
<P>
   The national committee has scheduled a meeting for Aug. 14 to
discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Switcheroo
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Michael Forbes of New York abandoned the Republican
Party and became a Democrat three weeks ago, he left Republican
congressional leaders with a seat to fill on the House
Appropriations Committee, where membership is much coveted. At
least 10 members have expressed an interest in the seat, but it
appears all would be well-advised to keep their expectations in
check.
</P>
<P>
   Roll Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper, reports that party
leaders have a special candidate in mind: Rep. Virgil Goode Jr., a
second-term Virginia ... Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   Say switch _ as in Goode's doing a reverse Forbes and becoming a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders are reported to be willing to give him
the Appropriations seat as a payoff for making the leap, and
Virginia Republican leaders are said to be willing to give him a
special break when congressional redistricting takes place after
the 2000 census, assuming they are in control of the legislature
and the governor's office, a good possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Goode is mum about his party plans.
</P>
<P>
   But should he make the leap, the trip to the other side would
not be all that long since he is one of the more conservative
Democrats in the House and frequently sides with Republicans on key
issues, most notably the vote to impeach President Clinton. He also
sometimes meets with Republican groups in his district, the 5th,
which covers the south-central part of the state and has voted
Republican in the last two presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote:
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is still a member of Appropriations, thanks to another
member, Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., chairman of the Congressional
Black Caucus. He agreed to take a leave of absence from the
committee to make room for the New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   No word yet on what payoff, if any, Clyburn will get. But he
says he stepped aside ``with an eye toward my future.''
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Money?
</P>
<P>
   Remember that photo-op canoe trip that Vice President Al Gore
took last month in New Hampshire on the Connecticut River to
promote environmental concerns and, not incidentally, his
presidential hopes?
</P>
<P>
   It got more attention than he wanted. To make sure his canoe did
not run aground (now there's a metaphoric shot that a campaign that
some say is adrift could do without), the local hydropower company
opened its sluice gates extra wide for a while, which raised the
water level _ and also some dander.
</P>
<P>
   A waste of valuable water during a bad drought, said some
conservationists.
</P>
<P>
   A waste of valuable water by a Democrat during a bad drought,
said some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The power company, PG&AMP;E Generating, said the water was due to be
released later that day anyway for generating purposes and that it
simply moved up the time to accommodate the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Did the changed timing of the release cause the company to gain
or lose any money, given the way that wholesale electric rates
sometimes fluctuate hour to hour? Are there tax consequences or
campaign gift consequences?
</P>
<P>
   The way Steve Duprey, the chairman of the New Hampshire
Republican Party, sees it, the release constituted an illegal
campaign contribution. He filed a complaint Thursday with the
Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign called the complaint a frivolous publicity
stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duprey's up a creek without a paddle,'' said Doug Hattaway, a
spokesman in the campaign's New Hampshire office.

   ALBANY _ Unable to calm the partisan tensions that have buffeted
it all year, the New York Legislature Thursday spent the last
scheduled day of its annual session in disarray. In an apt finale
to one of the most unproductive sessions in recent memory, Gov.
George Pataki and lawmakers failed to resolve most of the major
outstanding issues before them because they could not overcome some
relatively small disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate ended the session Thursday afternoon and its
members left Albany, but the Assembly continued to work into the
night as the speaker, Sheldon Silver, tried to negotiate with
Pataki to salvage some of the bills that had been given up for
dead. But even if they reached agreement on those bills, they could
not be immediately made law with the Senate members gone, and the
Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, insisted that they would not
return anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and the legislative leaders had been trying to
reach deals on measures that would have stiffened penalties for
stalking and for blocking abortion clinics, expanded the state's
database of DNA specimens from criminals and allowed the
construction of new power plants. They focused on those bills after
jettisoning others that proved even more nettlesome, including one
that would have permitted New York to join the multistate Powerball
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and the Legislature did agree to extend a law that
allows thousands of people to live in otherwise illegal loft
apartments, mostly in lower Manhattan. Otherwise, the recent talks
yielded mostly grief. As with the state budget, which the
Legislature approved earlier this week after missing the deadline
by more than four months, all sides at times seemed more willing to
get nothing done than to hand a victory to the opposition. The
session, which began in early January, had been scheduled to
conclude on June 16, but it was repeatedly extended because of the
haggling over the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a frustrating and exasperating session,'' Bruno
said. ``Not just today and yesterday, but practically since we
started the session.''
</P>
<P>
   After negotiating well into Wednesday night, Bruno, who is known
for his impatience with Albany's penchant for delay and
gamesmanship, threw up his hands Thursday afternoon and broke off
discussions with Silver. Bruno then had the Senate pass the latest
drafts of the important remaining bills and send them to the
Assembly. The Senate then recessed.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, rejected those versions of the
bills, but in a surreal touch to the last hours of the session, he
tried Thursday night to cobble together new compromises with
Pataki, even though there would have been no way for the bills to
become law immediately even had he reached a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse in talks Thursday was largely caused by the
longstanding Albany strategy of linking unrelated measures to exert
leverage. For example, Pataki, the Republican majority in the
Senate and the Democratic majority in the Assembly all in principle
backed the legislation toughening penalties for blocking abortion
clinics. But the Assembly Democrats wanted the bill more, so Pataki
and the Senate Republicans tried to use that to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republicans added to their version of the clinic bill
some provisions that created the DNA database and the stalking
penalties. The Democrats balk at some aspects of those provisions,
but the Republicans figured that the Democrats might capitulate to
win the clinic access measure. In the end, the whole exercise blew
up.

A LOST CHANCE TO LET ATTICA REST IN PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Will the ghosts of Attica ever find rest? Not the way
New York state officials and the courts have been going, it would
seem. The latest sign came this week with a federal appeals court's
ruling that suggests this long, sad affair will gnaw at our
collective conscience into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough already,'' said Frank Smith, who is 66 and has been a
central figure in the Attica story from the beginning, 28 years
ago. ``I'd like to finally see a settlement,'' he said Thursday.
``I'm sick of the legal mumbo jumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   So is almost everyone else who has looked at the world
differently since that gray morning in 1971 when Attica became more
than the site of a maximum-security prison east of Buffalo. For
many, the very name came to mean wholesale death at the hands of
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you remember.
</P>
<P>
   There had been a spontaneous riot on Sept. 9, 1971, that turned
into a four-day siege, with hundreds of inmates taking over the
yard of a cell block and holding several dozen guards hostage.
Outside mediators, including leading politicians, were brought in
to try to work out a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
   It was a scene both weird and scary. The inmates in the yard
were no saints. Some had clubbed a guard to death in the first
moments of rioting. Others _ though it was not known at the time _
had killed three fellow convicts.
</P>
<P>
   But Attica will always be synonymous with violence committed in
the name of the people of New York. An assault on the prison by
state troopers, under the ultimate command of Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller, became the bloodiest one-day clash between Americans
since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, troopers fired indiscriminately on inmates and
hostages alike, killing 39 and wounding more than 80. A
disillusioned state prosecutor, Malcolm Bell, later described it as
a ``turkey shoot.'' Herman Badillo, then a congressman from the
Bronx who was brought in as a mediator, called it a ``bloody
massacre'' and a ``willful police riot.'' Over the years, state
commissions and federal juries essentially agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting stopped, state officials distorted reality.
They said the troopers were sent in because the convicts had begun
murdering hostages and castrating some. Untrue, autopsies later
showed. All the killing that day was by the police.
</P>
<P>
   And once the prison was back in their control, guards and police
officers resorted to what federal judges would call ``brutal acts
of retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Inmates were forced to crawl naked over broken glass. One man
had a screwdriver repeatedly shoved into his rectum as he lay on
the ground. Smith, identified as an inmate leader, was forced to
lie naked on a table for hours with a football propped under his
chin. If he let the ball drop, he was warned, he would be killed or
castrated.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the question has been not what happened at Attica _
that is hardly in dispute _ but who would be held accountable.
Governors and attorneys general came and went, all unwilling to
accept state responsibility and refusing to settle civil lawsuits
first brought by inmates 25 years ago. The courts did little to
speed things along. To say that the cases crawled at a snail's pace
is to insult snails.
</P>
<P>
   But one case produced results, in 1992. A federal jury in
Buffalo found Karl Pfeil, Attica's deputy warden in 1971, liable
for having overseen anti-inmate reprisals. Five years later,
another jury followed up with a damages award of $4 million to
Smith. By previous agreement, the money was to be paid by the
state.
</P>
<P>
   With an award that large, Smith said then, the jury was saying
that ``just because you're in prison, they can't beat you like a
dog and get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   This week, his award was overturned by a three-judge panel of
the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan. The trial
judge's instructions to the jury were ``enigmatic'' and improper,
the panel said, sending the case back to the lower courts and
square one.
</P>
<P>
   So the question remains. Will Attica ever be put to rest?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is still possible. The appellate judges made clear
that they, too, were fed up with endless delay by officials who
``have done all they could'' to leave this old canker untreated.
Stripped of legal niceties, their message to the courts and to the
state was really no different from Smith's: ``Enough already.''

SEC SAYS BEAR STEARNS SUBSIDIARY ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to strengthen allegation in the lede and to make 2nd sentence
more accurate, including insertion of `civil.' Adds sentence re
Baron in 3rd graf. Inserts new 4th graf.)  (mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Securities and Exchange Commission charged
Thursday that a subsidiary of Bear Stearns Cos., Wall Street's
sixth-largest brokerage firm, actively participated in a major
fraud that led to millions of dollars in investor losses.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns settled the civil fraud charges with the commission
and also reached a settlement with the Manhattan district attorney
without admitting or denying the allegations, and agreed to pay
$38.5 million in fines and restitution. The commission also brought
securities fraud charges against Richard Harriton, the president of
the subsidiary, who resigned and plans to fight the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement ends a three-year investigation into Bear
Stearns' role handling securities trades for A.R. Baron, a small
New York brokerage firm that collapsed in 1996 and caused $75
million in investor losses. Baron had more than 5,000 customers in
its years of operations, and all but a few of them lost money with
the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, who won 14
convictions against Baron and its employees, was investigating the
Bear Stearns relationship with Baron, but had not brought charges
against the larger firm.
</P>
<P>
   By holding Bear Stearns accountable in the Baron case, the SEC
makes clear that any firm, legal, accounting or financial, that
helps another commit a fraud must take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In its settlement, the commission described a pattern of
misconduct that is surprising for a firm of Bear Stearns' stature.
The SEC said that Bear Stearns took extraordinary steps to keep
A.R. Baron, an obviously troubled firm, in business. It knew that
Baron completed numerous trades that were unauthorized, yet the
larger firm took money from accounts to pay for the unauthorized
trades and refused to return the funds to the customers even after
Baron admitted as much.
</P>
<P>
   Although the $38.5 million that Bear has agreed to pay is
immaterial to the wealthy firm, the settlement will damage its
reputation among clients, creditors and competitors. Of that
amount, $5 million is a fine paid to the SEC, the sixth-largest
fine ever levied against a brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the investigation, Bear Stearns maintained that it
did nothing wrong. Bear Stearns said Thursday that the fraud
charges were merely technical in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, director of enforcement at the SEC, disagreed.
``Bear Stearns Securities Corp. is charged with causing a massive
fraud, a fraud that cost investors millions,'' Walker said. ``There
is nothing new in the proposition that those participating in a
fraud should be held accountable for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is by no means the end of the investigations into
Bear Stearns' activities as the Wall Street leader in clearing, the
business of processing securities trades for other smaller firms
and providing them with capital to operate. Federal prosecutors in
Brooklyn and Manhattan continue to examine Bear Stearns' clearing
relationships with two other small brokerage firms charged with
bilking investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in lower Manhattan Thursday, Morgenthau,
the district attorney, said that his criminal investigation into
Harriton's conduct also remains active. In a statement, Harriton's
lawyer called the SEC civil complaint baseless and said that his
client would fight the charges.
</P>
<P>
   James Cayne, the chief executive officer of Bear Stearns who has
vigorously defended Harriton throughout the investigation, said:
``We are disappointed that Dick is leaving, but we understand that
his considerations as an individual are different than ours as a
corporation. We respect his decision.'' Harriton, a 20-year veteran
at Bear Stearns and the man responsible for building its clearing
business, was among the firm's most powerful executives.
</P>
<P>
   The details laid out in the SEC's 23-page cease and desist order
belie past claims by Bear Stearns' management that its powerful
clearing subsidiary had only a passive role, if any at all, in the
Baron fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the commission began imposing new rules for
clearing firms that require them to notify regulators of customer
complaints, rules intended to prevent such transgressions in the
future. Historically, clearing firms have argued that they simply
process trades and are therefore not responsible for policing
practices at the smaller brokerage firms they count as customers.
Those days are over. ``This case establishes that clearing firms
cannot simply turn a blind eye to fraud,'' Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC, Bear Stearns did that and more. Although
Bear Stearns was aware of excessive unauthorized trading in Baron
accounts, Walker said the firm helped keep A.R. Baron in business,
allowing it to defraud customers.
</P>
<P>
   The violations upon which the SEC order are based took place
from September 1995 through July 1996. The SEC alleges that many of
Bear Stearns' violations came as Harriton tried to protect the
company from large losses as a result of its clearing relationship
with the financially troubled A.R. Baron.
</P>
<P>
   It took only two months of transactions with A.R. Baron for Bear
Stearns employees to see signs of fraud in Baron's practices.
Almost immediately, Bear Stearns began taking steps to insulate
itself from the smaller firm's fraudulent activities. On Sept. 22,
Harriton required that all Baron's trades in customer accounts be
faxed to Bear Stearns; only those trades that the firm determined
would not increase its credit exposure to Baron were allowed. This
meant that many trades ordered by Baron's customers were not
completed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC, Bear Stearns not only disregarded the
instructions of Baron's customers, but repeatedly charged those
customers with trades that it knew were unauthorized. In one case,
involving a Baron customer Diaward Steel Works Ltd., Bear Stearns
took it upon itself to sell $1 million of the customers' securities
to cover trades that the clearing firm knew to be unauthorized and
that Diaward refused to pay for.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC, Bear Stearns also refused to return
securities and funds that it had taken to pay for unauthorized
trades to their rightful owners, even though Baron had told Bear
Stearns the trades were unauthorized. Bear Stearns also repeatedly
asked for credit extensions to cover Baron's unauthorized trades
and helped Baron to operate even when the firm's capital fell below
the amount required by regulators for it to be able to continue
conducting business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Harriton encouraged employees to discard documents
relating to A.R. Baron's operations, a violation of securities laws
that require firms to maintain such records.
</P>
<P>
   When HMA Investments Inc., a Baron customer, complained to Bear
Stearns about unauthorized trades in its account and provided Bear
Stearns with a letter from two Baron brokers admitting the trades
were unauthorized, Harriton refused to reverse the transactions. He
also froze accounts HMA held at another brokerage firm whose trades
Bear Stearns cleared. In January 1996, Harriton directed Bear
Stearns to liquidate HMA's accounts at the other brokerage firm and
credited Baron with the payment.
</P>
<P>
   Fiduciary Management Services Ltd., a private company based in
the Bahamas, lost $890,000 in the A.R. Baron fraud. Ian Barry, the
firm's investment manager, was vigilant about notifying Bear
Stearns when unauthorized trades showed up in its account. But Bear
Stearns simply referred him back to A.R. Baron.
</P>
<P>
   Barry initially felt confident that the problems would be
addressed. He said: ``I had a definite comfort level knowing Bear
Stearns was there. I feel I acted in accordance with the
requirements and I was let down.'' Fiduciary took its case to Lewis
Lowenfels, a prominent securities lawyer who was one of the first
to recognize that clearing firms were not completely insulated from
liability stemming from the behavior of their clearing firm
customers. When told of the settlement, Barry said: ``We hope that
this will finally bring our recovery efforts to a satisfactory
conclusion. We always felt that Bear Stearns bore certain
responsibilities in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In its charges against Harriton, the SEC alleges that Harriton
had a deal with Andrew Bressman, chairman of A.R. Baron, to profit
personally from initial public offerings underwritten by the firm.
Only the fact that Baron failed before the stock offering could be
completed prevented Harriton from making good on this arrangement,
which would have been outright securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   William McLucas, partner at Wilmer Cutler &AMP; Pickering in
Washington and a former director of enforcement at the SEC when the
case began, called the Bear Stearns settlement a warning flag to
others. ``It says to a clearing firm you cannot ignore clear and
unequivocal evidence of violations of the law and abuse of
customers by the introducing firm, and if you do, you do so at your
peril.''
</P>
<P>
   In settling with the SEC, Bear Stearns agreed to cease and
desist from committing or causing any such frauds in the future. It
also agreed to retain, within one month's time, an independent
consultant, to be appointed by the SEC, to conduct a review of the
firm's supervisory and compliance policies.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement announced Thursday, Bear Stearns
agreed to pay $1 million to the state of New York, $1 million to
the City of New York and $1.5 million to the district attorney's
office to cover the costs of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   That Bear Stearns was a direct cause of a significant securities
fraud is a black mark on the record of its chairman, Alan
Greenberg, and president, James Cayne, upon whose watch these
transgressions took place. The board of directors could be
vulnerable to charges that it was not attending to details as well.
</P>
<P>
   A clue to how a firm as big and well-known as Bear Stearns could
have been an integral part of such a fraud may lie in a promotional
piece Bear Stearns published celebrating its scrappy corporate
culture. Among the firm's self-avowed cultural mottoes is this one:
``Protect the Money Machine.''
</P>
<P>
   State securities regulators have already begun to look into
matters involving clearing firms. Joseph Borg, the Alabama
securities commissioner, said, ``I am concerned that the facts in
the order clearly point out that Bear Stearns knew of the problems
that were existing and rather than recognizing their civic
responsibility to the investing public, they apparently went the
other way.''

<P>
   Zohara Schatz, a sculptor who designed a symbolic menorah for
the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, died Aug. 3 in
Jerusalem after a long illness. She was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schatz's aluminum six-branched candelabrum of 1985
represented the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust. The piece,
considered Yad Vashem's emblem, marks the entrance to the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The menorah is lighted once a year, on Holocaust Remembrance
Day, or Yom ha-Shoah.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Ms. Schatz, who created abstract works in metals and
plastics, was the first woman to win the Israel Prize. The
country's president bestows the award to distinguished scholars,
writers, artists and public figures. She won the prize when she
headed the Department of Arts and Crafts in the Israel's Industry
and Trade Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   She also won the Dizengoff Prize and awards from Yad Vashem and
New York's Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Her sculptures and decorative works are featured at sites
throughout Jerusalem, and her work also has been shown in New
York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and in New York galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Boris Schatz, founded the Bezalel Academy of Arts
and Design in Jerusalem. Ms. Schatz studied at Bezalel and later
taught there, and she was a member of Yad Vashem's board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   She dedicated her final years to promoting the members of the
Jerusalem Artists Association and those in the Artists' Village at
Ein Hod in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schatz is survived by cousins. &QL;

Departements in penultimate graf.) 
DeLAY: IT WAS THE REPUBLICANS' PLAN TO SPEND NEXT YEAR'S SURPLUS(rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tom DeLay, the House majority whip and conservative
field marshal, said Thursday that Republicans would spend next
year's anticipated $14 billion budget surplus _ and had intended to
do so all year long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to spend it, and then some,'' he said. ``From the
get-go, the strategy has always been we're going to spend what's
left.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, DeLay said, was for Republicans to drain all of the
surplus out of next year's budget and force President Clinton to
pay for any of his additional spending requests out of the Social
Security surplus, which both parties have pledged to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no money left,'' he said. ``The only way he can get
all that spending is to spend the Social Security surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican strategy, DeLay said, will force Clinton to sign
their spending bills _ which, except from the defense budget, have
been cut by roughly $26 billion from this year's levels _ or break
his pledge to keep his hands off Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president wants to spend the Social Security surplus,
he's going to have to go to the American people and convince them
that's important,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's comments, made in an interview in his office, were the
first explanation of such a plan to come from the House Republican
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks came as a surprise to some senior members of the
House Appropriations Committee, which is in charge of the spending
bills that finance the government. But none of those members would
publicly criticize or question DeLay or his strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The spending described by DeLay would turn the projected surplus
into a deficit. He said the first federal budget surplus in 30
years was almost certainly going to disappear as a consequence of
the Senate's passage on Wednesday of a $7.4 billion emergency aid
package for farmers. The House will have a similar bill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that even if the spending swallowed up the budget
surplus, the Republicans had a plan to use various budgetary
mechanisms that would allow them to say they had stuck to the
strict spending caps they imposed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do everything we can to hold on to the caps,''
he said. ``But what's more important to us is not spending a dime
of the Social Security surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation that DeLay anticipates has high stakes. The
fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, and Clinton has indicated that he
will veto some of the spending bills because of the deep cuts
imposed by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   If the argument over spending is not reconciled by Sept. 30,
Congress must pass a continuing resolution to allow federal
agencies to spend money, or shut down the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have had two showdowns like this with Clinton
since taking control of Congress in the 1994 elections. Each time,
the Republicans have lost. In October 1995, Clinton embarrassed
Republicans by forcing them into a politically disastrous
government shutdown. And last October, he outmaneuvered them again.
Congress crammed $21 billion in ``emergency'' spending into a
last-minute bill, mostly for programs the president favored.
</P>
<P>
   Not this year, DeLay vowed. ``We will negotiate with the
president, after he vetoes the bills, on his knees,'' he said. Bill
by bill, he said, ``we will try to resist every one of his spending
proposals.'' And he indicated that if the spending caps were
lifted, that was acceptable ``as long as the American people
understand it's the president busting the caps, not us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard for the president to explain to the American
people that he's shut down the government because he wants more
spending than last year,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay spoke as Congress, staggering toward an August recess,
struggled to pass two more spending bills. The Senate, after days
of negotiations over amendments favoring the oil, gas and mining
industries that were attached to the $14.1 billion Interior
Department spending bill, gave up work Thursday night. The House
late Thursday night narrowly passed a hotly disputed bill financing
the Commerce, State and Justice Departments by a partisan 217-210
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has vowed to veto both over spending cuts and policy
issues.
</P>
<P>
   With 18 working days left before Sept. 30, only one of the 13
spending bills financing the government is ready for Clinton's
signature. The House has passed 11 of the bills, and the Senate
nine, but a House-Senate conference must smooth out differences
before the bills can be sent to the White House.

BEHRENS MISSES POINT

<P>
   At Del Mar, they've started the countdown to the $1 million
Pacific Classic, the San Diego County track's marquee event and the
``NTRA Champions on Fox'' series' climactic race.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a countdown to a spectacular launch or an
embarrassing fizzle depends on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, the Aug. 29 race will have Real Quiet and
Victory Gallop _ an attractive rematch of the 1998 Triple Crown
stars _ as well as Malek, the best horse or horses to emerge from
Saturday's San Diego Handicap, and perhaps Old Trieste.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pacific Classic is going to come up a great race,'' Del
Mar racing secretary Tom Knust said. ``You've got three of the top
four handicap horses in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But the one who's missing is Behrens, the top points-earner in
the NTRA series. His absence is embarrassing and significant
because it means the inaugural NTRA series hasn't matched its
promise.
</P>
<P>
   The rules for the 11-race series require horses to compete in
the Pacific Classic to convert their points into cash _ at a rate
of $5,000 a point for the winner, $4,000 for the runnerup, $3,000
for third and so on down to fifth. That should have made the race a
showdown of the nation's leading handicap horses.
</P>
<P>
   For the owners of Behrens, with 46 points after winning the
Oaklawn, Massachusetts and Suburban handicaps, a Pacific Classic
victory would bring $330,000 in bonus money on top of the $600,000
winner's purse.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Behrens' eastern-based owners and trainer decided to pass up
that money, fearing the effects of a cross-country trip on their
horse's preparations for the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park
on Oct. 10 and the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream
Park on Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they'd love us to be there (Del Mar), and I'd love
to be there for racing because it would be good for (TV) ratings,''
trainer Jim Bond said from Saratoga. ``But these horses are not
machines; we want the Breeders' Cup, and there can only be one
Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond said he supports the series in principle and likes what the
Fox network has tried to do with its coverage, featuring a
more-hip-than-traditional style designed for the younger audience
racing craves. But the Pacific Classic didn't fit into Behrens'
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   That should worry the National Thoroughbred Racing Association,
which has made the series for 3-year-olds and up its most visible
initiative, suggesting this could spawn similar series for horses
in other divisions. If it's not good enough for Behrens this
season, why should it be any more appealing to leading horses of
the future?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a situation where the points and the money are
not substantial enough to make people gear their horses toward
certain races,'' said Tom Knust, racing secretary at Del Mar. Knust
suggests increasing the bonus money is a possible solution.
</P>
<P>
   NTRA spokesman Eric Wing said discussions about changing the
series for 2000 haven't begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first year. On the whole, the results have been quite
good,'' Wing said. ``I don't think it (Behrens' absence from Del
Mar) tarnishes the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop nosed out Behrens in a thrilling Whitney Handicap
_ part of the NTRA series _ at Saratoga on Sunday. Victory Gallop
trainer Elliott Walden is risking a trip west because he thinks
major victories on both coasts would boost the colt's Horse of the
Year chances.
</P>
<P>
   The NTRA should root for Victory Gallop to take the Pacific
Classic !ital!and the Breeders' Cup Classic, proving there can be
two Super Bowls and you can win them both.
</P>
<P>
   __  &UR; Coming home: &LR;  Enticed by a contract with Saudi Prince Ahmed
Salman's Thoroughbred Corp., Gary Stevens will return to ride in
California at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   That will mark the end of Stevens' three-month verbal agreement
with English trainer Michael Stoute. Stevens has done well in
Europe but probably missed his children and grew tired of the long
commutes involved in English racing life.
</P>
<P>
   The Thoroughbred Corp. contract calls for Stevens to ride all
over the United States and promises the 36-year-old a position with
the company after he quits the saddle. For a jockey, job security
such as that is hard to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   __  &UR; The weekend: &LR;  San Diego is left with a small field _ River
Keen, Mazel Trick, Tibado and Budroyale from the rail out _ after
Bob Baffert withdrew Real Quiet because the 1 1/16-mile distance is
too short for him.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening to overshadow the San Diego on Saturday is
Chilukki's California debut in the Sorrento Stakes. The Bob
Baffert-trained 2-year-old filly is undefeated after three starts
in Kentucky. She and David Flores will head a field of six going 6{
furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big week for 3-year-olds back east. Saturday's Haskell at
Monmouth Park has Baffert-trained Forestry going for his sixth
consecutive victory. Sunday's Jim Dandy at Saratoga marks Lemon
Drop Kid's first start since winning the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   __  &UR; Induction day: &LR;  D. Wayne Lukas, who'll go into the Racing
Hall of Fame along with jockey Russell Baze in Saratoga Springs,
N.Y., on Monday, is being hailed for ``revolutionizing'' the sport
as the first trainer to succeed on such a grand, nationwide scale.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with the Lukas-as-revolutionary image is that nobody
has been able to follow him. In his third decade in the
thoroughbred game, he's still one of a kind. That's why he's a Hall
of Famer.

HOUSTON HOSPITAL AGREES NOT TO STOP LIFE SUPPORT IN FETUS CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Houston hospital agreed Thursday to get court
permission before withdrawing life-support treatment from a
comatose pregnant woman _ even if her doctors declare her to be
brain-dead.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Memorial Hospital Northwest said such a decision was
entirely up to a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital attorney Craig Smyser said the two positions are not
contradictory because the hospital has said all along that it
cannot make the decisions on Tammy Martin's medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a dog in this hunt,'' Smyser told Harris County
Probate Judge Rory Olsen at a hearing Thursday. ``We are in the
middle of a fight between other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Martin vowed to keep up the legal fight to stop the
life support and allow Martin and her fetus, now 16 weeks old, to
die.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Law, 35, who claims to be the biological father of the
fetus and common-law husband of the 34-year-old woman, wants the
treatment continued at least until the fetus can be taken from the
womb, between 23 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing will be held Aug. 13 to determine who will be declared
Martin's guardian and possibly make the decision on maintaining or
withdrawing life support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's insane to keep a dead woman alive on a machine like she's
an incubator,'' said Martin's brother, Lonnie, 40, of nearby
Splendora, after Thursday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Law, wearing a pin with pink and blue ribbons and a heart-shaped
picture of himself and Tammy Martin, choked back tears and said,
``I'm pleased.'' He declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Law's attorney, Jared Woodfill, said the hospital's agreement
Thursday was ``a real victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By maintaining the status quo, it's another day, another week,
that the child has the opportunity to grow and develop,'' Woodfill
said.
</P>
<P>
   Law sued Memorial two weeks ago, claiming the hospital and
Martin's family were conspiring to allow the woman and fetus to die
against his wishes. On July 23, state District Judge Scott Link
ordered the hospital to not withdraw life support at least until
Thursday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Law grew more concerned last week after hospital attorney
Gregory Sapire wrote his attorney a letter saying Link's order
would be ``inapplicable'' if a doctor declared Martin brain-dead,
which would satisfy the legal definition of death.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the letter, Olsen on July 30 declared Law to be
Martin's temporary guardian, meaning the hospital had to get Law's
permission before undertaking any medical procedure on Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Smyser told Olsen on Thursday that a decision on life support
must be made by Martin's physician and her legal guardian, and it
would be improper for a court to tell the hospital what decision to
make.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen's order Thursday says the hospital will get the approval
of the physician, guardian and the court before treatment is
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cenatiempo, the attorney appointed to represent Tammy
Martin's interests, said he was satisfied that life support will be
maintained at least until the guardianship issue is resolved. He
said Martin's treating physician, Thomas Mims, had written a letter
Thursday saying he would not withhold any treatment without a court
order.
</P>
<P>
   Mims also wrote, ``I promise I will withhold a pronouncement of
death'' until a court orders him to do an official examination.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has not officially been declared brain-dead because the
hospital has not yet done a test measuring the brain's ability to
initiate a breathing response.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Martin said the test was scheduled for two weeks ago, but
the legal proceedings postponed it. He said doctors told him them
that she was brain-dead.
</P>
<P>
   Woodfill said a team of experts examined the fetus last week and
determined that its organs were developing normally and that its
heart beat is getting stronger. He said a sonogram done Monday
revealed the fetus is a boy.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said doctors told him the fetus has little chance of
surviving or being healthy because his sister was an alcoholic and
cocaine addict.
</P>
<P>
   He said if doctors tell the family the fetus has a good chance
to survive, ``we'll jump on the bandwagon'' to save it.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said that a former boyfriend of his sister will file
documents claiming to be her common-law husband and possibly the
father.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, the former boyfriend, Ben Bruce of Houston,
would only say, ``my day will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Law has said Martin became comatose hours after her head was
struck by a car door Aug. 18 when it jumped out of gear. He said
she seemed OK and went to sleep, but after she woke up she began
throwing up and fell unconscious. He said doctors told him he did
all he could have done.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin's stepfather, J.D. Cox of Bracketville in South
Texas, has said he and his wife, Joyce, Tammy's mother, may seek
criminal charges against Law because they believe he may have
played a role in her death. They contend he was either negligent by
not calling for help sooner and may have even assaulted her.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Martin was charged in September 1995 with intentionally
and knowingly injuring a child after she allegedly injected cocaine
and amphetamines into Bruce's minor daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Martin pled guilty to a lesser charge, reckless injury to
a child, and was given probation. But in June 1996 she was
convicted of driving while intoxicated and criminal mischief for
``striking a car with a car jack,'' according to court records. Her
probation was revoked, and an appellate court upheld the prison
term.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Heitman, associate professor of ethics at UT-Houston
Health Science Center, has said although there have been several
highly publicized cases involving comatose or brain-dead pregnant
women, she knows of only one case in which a brain-dead woman was
kept on life support to try to keep a fetus alive until it could be
removed from the womb. In that case, which was in Germany two years
ago, both the mother and fetus died.
</P>
<P>
   But there are newspapers reports of a baby successfully being
born in San Francisco in 1993 after the mother was declared
brain-dead when the fetus was 17 weeks old.

GROUP OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS REACH ACCORD WITH DEMOCRATS ON HEALTH
CARE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite 7th graf with more information; rewrites original
final graf and follows it with four new grafs.)  (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of dissident Republicans reached agreement
with House Democrats Thursday on a comprehensive bill to regulate
the managed health care industry and predicted they would have
enough support to force the Republican leadership to bring their
measure to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which would cover all 161 million Americans with
private health insurance and give them expanded rights to sue
insurance companies, was hastily made public by a bipartisan group
of House members late Thursday afternoon, as they scrambled to
introduce it and get the edge on the potent health issue before
Congress left for its August recess.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., who negotiated the measure with
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said he simply did not think that the
Republican leadership, which favors a more limited approach, was
assembling a measure that could meet with President Clinton's
approval and become law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a law on the books that will protect patients,'' said
Norwood, who practiced dentistry for more than 20 years and is
usually a staunch conservative. ``Not a bill that protects
politicians at the November ballot box. And this in my opinion is
the only bill that can accomplish the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had vowed to veto the Senate's version of managed
care legislation, quickly endorsed the proposed measure and called
on House Speaker Dennis Hastert to schedule a vote as soon as
Congress returns in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's action proves that patient protections need not and
should not be a partisan issue,'' he said. ``It is time to do what
this bipartisan coalition has done _ put the well-being of patients
before politics and special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all House Democrats were expected to coalesce around
the bill. The Republicans identified at least 10 supporters from
their own party and promised many more. Such numbers would be
enough to insure passage in a House so narrowly divided that a
shift of just five Republican votes can determine an outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's spokesman, John Feehery, said the House would address
the health care issue in the fall, but declined to specify what
legislation would be brought to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Of the bipartisan legislation he said: ``What about the
uninsured? They don't address that issue at all.'' He said the
speaker had been looking at an array of tax incentives to include
in a Republican leadership measure to help the 43 million people
without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon after meeting with the speaker, several of
his senior lieutenants on health issues met with business and
industry officials opposed to the bipartisan approach. Rep. John
Boehner, R-Ohio, who has been working with the speaker said the
lawmakers had urged business groups to tell employees that the
bipartisan bill would ``increase costs and end up with less
affordability which is going to create more uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   Several industry groups immediately denounced the bipartisan
legislation on just those grounds, saying that cost would rise
because the measure would expand the right of patients to sue
health care plans in state courts for their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is built on the erroneous premise _ rejected
this year alone in 24 states _ that trial lawyers are the sole
guardians of good medical care,'' said Karen Ignagni, the president
of the American Association of Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders have been searching for an approach to
regulating managed care since Senate Republicans earlier this month
approved a bill that would provided some protections for patients
but complied with their party's desire for only limited regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Senate bills guarantees would apply only to the 48
million people whose employers provide the kind of self-insured
health plans that are not regulated by the states. Such people are
rarely in health maintenance organizations and do not often face
the kind of ``gatekeeper'' arrangement that has led to many
consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans had been struggling for a broader bill that
applied to all 161 million Americans with private health insurance,
some dissident Republicans, led by Norward and Rep. Greg Ganske of
Iowa, who is a surgeon, accused their leaders of bowing to the
insurance industry and began negotiating with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The measure they agreed to on Thursday would include an array of
protections for Americans with private health insurance _
guaranteeing that patients would be covered for emergency room care
outside their health network, giving women direct access to
obstetricians and gynecologists and children to pediatricians. The
bill would require that health plans have a process in place for
guaranteeing that people have access to clinical trials, if that is
the only treatment for their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In cases in which a health plan has denied a patient a course of
care, the legislation would give individuals the right to go to an
external appeals panel made up of independent doctors to resolve
disputes. They would make their judgment based on generally
accepted medical practice, not on the insurance plan's definitions
of what is medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also give patients the right to sue a health plan
in state courts. However, the measure provides that if a health
plan complies with a decision of an external review panel, it can
be sued for compensatory damages but not punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the health care debate are expected to use the
August recess to press their point with the public. Norwood had
seven Republicans at his side and named two more Republican
co-sponsors. If Democrats, as expected, unite behind the bill, that
would be enough votes to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   And Norwood and Ganske predicted many more would join them.
Their backers ran the gamut from moderates like Marge Roukema of
New Jersey and Amo Houghton of New York to conservatives like
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bob Barr of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But a month is a long time in politics, giving the leadership
the possibility of winning back dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Another outspoken doctor, Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., was still
negotiating with Hastert Thursday night and said that he would not
support the bipartisan measure, at least for now, because he
thought the right to sue was too far-reaching.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is how the bipartisan group can get its bill to
the floor if the Republican leadership decides to block it.
</P>
<P>
   One way is by getting a majority of the House to sign a special
petition to force legislation to the floor. Such a route rarely
succeeds because signing such a measure is considered tantamount to
handing control of the House to the opposition party.

ASTROS SHUT OUT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson looked
across the Astrodome turf to where the best pitching staff in the
NL resides and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston doesn't have any better arms than we do,'' Johnson
said. ``They throw it over the plate more. They have (111) less
walks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros also have given up 98 fewer runs than the Dodgers
and, in starters Mike Hampton, Jose Lima and Shane Reynolds, they
have 43 wins. The last came during Reynolds' five-hit, 7-0 shutout
of the Dodgers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Those were types of numbers Dodgers starters were supposed to
have, before this best-laid plan fell flat on its face.
</P>
<P>
   The starting pitchers aren't pushing Kevin Brown for staff
dominance. They're not even following his lead. Instead, they're
far off the pace he was brought here to set.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to see that little competition on the staff,''
Johnson said. ``That really hasn't come out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored three runs in losing two of three to the
Astros and their bullpen failed to keep this loss close after
Ismael Valdes left the seventh trailing 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   But another typical Valdes effort _ one in which he pitches well
but loses _ doesn't mask how bad the Dodgers starters have been
this season. A strong rotation _ Brown, Valdes, Chan Ho Park,
Darren Dreifort and Carlos Perez _ was supposed to help the offense
overcome its shortcomings and ease the burden on the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the most frustrating thing for me is the inability of
our starters to get quality starts,'' Johnson said. ``We're not
going to be that kind of explosive, offensive club, but it makes it
doubly tough to try to play catch-up. Brown has been good, Valdes
has been good, but everyone else hasn't been good.''
</P>
<P>
   That has translated into 50 quality starts in 108 games, an
anemic 46 percent. Brown has 16 quality starts in 24 games. The
others provide quality starts 37 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes had his 15th quality start in allowing two earned runs on
six hits in 61/3 innings against the Astros, but that has meant
little in terms of success. He's 8-10 despite a 3.31 ERA, mostly
because the Dodgers average 3.9 runs when he pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could pitch (poorly) and we still win,'' Valdes said.
``People see my record and say, `Geez, he (stinks).' But the people
who know baseball understand that I'm pitching well. What can you
do? Forget it and go to the next start. Some time it has to turn
around. I'm doing the best I can and I think I'm doing a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Youth could be part of the problem, although Johnson doesn't
think so. Park, 26, and Dreifort, 27, each have fewer than 100
career starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't think it's inexperience because we have
experience,'' Johnson said. ``At times, I'm down (in the bullpen)
with (Darren) Dreifort and I tell him, `If you throw that slider
down the middle, some are going to be hit and some are going to get
the corners. But if you throw at the corners, it's going to be a
ball.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan Ho can paint both sides of the plate, but you can't do it
too early in the count. You gotta be aggressive in the strike
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (4.7 walks per nine innings) and Park (4.1) are the
leading culprits when it comes to walks. And with Perez in
Triple-A, Park leads the starters with a 5.97 ERA and Dreifort is
second at 5.63.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Kevin and Ismael, we have two solid starters,'' Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone said. ``I think Darren, he's shown
flashes. He's developing as a starter, so you continue to give him
the ball every five days and see what you have. What we'll continue
to do is evaluate who we have and look to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether the nucleus is enough to overcome the other pitfalls
facing the Dodgers is the big concern. Johnson and Malone will
spend the next two months auditioning in-house candidates for roles
on the staff, and there's also a debate of whether to send Dreifort
back to the bullpen or leave him in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a decision must be made about Perez, who was 2-10 with a
7.43 ERA before his demotion last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the nucleus of a quality starting rotation,''
Malone said. ``Carlos Perez has to re-find himself or we're going
to have to go out and find a replacement.''

   PITTSBURGH _ By the third game at Three Rivers Stadium on
Thursday night, the Braves had to check for an offensive pulse.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting just .150 with a pair of extra-base hits in two
losses to open this series, the beat was faint and steadily falling
right up until the seventh inning on Thursday. That's when the
Braves broke out of their vegetative state to fire off a 6-3 win
over the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves collected five hits in the seventh and eighth innings
to rally from two runs down. Keith Lockhart got the biggest when he
sent a bases-loaded 3-2 pitch from Pirates reliever Greg Hansell
into the right-center gap to break a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a whole lot of offense lately, but we had to
turn it around sometime,'' Lockhart said. ``It was good for us to
do it tonight. We don't have too much breathing room.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets off on Thursday night, the Braves climbed to
within 1 1/2 games of them in second place and avoided being swept
in a three-game series at Three Rivers' Stadium for the first time
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Benson, Todd Ritchie and reliever Mike Williams had
afforded the Braves only three runs in the first 18 innings of this
series. Pete Schourek, who held at 2-7 against the Braves, picked
up where they left off, holding the Braves to a run on two hits
over the first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   But he cracked in the seventh, giving up three consecutive hits
on an Andruw Jones double down the third-base line, a Jose
Hernandez infield hit to the mound and a Brian Hunter liner to left
which cut the Pirates lead to 3-2. A pinch-hit sacrifice fly by
Ryan Klesko and the Braves were even 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later. the Braves loaded the bases with two out for
Lockhart on a Brian Jordan bloop single, sandwiched by a pair of
walks to Chipper Jones and Hernandez. Hansell fell behind 3-1 and
had Lockhart waiting on his fastball. He ripped it home-run
distance but foul, but came back with an answer to another
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine pitched around some trouble _ including three hits
by the first four batters he faced and later a home-run ball to
Freddy Garcia _ but he never allowed more than one run an inning.
