<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Speaks On Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Li Lanqing today
said that education can not only help lift China's vast rural
areas out of poverty, but can prepare the country for the
opportunities and challenges of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Li was winding up an inspection tour of east China's Fujian
Province that started on January 16, where he visited a number of
primary and secondary schools, universities, and vocational and
technical schools.
</P>
<P>
At a rural primary school where facilities were not very good
but where students are said to be first-class, Li said what is
really important for the quality of education are a good
headmaster and a team of qualified teachers.
</P>
<P>
"Poor areas will have greater hope to overcome poverty if
education there is highly developed," he stated.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with college and university faculty members, Li
told the participants that, while the government will increase
financing for education in keeping with the law, it is also
essential for schools to tap their own "potential".
</P>
<P>
"Existing education resources should be fully utilized and
reasonably distributed, and schools must make every effort to
increase efficiency and the quality of education," he noted,
urging institutions of higher education to change concepts, and
align themselves more with economic construction and social
development.
</P>
<P>
Li also stressed the necessity of setting up more vocational
colleges, improving ideological and political education in higher
education institutions, and paying more attention to improving
teachers' work and living conditions.

<HEADLINE> Shortage of School Places Lamented in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition United
Parties (UP) today said the government should channel more
resources toward construction of more schools in Harare to reduce
the current shortage of places in the capital.
</P>
<P>
UP Information Secretary Isaac Manyemba said the current
shortage of vacancies is due to gross misallocation of government
resources, adding that funds should be redirected from the
Ministry of Defense budget to finance infrastructural development
in schools.
</P>
<P>
He said as a result of the shortage, some headmasters are now
accepting bribes for places.
</P>
<P>
''The scarcity of both primary and secondary schools which has
caused a critical shortage of grade one and form one places is
because of the deliberate misallocation of government resources
and corruption,'' he claimed.
</P>
<P>
''This uncalled for shortage of places has intensified the
culture of corruption in the Ministry of Education as many
parents are being forced to pay headmasters and other influential
government officials bribes so that their children can be
admitted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Manyemba was commenting on reports that scores of children had
not found places in a number of Harare schools when the new
school year started last week.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Hebron Is Liberated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEBRON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- "I announce Hebron as a
liberated city." Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat spoke to some 60,000 jubilant Palestinians in a
gathering here.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here today in his first official visit to
celebrate the withdrawal of Israeli troops from most of the city
which was under Israel's rule for the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
"The will of peace has succeeded," said Arafat in his emotional
address.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the Hebron deal reached with Israelis last week as
"the decision of peace" which means "a new thing in the Middle
East."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his optimism towards the peace process, saying
"together (with all peace forces in Israel), we can make the just
and durable peace in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Arafat thanked some world leaders in helping reach the
agreement, mentioning the names of U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordanian King Hussein. He
also praised Europe's role.
</P>
<P>
In assessing the signing of Hebron accord, the PNA leader
asserted, "Hebron is a start for what is after Hebron" and "for
founding our independent Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
He urged the Palestinians to shoulder the "great
responsibility to continue together and build together this great
construction of the Palestinian independent state."
</P>
<P>
"I say they have committed to their obligations, and we will
commit to all of our obligations decided by the agreement," he
added.
</P>
<P>
On future possible confrontation between the 200,000
Palestinians and the 450 Jewish settlers in the city, Arafat said,
"I tell the settlers in Hebron that we do not want any
confrontation.... I say to them that we are also with the just
peace."
</P>
<P>
In the speech he stressed that the just and comprehensive
peace is not only with Egypt, Jordan and Palestine, yet also with
Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In regard with the prospect of the peace process, the PNA
leader pointed out, "A long way is still in front of us with many
obstacles. I do not tell you that the land is furnished with
flowers." He called the Palestinians to proceed until the
independent state is established.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed national unity, describing it as "the
guarantee of our triumph, and the guarantee to proceed in our way
and establish the Palestinian independent state.

SHIJIAZHUANG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Northern Telecom
in the past year promised a one-million-yuan donation to help
Chinese children from poor families go to school.
</P>
<P>
The funds have been spent on five primary schools in relatively
poor counties of Hebei Province, and will be used to support the
students in their study.

Since the project was launched seven years ago, the China Youth
Development Foundation, organizer of the project, has received
about 800 million yuan (96 million US dollars) in donations from
at home and abroad.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A Rwandan government
delegation will arrive here for a week-long visit from Monday at
the invitation of The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC),
TRC Deputy Chairman Alex Boraine announced today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Cape Town, Boraine said the
six-person Rwandan delegation, including government ministers and
senior advisers, would hold talks with government officials and
TRC commissioners during their stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
The visit is aimed at sounding out how South Africa can
achieve reconciliation between different races, observers here say.
</P>
<P>
All costs associated with this trip would be covered by the Belgian
government in terms of a funding agreement signed in November 1996
between the TRC and the Belgian government, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Referring to TRC's trip to Rwanda late last year, Boraine said,
"The purpose of our visit there was to provide technical assistance to
the Rwandan government in the formulation of their reparations policy
to assist victims of the Rwandan genocide in 1994."
</P>
<P>
After a week of meetings in Kigali, capital of Rwanda, it was felt
that both the Rwandans and the TRC would benefit from a broader range
of discussions on areas of mutual interest, added Boraine.

<HEADLINE> National Conference on Publicity Work Held in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Heads of publicity departments
in China attended a national conference on publicity and
ideological work in Beijing from January 14 to 18, presided over
by Ding Guangen, head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Their duty is to make the public aware of the two great events
this year: the return of Hong Kong and the convening of the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Those
present said they agree that publicity and ideological work in
1997 should provide ideological backing for China's reforms,
development, and stability.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President and General Secretary of the CPC Central
Committee Jiang Zemin met with delegates and spoke of the
achievements of the country's publicity and ideological work in
the past year and what is needed next.
</P>
<P>
Participants concluded that overall China's publicity and
ideology work in 1996 was good, socialist ethical and cultural
progress being given full attention.
</P>
<P>
The conference took Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the Party's basic lines
and principles as its guide and urged all publicity workers to
concentrate on this year's two great events and to work hard to
arm the people with scientific theory, correctly guide public
opinion, provide people with lofty ideas, and encourage people
with outstanding works.
</P>
<P>
It also decided that publicity workers should grasp the overall
situation, work with one heart and one mind, and show a pioneering
spirit to be able to better serve the people and the socialist
system.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Protests to Russia Over Remarks on Sevastopol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine today protested to Russia
over Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov's recent remarks insisting the
return of the disputed city of Sevastopol to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Luzhkov...made unfriendly statements toward Ukraine, which
directly infringed on Ukraine's territorial integrity," a Foreign
Ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
Describing Luzhkov's comments as "unacceptable," it said such
statements "negatively influence Ukrainian-Russian relations and
could bring about their deterioration."
</P>
<P>
During a surprise visit this weekend to Sevastopol, the home
port of the Black Sea Fleet on the Crimean peninsula, Luzhkov
said, "Sevastopol is a Russian glory city...we should defend the
right of Sevastopol to remain a Russian city."
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov's visit is likely to heighten tensions over the fate of
the fleet and the city, which have mired Russian-Ukrainian
relations since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of Sevastopol's population are Russians, who
are also in the majority across Crimea. The Crimean peninsula
remained Russian territory until 1954, when former Soviet leader
Nikita Khrushchev turned it over to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Luzhkov and his delegation were detained for much
of the night in the airport trying to leave Crimea at the end of
the surprise visit.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian police and customs officials accused Luzhkov's
bodyguard of illegally importing weapons as he was carrying a
gun. The bodyguard denied the accusation, saying he had declared
the gun upon arrival in the country.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the detention, Luzhkov called the act a "very
primitive, unintelligent and extremely insulting provocation."
</P>
<P>
"We have fallen victims to a very primitive, unintelligent and
extremely insulting provocation initiated by the leadership of
Kiev as a revenge for our open, clear and honest position," he
said.

<HEADLINE> National Conference on Publicity Work Held in Beijing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The conference pointed out that publicity work this year must
center on economic construction and help promote the two
"fundamental shifts" in the economic system and mode of economic
growth, while taking opportunities to promote new developments and
conditions for socialist ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
The publicity and ideological offices must advocate the ideas
of "serving the people" and collectivism, promote a healthy
society, and use the opportunity of Hong Kong's return to educate
people about patriotism.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the forthcoming 15th CPC National Congress,
efforts should be made to broaden education on the Party's basic
theories and lines to increase the public's faith in building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Several major tasks in publicity and ideological work for 1997
were listed, including upholding Deng Xiaoping's theories,
sticking to the central task of economic construction, increasing
promotion of ethical and cultural progress, correctly guiding
public opinion, and creating favorable social conditions for this
year's two great events.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guangen said that holding the banner of Deng Xiaoping's
theories high and sticking to the Party's basic lines are
fundamental to publicity work, which must be faithfully followed
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong thought, and Deng Xiaoping's
theories follow a continuous line of development and have formed a
unified scientific system. Deng Xiaoping's theories are Marxism
developed for contemporary China," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He explained that publicity workers must keep in line with the
Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core
ideologically, politically, and in their actions, and that
publicity work must serve the whole Party and the whole nation.

"We must also cater to the needs of the masses and depend on
them, and do things that are welcomed by the masses, seriously and
satisfactorily," he said.
</P>
<P>
Publicity and ideology workers must try hard to popularize
scientific theories and promote lofty ideas, and seek healthy and
orderly development of publicity and culture, he pointed out,
adding that it is very important that consistency and stability be
maintained in publicity work, and that reality be examined deeply
in investigations and research for gathering experience.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that publicity and ideological work need a
team of dedicated and highly responsible officials, and that
"seriousness" in one's working attitude is the best criterion for
judging a person's dedication and sense of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"Publicity and ideology workers should adopt an extremely
serious and responsible attitude toward the Party's and the
people's cause," he said, concluding by urging publicity and
ideology workers to do a solid job in welcoming the Party's 15th
national congress.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by publicity chiefs from all
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, a number of
central government departments, and the People's Liberation Army

</P>
<P>
A Zhang Yong three-pointer and a free throw by Li De'en gave

reasonably good but we couldn't match them in rebounds."

Zhejiang's coach Pan Jianping said his players suffered a lot
on poor shooting percentage from field.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The law panel of the
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) discussed handling the issue of laws in force in Hong
Kong, in Beijing during its Seventh meeting January 18 and 19.
</P>
<P>
The participants held that only a few ordinances, subordinate
legislation of laws previously in force in Hong Kong, which
totally or partially contravene the Basic Law, cannot be adopted
as laws of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Most of the existing laws can be adopted as laws of the Hong
Kong SAR. But, when they are applied in Hong Kong, interpretation
should be made according to Hong Kong's status and the
stipulations of the Basic Law, after China resumes the exercise of
its sovereignty over Hong Kong and all improper terms or phrases
appearing in laws will be amended.
</P>
<P>
The participants said that ordinances previously in force in
Hong Kong that totally contravene the Basic Law are mainly laws
supporting Britain's colonial rule, such as the Application of
English Law Ordinance, a marriage law outside Britain, the British
Nationality (miscellaneous provision) Ordinance, the Secretary of
State for Defence (succession to property) Ordinance, the Royal HK
Regiment Ordinance, the Chinese Extradition Ordinance, Colony
Armorial Bearing (protection) Ordinance, and the British
Nationality (corresponding revision) Ordinance of 1981.

(Electoral Provisions) Ordinance, and stipulations on the election
of the district and two municipal parliaments, which were

apply its Constitutional Bill in violation of the Sino-British
Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, and principles
which contravene with the Basic Law and agreements and
understanding reached by the two governments contravene the Basic
Law, cannot be adopted as laws of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The participants also held that the stipulations on explanation
and aims of the application in Clause 3 of Article 2 of an
ordinance on Hong Kong human rights, and the relevant terms and
phrases of Articles 3 and 4 of the ordinance, too, contravene with
the Basic Law and cannot be used as laws of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Relevant stipulations in Clause 2 of Article 3 of an individual
information (secrets) ordinance, likewise, cannot be adopted as
laws of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
As for some major revisions of the original laws according to a
human rights bill, such as a revision of the Societies Ordinance
since 1992 and a revision of the Security Ordinance since 1995
also cannot be adopted as laws of the Hong Kong SAR because they
violate the Sino-British joint declaration and the relevant
stipulations in the Basic Law that the laws previously in force in
Hong Kong will basically remain unchanged.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa-Syria Arms Deal in Bidding Stage: Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Affairs
Department reiterated today South Africa's proposed sale of 638
million U.S. Dollars of tank firing control system to Syria is
still in the bidding stage at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Neither the department, nor arms supplier DENEL, nor even
President Nelson Mandela, has any doubt about that, said Pieter
Swanepoel, a spokesman for the department.
</P>
<P>
However, the local "Sunday Times" newspaper quoted some leaked
cabinet minutes as saying that the controversial deal, which has
caused an international stir in the past week, is now far more
advanced than the government has claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to the leaked cabinet minutes, the cabinet has
agreed that a pending contract should be signed to deliver the
tank firing control systems to Syria, subject to Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki's approval.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to defuse the row on the deal, the ministry
claimed earlier this week the cabinet had only given conditional
approval to the DENEL to market its products in Syria, rather
than delivery as the media reports alleged.
</P>
<P>
Swanepoel said when the contractual stage is reached, which
is only likely in about two years time, it would be necessary to
review the situation in the Middle East and decide whether the deal
should be finalized.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported that DENEL has spent 638,000 U.S.
Dollars on sending a team of technicians to Syria where the tank
firing control systems are fitted to the Russia-made T-72 tanks
and successfully tested in November last year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the leakage of the cabinet minutes, Rusty Evans,
Director General of the Department, said, "this is embarrassing.
What is very serious about the cabinet documents should be a
subject of public debate even before they have been approved."
</P>
<P>
Evans also said he had never in all his years in international
affairs heard of cabinet documents being leaked.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A draft document aimed at
helping all South Africans, particularly those in the Cape
Metropolitan Region, assess the impact of Cape Town's bid for
2004 Olympic Games was made public today.
</P>
<P>
David Shandler, a member of the team responsible for the
Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of the bid, said in Cape
Town that a public meeting on hosting the 2004 Olympic Games in
Cape Town would be held in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
The document identifies issues such as the likely impact of
the games on the economy, job creation, social development,
spatial restructuring of the Cape Metropolitan Region, public
involvement in decision-making and the natural environment.
</P>
<P>
Shandler said the document, which would be available in public
libraries throughout the Cape Metropolitan Region, drew from
reports from specialists of the SEA team as well as responses to
a questionnaire issued to the public last year.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly urge the public to look through the discussion
document, especially if they are attending the public meeting on
January 23. The success of this project depends on well-informed
public opinion," he added.
</P>

Cape Town is one of the 11 cities of the world bidding for the
2004 Olympic Summer Games.

identical views regarding a number of regional and international
issues, a Russian envoy said here today.

peace process and stressed on his country's full support for
Egypt's steps and stances toward the peace process, of which Russia
is a co-sponsor.
</P>
<P>
He said that they also discussed issues related to
bilateral relations and the programs that could enhance this
cooperation in various fields.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Tajik Peace Talks End in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The two-week long inter-Tajik
peace talks wound up here today with both parties signing an
agreement on several major issues to guarantee a lasting peace
in the Republic of Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told reporters
after the negotiations that the peace talks in Tehran succeeded
in preparing the ground for signing the final document on
national reconciliation in the next round of talks in Tehran or
Moscow in a five weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
He voiced Iran's readiness to make every endeavor to help
restore a just and lasting peace in Tajikistan, Iran's official
news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The IRNA said, representatives of the Tajik government and the
united Islamic opposition reached an agreement on repatriation of
Tajik refugees, declaration of general amnesty by the two sides
and the procedure for forming a central commission for the
upcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
About 700,000 people were displaced as a result of the civil
war, but most of them have now returned home.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the two sides also agreed on holding
plebiscite during the transitional period, the quota of the
opposition in the commission and restructuring the Tajik
administration system.
</P>
<P>
However, the official report gave no detail about the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report said, the two parties held talks on
formulating the charter of the national reconciliation
commission including the number of its members, the extent of
its authority and venue for holding its sessions.
</P>
<P>
Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov said that the Tajik
government is committed to the agreements signed in Tehran and
would fully carry out the accords.
</P>
<P>
Nazarov said "we believe that the day is coming to Tajikistan
for peace."
</P>
<P>
Akbar Turjanzadeh, representative of the Tajik opposition said
that with the signing of the agreement on repatriation of Tajik
refugees, the rights of thousands of Tajik people would be
restored and that the government has promised not to prosecute
them for their participation in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Turjanzadeh said the opposition has pulled back its forces
from the areas singled out in the former accords and prepared the
ground for deployment of government forces, whereas, the
government has not evacuated its bases as envisaged in earlier
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Iran and Russia participated in the peace
talks as observers.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations special envoy for Tajikistan Gerd Dietrich
Merrem described the Tajik peace talks in Tehran as a
breakthrough, saying that the agreement reached between the two
parties has been a major part of a political accord.
</P>
<P>
Up to 50,000 people have died in fighting in the country since
1992, when Tajik hard-liners drove out their opponents, who then
regrouped in the rugged mountains and across the border in
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Former Burundi President Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Former Burundi President
Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, a Tutsi ousted in a coup in 1987, has been
arrested, Radio Burundi reported today.
</P>
<P>
Bagaza was toppled in 1987 by Burundi's present leader Pierre
Buyoya, who had ruled until 1993 and seized power again last July
25 when he overthrew Hutu President Sylvestre Nitbantunganya in
the small central African country.
</P>
<P>
The arrest took place a day after the apprehension of
opposition Sojedem party's leader Deo Neozima, who had earlier
published an open letter attacking Buyoya's leadership, according
to a Reuter report from Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
However, the report failed to give any reason for Bagaza's
arrest.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya, also a Tutsi, on Friday called a national debate
starting on January 28 to try to end the civil war in Burundi,
saying he wanted to listen to the opinion of everyone on peace
solutions.
</P>
<P>
He removed both hard-line Bagaza and Neozima possibly in a bid
to pave way for the national debate in the country, observers say.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of civilians, mainly Hutus, have died in
violence in Burundi over the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Burundi, controlledanya for centuries by a Tutsi minority, is
suffering severe economic problems following the imposition of an
economic embargo by neighboring central and east African states
last August in a bid to reverse the coup in the country.

<HEADLINE> S. African-Syria Arms Deal on Tentative Stage: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government favors the proposed 638-million-U.S.-Dollar South
African-Syrian arms deal in principle but the deal is still at a
tentative stage, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said today.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's armaments company Denel is just one of
companies around the world which has responded to a Syrian
request for tank firing control systems, Mbeki said after
attending a close-door meeting of the African National Congress
(ANC).
</P>
<P>
He noted that some European and U.S. companies have also
expressed interest in supplying such technologies to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the South African government has a clear policy on
the sale of arms abroad and the proposed supply of arms to Syria
falls within the ambit of this policy.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's criteria on arms sale include the human rights
record of the country concerned, the likelihood that the weaponry
would be used to suppress the local people and whether or not a
united nations arms embargo is in force, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the decision has to be viewed in accordance with
the policy of the present South African government which has
relations with most of the countries in the Middle East rather
than only with Israel, as was the case with the previous
government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Foreign Ministry spokesman Pieter Swanepoel
told the press that neither his ministry nor Denel had any doubt
that the deal is still at the bidding stage.
</P>
<P>
Swanepoel said when the contractual stage is reached which is
only likely in about two years time, it would be necessary to
review the situation in the Middle East and decide whether South
Africa-made tank firing control system should be supplied.
</P>
<P>
The local Sunday Times paper quoted some leaked cabinet
minutes as saying that the cabinet has conditionally approved the
signing of a pending contract to deliver the package of arms to
Syria.

were sent from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Rafat Khlous, board chairman of the National Postal Authority,
made the statement before the People's Assembly Transport and
Communications Committee, in a report on the investigations into
the letter bombs.
</P>
<P>
Nine letter bombs disguised as Christmas cards were found at
the offices of the Arabic-language Al-Hayat newspaper in
Washington and New York and other places of the U.S. since early
this month.
</P>
<P>
The postal authority chief disclosed that Denmark announced
earlier today the arrest of the gang suspected of sending the
letter bombs.
</P>
<P>
The letter bombs that arrived in the newspaper's offices in
Washington had been thoroughly examined in New York, he said,
adding that the letters could have been laced with the explosives
later.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation had faxed five
letters bearing the postmarks of Alexandria to the Egyptian
authority for investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Egypt had categorically denied any letter bombs went
out of Alexandria and suggested that fake stamps can be easily
made on letters to confuse investigators.

<HEADLINE> Racial Minority Men Earn Less Than Whites: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Racial minority men earn less
than whites, even when they were born and raised in Canada,
according to three studies here.
</P>
<P>
Two of the studies found visible minority men born in Canada
earned substantially less than white men, while a third study by
the federal government found a small wage gap, the Ottawa Citizen
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the study by two economists at the University of
Toronto, South Asians and blacks earned 19.9 percent and 15.7
percent less respectively than whites.
</P>
<P>
Chinese men earned 5.6 percent less, while Southeast Asians
took home about 2.3 percent less, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
Another study, by an economist and a federal government
sociologist, found that on average, visible minority men living in
cities earned 8 percent less than whites.
</P>
<P>
But the study by the federal government human resources
development indicated that visible minority men earned only about
one percent less than whites.
</P>
<P>
"We did find a gap and it's much more difficult to justify and
much more difficult to understand why it would be there for some
reason other than discrimination," one author of the studies was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The three studies are significant since they are the first to
look at how Canadian-born minorities fare in the workforce, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
And they are the first to use 1991 census data to compare the
wages of Canadian-born minorities with whites. In the 1991 census,
9 percent of adults in Canada were visible minorities, double the
number of a decade before.
</P>
<P>
More study is vital, researchers say, since visible minorities
are expected to make up to 20 percent of Canada's population by
2016.

<HEADLINE> Greek Seamen Urged to Stop Strike Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Farmers from the Greek Island of
Crete were congregating tonight to urge the shipping of their
products by the seamen who have been on strike for seventh day
today.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday scuffles broke out between farmers and seamen near
the mooring of the Knossos ferry boat in Iraklion, the major port
of the Island.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and leaders of the Seamens Federation of
Greece (PNO) are holding meetings at the Merchant Marine Ministry
in an effort to reach a compromise regarding the farmers' plight
who stand to lose millions of drachmas if their highly perishable
produce is not shipped to Greek and European markets on time.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce the losses of the farmers, C-130 military
transport aircraft were employed to pick up perishables. It has
also been reported that navy landing vessels were expected at
other Cretan ports to pick up trucks carrying fruit and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The PNO decided late Thursday night to extend a four-day strike
for another four days until early Tuesday morning. The strike
affects Greek-flag vessels of all categories as well as foreign
ships employing Greek seamen.
</P>
<P>
A local court on Friday ruled the extension of an ongoing
semen's strike was "illegal and an abuse of their right to
strike". The court, acting on a suit filed by shipowners, ruled
that if seamen do not call off their strike action within the day,
the 14 trade unionists comprising the PNO administration would be
sentenced to two months' detainment and a 100,000 drachma (410
U.S. dollars) fine for each violation of the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
The seamen are pressing demands for increased insurance and
unemployment benefits, an increase in minimum pensions and
preservation of tax breaks enjoyed since 1955.

<HEADLINE> Double-Digit Growth For China's Economy This Year (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's economy is expected to
grow 10 to 11 percent this year, economists from the State
Statistics Bureau and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the inflation rate for retail sales will fall
further to six to seven, or "even lower than that."
</P>
<P>
The state's macro-economic control efforts have helped the
growth in the economy and the drop in inflation, they added.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth last year was 9.7 percent, down from 1992's
peaking of 14.2 percent, while inflation was 6.1 percent, down
from 1994's 21.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Rapid economic growth with low inflation will be of great
importance to China's economy," said Chen Jinhua, minister of the
State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
In analyzing inflation this year, Chen said the rate is
not likely to be too high because sufficient agriculture and
industrial products will cushion the price increase.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that last year's lagging factor for this year's
inflation rate will be of 0.5 percentage points, and that from
price adjustment of the basic products, such as petrol and
electric power, will be controlled within about one percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
According to the economists, state-owned enterprises will have
more favorable factors for development in 1997, with the help of
the state's supporting policies of increasing loans and pacing up
company merger and bankcrupcy.

<P>
Two interest cuts last year will also encourage people to spend
more, providing a strong basis for market growth.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the government will continue to list agricultural
development as a priority. China's ambitious agriculture plan
calls for grain output to stay at last year's level of 480 billion
kilograms or to increase, and for some 12 million people to be
helped to have enough to eat and wear.
</P>
<P>
Fixed assets investment will be kept at 1996's level, much
lower than the average 34.7 percent during the Eighth Five-Year
Plan (1991-96) period.
</P>
<P>
Economists are also optimistic on world environment for Chinese
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations predicts that the world economy will grow by
3.2 percent in 1997, and world trade by 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
China's export volume, accounting for some 22 percent of its
GDP, is expected to increase to some extent this year.
</P>
<P>
The country is expected to use more foreign funds in 1997, the
economists said. It actually used 40 billion US dollars in foreign
funds last year.
</P>
<P>
Economists warn that some serious problems in micro-economy
development and economic structure need to merit more attention.

<HEADLINE> China's Meteorologists Vital To Country's Poverty-Relief Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Chen Junsheng
told a national conference here today that government meteorology
departments should play an important role in the national
poverty-relief drive.
</P>
<P>
Poor areas should be helped in developing their economy and in
overcoming poverty by using meteorology to foresee natural
disasters and reduce economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is also director of the State Council's Leading Group
in Charge of Aid-the-Poor Projects, said that combining
meteorology with agricultural technology can help farmers to
improve farming methods and more effectively use agricultural
resources.
</P>
<P>
He urged meteorology departments and workers to make full use
of advanced technology to help farmers predict natural disasters
and boost agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The State Meteorological Administration has mobilized local
meteorology departments in 13 provinces and autonomous regions for
some 300 aid-the-poor projects in more than 20 provinces since
1988.
</P>
<P>
A total of 722 poverty-stricken counties, mainly in outlying
mountainous areas, have benefited from these projects.

ZHENGZHOU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Ice has covered a 1,000-km
stretch of the Yellow River, China's second longest, because of
low temperatures in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and
Shanxi and Shandong provinces.
</P>
<P>
The period of low temperatures was 17 days earlier than normal
and 23 days earlier than last year, and flow in the frozen section
is 300 cubic meters per second, less than in previous years,
according to local experts.
</P>
<P>
Because of floods last year, the Henan section has become
shallower and is impeding the flow, causing the river to overflow
in parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
Over 40,000 local people in 47 villages there are now suffering
from the effects of this, and over 3,333 ha. of farmland and 25 km

<HEADLINE> Canadian Prime Minister Ends Visit to Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien and the mission he was leading left here tonight at the
end of a five-day visit to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in the country, they signed 10 agreements
with the Thai government and the Thai public sector and 55
business contracts and memorandums of understanding.
</P>
<P>
The 10 inter-governmental and inter-public sector agreements,
of a cooperative nature, signified a shift in the Canadian-Thai
relationship, from a donor-recipient one to an equal partnership.
</P>
<P>
Between 1981 and 1995, Canada gave Thailand a total of 350
million Canadian dollars (266 million U.S. dollars) in official
development aid.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on investment promotion and protection is
important for future businesses for both sides for a long time to
come.
</P>
<P>
Canadian companies showed interest in investing in Thailand in
electricity generation, petroleum, resources management and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Another important deal was the contract for Thailand to buy a
small Canadian satellite for natural resources and environmental
surveying.
</P>
<P>
The contract was saved at the eleventh hour when the Canadian
side agreed to postpone Thailand's payment for the deal and import
more Thai goods.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is facing an economic slowdown and a current account
deficit.
</P>
<P>
From a broad perspective, Chretien's visit indicated that
Canada attaches importance to the region, particularly in the
economic field.
</P>
<P>
Under the present investment protection agreement, more
Canadian investment is expected in Thailand and bilateral trade
will also increase, as Thailand would serve as a gateway for
Canadian goods to Indochinese countries.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Memorial Held for Revolutionary Martyr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony in Beijing today
marked the 100th anniversary of the birth of Xie Zichang, who
founded a revolutionary base in the northern part of Shaanxi
Province, northwest China, in the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
The revolutionary base later became a focal point for Communist
soldiers from other areas on the Long March, Mao Zedong's
strategic retreat to the north from 1934 to 1936.
</P>
<P>
For the ceremony, Premier Li Peng wrote: "Inherit the
revolutionary spirit of the martyr and strive for China's
modernization drive."
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice-chairman of
the Central Military Ccommission (CMC), said on behalf of the CPC
Central Committee and the CMC, "The life of comrade Xie is
transient but glorious. He devoted his life to the revolutionary
cause, and was loyal to the people up to his death."
</P>
<P>
He called on the Party to follow Xie's example and to rally
closely around the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the
core.
</P>
<P>
"Let's work hard together to welcome the return of Hong Kong
and the Party's 15th national congress with new material, ethical,
and cultural accomplishments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bo Yibo, a revolutionary veteran and retired senior leader,
also sent a letter to the forum in memory of Xie.
</P>
<P>
Xie was fatally wounded while defending his guerrilla base
against a nationalist attack in early 1935, and died at the age of
38.

<HEADLINE> Japan Adopts 1.9 Percent Growth Target for Fiscal 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government today
formally adopted the lowest official economic growth target for
the country for four decades.
</P>
<P>
The inflation-adjusted 1.9 percent growth in gross domestic
product (GDP) for fiscal 1997 eclipses the previous record low of
2.4 percent for fiscal 1994, Kyodo news service reported.
</P>
<P>
The official target was announced last December by Economic
Planning Agency Minister Taro Aso but was formally adopted today
at an extraordinary meeting of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The government predicts the economy should gradually move
toward sustained growth after a slowdown in the first half of
fiscal 1997 due in part to a rise in the consumption tax rate from
3 to 5 percent which takes effect in April.
</P>
<P>
That increase is expected to dampen consumer spending and push
the consumer price index up about 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also formally adopted its basic stance on the
conduct of economic policy, Kyodo reported.
</P>
<P>
The state budget proposal for fiscal 1997, which begins April
1, was approved by the cabinet late last year.
</P>
<P>
The government said that it would seek to ensure a
self-sustaining economic recovery, led mainly by domestic demand,
and stressed its resolve to push for deregulation and reforms in a
variety of areas, including the structure of the economy,
administration and fiscal issues, the news service said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
said today Japan will continue to seek a peaceful solution to the
Peru hostage crisis but will not bow to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorist activity is a grave challenge to all states and
societies and it is vital for the international community to
tackle terrorism in unity," Hashimoto said in a policy speech at
the first session of the new Diet (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis has now dragged into its 35th day with 73
hostages still held captive by a group of Peruvian rebels at the
Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto reiterated Tokyo's "complete trust" in Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori's tough stance in handling the hostage
standoff and vowed to work with the international community to get
the hostages freed as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
On Japan's diplomatic policy, Hashimoto underscored the
importance of trilateral ties between Japan, China and the United
States in the Asia-Pacific region and said Japan will seek better
ties with China while hailing improved Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"Progress in any of the bilateral sets of relations among
Japan, the U.S. and China will contribute to the stability and
development of the entire Asia-Pacific region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pledged to strengthen military cooperation
between Japan and the United States by establishing new guidelines
for defense cooperation under the upgraded bilateral security
framework.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda told the Diet that
Japan's security alliance with the U.S. is the foundation of sound
bilateral ties between the two countries and that efforts are
needed to make it function more smoothly and effectively.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda also emphasized the importance of relations with China
and South Korea, saying sound ties with the two countries would be
conducive to the maintenance of peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He said Tokyo will work harder to promote relations with
Beijing through close contacts and various exchange programs as
this year marks the 25th anniversary of the normalization of
diplomatic relations between Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
The minister renewed Japan's support for China's economic
reform and opening policy and reiterated that China should be
brought into the World Trade Organization at an early date.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Volume to Exceed 300 Billion Dollars in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to have a
foreign trade volume of 310 billion US dollars this year, up 6.4
percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation at a national conference on foreign trade in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China had a record high 289.9 billion US dollar
foreign trade volume in 1996.
</P>
<P>
As for the foreign trade and economic co-operation this year,
the minister said that the policies for an active, rational, and
effective use of overseas investment should be followed this year
to raise the work to a new height.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing China's 1996 foreign trade performance, Wu
explained that two major trends were the processing trade for the
first time accounting for half the total trade volume and more
foreign funds actually being used in spite of the fewer projects
approved.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China approved more than 24,000 overseas-funded
projects, with over 42.35 billion US dollars of overseas funds
being used.
</P>
<P>
China has so far approved a total of 280,000 such projects
which used overseas investment totalling 177.2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wu told the local officials and leader of the country's big
trade companies present at the meeting that China's foreign trade
is facing a new situation and that the greatest difficulty will
come from blindly seeking to expand the scale and increase
quantity, a practice that was common under the centrally planned
economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, as the opening up policy proceeds,
more importance will be placed on foreign trade and economic
cooperation by local governments. And China's huge market,
abundant labor, political and social stability, market
environment, and investment climate will help create favorable
conditions for the development of foreign trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China will continue its comprehensive foreign
trade strategy, which is designed to promote balanced development
in overseas investment, trade and other economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
She said that China will also give priority to rectifying trade
orders, to exploring international markets in all directions, and
to speeding up the spread of information and legislation on
foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> Attack on Political Leader Condemned in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Political parties in Nepal
have condemned a violent attack on a senior political leader by
activists of some parties in western Nepal last weekend, sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
President of the main ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party Girija
Prasad Koirala was violently assaulted on Saturday afternoon in
the Baitadi district, about 400 km west of Kathmandu, after
attending a mass meeting there.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 activists from other parties chanted anti-NC slogans
and pelted stones at Koirala's helicopter when it was about to
take off, sources of the NC party said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the 75-year-old Koirala was hit by one
stone in the leg and some windows of the helicopter were broken
during the attack.
</P>
<P>
According to the NC central office here, the attackers were
from the main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist Leninist CPN-UML) and NC's ruling partner the National
Democratic Party (RPP).
</P>
<P>
The NC party in a statement issued here Sunday urged the
coalition government to take strong action against those who
assaulted Koirala.
</P>
<P>
However, leaders of the CPN-UML and RPP in separate statements
today also denounced the violent attack on Koirala and denied that
the attack was carried out by their party workers.
</P>
<P>
Koirala, a former prime minister who led an NC government from
1992 to 1994, was in western Nepal on his party's campaign for the
upcoming lower house by-elections.
</P>
<P>
The by-elections will be held on the coming Friday in five
constituencies throughout the country for five seats in the lower
house which are vacant currently.
</P>
<P>
The NC party has said it wants to win all the five seats in the
house to replace the CPN-UML as the single largest party in
parliament. The NC presently has 86 MPs in the 205-seat house
while the CPN-UML holds 87 seats.

<HEADLINE> China Revises Foreign Exchange Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council today
announced its decision to revise the Regulations on Foreign
Exchange, which were adopted last January.
</P>
<P>
An article has been added, saying that the state will no longer
impose restrictions on international payments and money transfers
under current account.
</P>
<P>
Another new article, the 15th, says that after a person has
emigrated from China, the profits generated by his assets within
China can be used to purchase foreign exchange at designated banks
if he can present verification and proper certificates, and the
money can be taken out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The first section of the previous 13th article, now the 14th,
has also been changed and now permits any individual in need of
foreign exchange for personal use to purchase a limited amount. If
the amount is insufficient, the person can apply to the foreign
exchange management department for approval for more.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations also combine the previous 15th and 16th
articles into one, the 17th, which has been revised to say that
any foreign institution or individual in China wishing to remit
RMB income abroad must go to designated foreign exchange banks
with proper verification and certificates.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations took effect today.

BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), met here today with a delegation
from the Federation of the Pilipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce
and Industry, led by Jimmy T. Tang.
</P>
<P>
In welcoming the delegation, Wu said China has scored some
remarkable economic achievements in the past decade, under its
reforms and opening-up policy of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
There is still a large gap, however, between China and the
developed countries, he said, because China has only had a short
period of development, and that this means the Chinese need to
work hard for a relatively better living standard, and then can
catch up to mid-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that neighboring countries, especially
Southeast Asian nations, will come to China more frequently for
exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the purpose of his visit is to connect with people of
Chinese discent living in the Philippines and to make a joint
effort at increasing cooperation between China and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting were Wang Zhaoguo and Wan Guoquan,
vice-chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Geologists Look for Environmental Protection Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- After two years' efforts by the
China's State Bureau of Environmental Protection and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, a geo-environmental research center opened
today in Beijing, to give Chinese geologists a role in the
country's battle against pollution and other environmental
problems.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, head of the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection, said the center could provide "substantive support"
for his bureau's work, and that he hopes "more scientists can take
an active part in environmental protection, and play a significant
role in China's bid to achieve sustainable development."
</P>
<P>
Xie and Zhou Guangzhao, president of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, explained that the center will be under the "dual
leadership" of the bureau and the academy for the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts regarded this "dual leadership" as a bold new
attempt to promote cooperation by the country's scientists and
decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
"This practice will help scientific research results to get
more official attention and better use, and give the scientists
more chances to get involved in and have an influence on the
government's decision-making process," one of the analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
Environmental geology is a science that grew out of basic
geology, and the geo-environmental research center will do
research on the China's major environmental problems, and try to
develop the country's own system of environmental theories.
</P>
<P>
It also hopes to be able to help the nation's economy overcome
major difficulties and to develop a theoretical basis and plans
for the country's large-scale environmental reforms or energy
projects.
</P>
<P>
The center will be affiliated with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences' Institute of Geology, which has over 400 researchers,
including six academicians and 53 professors.

year, the local newspaper "Vanguard' reported today.
</P>
<P>

problem posed by high duty rate on imported goods which have no
substitutes," government officials were quoted as saying.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Former Sex Slaves Picket Japanese Embassy in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Filipino women forced
to work as sex slaves for the Japanese imperial army during World
War II held another protest rally today at the gate of the
Japanese embassy here.
</P>
<P>
Carrying banners and chanting their demands for justice, about
60 ageing Filipino sex slaves survivors, also known as "comfort
women," picketed the Japanese embassy for nearly one hour this
afternoon, pressing for official and legal compensation from the
Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
The rally is the second this month and part of the 1997
campaign launched by Lila-Pilipina, a private group representing
former sex slaves from the Philippines, to demand the adoption of
a draft compensation law for non-Japanese comfort women by the
Japanese Diet (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Amaneda Ballahabi, a representative for the protestors, urged
the Japanese government to act quickly because former sex slaves
are elderly and sick.
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old woman, who was forced to provide sexual
services for Japanese soldiers when she was just 14 years old,
denounced an agreement signed last week by the Philippine
government and the private Japanese Asian Women's Fund (AWF).
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the AWF will allot 1 million yen (8,547
U.S. dollars) in medical and welfare assistance to every Filipino
sex slave for a period of five years. But Ballahabi said it is
state compensation and official apologies, not AWF money, that
former sex slaves want.
</P>
<P>
She said the campaign would continue until the women received
official compensation and an apology from Tokyo. Another four
rallies outside the Japanese embassy in Manila are planned over
the next two months.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, thousands of women from the Korean Peninsula,
China, the Philippines and some other Asian countries were forced into
sexual slavery by the Japanese military, who called them "comfort
women."
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, there were a total of 169 documented comfort
women, of whom about 100 are still alive now, according to Maloo
Sabado, a member of the private Philippine Asian Women's Human Rights
Council. But she said the actual number of Filipino comfort women was
much higher.
</P>
<P>
After the war, the Japanese government denied the atrocity for
decades. In 1996, it acknowledged the existence of comfort women,
but refused to give individual state compensation and make
official apologies to them.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government only admitted its moral responsibility to
the comfort women, claiming all its legal war obligations and
responsibilities, including reparations to war victims, have been
settled.

BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of
China's Central Military Commission, met with Chief of Staff of

</P>
<P>
Chi, also state councillor and defense minister, briefed the
visitor on China's reforms and opening drive, as well as on
China's foreign policy and defense strategy.
</P>
<P>
Chi stressed that China pursues a defensive policy. He noted
that the so-called "China Threat" theory spread by some people in
the West is "out of ulterior motives."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister praised the Portugal Navy chief for his
efforts in helping restore the relations between the armed forces
of the two countries. He added that the current visit of Pacheco
will help promote the long-term, stable and healthy development of
such relations.
</P>
<P>
Chi also said the good cooperation between China and Portugal
offered a good basis for the development of military ties.
</P>
<P>
Pacheco, who is visiting China for a first time, said he hopes
the relations between China and Portugal, especially between the
two navies, will continue to develop.
</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Americans are optimistic that there will be harmony in
Washington as President Clinton starts his second term, but they
are also skeptical that particularly intractable problems like the
deficit and campaign finance abuse will be solved, a new survey
shows.
</P>
<P>
-- A central question of Bill Clinton's second term will be
whether a man who won reelection in part by embracing some
Republican themes can now redefine the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
-- Yasser Arafat flew into an ecstatic throng of Palestinians
to proclaim Hebron "liberated" and to hold out an olive branch to
Israel and the 450 Jewish settlers in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- With pomp and pageantry, symbolism and celebration, the last
president of the 20th century takes the oath of office today. And
after weeks of anxious preparation by an army of inaugural
planners and a frigid weekend of pre-inaugural activities that
drew tens of thousands of visitors to Washington, all appears
ready.
</P>
<P>
-- A member of the House Republican leadership said Sunday that
Speaker Newt Gingrich should pay from personal rather than
campaign funds the 300,000 U.S. dollar penalty that is part of the
sanction he agreed to in the ethics probe of his activities.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Commerce Department said the trade deficit, which has
been on the rise for most of 1996, widened just a bit to 8.4
billion U.S. dollars in November from 8 billion U.S. dollars in
October.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) - Somalia's two most powerful
warlords, Hussein Aideed and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, today started
their first face-to-face peace talks in capital Mogadishu, aiming
to end the six-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted South Mogadishu's security
officials as saying that the two leaders met at a hotel along
Mogadishu's greenline, which separates the divided city into the
north controlled by Ali Mahdi and the South by Aideed.
</P>
<P>
They said the talks are centered on reopening Mogadishu Port
and the international airport, which had been closed since 1995
because of feuds between the two factions.
</P>
<P>
A number of other issues concerning ways to maintain ceasefire
in the war-torn country are also under discussion, said the
officials. But details of the talks are not yet known.
</P>
<P>
A peace process has been going on in the Horn of African
nation since a ceasefire accord was signed by representatives of
the warlords in Nairobi, Kenya in late 1996 following the death
of late hardline warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Vows to Carry out Wide-ranging Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today pledged wide-ranging reforms of the national
bureaucracy, fiscal and economic structures and the social welfare
and educational systems.
</P>
<P>
In a policy speech on the first day of the new session of the
Diet (parliament), Hashimoto said the reforms would cause great
hardship but were necessary if Japan's economy was to develop more
vigorously and thrive in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"Our current systems -- namely, administrative systems,
regulation on private-sector activities, social security and
welfare structures, educational administration, and relations
between the central and regional governments -- have in general
functioned effectively for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"However, we are now in an era when the world is rapidly
becoming integrated and when people, products, capital and
information flow freely, and it is clear that the current
framework is an obstacle to the vigorous development of our
country."
</P>
<P>
He said that to change a system that is so deeply rooted in
Japanese society "would take great hardship," but the planned
reforms in the six areas are necessary in a bid to transform the
nation's rigid social and economic system into one that can cope
with changing global trends in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto called fiscal 1997 the first step towards fiscal
reconstruction and said the government had set various
quantitative targets, including cutting central and local
government debt to 3 percent or less of gross domestic product
(GDP) by fiscal 2005.
</P>
<P>
On education, the prime minister vowed to transform the current
rigid schooling system into one which aims to develop the diverse
abilities and creativity of each individual from a viewpoint of
lifetime education.
</P>
<P>
On social security, Hashimoto said the government would allow
for more input from the private sector to create a system which
can efficiently provide high-quality services to meet users'
varying needs.
</P>
<P>
On economic reform, he stressed the need to boost funding,
technology and human resources to foster new industries and turn
the Japanese economy into one of greater efficiency, more
flexibility and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
As for monetary reforms, he said the government would submit to
the Diet a bill to revise the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade
Control Law for drastic liberalization of Japan's financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
On administrative reform, Hashimoto said the government would
work to abolish government involvement in private activities,
entrust public services to private entities and promote
decentralization.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today told the police force to deal "swiftly and firmly" with
criminal activities, especially the rampant armed robberies and
cattle rustling.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to senior police officers from Rift Valley
province in Nakuru where they are attending a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader urged the police to be extra alert to avoid
the kind of violence witnessed during the run-up to the 1992
general elections as an electioneering fever is setting.
</P>
<P>
Moi pledged full support in recruitment of more staff and
provision of modern equipment in order to cope with the new
challenges of the complex world of crime.
</P>
<P>
He advised Kenyan policemen to cultivate moral courage, adding
that it is only through such moral courage that they will
sustain their reputation.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest report, armed crime incidents in Kenya's
capital Nairobi had risen to 470 in the third quarter of last
year compared with 331 and 373 in the first and second quarters.
</P>
<P>
Car-hijackings in the capital had reached an all-time high of
420 incidents for a three-month period ending last September, up
from 227 and 201 in the first two quarters last year.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that illegal arms trade is rampant in the
country with a range of weapons being easily purchased in
Nairobi, Isiolo, Namanga and Kiambu.
</P>
<P>
A police task force was set up in Kenya in the beginning of
this year to fight increasing armed violence in the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese General Comments On Troops To Be Stationed In Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The caliber of troops to be
stationed in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is
even higher than when they first appeared in public last year,
according to Major-General Liu Zhenwu, their commanding officer.
</P>
<P>
The general explained that a special recruitment system has
been adopted by the PLA, and that each one must go through nearly
a year's training before joining the outfit.
</P>
<P>
Courses on Mao Zedong's military thought and Deng Xiaoping's
military theories during the new period and other military affairs
are provided for officers and enlisted men, and the personnel
place a great deal of importance on being model soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The PLA's naval forces to be stationed in the Hong Kong SAR
have done geographical studies of the region and have engaged in
manoeuvres to improve their skill.
</P>
<P>
The air force units are making progress in preparation for
being stationed in the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Central Military Commission and some other units inspected
237 companies last November, and found 97 percent of the troops to
be of excellent caliber, Major General Liu said.

<HEADLINE> UN-Sponsored Forum on Aid for Afghan to Be Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations-sponsored
international meeting will be held from Tuesday to Wednesday in
Ashgabad, Turkmenistan to mobilize humanitarian aid for the
war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to rally international support for a
strategy that links urgently-required humanitarian assistance with
development and peace-making efforts, said the U.N. Office for
Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (UNOCHA) in
a news release issued here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 representatives from governments, the United
Nations system and non-governmental organizations will attend the
two-day event, said the news release.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is co-sponsored by the Department of Humanitarian
Affairs and the United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
After 17 years of conflicts, Afghanistan is one of the poorest
countries in the world today.
</P>
<P>
The recent acceleration of the civil conflict has only
exacerbated the difficult living conditions of an already
impoverished population.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan conflict saw a sudden upsurge as the Taliban militia
launched a lightning strike last week against the Anti-Taliban
Alliance on the front north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The renewed fighting has brought an appeal for an immediate
ceasefire from U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan Norber Holl who
warned that the fighting would send false signals to the Ashgabad
forum.

<HEADLINE> Chinese And Vanuatu Prime Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met
with Vanuatu's Prime Minister Rialuth Serge Vohor in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Li said the visit will help increase understanding and
friendship between the two countries and promote
mutually-beneficial bilateral cooperation, and that although the
two countries are far apart from each other, they are both
developing nations in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that relations between the two countries have gone
smoothly since their diplomatic ties were forged 15 years ago, and
that the two countries have conducted satisfactory exchanges in

have given each other in international and regional affairs, he
said.
</P>

China regards all nations, big or small, as equal, Li pointed
out, and that the past 15 years demonstrate that bilateral
relations can grow as long as the two countries adhere to the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

support and assistance and said that China has played a positive
role in enhancing social, agricultural, medical and educational
growth in his country.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Newspaper: Sanction Is Another War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 20 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi English newspaper
today carried a signed article describing the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq as "another war more serious and more devastating"
to the country.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the Gulf War in early 1991, the sanctions imposed
on Iraq for more than six years is "another war more serious and
more devastating albeit on a slower scale," said the article by
Nail al-Hadithi, Editor-in-chief of the Baghdad Observer.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis have been kept captive of sanctions," the article
said, adding that tens of thousands of Iraqis are suffering from
hunger or almost starvation to death since they could neither find
food, nor could they find badly needed medicines.
</P>
<P>
The author of the article complained that although the leaders
of the main big powers involved in the Gulf War declared they were
not fighting against the Iraqi people, but against the government,
the war turned out to be a large-scale attack on all facilities
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The six-year sanctions have greatly affected the Iraqis' daily
life and caused hundreds and thousands of civilian deaths, many of
them were children.
</P>
<P>
The article ended with the hope that the implementation of the
oil-for-food deal would be only the first step for the full
lifting of all sanctions imposed on Iraq since its August 1990
invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on HK's Economic Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, with its highly
internationally-oriented economy, is particularly outstanding in
its capability to overcome external limitations and make full use
of its various advantages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the region is closely following trends seen in the
global economy and development, and is adjusting its economic
structure in an active and timely manner.
</P>
<P>
An Min, assistant minister for Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, made the remarks today when asked to respond to a
journalist's question on which industry in Hong Kong will be the
most competitive.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's manufacturing sector has been moving up on
a massive scale since 1980s, and to date, 80 percent of the sector
has been moved to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the service sector as a tertiary industry has
developed rapidly, and its dominance in Hong Kong's economy has
been constantly solidified," he noted, adding that the growth of
this sector by far surpassed that of other countries or regions.
</P>
<P>
It accounts for over 80 percent of Hong Kong's GDP compared
with a little over 10 percent of the secondary industry --
industry and manufacturing -- and less than one percent of the
primary industry -- agriculture, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As global economic integration picks up its pace and the
Asia-Pacific economy continues to grow, I believe that Hong Kong
will continue its efforts to adjust its economic structure and
work to improve its economic environment and conditions," he
said. "This will keep Hong Kong as vibrant as it is now and
further consolidate its status as an international center for
trade, finance, shipping and information," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enterprises Enjoy No Privileges in HK SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese enterprises will engage
in fair market competition in the future Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), without enjoying any privileges that
are not extended to other businesses, said An Min, assistant
minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a journalist's question on whether Chinese
corporations will have an advantageous position in the Hong Kong
SAR, he said today that the mainland's investment in Hong Kong
will be listed as overseas investment, under the framework of "one
country, two systems." The investment is subject to the state's
provisions applying to overseas investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
An said Chinese enterprises, when operating in a free and open
market such as Hong Kong's, are required to observe the local laws
and regulations.
</P>
<P>
As all other businesses active in Hong Kong, Chinese
enterprises should be protected and bound by local laws, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In a word, Chinese enterprises shall follow internationally
prevailing economic and trade rules and local "rules of the game,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration of all economic and trade contract disputes
shall draw reference from international practices, he emphasised.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The principles we are pursuing are fair competition,
vigorous development, operation guided by law and enriching Hong
Kong."
</P>
<P>
An said Chinese enterprises have invested considerable
investment, up to tens of billions of US dollars in Hong Kong,
which takes up 10 percent of the Hong Kong's aggregate economy and
becomes an important factor contributing to the region's economic
development and stability.
</P>
<P>
"After July 1, 1997, Chinese businesses in Hong Kong will
devote more efforts to improve quality and efficiency, engaging in
fair competition with other businesses and joining hands to
promote Hong Kong's prosperity," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Confident About Hong Kong After July 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, in a
meeting this afternoon with a Japanese delegation, again expressed
the confidence about Hong Kong's stability and prosperity after
July 1, when China resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Li assured the 85-member group, led by Yoshio Sakuauchi,
president of the Japanese Association for the Promotion of
International Trade, that the policies of "one country, two
systems", and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong", with a high
degree of autonomy will finally be realized.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his appreciation to Sakurauchi and the association
for their efforts in improving Sino-Japanese friendship, and his
hope that the association will expand bilateral trade relations
and increase the understanding of the two peoples so as to boost
friendship for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
Sakurauchi said the two countries' trade and investment
cooperation has continued to increase over the past several years,
and even though political relations are not satisfactory, the
meeting between Prime Minister Hashimoto and President Jiang Zemin
last year during the APEC meeting proved to be a turning point in
bilateral ties, which is gratifying.
</P>
<P>
He called for new cooperative relations based on mutual trust,
to help Japan-China relations.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese guests arrived here Sunday at the invitation of
the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. This
is the association's 25th delegation since 1972, sources said.

<HEADLINE> EC Bans Cosmetic Products Containing Bovine Tissues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
introduced today a provisional ban on the marketing of unsafe
cosmetic products containing bovine tissues or extracts to avoid
risks for humans concerning the so-called Mad Cow Disease.
</P>
<P>
The commission bans the placing on the market of cosmetic
products containing tissues and ingredients derived from the
encephalon, spinal cord and eyes of bovine, ovine and caprine
animals.
</P>
<P>
An EC spokesman said that this ban had in fact translated into
legal terms a situation that already existed in the EU cosmetics
industry.
</P>
<P>
"It is appropriate to take measures designed to ensure the
safety and health of consumers without awaiting irrefutable proof
of the link between BSE (Mad Cow Disease) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease in humans," the commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to a directive of the commission, this ban is
provisional and will be reviewed in line with the development of
scientific knowledge.
</P>
<P>
EU member states are obliged to bring into force the laws,
regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with
this directive no later than June 30, 1997, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Warns PA Against Declaring Independent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today warned the Palestinian Authority (PA)
against unilaterally declaring an independent state.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Israel Radio quoted Netanyahu as saying that
Israel would respond seriously to such a move, which he
described as violation of the peace accords between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Repeating earlier statements, Netanyahu added that the
establishment of a Palestinian state would hurt Israel's vital
security interests.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks following a speech by PA President
Yasser Arafat Sunday during his first victorious visit to the
West Bank town of Hebron, where Israeli troops last week
redeployed and handed over 80 percent of the city to the
Palestinian self-rule.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to about 60,000 tumultuously jubilant Palestinians,
Arafat called for continued march to the still occupied Eastern
Jerusalem and to struggle for achieving Palestinian
independence.
</P>
<P>
"Hebron is the start of the process which will bring us areas B
and C and will lead to an independent Palestinian state," he said.
</P>
<P>
But in contrast with his previous speeches marking the handover
of Palestinian towns to his control, Arafat did not emphasize
Eastern Jerusalem, which he wanted to be the capital of a future
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Following the difficult Hebron deal, Israel and the PA will
likely resume talks soon on the final settlement to
Israeli-Palestinian disputes, including final status of the
self-rule areas, Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The two central disputes will be the issue of Jerusalem and
establishment of Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Israel has vowed never to concede its self-claimed
sovereignty over whole Jerusalem. Netanyahu has indicated his
willingness to expand the Palestinian self-rule, but he has
flatly rejected the establishment of an independent Palestinian
state, saying Israel must retain control over the border, space
and water resources which are so vital to its national
security.

<HEADLINE> China's 1996 Personal Income Tax Revenue Up 46.9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's personal income tax
revenue grew 46.9 percent to 19.3 billion yuan (about 2.3 billion
US dollars) in 1996, according to latest statistics of the State
Administration of Taxation (SAT).
</P>
<P>
Beijing was the biggest source of the tax last year, with
individual income tax revenues of nearly 2.27 billion yuan. The
next four major sources were all in the eastern coastal areas --
2.16 billion yuan for Shanghai, 1.91 billion yuan for Guangdong,
974 million yuan for Jiangsu, and 890 million yuan for Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Most of the national tax revenue was levied on wages, salaries
and incomes of private business people, a SAT official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that though China took a step forward in the collection
and regulation of personal income tax, some outstanding problems
must not be neglected.
</P>
<P>
"A lack of the awareness to pay the income tax and an
undesirable social taxation environment are the two major
problems," he said, adding that government departments in some
places even interfered in tax collections.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that an insufficient check on cash
incomes and transactions has also made collections difficult.
</P>
<P>
A greater effort should be made to collect taxes from people in
the high-income bracket, such as entertainers, and people in the
advertising industry, the official urged.
</P>
<P>
China officially introduced its first individual income tax law
in 1980 and put a revision into force on January 1, 1994. The new
law sets graduated tax rates of five percent to 45 percent, with
the lower end levied on monthly incomes of more than 800 yuan and
the upper end on incomes of over 100,000 yuan a month.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK Has to Increase High-Tech Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has to increase its
input in the development of high technology, said Herbert Liang,
chairman of the Chinese Manufacturer's Association (CMA) of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
At a recent interview, Liang told Xinhua that in the
development of the manufacturing industry, Hong Kong has fallen
behind among "four small dragons in Asia."
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's manufacturing industry is composed of small
and medium-sized enterprises, which lack funds and professionals
for research and development.
</P>
<P>
He said that to meet the trend on the international market,
Hong Kong has to promote high-tech industries so as to enhance its
competitiveness in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the Hong Kong government set up the
Industry and Technology Development Council and Hong Kong
University of Technology in an effort to enhance high technology
development, but the impacts were inconspicuous due to
insufficient investment.
</P>
<P>
The way for Hong Kong to develop high technology is to
integrate the Chinese mainland's technological base and huge
market demand with Hong Kong's own edges, make use of the research
results of scientific institutions on the mainland and carry out
large-scale research and development programs to create
technology-intensive industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liang said the CMA is committed to promoting Hong Kong's edges
in developing high value-added industries via its missions in
foreign countries and the Chinese mainland, with a view to
securing their investment in and cooperation with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Collaboration in this regard is both beneficial and
complementary to Hong Kong and the interior areas," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Liang, the CMA will spearhead, in the coming year,
assistance to local small and medium-sized enterprises in
enhancing their competitiveness, exploring investment
opportunities in Central and West China and stepping up economic
cooperation between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The association has set up a three million HK dollars (387,000
U.S. dollars) Industrial Support Fund for a "Net for Small and
Medium-Sized Enterprises" on the Internet to provide on-line
market information to the enterprises and encourage wider adoption
 of information technology in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Declines in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The overall month-on-month
inflation rate decreased to 10.8 percent in December 1996 from
11.4 percent in November the same year, according to the latest
issue of the Monthly Economic Review.
</P>
<P>
The review, published by the Central Bank of Kenya, noted that
the decline in inflation was more pronounced in the lower and
middle income groups and affected almost all consumer items,
except transport, basic foods and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The review said the downward trend is likely to continue and
the month-on-month rate is expected to fall below 7.0 percent in
the next four months.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the decline to the government's adherence to a
strict fiscal and monetary policy, a stronger local currency
Shilling and a drop in prices of petroleum and petroleum-related
products.
</P>
<P>
The money supply is targeted to consistently expand by no
more than 15.7 percent between January and March this year, it
stated.
</P>
<P>
The review pointed out that the fiscal policy will be
further tightened to ensure that the ratio of the budget deficit
to GDP falls below 2.2 percent by the end of the current
financial year.

<HEADLINE> COSCO Vows to Work Toward HK's Prosperity, Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China Ocean Shipping (Group)
Co. (COSCO) pledged today to enhance cooperation with Hong Kong
shipowners and to devote its efforts toward Hong Kong's prosperity
and stability after mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's role as a free port and an international shipping
center will not be changed after it returns to the motherland,
said Chen Zhongbiao, president of COSCO group and chairman of the
China Shipowners Association.
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon given in his honor by the Hong Kong Shipowners
Association (HKSOA), Chen outlined the rapid growth of China's
ocean shipping industry in the last several years, as a result of
the nation's expanding foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
During the eighth Five-Year plan (1991-1995) period, China's
total trade volume was over 1 trillion U.S. dollars, with the
average annual growth at 19.5 percent. The trade volume is
expected to top 400 billion dollars in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, China's shipping industry, which
carries over 90 percent of foreign trade cargoes, has seen
business increase sharply, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Container turnover, in particular, has enjoyed an average
annual growth of 30 percent in the last several years, and is
estimated to reach a high of 10 million 20-foot equivalent units
(TEUs) in the year 2000, compared with 5.49 million TEUs in 1995.
</P>
<P>
With China's policy of opening to the outside world, foreign
shipping companies have entered the huge Chinese market, Chen
said. By 1995, 15 had established their wholly-owned subsidiaries
in China, in addition to 350 representative offices set up by
foreign shipowners, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The COSCO chief in his speech also hailed the establishment of
Shanghai Shipping Exchange in November 1996, which will help build
an equitable, open and fair cargo forwarding market in China.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Taliban Launch New Offensives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan has seen a sudden
upsurge in fighting over the past few days when the Taliban
militia launched a lightning attack against the anti-Taliban
alliance on the front north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia, which control two-thirds of Afghan
territory, are already close to the Panjshir Valley, the
stronghold of Ahmad Masood, commander of the ousted government
forces, following their capture of Kapisa Province northeast of
Kabul Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The front-line, which a few weeks ago was close to Kabul, has
now been pushed back 100 kilometers into the territory under the
control of the ousted government.
</P>
<P>
Kapisa was seized a day after the Islamic militia recaptured,
in a lightning strike, the strategic Bagram Airbase and the key
provincial capital of Charikar, which had been defended largely by
Masood's forces.
</P>
<P>
In tanks and armored personnel carriers, Taliban soldiers on
January 16 stormed the airbase, which is about 50 kilometers north
of Kabul and where the biggest military and civilian airport in
Afghanistan is located.
</P>
<P>
From Bagram the Taliban pushed northward another 10 kilometers
and took Charikar, the capital of Parwan Province.
</P>
<P>
By Saturday, the Taliban militia approached the town of
Gulbahar, about 100 kilometers north of Kabul. Gulbahar, with its
strategic location, is believed to be the gateway to the Panjshir
Valley.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban had tried to push into the Panjshir Valley after
their capture of Kabul last September, but failed despite several
costly attempts as Masood lost no time in launching a
counterattack and forced the Taliban forces to retreat to areas 20
kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The latest offensive by the Taliban came after peace talks were
held here last week among Afghan warring factions under the
auspices of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Taliban and the anti-Taliban alliance
led by northern warlord Rashid Dostum attended the three-day
working group meeting, as termed by the head of the U.N. special
peace mission to Afghanistan, Norbert Holl.
</P>
<P>
Holl called for an immediate cease-fire among the Afghan
warring factions after the renewed fighting which he described as
all the more "disturbing."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy emphasized that a cessation of hostilities would
help promote the process of dialogue among the warring sides which
did see some positive developments at their Islamabad meeting.
</P>
<P>
Although no substantial progress was made, the factions agreed
to resume their talks in February.
</P>
<P>
However, it is believed that no major breakthrough could be
achieved through such kind of talks until the Afghan warring
factions earnestly observe an overall cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Disagrees With Nigeria's New Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has expressed
reservations with aspects of the Nigerian government's 1997
budget released last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The issues of privatization and the exchange rate are in the
center of the disagreement, World Bank officials said at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is currently negotiating with the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund on its Medium Term Economic Strategy,
which is linked to the reduction of the country's huge external
debt standing at 28 billion U.S. Dollars by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank insisted on bolder steps to be taken in
privatization, but Nigerian Head of State, General sani Abacha,
said various options on privatization "will be closely examined
by a highly-powered committee before any privatization exercise
is embarked upon."
</P>
<P>
"The government will ensure effective and efficient management
of these enterprises while the nation gets maximum benefits from
service and resources," said Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank expected the Nigerian government to drop its
officially fixed exchange rate of one dollar to 22 Naira and
liberalise the exchange rate, but government insisted that the
current exchange rate system will not change in the 1997 fiscal
year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on Measures to Maintain HK's Status (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An said the Hong Kong SAR will keep its membership under the
name of "Chinese Hong Kong" in the world's largest multilateral
economic and trade organization, the World Trade Organization
(WTO), enjoying the rights and fulfilling the obligations of the
WTO independently.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining and strengthening the role Hong Kong is playing in
world trade and economy is in the best interests of both Hong Kong
and the mainland, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We set our primary objective of the economic and trade policy
towards Hong Kong as maintaining and strengthening Hong Kong's
status as a center of international trade, finance, shipping and
information," An said.
</P>
<P>
Guided by this, he said, "We will fully support a high degree
of freedom and openness in Hong Kong's status as an ideal arena
for concentration and flow of international capital.
</P>
<P>
"We'll actively support Hong Kong's effective market operating
mechanism and complete market legislation, encouraging Hong Kong
to bring its market mechanism into full play and maintaining its
environment for open and fair competition.
</P>
<P>
"We stand ready to support Hong Kong in its efforts to expand
foreign economic and trade relations, and further enhance its
reputation as an international metropolitan city provided the
state's sovereignty and interests are not undermined."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, extra efforts shall be taken to strengthen
economic cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong and make
better use of the advantages the two areas enjoy, and thus create
favorable conditions for mutual prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of these laws and regulations after July 1
this year and a close economic and trade cooperation between the
two areas will further strengthen and advance Hong Kong's status
as a center of international trade, finance, shipping and
information, he pointed out.

<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), as a separate customs territory of
the People's Republic of China, will enjoy a high degree of
autonomy in its administrative management of the economic and
trade sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it can formulate and implement economic and trade
laws, policies and administrative measures on its own in strict
keeping with the principle of "one country, two systems" and the
Basic law, said An Min, assistant minister for Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
When asked by journalists to comment on how foreign investors
can be assured that Hong Kong will continue to be a society ruled
by law, An said Hong Kong will continue to enjoy a relatively
complete legislation, and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR
provides a basic guarantee for its economic prosperity and stable
development.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates that after July 1, 1997, Hong Kong's
legislation will remain basically unchanged, he added.
</P>
<P>
All the existing laws will remain in force, except those
provisions that contradict the Basic Law or those requiring
amendments by the Hong Kong SAR legislature, he explained.
</P>
<P>
An noted all the central government's economic and trade laws,
regulations, policies and administration measures effective on the
mainland shall not be applied to Hong Kong, adding that Hong
Kong's agencies are by no means subordinate to their counterparts
in the central government, and Hong Kong's relevant departments
will not experience any interventions in their routine work.
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue to welcome foreigners to Hong Kong to make
investment after 1997," he pledged, "encouraging them to engage in
legal operation and fair competition."

JAKARTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Continuous volcanic tremors are
rocking the areas surrounding Mount Merapi, Indonesia's most
active volcano, which erupted last Friday, a volcanology official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Mas Atje Purbawinata, head of the Volcanology Office in
Yogyakarta, about 35 kilometers south of Merapi, said that Merapi,
since its eruption on Friday, has not stopped spewing heat clouds

Mount Merapi is still on the "alert" warning level, he said,
noting that at least 63 tremors and 62 major lava emissions were
recorded since Sunday evening to 6:00 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the "alert" status of the volcano, thousands of people
have returned to their homes at the slopes of Mount Merapi since
late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 2,968-meter volcano stands at the border of Central Java
province and Yogyakarta.

On the economic and trade front, Hong Kong will keep the
current economic and trade system, retaining its standing as a
free port.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong will continue to pursue a free trade policy,
enabling the free flow of commodities, invisible assets and
capital. Additionally, Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of
autonomy in administrative legislation and management, enacting
and implementing economic and trade laws, policies and measures on
their own.
</P>
<P>
"China will fully ensure Hong Kong's autonomous participation
in multilateral and bilateral economic and trade activities,
provided the Basic Law is not violated," he said.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the stipulations of the Basic Law or with the
authorization of the central government, he said, the Hong Kong
SAR, a separate customs territory, can keep and advance its
economic and trade relations with various countries and regions,
under the name "Chinese Hong Kong."

<HEADLINE> Liberian Warlords Reaffirm Commitment to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of warring factions in
Liberia have repeated their commitment to the completion of
disarmament and demobilization of their fighters before the
January 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi made the remarks at the
weekend after his visit to Liberia last week on conducting the
second phase of the verification of the disarmament,
demobilization and repatriation of the Liberian factions.
</P>
<P>
His words might be helpful to remove the fear of any new
obstacles in the Liberian peace process aroused by recent calls
from warlords Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah for fresh peace
talks "to thrash out unresolved issues", local observers say.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is
greatly concerned about the current low level of disarmament,
Ikimi said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
So far only about 7,000 of Liberia's estimated 60,000 fighters
have put down their weapons since the disarmament operation began
on November 22.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to make it clear to all citizens of Liberia that
anyone found carrying arms beyond that date would be doing so on
his individual account and not on behalf of any faction," Ikim
said.
</P>
<P>
The West African peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, "will be
in a position to take appropriate action against such
individuals," he added.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS is determined to keep to the schedule of implementation
of the Abuja peace accord signed by factional leaders last
August, which will lead to the conduct of elections by the end of
May this year, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi said his assessment team has recommended that the
ministerial meeting of the ECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia be
brought forward to early February from March "to assess the
outcome of the disarmament and endorse the mode of implementation
of the rest of the program."
</P>
<P>
The minister also appealed that the international community
should not engage in any exercise that could impede the
implementation of the peace program.

<HEADLINE> Macao Civil Servants to Study Putonghua Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 civil servants of the
Macao Government will begin to learn Putonghua, or standard
Chinese language, this year to prepare for their future career.
</P>
<P>
That means an increase of some 800 people, compared with the
number of 1,215 civil servants who attended language training
courses in 1996, according to figures released by the Department
of Administrative and Civil Service Affairs of the Macao
Government.
</P>
<P>
The department plans to start 88 Putonghua courses and 13
Cantonese language courses this year for the civil servants who
chose to remain in Macao after 1999 when China resumes its
exercise of sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that as most civil servants who decided to stride
across 1999 need to improve their language skills and as the use
of Chinese as an official language proceeds, the number of
Putonghua and Cantonese language courses tends to increase.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an official of the Macao Cultural Department urged
Macao students to learn Putonghua now, saying it would be the main
form of communication in the future Macao Special Administrative
Regional Government.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK Has to Increase High-Tech Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has to increase its
input in the development of high technology, said Herbert Liang,
chairman of the Chinese Manufacturer's Association (CMA) of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
At a recent interview, Liang told Xinhua that in the
development of the manufacturing industry, Hong Kong has fallen
behind among "four small dragons in Asia."
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's manufacturing industry is composed of small
and medium-sized enterprises, which lack funds and professionals
for research and development.
</P>
<P>
He said that to meet the trend on the international market,
Hong Kong has to promote high-tech industries so as to enhance its
competitiveness in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the Hong Kong government set up the
Industry and Technology Development Council and Hong Kong
University of Technology in an effort to enhance high technology
development, but the impacts were inconspicuous due to
insufficient investment.
</P>
<P>
The way for Hong Kong to develop high technology is to
integrate the Chinese mainland's technological base and huge
market demand with Hong Kong's own edges, make use of the research
results of the scientific institutions on the mainland and carry
out large-scale research and development programs to create
technology-intensive industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liang said the CMA is committed to promoting Hong Kong's edges
in developing high value-added industries via its missions in
foreign countries and the Chinese mainland, with a view to
securing their investment in and cooperation with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Collaboration in this regard is both beneficial and
complementary to Hong Kong and the mainland," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Liang, the CMA will spearhead, in the coming year,
assistance to local small and medium sized enterprises in
enhancing their competitiveness, exploring investment
opportunities in Central and West China and stepping up economic
cooperation between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The association has set up a 3 million HK dollars (387,000 U.S.
dollars) Industrial Support Fund for a "Net for Small and
Medium-Sized Enterprises" on the Internet to provide on-line
market information to the enterprises and encourage wider adoption
of information technology in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong's economic prospect in 1997, Liang said he is very
optimistic about the economic performance of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said the CMA predicts that the economic growth this year
will surpass that of 1996, reaching 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong's handover in the middle of 1997, Liang said the
current sound macro-economic environment, coupled with the picking
up of Hong Kong's economy, is conducive to the territory's smooth
transition.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has now reached its historical moment of
enjoying a most stable social order, a booming economy and the
best diplomatic relations, which will all guarantee a smooth
transition in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A telephone hotline aiming to help
primary school students in their home study turned out extremely
popular in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The hotline, sponsored by the government education department,
receives more than 200 calls a day, mostly from pupils of grade
four, five and six, asking questions related to maths and English
lessons.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Education and Youth Department said that the
hotline was expanded from two lines in the beginning last October
to four by the end of 1996, and may be further increased to ten
lines or more, to meet surging demands.
</P>
<P>
The hotline is available between five o'clock to ten in the
afternoon from Monday through Saturday, with students from the
University of Macao volunteering to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
Most parents in Macao are busy with their work and have little
time helping their children's home study, prompting the
establishment of the hotline, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has some 40,000 students in primary schools, attending
courses in Cantonese, English or Portuguese language.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Several Thai Sectors Face Further Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 20 (Xinhua) -- As a result of the adverse
impact of an overall economic slowdown in Thailand last year,
several sectors of the economy may not look promising this year.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has taken a series of urgent measures to
revive the economy, but they have yet to prove effective in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Stagnation could still be a problem with several sectors and
business people, in particular new entrants, need to be prudent in
their management, if they want to survive the sluggish period, the
Thai Farmers Research Center has warned.
</P>
<P>
The oversupply in the property sector, which has been building
up over the last three to four years, cannot be expected to be
eased within this year. The sector is faced with low buying power
and high interest rates and a recovery will hinge, to a large
extent, on the government's financial incentives.
</P>
<P>
Plastic products, whose prices have been high because of high
wages and expensive raw materials, may find it hard to compete
with products from countries where cost is lower. Quality is
another problem that could affect exports and worse still,
beginning this year the European Union has reduced by half plastic
import tariff privileges for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Expansion of garments industry would remain slow and it is
expected to hit a record-low this year, down by five percent
further. Thai clothes will find it harder to penetrate the U.S.
market because goods of Mexico, a member of NAFTA (North American
Free Trade Agreement), are cheaper and enjoy lower tariffs.
</P>
<P>
For gems and jewelry, although their exports grew by about 9.4
percent last year, the growth rate was lower than the average 10
percent in the 1990-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
This year prospects for gems and jewelry exports are expected
to be still poor as economic growth in importing countries and
regions remains slow.
</P>
<P>
The cost of Thai gems and jewelry is high because of high cost
of cutting and machinery imports.
</P>
<P>
The general outlook for the tourism industry this year is also
poor, with tourist arrival growth expected at eight percent, but
outbound at 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The problems are old ones, such as pollution, traffic jams and
safety. Outbound tourism will continue to experience tough
competition in a declining market, and a price war is likely to
spread in the market.
</P>
<P>
Hotels will continue to suffer from an oversupply as more new
rooms are available. Main hotels in major destinations have seen
their occupancy rates drop.
</P>
<P>
Footwear is unlikely to show a brighter picture this year. Its
exports may rise about five percent, but last year the industry
recorded a major decline of 37.6 percent in comparison with 1995.
</P>
<P>
Costs, such as raw materials and labor, will continue to go up,
and the European Union's anti-dumping strategy against Thai
footwear will be another factor the sector will have to face.
</P>
<P>
Rising costs and shortage of labor may also affect the frozen
food industry and output of black tiger prawn will also drop.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors which will face a gloomy year are toys, sanitary
ware, golf courses and ceramics.
</P>
<P>
However, the research center pointed out that prospects for
canned seafood and furniture are among those which could be
promising.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian professor has called
for the maximum exploitation of the country's nuclear energy
potentials before its huge oil reserves are used out.
</P>
<P>
E. D. Mshelia, a professor from Abubakar Tafawa Balewa
University, said the situation that 62 percent of the country's
electricity are generated from oil must be changed.
</P>
<P>
The professor noted that Nigeria's 20 billion U.S. Dollars
worth of oil reserve could be exhausted within the next 20 years
at the present production of two million barrels a day. It must,
therefore, make haste to seek alternative sources of energy.
</P>
<P>
"The only available and viable option is to exploit the
possibility of generating electricity from nuclear sources," said
the professor.
</P>
<P>
He pictured a bleak future for the country to satisfy its
increasing demands for electricity in the forthcoming decades.
</P>
<P>
At present, Nigeria has two research bodies engaged in nuclear
research. It also has uranium mineral. In the years during the
oil boom, the country had planned to develop the nuclear
industry.

HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Eastern Chinese Province
of Anhui is a reliable partner in economic cooperation for Hong
Kong, Macao and Southeast Asian countries and it now seeks an even
closer tie with Hong Kong, an official of the provincial
government said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of an investment-oriented
campaign here today, Deputy Governor Zhang Runxia said that Anhui
achieved the fastest economic development among Chinese provinces
during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period which ended in 1995, with
an average annual increase of 14.1 percent in the gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
Anhui's total import and export value for the period was 7.4
billion U.S. dollars, with an average annual increase of 25
percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's total investment in Anhui during the period was 1.3
billion U.S. dollars, about 43 percent of the total value of
overseas investment in the province. Anhui's total value of
imports and exports in 1996, which is the first year of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period, was 2.75 billion U.S. dollars and that for
the trade with Hong Kong was 410 million U.S. dollars.

"We believe that economic cooperation between Anhui and Hong
Kong will enter a new stage on the basis of mutual benefit and
prosperity," she added.

<HEADLINE> PA Official: Negotiations Beyond Hebron to Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Higher Education Minister of the
Palestinian Authority (PA) Hanan Ashrawi today said negotiations
with Israel on pending issues in the transitional phase after the
Hebron redeployment will start soon.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the two sides would discuss a number of
issues, including the opening of safe passages between the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Gaza Airport and the release of
Palestinian prisoners, the minister said in an interview this
morning with Voice of Arab radio.
</P>
<P>
Some issues in the transitional phase require an executive
protocol such as the security passages between the West Bank and
Gaza, while others do not need talks, namely, the release of
Palestinian detainees and prisoners of war in Israeli jails, she
added.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi termed Hebron accord as a mere executive protocol that
has political dimensions because it is the first accord the
present Israeli government signed with the PA.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed troop pullbacks from 80 percent of Hebron last
Friday under a deal initialed Wednesday between the Palestinians
and Israelis after months of tortuous negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Under the Note for the Record provided by the the U.S. as an
annex to the Hebron agreement, the two sides will resume the
above-mentioned talks immediately after the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Within two months, they will begin talks on a final peace
agreement, which will decide their final borders, the future of
Jerusalem and the 144 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's cement export has lost
1.6 billion Kwacha (about 1.2 million U.S. Dollars) since last
July due to the sanctions imposed on Burundi by some African
countries.
</P>
<P>
The loss was accrued by Chilaga Cement Plc's export to
Burundi. Chilaga Cement Plc is the sole cement producer in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Zambia stopped its cement export to Burundi last July when it
joined other African countries in imposing sanctions on Burundi
to protest against the military coup staged by present President
Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions also affected Mpulungu Port and surface
transporters who lost 80 million Kwacha (about 62,000 U.S.
Dollars) and 800 million Kwacha (about 620,000 U.S. Dollars)
respectively in service charges.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Foreign Minister Lawrence Shimba reaffirmed recently
that his country will maintain sanctions on Burundi, alleging
that Buyoya's has continued to kill members of opposition
parties.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Mission to Boost Trade With Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Spanish
Association of Agricultural Machinery Exporters arrived in
Malaysia today for a two-day visit to the country as part of their
mission to seek business partners in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, made up of representatives of eight Spanish
companies, will also visit other Southeast Asian countries
including Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish business people will hold individual meetings with
potential importers and distributors during their visit here,
delegation chief Aitor Santillan said today.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish companies are producers of farm equipment,
agricultural implements and machinery for cattle breeding,
sprayers and accessories, grain silos and feedmill plants,
automatic scarecrow equipment and power shafts for agricultural
machinery.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Spain exported about two million ringgit (about
800,000 U.S. dollars) worth of agricultural machinery components
and spare parts to Malaysia. Santillan said Spanish products must
compete with those from Australia, Denmark, Italy, Japan and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
But, he said there was good potential for Spanish-made stock
breeding products like automatic feeding systems, grain silos and
feedmills plants in which Spain has a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in 1995, Malaysia's exports
to Spain totaled 526.4 million U.S. dollars compared with 321.9
million dollars in 1994, while Spain's exports to Malaysia were
valued at 210 million U.S. dollars in 1995 against 81.1 million
dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Most of Malaysia's exports to Spain were consumer electronics,
data processing units and air conditioners, natural rubber, latex
and gloves, and palm oil and palm oil products. Spain's exports to
Malaysia included boilers and machines, automotive components,
paper, furniture and stainless steel laminated sheets.

<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- An Min, assistant minister for
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, has said that Hong Kong's
return to the motherland will create more business opportunities
and foster a more favorable environment for businesses from
various countries and regions, including U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
He said this in response to a journalist's question on what
impact Hong Kong's return to the motherland will have on
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
An said that after Hong Kong's return, the economic relations
and trade between the mainland and Hong Kong will continue to be
regarded as China's external economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
He said economic and trade interactions between the two areas
will continue to follow the rules and practices governing
international trade.
</P>
<P>
"In our opinion", he said, "after July 1 this year, the
mainland and Hong Kong will be two independent units in keeping
trade statistics. The two areas will follow their own statistics
systems and laws and regulations while compiling trade statistics
and offering relevant information."
</P>
<P>
"In this sense, Hong Kong will play the same role in the
Sino-U.S. trade relations as it is playing now," he said.
</P>
<P>
An said that despite the transfer of power, Hong Kong will
remain the gateway linking the mainland to the international
market.
</P>
<P>
It will continue to be an international economic and trade
center blessed with unique advantages, he said, adding that no
other Chinese city can replace Hong Kong in terms of its status
and role. Provided the Basic Law is not violated, the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region will seek to further consolidate and
advance its multilateral and bilateral economic and trade
relations with other countries and regions, he said.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Trade Rises 2.8 Pct Last December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total external
trade increased by 2.8 percent in December 1996 on a monthly
basis, with non-oil domestic exports remaining weak, the Singapore
Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports recorded a marginal decline of 0.5
percent last December as compared with an 8.8 percent decline the
previous month, it said.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports grew by 9.2 percent in December, while domestic
exports of oil rose by 20.2 percent, due mainly to the continued
surge of 19.4 percent in oil prices resulting from cold weather in
Europe and the United States and a shortage of heating oil stock.
</P>
<P>
On a three-month moving average basis, however, non-oil exports
dropped by 2.8 percent to a level of around 5.36 billion US
dollars in December, while oil domestic exports registered a
double digit growth of 21.7 percent to reach about one billion US
dollars in the month.
</P>
<P>
Imports increased by 1.3 percent in December, largely in
computer parts and peripherals, disk drives, blank computer tapes
and discs, jewelry, parts of color television sets and radios,
cigarettes, and transmitters and transmitter-receivers.
</P>
<P>
The TDB predicted that total trade growth for 1997 will be
between five to seven percent, probably closer to the upper end of
the projected range. It cited two major reasons as "favorable
developments" leading to the increase.
</P>
<P>
First, the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development) has projected higher world trade growth of 6.7
percent compared with 6.1 percent in 1996. Second, global
electronics demand is expected to recover by the second half of
1997.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1996, the TDB said that Singapore's total
trade grew by 5.1 percent to reach around 258.21 billion US
dollars, slower than the 13.2 expansion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The slower trade growth was due mainly to the cyclical slowdown
in global demand for electronics and related products, it said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Iraq Reach Agreement on Oil Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Iraq have agreed on
an across-the-board price of 19.10 U.S. dollars per barrel for
Iraqi oil to be supplied to the kingdom in 1997, Jordan Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed Saturday night by the two countries
in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, Iraq will meet Jordan's request to
raise its oil supplies in 1997 by 7 percent to reach 4.5 million
tonnes of crude oil and oil derivatives (25 million barrels of
crude and 7 million barrels of derivatives).
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Jordanian Minister of Industry
and Trade Ali Abul Ragheb and Minister of Energy and Mineral
Resources Hisham Dabbas attended the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
During the Baghdad talks, Jordan and Iraq also signed a trade
protocol, under which Jordan will supply to Iraq goods and
services worth 255 million dollars in 1997 compared with 200
million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The agreement means that Jordan will receive Iraqi oil worth
625 million dollars in 1997. The free-of-charge supply will account
for 300 million dollars, leaving 325 million dollars to be
paid. This will be settled by the 255 million dollars trade
protocol and the rest 70 million dollars will be adjusted as
partial payment of Iraq's debts to Jordan, which is estimated by
officials here at 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, Iraq has been providing Jordan with crude oil and
petroleum products, half free of charge and the other half at
discounted prices.
</P>
<P>
Jordan paid 15.25 dollars per barrel of Iraqi oil and
received 250 million dollars worth of free Iraqi oil supply in
1996.
</P>
<P>
In return, Jordan exported food and medicine to Iraq, but not
free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Jordan reduced its trade volume with Iraq to 200 million
dollars in 1996 from 400 million dollars in 1995, saying that the
cutback was prompted when Iraq could no longer afford to pay the
foreign exchange needed for the Jordanian goods.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's oil imports from Iraq are carried out under a special
exemption to the United Nations economic sanctions imposed on
Baghdad after its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

1996, the Interior Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The accidents, totaling 20,000 last year, claimed the lives of
6,000 people and injured 21,700 others, making it the single
greatest cause for the loss of life in many years.
</P>
<P>
The number of traffic accidents and subsequent deaths and
injuries increased by 22 percent, 3.8 percent and 26.5 percent
respectively compared with 1995, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
In spite of great efforts made to implement decrees on traffic
safety, violation of traffic law and regulations and illegal
occupation of roads and street pavement remain a big problem.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the police throughout the country handled more than
1.8 million cases of traffic law and regulation breaches, and
revoked the licenses of 2,645 motor vehicle drivers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of newly-licensed cars and motorcycles
increased by 17 percent in Vietnam but roads were still narrow and
degrading in the country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe To Vaccinate 4 Million Cattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
planning a nationwide campaign to vaccinate about 4.2 million
heads of cattle against parasites and other diseases as part of
the effort to restore viability to the livestock industry.
</P>
<P>
Re-production of cattle in the communal areas, which formed a
good percentage of the herd in the nation, has been adversely
affected by worms and other diseases, according to Stewart
Hargreaves, director of country's veterinary services.
</P>
<P>
"We have embarked on a countrywide program to dose cattle in
the communal areas in the fight against worms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Funding for the massive program had come from the World Food
and Agricultural Organisation as most farmers in the communal
areas could not afford to vaccinate their cattle.
</P>
<P>
After the serious drought of 1991/92 had depleted the herd in
the southern African country, the government embarked on the
restocking program.

Lagos, January 20 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said he is planning to visit Nigeria "when time is
right" and pledged to assist the country's democratization
process.
</P>
<P>
"That is how we normally operate," Annan said last weekend,
explaining that the U.N. will participate actively in the
country's electoral process if the Nigerian government makes the
request.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is the first sub-Saharan African taking office of
the U.S. chief, said he will step up dialogue with the Nigerian
military government on the democratization process in the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
"I supported what my predecessor did I intend to continue,"
said the Ghanaian, who became the U.N. Secretary-General on
January 2 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other
human rights activists in November 1995, former U.S. Secretary
General Boutros-Ghali sent a U.N. fact-finding mission to Nigeria
to asses the country's democratization process and the human
rights situation.
</P>
<P>
The mission, which had visited Nigeria from March 29 to April
13, 1996, while concluding that the phased transition program,
scheduled to be completed on October 1, 1998, is "genuine",
warned against imposition of further sanctions against Nigeria.

"The moderate growth of the electronics industry in Singapore
in 1996 was a result of a slowdown in the global semiconductor
industry being offset by the strong growth in data storage and
office automation equipment," the EDB commented.
</P>
<P>
This reflects the balancing effects of the various
sub-clusters, which need further diversification, to reduce
negatives of the industry's "boom and bust" cycles, it added.
</P>
<P>
This moderating effect is anticipated to remain a
characteristic of the electronics industry in the future, the EDB
said.

<P>
SHANGHAI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- They look like experienced
newspaper reporters, they have interviewed state leaders and
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, and their stories can be read in
every corner of China.
</P>
<P>
But unlike thousands of other Chinese journalists, their
full-time job is not writing news, but going to primary and middle
school.
</P>
<P>
The boys and girls have plenty of reasons to be proud of their
professional newspaper, named "Xiao Zhu Ren", or "Little
Master": the newspaper's circulation now exceeds one million,
making it the world's most widely-read newspaper for kids.
</P>
<P>
And it's run entirely by youngsters under the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
Many of the newspaper's "veteran" reporters have gone on to
work at some national newspapers and TV stations.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to give young people opportunities to practise news
writing and help them grow up in an all-round way," said Zhu
Jieshi, director and founder of the Shanghai-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
When the paper was founded on July, 1983, it had only around
10,000 readers. There are more than 300 million children in China,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
But the four-page semi-weekly soon attracted attention from
young readers all over the country, because its stories, photos
and cartoons vividly cover teens' lives in and out of school.
</P>
<P>
"I like to read it because it talks about us," said a boy
reader in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We always try to let our readers know how to become a master
of their own lives, not only now but also after they leave
school," noted Zhu, who was a long-time teacher.
</P>
<P>
In order to train a professional news staff, Zhu set up a
special school to teach the ABCs of journalism to the children.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 200 reporters in Shanghai and thousands of
correspondents across the country are working for the paper,
developing their skills in gathering and writing news.

<HEADLINE> Thai Jewelers Want Incentives for Quality Uplift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Owners of Thai jewelry
factories have urged the government to grant lower duties on
machinery imports and easier and less expensive credit as
incentives for improving the quality of their products, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country's jewelry industry needs to upgrade its factories
and technology to keep its competitive edge in the world market,
said executive members of the Thai Gem and Jewelry Traders
Association.
</P>
<P>
Installation of more modern machinery will help jewelry
companies move into the production of higher-end goods that are
expected to boost the sector's export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's jewelry exports value recorded a near double-digit
growth last year, while the country's overall exports barely
increased.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the world's second largest jewelry producer in term
of volume after Italy.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Thailand maintained the ranking through producing
cheap silver and gold alloy jewelry for the lower market.
</P>
<P>
In the past three to five years, Thai jewelry products have
seen considerable improvement with new local design creations and
introduction of western skills, the report said.

<P>
MOGADISHU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader Ali
Mahdi Mohamed, at a press conference yesterday, called on the
Somalis to refrain from violence and armed conflicts, but
practice maximum restraint at this crucial moment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his first press conference in north Mogadishu, Ali
Mahdi warned against the consequences which might result from any
further bloodshed in the capital, Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi denjed that the 26 Somali factions who recently met
in Ethiopia are organizing war against Hussein Aidid and the
leader of the break away Republic of Somaliland, Mohamed Hagi
Ibrahim Egal.
</P>
<P>
He said that the newly founded National Salvation Council has
instead formed two negotiation committees to open peace dialogues
with Hussein Aidid and Egal.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi said the National Salvation Council will be operating
for the coming six months before going into other round of
forming a government of national unity or a presidential council
for somalia.

"I've learned to be very clear about the basic difference
between a composition and a news story - the composition can be
fictitious but the news must be true," said Chen Huizhuo, a
fifth-grader at Shanghai's Fahuazhen No.2 Primary School, who is a
reporter with the paper.
</P>
<P>
Instructed by teachers, the part-time reporters have
interviewed many people, both famous and not-so. The namelist
includes China's state leaders, the Mayor of Shanghai, Queen
Elizabeth II, astronauts, writers, engineers and fellow students.
</P>
<P>
"I think we've partially reached our goals," Zhu said,
explaining that a group of former reporters who have gone on to
work as professional journalists have been successful in their new
positions.
</P>
<P>
Some of them have been employed by local television stations
and national newspapers, such as "People's Daily", China's largest
newspaper, he said.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The three East African
countries, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, are planning to upgrade
their flying school to an aeronautical university to satisfy
increasing regional demand for pilots and plane engineers.
</P>
<P>
"East African ", the region's weekly newspaper, today quoted
David Wakikona, director of the flying school, as saying that the
university is expected to be jointly financed by the three
members of the East African Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
But it will continue to receive financial aid from the United
Nations Development Program and International Civil Aviation
Organization, he said.
</P>
<P>
The flying school, located at Soroti, about 300 kilometers
east of Uganda's capital of Kampala, was initially set up in 1971
to train pilots and aircraft maintenance engineers for the entire
Anglophone east African region.
</P>
<P>
It admits 20 piloting students per class for a 18-month
training session.

<HEADLINE> Government Organs Forge Ties With Poverty-Ridden Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Twelve government ministries
and non-Communist parties are uniting to help poverty-ridden
Guizhou Province jumpstart its economy.
</P>
<P>
Departments included were the ministries of Agriculture,
forestry and construction, the State Science and Technology
Commission, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of
China, Xinhua News Agency, Jiu San Society and the Chinese
Peasants and Workers Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
They have sent 39 officials to serve as deputy party and
government heads in 36 counties in a bid to improve management
expertise there.
</P>
<P>
The number of poor counties in Guizhou make up 8.1 percent of
the total number in China, and account for 12.5 percent of the
country's total impoverished population.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that poor areas in Guizhou have received 200
million yuan in financial aid from the 12 government
departments. The money has been used to build 100 projects, the
majority of which are in operation and have been initially
successful.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the Ministry of Forestry Industry has allocated
54.79 million yuan to help 10 poor counties build 67
forest-related projects and develop forest product and fruit
processing techniques.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the output value generated from forestry by the 10
counties climbed to 578 million yuan by the end of 1995,
accounting for 26 percent of the total industrial and agricultural
output value there.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture offered 9.4 million yuan to build
22 farm produce processing firms in the mountainous area of Wulong.
</P>
<P>
With their support, the living standards of more than 3.7
million people who used to live under the poverty line, with an
annual income of less than 530 yuan per person, have greatly
improved.

<HEADLINE> Self-Reliant SADC To Set up Fund for Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) is planning to establish a 50
million U.S. Dollar fund for drought relief, according to the
latest issue of "the Zambian Farmer".
</P>
<P>
The SADC is currently making a survey to determine how best
the fund can be used to alleviate drought problems in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Drought has ravaged the southern Africa in recent years and
SADC member states have found themselves lack of food to cushion
people from recurrent droughts.
</P>
<P>
"It's better to put up our own instrument which we can rely on
rather than go to donors every year asking for food aid or
emergency assistance," said SADC food security organizer Reginald
Mugwara.
</P>
<P>
The fund, expected to be operational by March this year, is
expected to come from both governments and non-governmental
organization of the 12 SADC member states.
</P>
<P>
The money in the fund will not be intended for hand-outs, but
will be borrowed at concessionary interests to help member states
import food in drought years, according to Mugwara.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Rules On Listing Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China has come up with a new
set of rules on how companies are listed on the stock exchange,
putting stricter controls on their financial disclosures, new
stock pricing, and underwriting of shares.
</P>
<P>
"The rules are designed to protect investors from falsified
information and to encourage better performers to list," one
official with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the
industry's watchdog, explained.
</P>
<P>
Certified Public Accountants who mistakenly predict 10 to 20
percent higher earnings for a listed company will have to issue a
public apology to investors. It there is an intentional
miscalculation of above 20 percent, both the accountanting firm
and the evaluated company will have penalty levied by the
commission.
</P>
<P>
New stock prices will be based on average profits over the past
three years, rather than on an earnings forecast.
</P>
<P>
Shares held by employees of a listed company cannot be traded
for three years after the date of issue, and there is an average
limit of 5,000 shares per employee.
</P>
<P>
The nation's 300 key enterprises will be given top priority in
listing, as will companies that are using modern enterprise
systems, the rules say. Companies in the agriculture sector, and
basic energy, transportation, telecommunications, raw materials,
and high and new technology industries will be encouraged to list.
</P>
<P>
Listing of processing industries and commercial businesses will
be restricted, while the financial and real estate sector won't be
considered for fund raising through the stock market for now.

<HEADLINE> Acid Tolerant Bean on Experiment in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A productive seed variety of
the acid tolerant bean has been found in Africa and scientists
said it will be introduced on Uganda's soil.
</P>
<P>
local press reports quoted Charles Wortmann, a scientist of
Kampala's Kawanda Research Institute, as saying that the variety,
suitable to most soil of east and central Africa, had been
defined after a six-year extensive screening starting from 1990.
</P>
<P>
The seeds of the variety were acquired in Malawi and spread to
Rwanda as Lunze lubanga, a soil scientist responsible for the
job, gave some seeds to his wife for experiment in her garden,
which was proved very successful and welcomed by local farmers
who named it as "Mwa Sole".
</P>
<P>
The merit of acid tolerant "Mwa Sole" seeds is its bigger size
despite earlier definition that acid tolerant beans are
small-seed ones.
</P>
<P>
Acid soil is the main constraint to land productivity in most
parts of central and east africa. And researchers in different
countries including Uganda are at present doing more experiment
on the seeds.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Award Oil Contracts to Foreign Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to award foreign
companies two multi-million-dollar oil field contracts that could
provoke U.S. sanctions, state-owned English daily Tehran Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) will
award contracts to develop its Soroush and Balal offshore oil
fields by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a NIOC official as saying "final proposals
of the interested companies have been received by the NIOC and the
winners will be announced by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Seyed Jalilian, NIOC's director of offshore division, said
that European, Asian and Iranian companies are being considered
for the work at the two fields.
</P>
<P>
However, the official did not specify how many foreign
companies are taking part in the bidding to carry out
the development work at the offshore fields.
</P>
<P>
Last August, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a bill to
punish foreign companies which invest 40 million dollars or more
a year in Iran, which was accused by the U.S. of sponsoring
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate that contracts to develop Soroush and Balal
could total some 250 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies would get a return for their investment
under the NIOC's so-called buy-back formula which gives payment in
the form of oil and gas produced at the field.
</P>
<P>
Soroush, which was heavily damaged during the 1980-88
Iraq-Iran war, and the untapped Balal fields are set to
produce some 130,000 barrels of oil a day at the end of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
To thwart U.S. sanctions, the Iranian oil industry has
announced a total of 11 oil and gas projects worth at least 7
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that more than 120 foreign oil and gas companies
offered their bids for the Iranian oil and gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
Iran, with 92 billion barrels of crude oil reserves, is the
second largest oil exporter in the world. It pumps 3.6 million
barrels of oil and exports 2.5 million barrels of crude oil every
day.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry is the pillar of Iran's economy. Iran earns
about 16 billion to 18 billion dollars by exporting crude oil a
year, and the oil export revenue accounts for about 70 percent of
the total export of the country.

<HEADLINE> Players Protest Over Heat In Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Women players protested to the
Australian Open officials over the heat-wave conditions, delaying
a start to their matches in Melbourne on Monday.
</P>
<P>
With temperatures soaring to near 40 Celsius -- and over 50
Celsius on court -- a number of players sought to have the Extreme
Weather Conditions rule invoked which would have given them 10
minutes breaks between the second and third sets.
</P>
<P>
But tournament referee Peter Bellenger rejected their
arguments, saying it would be unfair for those who were forced to
play in equally hot conditions yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Top women's seed Steffi Graf and third seed Conchita Martinez
yesterday wilted in the conditions and both lost. Graf was
whisked away for treatment after she was defeated by Amanda
Coetzer in the 4th round match.
</P>
<P>
Belgian player Sabine Appelmans received treatment for more
than two hours and another player had to be placed on an
intravenous drip.
</P>
<P>
The men's players also complained about the hot wave. "It is
too hot, you can't run, if you do after 10 minutes you are dead,"
said Croatian third seed Goran Ivanisevic after he beat Norway's
Christian Ruud to reach the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Men's second seed Michael Chang also had difficulty in the
conditions, although not as much as his beaten opponent Andrei
Medvedev. Chang reached the quarter-final yesterday.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the tournament, which was played in
similar conditions, defending champion Boris Becker said he had
been scared to run at times during his match because he felt he
would tear the skin from his feet.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Australian Open moved from the grass courts
Kooyong to the new National Tennis Center in 1988, players have
complained about the heat generated on the concrete based Rebound
Ace courts.
</P>
<P>
Tournament officials would not budge from their "no relief"
stand when it comes to hot weather. The roof of the center court
stadium can be closed to protect the players, but tournament
 policy is that outdoor conditions should be maintained.

<HEADLINE> China Draws Rosy Picture for Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China has drawn a rosy picture
for its cultural development in the 21st century, saying it will
be a time for prosperity and greater social and economic
achievement.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan issued today concerning cultural
development by 2010, the sector should be put under the guidance
of the Party leadership in the next century and it must have an
explicitly socialist focus.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious outline, written by the Ministry of Culture,
states that a powerful management and operations mechanism will be
created in the sector, and that the funding channels set up for
cultural development will be greatly improved by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The plan stresses the expansion of cultural exchange between
the inland areas, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao, vowing to send more
artists to the territories and set up foundations to support the
activities.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the plan says, China will build an electronic
information network on the subject of culture, as well as a large
number of key theaters and museums that can reflect the country's
rising status in the world.
</P>
<P>
Cultural facilities will be built throughout the country, and
various forms of the arts and literature will engage in
competition. People can enjoy top-rated artistic performances and
other cultural works in a clean and healthy market.
</P>
<P>
The plan suggests that more cultural laws and regulations be
drafted, and that the sector should be more involved in beneficial
economic interests. People are expected to spend more money on
culture and become consumers of cultural goods.
</P>
<P>
It indicates that China's fine literature and arts should be
further spread around the world.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, China will cultivate 100 artistic
and literary masters and a number of experts who can administer
the sector well, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, another 500 historical sites will be included on
a list to receive state protection in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The outlines states that the cultural management system must
stay in line with the socialist market economy, meet the
requirements of socialist ethical and cultural progress, and be
governed by the laws of culture itself.
</P>
<P>
The sector's development in the next century must be guided by
Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, as well as Deng
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and it should follow other culture policies set
by the Party, such as "let a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred
schools of thought contend".
</P>
<P>
The outline urges Chinese people to carry forth the fine
tradition of their culture, and to import fine foreign
culture. Any decadent cultural element in the market must be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the outline will help create new splendor for
the 5,000-year-old Chinese civilization, and bring China into the
next century with a brand new image, said Liu Zhongde, Culture
Minister.

<HEADLINE> Government Army, Rebels Build up Forces in Mindanao, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Tension remains high in Buldon
town, Western Mindanao, as Philippine government troops and Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels are building up their
forces following heavy skirmishes there last week, official
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
At least six people, including two soldiers, died and several
others were wounded in last week's clashes triggered by an ambush
by 50 MILF rebels against government soldiers, who were setting up
checkpoints along the road to Buldon.
</P>
<P>
The official Philippine News Agency said today that no new
clashes were reported in Buldon during the past three days, but
shelling and sporadic bursts of gunfire could still be heard in
the area.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Noel Detoyato, a spokesman of the government
army, as denying that the shelling comes from government troops.
</P>
<P>
"It is the enemy that is mortar shelling our troops," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the deployment of additional government troops in Buldon,
Detoyato said that the military buildup is not intended for a new
offensive against the MILF but for "security purposes" only.
</P>
<P>
However, Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs,
was quoted by the agency as saying that government troops have
been continuously bombarding them with 105mm howitzers.
</P>
<P>
"The blasts do not come from mortars but from howitzers and we
do not have those kind of artillery. Only the government soldiers
have those," he said.
</P>
<P>
Murad also warned that unless immediate steps are taken to ease
the tension in the area, the on-going peace negotiations could be
adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF started peace talks and entered
into an informal truce earlier this month. The next round of peace
talks is scheduled for next month.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Scientists Perform Miracles in Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- They are known as the
magnificent seven -- young Chinese scientists who have performed
what experts described as nothing short of a miracle.
</P>
<P>
The seven from Gansu Province, northwest China, headed to the
inhospitable Gobi Desert in Tibet where the sand rules supreme.
</P>
<P>
But using scientific skills, the young scientists have
harvested crops, fruits and successfully introduced some 100 kinds
of flowers to create a thriving garden 3,890 meters above sea
level in desert on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Desert experts in Lanzhou, capital of Gansu Province, believe
that the young people from Lanzhou Institute of Desert Research of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences have created miracles by
establishing the world highest altitude desert demonstration zone.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have successfully grown maize, wheat, fruits,
melons and flowers directly in the Gobi desert and on an
artificial pasture in a 113-hectare desert demonstration zone.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1994, they have changed a desolate and uninhabited
area in Xigaze in the Tibet Autonomous Region, building canals,
levelling land, planting shelter forest, improving natural
grassland and developing ecological experimental areas.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has 210,000 hectares of land that has turned into desert
and is threatened by shifting sand and desertification, hindering
local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
After years' efforts, the seven young scientists have sought
the best time and best method for plant growing in the plateau's
Gobi desert.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in Tibet's history that trees have been
successfully planted in the rainy season. The survival rate of the
trees has reached 99 percent whereas the survival rate of trees
planted in the autumn months has reached 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
They also made a breakthrough in introducing water melons,
strawberries, melons and grapes, reaping a good harvest in the
same year of the planting. The fruits are big in size, sweet
tasting and high in water content.
</P>
<P>
The scientists also obtained a high wheat yield by applying
advanced technology in plastic sheet-covered wheat growing. The
wheat output reached 6,825 kg per hectare, 27.3 percent higher
with conventional methods.
</P>
<P>
The operation of the demonstration zone has aroused the
interest of many Tibetans living nearby. They volunteered to
participate in work in the zone to learn about the new technology.
</P>
<P>
The local government has decided to spread the technology to
other parts of the Gobi desert area starting from this year.

<HEADLINE> South China Region To Make Better Use Of Overseas Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in southwest China has said it will use more overseas
capital from large enterprises and financial groups for
infrastructure contruction and upgrading agricultural and
industrial technology.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Fulin, Secretary of the regional committee of the
Communist Party of China, says the region is encouraging overseas
investment for tapping oceanic resources, developing hi-tech
industry and tourism, and building housing.
</P>
<P>
Overseas funding is welcome as direct investment in
transforming large state enterprises technically and for producing
market-oriented products.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years the region has had imports and exports
worth 10 billion US dollars and has used just over 3 billion US
dollars worth of overseas capital. It had 6,301 registered
overseas-funded enterprises by the end of 1995.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa To Forge Closer Ties With Arab World: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would forge
closer ties with the Arab world instead of with Israel, according
to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
"The government would not follow the previous government's
policy of forging alliance with Israel and being hostile to the
Arab world," Mbeki told a press conference on Sunday at the end
of a three-day closed-door meeting of the ruling African National
Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
"The apartheid government's policy of dealing with Israel and
Arab states was incorrect," he stressed, referring to South
Africa's proposed sale of 638 million U.S. Dollars worth of tank
firing control systems to Syria.
</P>
<P>
The development had caused an international stir in the past
week.
</P>
<P>
"Why would there be an assumption that we should not market
our arms in Syria?" asked the South African deputy president.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki defended the controversial Syria arms deal, which he
said is still at a "very preliminary marketing stage", by saying
that South Africa is independent in forming and executing its own
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to cut its aid to South
Africa if it insists to go ahead with its arms sale to Syria, but
so far Johannesburg has been turning a deaf ear to the warning.

<HEADLINE> Thai Airways Denies Neglect of Safety Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior executive of Thai
Airways International (Thai) has denied that Thai has neglected
aviation safety standards.
</P>
<P>
Thamnoon Wanglee, president of Thai, insisted that his
company's safety record is up to standard.
</P>
<P>
He said Thai strictly follows the U.S. aviation standards and
its safety standards have been approved by the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA).
</P>
<P>
Thamnoon made these remarks when commenting on a report that
the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority was not happy with
Thai's safety measures.
</P>
<P>
However, a Bangkok Post report today quoted a Thai Airways
International source as saying that Australians' doubt about
Thai's safety standards are not totally groundless as the current
management of Thai, the national flag carrier, has not paid enough
attention to safety standards.
</P>
<P>
The source cited lack of a fair overtime pay system and lax
discipline among maintenance staff for the obvious result.
</P>
<P>
Thai is among airlines from 15 countries, mostly from Latin
America, which the Australians have given notice to improve their
air safety discipline and maintenance quality.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and the Philippines are the other two ASEAN members
on the Australian list.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen other international airlines have been banned from
operating in Australia as a penalty for not meeting the
authority's standards, which are based on an assessment by FAA,
the air safety regulator of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Flights to Australia are reportedly Thai's only profitable
long-haul services.
</P>
<P>
On European destinations, at a time when even European airlines
are running at a huge loss, Thai has only maintained its aviation
rights to wait for the European union's economy to pick up, the
Bangkok Post quoted a European airline's representative in
Thailand as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Thai lost its flights to four north American
destinations -- two each in the U.S. and Canada, because of low
profitability.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Kill Airport Runway Birds To Protect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Entebbe International
Airport is waging a campaign of wiping out birds on the runway
to put safety of human life ahead of environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
"Losing 300 lives of passengers in a plane crash is a greater
concern to the government. I want the birds to leave and go
somewhere. But when they approach the runway they should be
killed," Transport Minister John Nasasira said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The birds were reported to be originating from a fish landing
site near the airport where they carry fish wastes to eat on the
runway, while some were attracted to eat worms in the overgrown
grass on the runway.
</P>
<P>
On January 10, 1997, a Uganda Airline plane made an emergency
landing shortly after take-off when its engine sucked two marabou
stocks.

<HEADLINE> Mediation Meeting on Qatar-Bahrain Row Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A mediation committee of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has ended its 3rd meeting on
improving the Bahrain-Qatari row in the Qatari capital of Doha.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Arab Emirates' news agency reported
earlier today that during the meeting held Sunday, the committee
discussed a draft memorandum of understanding among the GCC member
states and a proposal on improving the relations between Qatar and
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
However, no details of the two documents have been released.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was convened after the mediation committee, which
groups Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,
failed to persuade the two neighbors to end their dispute over
the sovereignty of Hawar islands located in the Gulf in two
previous meetings held in Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
The committee left Doha shortly after the meeting and headed
for Bahrain for a two-day visit in a bid to continue its efforts
to help improve Bahraini-Qatari relations.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Qatar has been at odds over the Hawar islands for a
decade, Bahrain was angered after Qatar took the dispute to the
International Court of Justice in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two countries were further strained after
Bahrain accused two Qataris of spying and boycotted a GCC summit
held in Doha in December.

Haotian told his Congolese counterpart Francois Ayayen that he
believes Ayayen's current visit to China is bound to promote the
further development of friendship and cooperation between the two
countries and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also vice-chairman of the Central Military

various fields have been growing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
There has been further development in cooperation in political,
economic and cultural spheres in recent years, Chi said, adding
that the Chinese government and people value such a friendship
between China and Congo, and are willing to further promote
friendly cooperative relations on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit.

<P>
Ayayen said Congo and China have long-term, friendly and
cooperative ties which have stood the test of time, expressing the
hope that his current visit will further develop the relations
between the two nations and their militaries.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese government upholds the "One China" stance and
supports China's great cause of peaceful reunification, added
Ayayen.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Makes Progress in Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The foreign trade volume of
east China's Zhejiang Province soared 16.1 percent to hit 13.38
billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Of the total volume, export was valued at 9.33 billion US
dollars, 10.5 percent up from the previous year's figure, while
the import totalled 4.05 billion US dollars, a 31.5 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Export of overseas-funded or export-oriented firms made up 70
percent the province's total.
</P>
<P>
The province approved 1,208 overseas-funded enterprises last
year. Though the number of firms went down by 33.8 percent, the
volume of overseas funds absorbed increased by 20.9 percent at 1.5
billion US dollars, an all time high, said a local official.
</P>
<P>
Information about one-tenth of the newly-approved projects was
available on the Internet, which has made them more competitive in
international bidding.
</P>
<P>
Investment in 146 of the projects exceeded 10 million US
dollars for each.
</P>
<P>
The structure of overseas investment became more rational last
year. Investment in infrastructure and basic industries involved
a combined contractual value of 330 million US dollars, accounting
for 11 percent of Zhejiang's total contractual value, and setting
a record high.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka, India Strengthen Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The economic and trade ties
between Sri Lanka and India are expected to be further
strengthened as Indian External Affairs Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral arrived in Colombo Sunday to co-chair the third session of
the Indo-Sri Lanka Joint Commission.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have enjoyed closer economic and trade ties
ever since the establishment of the Commission in 1991 at
Colombo's proposal.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the Commission has played an active role,
through regular meetings, to enrich bilateral relations in all
dimensions -- economic, commercial, scientific, technical and
cultural.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka and India have witnessed larger volumes and wider
ranges of trade between them in recent years, reflecting
increasing business cooperation and commercial contacts. The
bilateral trade hit the historic record of 500 million U.S.
dollars in 1995-1996.
</P>
<P>
While India's exports to Sri Lanka constituted a large portion
of the two-way trade, there was a healthy trend indicating a
narrowing down of the trade gap, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
A number of Indian companies have been actively seeking to set
up joint ventures in Sri Lanka in areas of cement, steel,
pharmaceuticals and hospital projects.
</P>
<P>
A new joint venture -- Kiriya Milk Industries -- is being
created as part of the cooperation efforts in the dairy industry
in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis of the bilateral trade has been moving from
commodities to software technology and computer programming.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, the two countries will soon
enter into an agreement on the construction of a ground receiving
station after India provided radiosonde equipment to Sri Lanka,
</P>
<P>
At Colombo's request, the Indian government gave Sri Lanka 100
computers and accessories worth about 250,000 U.S. dollars last
September.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the computers, installed in 10 centers
across the island country, are making available otherwise costly
computer education to the needy sections of the Sri Lanka society.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in tourism is also booming. Sri Lanka's Tourist
Board opened a branch office in New Delhi last year as the board
expects tourist traffic from India to be an important contribution
to narrowing the trade gap between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A 40-member delegation of Indian tourism operators visited
Colombo last August and discussed with their Sri Lankan
counterparts ways to enhance cooperation and make tourism travel
between the two countries more attractive and affordable.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Sri Lankans visit India every year for
pilgrimages, medical treatment, education and business.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' national flag carriers -- the Indian
Airlines and the Air Lanka -- have agreed on Air Lanka's using the
excess capacity of Indian Airlines on a commercial basis.
</P>
<P>
Several private Indian airlines have entered into commercial
agreements with travel agents in Sri Lanka for bookings and
reservations, paving the way for more people-to-people contacts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and United Nations
experts will discuss strategies to help young girls in China's
poverty-stricken areas at a seminar scheduled to open next month
in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the China Children and Teenagers' Fund (CCTF)
said here today that officials from the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) would hear reports on China's work in the adoption
of newborn girls, crackdown of child-kidnapping, social protection
of orphans, and the nutrition and education of poor girls.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Shuqin, deputy secretary of CCTF, said that fund sponsors
hope the money will work successfully to protect young girls'
rights, provide health care and education for young girls, and
offer social support for young girls' growth.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will be sponsored by UNICEF and organized by CCTF
and the All-China Women's Federation. UNICEF officials plan to
brief participants on the situation of young girls in the world's
poor areas.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics, 2.1 million girls between the
ages of seven and 11, most of them living in rural or remote and
poor areas, have poor chances to go to school. In China, two out
of every three dropouts are girls.
</P>
<P>
The CCTF launched the "Spring Bud" Plan in 1992 to help these
girls, raising funds from at home and abroad to put them in
school. Since it was launched, the program has aided about 430,000
girls.

<HEADLINE> "Spring Bud Project" to Help More Girl School Dropouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The "Spring Bud Project,"
sponsored by the China Children and Teenagers' Fund, will help
50,000 more young female school dropouts this year, according to
an official with the fund.
</P>
<P>
Fund sponsors plan to collect seven million yuan (840,000 US
dollars) to help 150,000 poor girls across the country receive
their elementary education, said Cheng Shuqin, the deputy
secretary of the fund.
</P>
<P>
Each year, when the 50,000 girls who are benefiting from the
project graduate from primary school, the fund will select another
50,000 dropouts to support, she said.
</P>
<P>
Sponsors will also set up a special fund this year to provide
professional training for the poverty-stricken girls who have
already graduated from the primary schools, said Cheng.
</P>
<P>
Since its beginning in 1992, the project has helped more than
300,000 girl dropouts in 28 provinces, cities and autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
But insufficient funding is still a major problem for the
project: the young people's fund received 3.63 million yuan
(440,000 US dollars) in donations last year, which was far from
enough.
</P>
<P>
The head of the fund has called on people from all walks of
life and social organizations both at home and overseas to
actively support the "Spring Bud Project."

<HEADLINE> Flowers Bring Sweet Scented Riches to Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Flowers have provided the sweet
scent of success in Shandong Province, a major grain producer in
east China.
</P>
<P>
Flower growing has blossomed so much in recent years that it
has now become one of the five key agricultural industries in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Xin Yunyan, head of the Shandong Flower Association, told
Xinhua that his province has grown nearly 10,000 hectares of
flowers with the gross output reaching 47.5 million U.S. dollars
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He added that the flower growing acreage will be increased to
13,000 hectares, with an annual output value of 187 million
dollars by 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said the booming of the industry is attributed to the
improvement in people's living and cultural standards.
</P>
<P>
The Shandong provincial government believed that flower growing
had a great potential, and listed it as one of the five key
industries in its agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has built five flower growing bases
according to plan. They include the Heze peony and Chinese
herbaceous peony base, Weifang azalea base, Pingyin rose base,
Laizhou Chinese rose base, and Pingyi honeysuckles base.
</P>
<P>
Heze has become China's biggest peony production and sales
center with 133 hectares of peony growing area.
</P>
<P>
The province has also developed more than 20 items of new
technology in flower growing and flower land management, and
applied research findings in its flower bases.
</P>
<P>
With traditional peony growing methods, the flower usually
blossoms from mid-April, but by using the flower-accelerating
technology, it can blossom during the Spring Festival, the most
important holiday in China which usually falls in February.
</P>
<P>
A number of farmers have become rich by growing flowers. Li
Hongru, a flower grower in Huanglou town, Qingzhou city, started
growing flowers in 1981, and now has become manager of the
privately-run Shandong Wanhong Flower Company with 320 employees.
</P>
<P>
His company has grown 21 hectares of flowers of various kinds
and built up a flower trade hall of 16,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, his company realized 500,000 U.S. dollars worth of
profits and taxes.
</P>
<P>
His son and daughter, who were employees of state-own
enterprises, gave up their jobs and help him run the company.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka May Agree to Major Demand of Tribal Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
considering to form a regional council instead of the present
three local government councils in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) to
meet the major demand of that area's tribal rebels, informed
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist Chakma rebels, named as Shanti Bahini, have been
fighting a bush war since 1973 for autonomy of the resource-rich
hill forests in southeast Bangladesh bordering India and Burma.
</P>
<P>
The new government of Sheikh Hasina has held two rounds of
talks since last December with the Parbatya Chattagram Jana
Sanghati Samity (PCJSS), the political wing of the Shanti Bahini.
</P>
<P>
The PCJSS in their five-point demand seeks autonomy for the
regional council of the CHT and expulsion of Muslim settlers from
the plains.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks is expected to be held on January 25
in the capital city of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting in Dhaka is the manifestation of the confidence
that has been built between the two sides recently, about the
possibility of resolving the problem," said an official from the
special affairs division, which is in charge of the CHT affairs.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Scoops 300 Million Dollars From Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania earned 322.38
million U.S. Dollars last year from 326,194 foreign tourists,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Principal Tourist Information Officer of the Tanzania Tourist
Board (TTB), Jnhnson Manase, told reporters Sunday that this
registered an increase of 32,360 tourists as compared to the
previous year when 293,834 visited the country and brought in
258.14 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We have improved the promotion effort by increasing our
participation in international tourism fairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Manase said that previously Tanzania had no publicity office
abroad and that is why the number of visitors who came into the
country was very little compared to the number of attractions
found in the country.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, Tanzania is expected to receive 495,950
tourists and earn about 799.64 million Dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Manase urged the government to increase fund
allocations to TTB to enable it fulfil its plans which include
advertising Tanzania abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 2.2 million citizens
of Changzhou and people in its surrounding areas in north China's
Hebei Province will no longer have to put up with a high fluorine
content in their drinking water thanks to the building of the
Dalangdian Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir, some 20 kilometers south of the city, began
storing water Sunday from the Yellow River via the Grand Cannel.
</P>
<P>
With the sharp decrease in surface water resources, Changzhou
was forced to explore large amounts of non-tested water
underground for daily use in local households, industrial and
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 300,000 local people were poisoned by varying
levels of fluorine.
</P>
<P>
Concerned with local residents' health, the provincial and city
governments started construction of the reservoir in February of
1995, using 380 million yuan (47.5 million U.S. dollars) of funds.
</P>
<P>
It is one of China's largest reservoirs in the plain area, with
the water storage capacity of 100 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
It can annually provide 52.6 million cubic meters of water for
household use and industrial production.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALTAY (Xinjiang), January 20 (Xinhua) -- Hungry wolves and
harsh weather are responsible for the deaths of more than 1,500
rare animals in the Altay Prefecture of northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Of the dead animals, 30 species are listed under second-class
state protection. Officials said wolf attacks have increased as a
result of heavy snowstorms over the past 10 days which have cut
off most of the food sources in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
The number of red deer is decreasing due to cold, starvation
and the wolf killings. Twenty red deer have been found dead in the
Gobi Desert.
</P>
<P>
Severe weather has weakened more than 100 Mongolian wild
donkeys and gazelles, which are under the top state protection.
</P>
<P>
To guide wildlife protection, the regional government has set
up a special group to visit areas where wild animals have been
trapped by heavy snows.
</P>
<P>
Wildlife protection authorities have warned that large numbers
of the rare animals will die if they remain in the area much
longer.

<P>
SHANGHAI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The UN Global environment
Facility (GEF) will set aside 30 million US dollars for setting up
an efficient industrial boiler project in China.
</P>
<P>
An official with the country's industrial boiler association
has disclosed that the nine-item project's goal is to improve the
environment by introducing advanced technology, improving thermal
efficiency of boilers, and reducing environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the need for industrial boilers will
increase by three to eight percent annually to keep up with rapid
development. But, traditional coal boilers cause severe pollution
and they need to be replaced. In some cities in China, gas boilers
have taken the place of coal ones.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will get some foreign boiler manufactures to
come to China to cooperate with China's boiler industry.
</P>
<P>
The Third International Exhibition of Boilers, Subsidiary
Engines and Equipment is scheduled for Shanghai in November.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Political Interests Leave Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Congress resumes
its regular session today after a four-week Christmas recess, but
differences in political interests between the two chambers are
likely to leave the country without a 1997 budget for another one
or two weeks.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, a national budget is normally passed by the
House of Representatives and the Senate in time for the president
to sign it into law well before the beginning of the budget year
on January 1.
</P>
<P>
But this year, the congress ran into trouble over the budget as
the House of Representatives has refused to accept the cuts in the
Countrywide Development Funds proposed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock over the budget shows that the campaign fever has
already taken hold of the congress even though the general
elections are still 17 months away, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippines' constitution, members of the House of
Representatives are elected through local congressional districts
while senators are elected on a national basis.
</P>
<P>
As the representatives' popularity usually depends on budget
allocations for infrastructure funds for their districts, they
have to use the Countrywide Development Funds, or "pork barrels,"
to ensure their re-election.
</P>
<P>
However, for the senators, they rely more on campaign donations
than on pork barrels to get re-elected.
</P>
<P>
To seek their own political interests, members of the two
chambers have taken different stances on the pork barrels.
</P>
<P>
The Senate has proposed a 40-percent cut in the allocation for
the Countrywide Development Funds. But the House has rejected the
Senate's proposal, and is pushing for a 12.5-million-peso (470,000
U.S. dollars) pork barrel for each congressman, instead of the
7.5-million-peso (280,000 U.S. dollars) fund proposed by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
Senator Ernesto Herrera, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, told reporters recently that he believed the House
could eventually accept the Senate version of the budget because
the representatives will suffer more with the elections just
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain our position that we will not restore the cut
unless they (representatives) can convince us that the restoration
would result in the greater good of the public," he said.
</P>
<P>
But his counterpart in the House of Representatives, Rolando
Andaya, thinks otherwise. "Why cut these funds which have been
included in the president's budget? The president has approved
this. It did not come out of thin air," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock over the 1997 budget may continue until either the
Senate or the House makes a concession, which means that the
government is not likely to get a new budget soon, the analysts
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Philippine law secures a reallocation of the
previous year's budget funds if no new budget has been approved,
so salaries and other recurring expense are being covered.
</P>
<P>
But without a national budget, no funds for the nation's new
projects can be released, threatening to delay 20 billion pesos
(759 million U.S. dollars) of domestic and foreign-funded
infrastructure spending.
</P>
<P>
Economists here warned that the budget deadlock may delay some
projects by five to eight weeks and push them close to the rainy
season, which could drastically increase costs.
</P>
<P>
In a worst case scenario, they said, this could mean a
100-billion peso (3.8 billion U.S. dollars) or roughly
five-percent drop in the country's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The budget deadlock has aroused strong reactions in the
country. Some critics said that as the pork barrel gives the
incumbent congressmen a huge and unfair advantage over their
challengers, congressmen are seeking their own interest at the
expense of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
With members of the congress showing no signs of making a
compromise, the budget is unlikely to be passed before the end of
this month, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Electronics Sector Up 9 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's electronics
industry recorded a positive growth of 9 percent in 1996 despite a
year of flux on the international market, with the output totaling
around 45.1 billion U.S. dollars, the Economic Development Board
(EDB) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The country's electronics industry is expected to further grow
this year in line with global expectations, said the EDB, a
government statutory board established in 1961 to spearhead the
industrialization drive through investment promotion in
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Value Added, a more significant indicator of the
health of the electronics industry, recorded an increase of 12
percent or about 12.14 billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The industry's fixed asset investment commitment for 1996 is
estimated at about 2.43 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of about
33 percent over the 1.79 billion U.S. dollars recorded in 1995,
said the EDB.
</P>
<P>
The data storage and office automation sectors of Singapore's
electronics industry posted a record output of 13.07 billion U.S.
dollars and 3.79 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, up by 29 percent
and 40 percent respectively, it added.
</P>
<P>
"The moderate growth of the electronics industry in Singapore
in 1996 was a result of a slowdown in the global semiconductor
industry being offset by the strong growth in data storage and
office automation equipment," the EDB commented.
</P>
<P>
This reflects the balancing effects of the various
sub-clusters, which need further diversification, to reduce
negatives of the industry's "boom and bust" cycles, it added.
</P>
<P>
This moderating effect is anticipated to remain a
characteristic of the electronics industry in the future, the EDB
said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Produce 230,000 Santana Cars This year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will produce 230,000
Santana cars in 1997, and expects to chalk up 35 billion yuan in
sales volume.
</P>
<P>
The city made 200,000 Santana cars last year and sold 196,000,
with the market share of Santana cars standing at 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai started its car-manufacturing industry in 1956 and had
altogether produced 47,000 Shanghai-brand cars by 1985, when
Shanghai Volkswagen Corporation, a Sino-German joint venture, was
established and became operational.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the joint venture had produced 746,000
Santana cars, including 104,000 Santana-2000 type luxury cars made
last year.
</P>
<P>
The corporation has continued to adjust its product mix
according to market demands and has worked to improve product
quality, reduce production cost, and perfect marketing and
after-sale service networks -- all designed to help the company
maintain an edge in China's fiercely competitive car market.
</P>
<P>
According to a company executive, the localization ratio of
common type Santana cars is 90 percent, and 80 percent for the
Santana-2000 luxury type cars. The joint venture now has 113
dealerships and has established 332 repair centers across the
country.
</P>
<P>
To expand its market, the company has invested heavily in
building a modern storage and transport system. In addition to the
existing eight freight trains, four ships for shipping service on
the Yangtze River and three ocean-going vessels, the company will
soon purchase two more freight trains and import another sea
vessel to increase its annual storage and transport capacity to
300,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's car-manufacturing industry has helped the
development of related sectors in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The company now has 150 members for the localization of the
Santana cars and 230 factories from across the country have
provided it with spare parts needed in the production of Santana
cars. The annual output value of such auxiliary services is 15
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
All spare parts suppliers are expected to pass the ISO9002
international quality guarantee certification test this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Explains Sino-African Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-African friendship was
well established and is smoothly developing, said Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, commenting on his
last week's visit to five African countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here on Saturday for an official goodwill
visit to Portugal, paid official visits to the African nations of
Niger, Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe, Mauritania and
Cape Verde last week.
</P>
<P>
Qian told reporters of Xinhua News Agency and the Central
Television Station (CCTV) that what impressed him the most during
his tour of Africa was that these countries are enjoying stable
domestic situation and prosperous economic development after five
to six years of turbulence caused by the change of the
international situation.
</P>
<P>
Now, African countries are continuing their efforts to seek
their own political system and developing road according to their
own specific situation, Qian added.
</P>
<P>
African countries expressed their appreciation of China's
attention to them and welcomed China's position that all nations,
no matter big or small, rich or poor, are equal, he said.
</P>
<P>
African nations are expecting more effective assistance from
the international community, rather than intervention in their own
internal affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about China's principle position about the election of
the secretary-general of the United Nations, Qian said that the
result was fair.
</P>
<P>
A secretary-general from Africa, a continent of more than 50
countries, should enjoy the same right as those from other regions
to serve two terms, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
The election of Kofi Annan as the U.N. secretary-general showed
that the international community has confidence in and
expectations of Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the resumption of the diplomatic relations between China
and Niger and Taiwan's diplomatic efforts in this region, Qian
said that he is satisfied about the smooth development of the
Sino-Niger relations on a new basis and is optimistic about the
future of the relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past few years, the Taiwan authorities took
the advantages of the economic difficulties of some of the African
countries to exchange money for diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
The real aim of the Taiwan authorities is to split China rather
than to develop economic and trade relations with these African
countries, let alone to offer economic assistance to them.
</P>
<P>
The attempt of the Taiwan authorities will lead to nowhere when
the African countries realized its real purpose, Qian added.

<P>
HANGZHOU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang province
has 264 centenarians, two of whom are 107 years old, according to
a recent survey by a research center.
</P>
<P>
This is 54.5 percent more than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The elderly people seem to have five things in common:
</P>
<P>
First, harmonious families and children and grandchildren who
show filial piety; most live with four generations under one roof
and have good family relations.
</P>
<P>
Second, they have good habits, such as getting up early and
going to bed early, getting sufficient sleep and regular exercise.
</P>
<P>
Third, they have a good diet, eating three meals a day at fixed
times of light food; most are vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, most are optimistic and broad-minded.
</P>
<P>
Last, a good and unpolluted environment, usually in mountains
or near the seashore, where they breathe fresh air.
</P>
<P>
China has 110 million people at or above the age of 60, and the
number is growing at an annual rate of 3.32 percent. By the end of
the century, China will become a society of aging people, with the
elderly accounting for more than 10 percent of the world's total.

<HEADLINE> Evacuees Back to Indonesian Volcano Despite Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of evacuees have
returned to their homes on the slopes of the Merapi volcano in
Indonesia's Central Java province, ignoring danger warnings by the
authorities, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Officials said about 15,000 evacuees from four villages in
Klaten district all returned home by late Saturday and started to
clean up the ashes.
</P>
<P>
Scores of men and women even returned to their daily chores in
the hamlets of Turgo although lava continued to spew from the
2,968-meter high rim of the volcano, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The highest settlements are some four kilometers from the peak,
said officials.
</P>
<P>
Turgo was one of the hardest hit places when Merapi erupted in
1994, killing more than 60 people and forcing thousands to flee.
</P>
<P>
By the time of the report, experts still maintained the highest
warning level of the "alert" status for Merapi, which erupted last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that the unstable lava topping the crater,
estimated at around 1.3 million cubic meters, could break up at
any time.
</P>
<P>
There was no official report on casualties but unconfirmed
reports said six people went missing last Friday when Merapi
erupted.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's 17,000 islands are dotted by some 500 volcanoes, of
which 127 are still active and make up the Pacific rim of fire.
</P>
<P>
Merapi is one of the most active volcanoes in the world.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Cultural Conditions for Rural Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice-minister of
culture has stressed that the country will have to work harder to
offer cultural activities to a large number of children in
poverty-stricken villages who have limited access to such
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 "Culture Gardens" will be created by the year 2000 at
the village or township level, in an attempt to provide rural
children with entertainment facilities, films, books, sports and a
means of education.
</P>
<P>
Each "garden" will cover a floor space of several thousand
square meters and serve as a cultural center in the region.
</P>
<P>
"China has 370 million children, and 80 percent of them live in
rural areas, distant mountainous areas or ethnic minority
regions. Their cultural undertakings are quite backward," the
Vice-Minister of Culture Li Yuanchao said at an annual work
meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the youngsters do not have enough places where
they can engage in cultural activities. They also read few books,
watch few films, and have no effective channels to enjoy modern
entertainment as their urban counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture has been carrying out a program called
the "Dandelion Project" to help battle these difficulties. So far,
21 experimental culture spots have been set up in 18 provinces and
autonomous regions. Another 28 are being constructed, with an
investment of more than 100 million yuan (12 million US Dollars)
allocated from the government budget.
</P>
<P>
Li also urged that practical systems through which kids can be
exposed to culture be created in most counties and villages by
2000, which will be directly providing services to rural children,
including regular film screenings and artistic performances.

<HEADLINE> Debt Service Ratio Drops to All-Time Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' debt service
burden declined to an all-time low of 11.6 percent last year, an
indication that the management of the country's debt has improved
over the years.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson was quoted
today by local press as saying that "in other words, the country's
capacity to pay grew at much rapid pace than the growth in the
foreign debt".
</P>
<P>
The debt service burden, or the ratio of foreign debt payments
to total export earnings, is an important indicator being looked
at by foreign investors and creditors as well as international
credit rating agencies as it shows the country's ability to pay
its maturing foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Singson credited the improvement in the debt service to the
robust growth of the country's exports industry during the past
few years, which steadily sliced the ratio from a staggering 38
percent in 1982 to 11.6 percent of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Statistics Office, exports in
November grew by a record high of 30 percent, with the
January-November surge hitting 18 percent to 18.66 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Singson said, the country's foreign debt problem is
still worrisome. He added that it had totaled 37.9 billion U.S.
dollars as of June last year according to the latest data
available.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Tides of Rural Migrants to Shenzhen Ebbing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Spring Festival is
approaching, but at the Shenzhen Railway Station it's business as
usual -- unlike past years, when shoulder-to-shoulder crowds of
rural passengers squeezed onto trains to hurry home for the
Chinese people's most important holiday of the year.
</P>
<P>
The vanguard city of China's reform and opening, which first
attracted the "gold rush" of rural workers from across the rest of
the country, has been the first to see a change in the tide of
travel.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen observers attributed the phenomenon of fewer travelers
to the fact that the country's wealthiest city has adjusted its
industrial structure to dramatically reduce its need for unskilled
workers. And the central government's program for the
trans-regional migration of rural laborers has also contributed to
the lower numbers.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, the narrowed economic gap between coastal
areas and inland provinces makes Shenzhen a less-coveted
destination, say officials and experts in Shenzhen and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
After Shenzhen, formerly a fishing town bordering Hong Kong,
was chosen as China's first special economic zone in the 1980s to
experiment with reform and opening, it instantly became an ideal
site for millions of fortune-hunters in the country, including a
large proportion of farmers.
</P>
<P>
In less than three years since 1985, over one million people
across the country flocked there, "causing extreme pressure on the
new city's ability to maintain its public order, public
transportation and public health infrastructure," said Huang
Jingrong, a labor official with the Shenzhen government.
</P>
<P>
A farmer from the inland province of Sichuan clearly recalls
his experiences. "After each Spring Festival, all the railway
stations and ports are packed with passengers heading south," he
said. "Nearly everybody took for granted that once you were in
Shenzhen, you were bound to make a fortune even by picking up
garbage."
</P>
<P>
However, of the scores of his fellow Sichuan citizens who came
to Shenzhen, only a few stayed on. The others returned home,
disappointed.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Tides of Rural Migrants to Shenzhen Ebbing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To curb the random population in-flow, the local government in
1990 created a work permit system and asked newcomers to pay for
their right to residence here.
</P>
<P>
When the tides of rural workers spread to other parts of the
country, the central government introduced Shenzhen's successful
practices to them. And later on, Shenzhen drafted a local law
which proclaimed that anyone who intends to work there must have
at least nine years of compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
Starting from last year, the labor-intensive industries in
Shenzhen have been replaced by the industries of communications,
information and others which are capital and technology
intensive. Migrant workers with limited educational backgrounds
have to work elsewhere, the Shenzhen labor official Huang said.
</P>
<P>
And at the same time, the central government's national program
to oversee the orderly migration of rural laborers also helped to
ease the pressure on Shenzhen, said Zhang Xuwu, a researcher with
the Labor Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, now in full swing across the country, rural
surplus laborers must be organized by local governments to work
elsewhere, in accordance with the needs of labor markets. Most of
them are encouraged to work in township enterprises near their
homes.
</P>
<P>
The increased investments to inland areas in recent years, and
especially the township enterprises that are springing up
everywhere, have helped create more job opportunities for the
rural laborers, said an official with the State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Investments by the central government, overseas businessmen and
coastal areas to the inland provinces in 1996 jumped by more than
18 percent over the previous year, and township enterprises have
taken in 126 million workers, accounting for over half of the
surplus laborers in the country, statistics from the bureau show.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the registered rural laborers in Shenzhen have
decreased sharply from three million in 1994 to 1.79 million in
1995; the number is much less in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"My fellow citizens no longer think Shenzhen is the only place
to make a fortune," the farmer from Sichuan said. "Some are
becoming better-off without leaving home."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Establishes Water Conservancy Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Traditional water conservancy
in Shanghai has been expanded to function as a network covering
urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
An official at Shanghai water conservancy bureau says that,
with 464 kilometers of seawall, 208 kilometers of flood prevention
wall, and 2,300 kilometers of embankments as a major part of flood
control work, the water conservancy network has played its role in
every flood season.
</P>
<P>
An electronically-controlled Shanghai flood prevention
automatic measuring system was put into use in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, the 6,700 electrically run irrigation and
drainage pumping stations, with 275,000 kw of power, have
irrigated almost all cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
An expert in water conservancy pointed out that the water
conservancy network in Shanghai has delivered a means of solving
the problems of flood, drinking water quality and water
environment.
</P>
<P>
Water conservancy functions have multiplied alongside flood
prevention work, and a water conservancy tourism market has
emerged. The aim of Shanghai water conservancy network is to set a
water environment control system.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, US Settle Dispute Over Garments Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Washington and Manila have
finally reached a resolution on the long-drawn trade dispute over
the United States' new rules of origin affecting the Philippines'
garments export sector.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines accepted the United States' offer of increasing
the country's garments quota by 50 million U.S. dollars, instead
of the 40 million U.S. dollars provided earlier, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Trade Secretary Cesar Bautista was quoted as saying
that "We are happy to have reached a satisfactory solution on the
issue".
</P>
<P>
According to him, the settlement spares critical export
products such as jeans from the rules, but provides non-critical
sectors like manufacturers of polyester and shirt products no
reprieve.
</P>
<P>
However, Bautista expressed optimism the affected sectors would
be flexible enough to produce other export-oriented garments and
textile products and thus, surviving the change in rules.
</P>
<P>
The rules of origin, which was implemented by Washington last
July, stipulated that finished garments exported to the US would
be credited against the quota of the country which manufactured
the fabric.
</P>
<P>
The rules sent the Philippines' garments industry into a
tailspin, threatening to wipe out the whole industry because most
manufacturers in the sector depend on raw materials from other
countries or regions.
</P>
<P>
Its ill effects on the economy became evident when the
country's garments exports to the US went on a steady decline last
year, with total shipments to quota countries including the US,
European Union and Canada slowing down by an average of 5.4
percent to 1.9 billion U.S. dollars as of end-November 1996.
</P>
<P>
The settlement on the dispute had eluded the Philippine
government for months. Last year, it raised a protest over the
U.S. rules before the Textile Mediation Board of the World Trade
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Beijingers to Have More "Comfortable Housing" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has completed a total
of 600,000 square meters of "comfort housing" last year, reported
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government expected to build another 600,000
square meters of the same type of housing this year, said Xu
Yinpei, chief architect of Beijing Urban Development and
Construction Corp.
</P>
<P>
The "Comfort Housing Project" is a government program aimed at
building more houses for low- and medium-income, and poorly housed
urban residents.
</P>
<P>
It is an important step in China's housing reform program,
which helps increase the living space of those with less than four
square meters of space per person, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project in Beijing's northeastern
suburbs of Wangjing Town was completed last week.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that nearly 9,000 residents will move into new
flats by the end of the June when additional interior decorating
-- which was delayed because of cold weather -- is finished, Xu
said.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 1.5 hectares, the current largest plan of
the project in the city can provide 260,000 square meters of
housing.
</P>
<P>
The project's design has been recognized as the best in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
All 260,000 square meters of housing are heavily subsidized by
the local government. Sales of these houses will be managed by the
local government instead of real estate and other commercial
companies, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's housing reform, workers are encouraged to
buy the flats they occupy, which state-owned enterprises sell at
below cost.
</P>
<P>
Preferential prices will be fixed by the local government. It
is estimated that a suite of 70 square meters could cost residents
140,000 yuan (16,870 US dollars), Xu said.
</P>
<P>
In the past 18 years, Beijing has built a dozen residential
districts. Housing projects like Tuanjie, Jinsong, Shuangyushu and
Fangzhuang have been completed, while dilapidated houses in
downtown area have been renovated.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Protests Moscow Mayor's Unfriendly Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The unfriendly remarks made by
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov on the Sevastopol issue cast a shadow
over the relations between Ukraine and Russia, the Ukrainian
Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
When visiting the city of Sevastopol on January 17, Luzhkov
said "Sevastopol was, is and will always be Russian territory."
</P>
<P>
"Such remarks made by Russian officials, including Luzhkov,
will be never acceptable," the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
What the Moscow mayor said would spoil Ukraine's territorial
integrity, which has been recognized by the international
communities, including Russia, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
Sevastopol, the major base of the Black Sea Fleet, has been
claimed both by Moscow and Kiev after the collapse of the former
Soviet Union in 1991. The dispute has worsened the bilateral ties
since legislators quarreled over the status of Sevastopol in
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the note, the ministry reminded Moscow of the
necessity to maintain normal relations and to avoid similar
remarks in the future.

<HEADLINE> New Record for China's Shipbuilding Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China built 1.9 million tons of
ships in 1996, hitting a new record in annual shipbuilding output,
latest statistics from the China State Shipbuilding Corporation
(CSSC) show.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.6 million tons of vessels were exported last year
to countries and regions including Norway, Hong Kong, Iran,
Canada, Japan, and Singapore, accounting for 84.7 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
Another 330,000 tons of ships went under construction in 1996,
and the building work is continuing this year, corporation
authorities say.
</P>
<P>
The CSSC had shipbuilding orders of 146 vessels with a combined
capacity of 2.27 million tons. Included were 81 export ships,
totalling 1.32 million tons, and 49 ships for domestic customers,
with a combined 950,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the corporation signed contracts of ship products
with an aggregate value of more than 14 billion yuan, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the amount of shipbuilding orders for CSSC was a bit
lower than in 1995, when the figure reached 2.48 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the overall performance of the world shipbuilding
market, the CSSC still became more competitive in 1996," said Li
Junfeng, an engineer of the Production Bureau of CSSC.
</P>
<P>
Two large shipbuilders, Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK),
started a "price-cutting war" in 1996. Japan took advantage of the
drop in the Japanese yen's exchange rate to accept large
quantities of shipbuilding orders, and the ROK also took measures
against the move.
</P>
<P>
As a result, competition in the international shipbuilding
market became more fierce, increasing the difficulty for CSSC to
accept orders, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the negative factors, the CSSC still reports
further expansion of its international market, with countries such
as France and Switzerland placing orders for ships for the first
time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the contractual value of CSSC's export
vessels reached a combined 1.45 billion US dollars in 1996.

CANBERRA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- The states and territories will tell Prime Minister John
Howard to pare back native title rights to traditional hunting and
fishing rights in a plan that will increase federal and state
compensation bills substantially.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The blowtorch was applied to Steffi Graf from every
angle--from above, in temperatures of 36 degrees; from below,
where the surface of the Melbourne Park center court was 10-15
degrees higher; and from within, as the countdown to her father's
court verdict on tax evasion charges continued. Finally the world
No.1 wilted at 4:35 p.m. yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- The civility that binds our social culture is crumbling on
Australia's roads. Aggressive driving, so-called road rage, is
getting worse, according to experts, and has reached the point
where the Transport Accident Commission feels compelled to act.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Commonwealth assistance to the pharmaceuticals industry is

protection to develop new drugs under a radical Federal Government
plan to be considered by the Cabinet next month.

<HEADLINE> Sacrificial Horses Unearthed in Central Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists unearthed
36 sacrificial horses dating back to the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770
B.C. -- 256 B.C.) in the past two months in the city of Luoyang,
bringing the total number of these kinds of horses to more than
100.
</P>
<P>
The skeletons of horses were found in four ancient tombs in the
suburbs of Luoyang, which was the capital of the Eastern Zhou. The
largest tomb, which is three-meters deep and 60 sq.m. in area,
contains 24 horses. Archeologists found all the horses in the tomb
were facing south in four rows to form an honor guard.
</P>
<P>
Another 10 horses in a neighboring tomb were also arranged in
ranks.
</P>
<P>
Nine sacrificial horse tombs have been discovered so far in the
city, the largest of which has 32 horses.
</P>
<P>
A number of pieces of pottery, personal ornaments made of clam
shell and bronze, and animal bone pipes were also discovered in
the tombs.
</P>
<P>
Very close to the horses' burial place, a mausoleum of the
Eastern Zhou Dynasty was excavated, and a great number of
bronzeware, such as tripods, swords, knives, and dagger-axes
discovered.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists say that the horses were a burial offering of the
city's aristocrats, who lived in an age of belief in supernatural
powers worship and sacrifice of live victims.

<HEADLINE> South China Improving Environment for Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGDONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province, next to Hongkong, is focusing efforts on improving the
environment for tourism instead of construction for "Visit
China '97".
</P>
<P>
During a meeting on tourism recently, Guangdong's Vice-Governor
Liu Weiming pointed out that an obstacle hindering further growth
in tourism is no longer inadequate tourist facilities and scenic
spots as it was in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Why can Hongkong and Singapore attract so many tourists? It's
because of their ideal service and friendly environment," the
vice-governor pointed out, urging the province to consider
improving the environment a long-term goal.
</P>
<P>
Lu Weixiong, the director of the provincial Tourism Bureau,
called on the tourist agencies to make an effort to upgrade
service.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Guangdong had 6.9 million overseas tourists, a rise
of 10.1 percent over the previous year, of which 1.3 million were
foreign tourists, an increase of 10.2 percent, and earned 2.6
billion US dollars from international tourism.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Condemns Ethiopian Attack on Its Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Sudan today renewed its
condemnation of Ethiopia's attacks on its land amid reports of
days of massive military buildups on its southern border.
</P>
<P>
The attacks violated the principles of good neighborliness and
the provisions of the Organization of African Unity and the UN
Charter, said a statement of the Sudanese Foreign Ministry
released by the Sudanese Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned Ethiopia against the consequences of its
adventures and the its threats to the security and safety of the
African continent.
</P>
<P>
It appealed to the international community to stand witness to
Ethiopia's breach of the related principles and conventions.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has also accused Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda of
supporting its rebel forces, but all the three countries have
turned down the charge.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has poor relationship with neighboring countries. The
Cairo-Khartoum ties were cool since Egypt accused Sudan of having
orchestrated the 1995 failed attempt on the life of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and granting asylum to Egyptian extremists.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Mubarak Saturday has refused to offer support to
Khartoum and interfere in the current crisis, a request made by
Sudanese Vice President Zubair Mohamed Saleh during his unexpected
visit here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's MENA news agency today quoted the Sudanese opposition
National Democratic Rally sources as saying that its forces killed
about 150 Sudanese government troops in the southern areas under
its control during a fierce battle that broke out in the morning
and is still raging.
</P>
<P>
There has been no confirmation of the figures by the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition leader Mohamed Osman Mirghani said he
expected escalation of present confrontations in the Blue Nile
province and the eastern and southern regions in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
In a statement upon his departure here today for Jedda on a
private visit to Saudi Arabia, Mirghani said the coming stage will
witness constant escalation in diplomatic action and international
forums against the present government in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports reaching here have revealed a military
buildup of 3,000 soldiers backed by 20 heavy military vehicles in
northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The troops headed for Torit city in southern Sudan, which is
the former political capital of rebel leader Gohn Garang before
the Sudanese government forces drove him out in the early
nineties, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a prominent Sudanese military source that the
Sudanese armed forces take into consideration of all information on
military buildups on the eastern borders with Eritrea and Ethiopia
besides Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Drought Rampant in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Severe drought is towering
over Somaliland, the self-declared republic that split from
Somalia in 1991, where many wells are dry, a report from Hargeisa
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring ethiopia and nearby Kenya are all affected by the
latest drought, which aid workers say is already raising fears of
famine.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Hargeisa said Somaliland is now hard hit by
drought, with many wells and bore-holes dry and others running
out of water. Pasture land there has been devastated and former
grazing areas are now deserted.
</P>
<P>
In many areas the price of a barrel of water has risen more
than seven times and is beyond the reach of many nomadic herdsmen
whose cattle and goats are dying in large numbers, they said.
</P>
<P>
Somaliland, which has not been recognized by other states,
today appealed for urgent assistance to counter drought affecting
large areas of the Horn of Africa. It covers the area of the
former British Somaliland, which joined its southern neighbor
Italian Somalia to form the independent Republic of Somalia in
1960.
</P>
<P>
The Somaliland drought relief committee held meetings last
week with representatives of the U.N. and other aid
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Majdi Dawabi, operations officer of the U.U. Children's Fund
(UNICEF), said after the meetings, ``the drought is occurring on
an almost annual basis. We need to find a long-term solution.''
