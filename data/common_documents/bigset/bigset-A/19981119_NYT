COMMENTARY: STARR'S TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 7th graf, The committee ..., to UPDATE, Starr's prepared
statement says he will clear administration on Filegate and
Travelgate; Pickup 8th graf pvs, We have ...) 
 (bl) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of complaining that Ken Starr's
initial referral was ``only about lying about sex,'' Democrats on
the House Judiciary Committee now insist the impeachment hearings
be limited to sex, the whole sex and nothing but the sex.
</P>
<P>
   When Chairman Henry Hyde steered the inquiry beyond President
Clinton's Lewinsky perjuries, Democratic Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt had a hissy fit. Stick to the sex (which turns people off)
or we walk, was his message. Hyde called that bluff; the boycott
threat was hastily withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume Starr uses his opening time to show how Clinton
exhibited a four-year ``pattern and practice'' of abusing his power
by withholding evidence and tampering with witnesses _ from hushing
up Web Hubbell to coaching forgetfulness in Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers and committee partisans will try to change
the subject to Starr's leaks, expenses and prosecutorial hardball,
as if he and not the president's lawbreaking were the impeachment
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has undermined the rule of law with his
repeated trivialization of the oath, power abuse beyond ``lying
about sex'' has to be shown before a consensus could form for
removal.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of Kathleen Willey, the committee needs to know
all the grand jury knows about possible witness intimidation. More
important than who lied about sexual harassment in the Oval Office
is whether the power of the White House, buttressed by private
snoops, was subsequently brought against an individual accuser. The
committee cannot settle a she-accused-he-denied dispute, but it is
duty bound to find out what power, if any, was used to shut her up
after the alleged event.
</P>
<P>
   The committee should grill Starr on other investigations long
overdue. The advance word is that he will exonerate Clinton on
Filegate and the Justice Department persecution of Travel Office
employees standing in the way of political patronage. Let's see the
full report on those. And has Starr solved the mystery of the
reappearance in the first lady's upstairs office of her
long-missing Whitewater billing records?
</P>
<P>
   We have just learned that Starr has been taking the testimony of
John Huang, the Riady family's man at Commerce and the illegal DNC
fund-raising operation. That's in connection with the Riadys'
hushabye payment to the jail-bound Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   The committee should call Huang, give him use immunity and find
out how Clinton illegally raised millions from Asian sources, which
was soon followed by good news for the Riady clan: a flip-flop of
Clinton policy toward most-favored-nation trade.
</P>
<P>
   If Judiciary is unwilling to look into this, it does not take
seriously its impeachment responsibility. That's because the word
in the Constitution that comes before ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' as a cause for impeachment is ``bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   Huang, a secret participant with Indonesia's James Riady and
Bruce Lindsey at meetings in the Oval Office, knows what policy
advice was solicited and how much hard and soft cash was solicited.
Clinton's Justice Department has avoided questioning Huang for two
years. Why can't we know what Starr has learned _ and why must
Congress depend on the independent counsel for part of the story
when Huang and Lindsey are available to the committee?
</P>
<P>
   The courts have ruled that Clinton cannot cloak the
taxpayer-paid lawyer Lindsey with executive privilege; if Clinton
repeats his unlawful stonewalling order, that would become an
impeachment count.
</P>
<P>
   Looking into illegal foreign fund-raising that borders on
bribery, of course, is not as offputting to the public as delving
into private lives. That's why Clinton partisans want a
``Monica-only'' inquiry into sex lies.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should press Starr to reveal the status of all his
court-assigned investigations. The public's need to know of any
White House abuse of power now outweighs a prosecutor's obligation
to indict lesser figures later.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should the committee rely on any independent counsel as its
only source of information. The unpublicized Select Committee on
Chinagate has yet to share its secret findings with Judiciary.
Before a vote is taken on impeachment, Congress should find and tie
up Starr's loose ends.

BIG TALENTS, ANOTHER BIG GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ New schools, new teammates, new rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if it's the same old Carson Palmer and the same old DeShaun
Foster, everyone's in for a treat Saturday at the Rose Bowl when
UCLA plays host to USC.
</P>
<P>
   The pair of high-profile freshmen turned in one of the most
remarkable duels in CIF Southern Section history last December,
with Palmer quarterbacking Santa Margarita High to a 55-42 victory
against Tustin and Foster for the Division V championship.
</P>
<P>
   There were other good players on the field _ Santa Margarita
receiver John Minardi is at Colorado, Tustin cornerback Julius
Williams is at UCLA and offensive tackle Corey Chambers at Oregon.
However, Foster and Palmer showed why they would be among the most
sought-after recruits in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer completed 19 of 29 passes for 419 yards and five
touchdowns and ran for another. Foster rushed for 377 yards and all
six Tustin touchdowns on 33 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best (high school) game I ever played in,'' said
Palmer, who will make his third start Saturday for USC. ``Some of
the competition I played against was pretty bad. I would be done at
halftime. It was no fun just killing a team, but in a championship
game it was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much had to score every time to win (and) the crowd
was into it. Man, it was a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster doesn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to block it out,'' he said with a laugh when asked what
he remembers about the game. ``It was so frustrating because I just
couldn't get past that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Tustin had been knocked out of the playoffs the previous two
seasons by Santa Margarita and while both teams were 13-0 last
year, Santa Margarita was expected to win comfortably. It not only
had Palmer but a defense that allowed less than 10 points and 75
yards rushing per game.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, who is 6-foot-1 and 205 pounds, kept Tustin close. He
also played most of the game at cornerback, leaving him so tired
that he was deprived of a long touchdown run in the second half
when he fell to the ground with cramps after beating the last Santa
Margarita defender.
</P>
<P>
   The usually stoic Foster fought back tears as the teams shook
hands after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, now 6-4 and 220 pounds, displayed the arm, accuracy and
poise that has USC so enthusiastic about its future. He led Santa
Margarita to a touchdown every time it had the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a receiver has a little bit of room and the (defensive
back) is not covering him completely, he's going to throw the ball
right in there and there's no way the (defensive back) is going to
get the ball,'' said Williams, who has played occasionally on
UCLA's special teams this season.
</P>
<P>
   After Palmer signed with USC and Foster with UCLA, they had a
chance to be teammates last summer in the Shrine Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always tension between a Bruin and a Trojan,'' said
Palmer, laughing. ``We joked around with each other every day. I
would say, `How come you want to be a Bruin?' and things like that.
We did talk a little bit about what it would have been like to play
at the same school. Now, all of a sudden, we're playing against
each other in the biggest game of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   And no doubt both will play a large role.
</P>
<P>
   As a quarterback, Palmer will naturally be at the center of
USC's game plan, but Foster will play a large role as well. He is
the Bruins' third-string tailback but in name only. He's the
Bruins' leading rusher despite missing eight quarters with a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   That the two will be at a packed Rose Bowl, less than 12 months
after playing before 8,000 at Cal State Fullerton, is not lost on
either one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty amazing, isn't it?'' said Foster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never pictured that we would be playing against each other
in a game like this so soon,'' Palmer said. ``For him to be on the
other side is something. It was less than a year ago that we were
playing in the CIF championship game. It's really the same kind of
situation, but the stakes are a lot higher.''

CLAIBORNE'S JOB: CATCH McNOWN 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After the way he knocked Arizona State quarterback
Ryan Kealy out of the game with a concussion, it's only natural USC
linebacker Chris Claiborne has been asked around campus this week
if he can perform a similar feat against UCLA quarterback Cade
McNown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, definitely,'' Claiborne said. ``But you just play
the course of the game. Any shots I can get on him, you have to
take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Claiborne has faced the Bruins twice, he knows McNown is
one of the more elusive quarterbacks in the country, and more
difficult to hit cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the positions you get caught in that are a problem,''
Claiborne said. ``He knows where he's going but you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   As appealing as it sounds to have a McNown-Claiborne duel
determine the game's outcome, Claiborne said the contest will
really be decided on the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is definitely going to be between our defensive
linemen and their offensive linemen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soward tests ankle: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward tried running on
his badly sprained ankle Wednesday for the first time since getting
injured against Stanford nearly two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the light running were inconclusive, other than
proving Soward will not be 100 percent by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He struggled to run. As it loosened up, I thought he moved
much better,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``I felt he'll play. I
was encouraged. (But) it's not where he could start and be 100
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be in a limited role. I just know when it comes
to game time, he's going to want to play. There's nothing we can do
about him. He's frustrated. When you're injured, you're injured.
We're not going to put him in a position to jeopardize the
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   There's still a strong possibility Soward will be given another
anti-inflammatory injection before the game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he has seen a chiropractor, according to a
source.
</P>
<P>
   Soward declined comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates are becoming resigned to the fact they may face
the Bruins without their star playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sit here and worry about R. Jay right now,'' wide
receiver Billy Miller said. ``That's up to R. Jay and other doctors
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost amid the Soward hype, tight end Lonnie Ford has
recovered faster from his ankle sprain against Stanford, and
returned to practice this week. He is expected to be available for
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky team? Hackett expects UCLA coach Bob Toledo to toss in a
few trick plays for Saturday's game, possibly even the first play
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be conscious that you're probably going to get one
on the opening play of the game and you're probably going to get
three or four,'' Hackett said. ``The reason trick plays are so
effective is that they make the defense lay back. We've got six
(trick plays), so maybe we'll use them the first six plays of the
game. Who's going to call the first one?''
</P>
<P>
   The key for the Trojans defense is not to become obsessed with
trick plays, although the players expect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're going to face trick plays, but you have to be
ready and disciplined,'' Claiborne said.
</P>
<P>
   Matock update: Defensive tackle Marc Matock practiced Wednesday
but said he would not play until the Notre Dame game.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Williams, who had a neck stinger that prevented him from
starting against Stanford, will start Saturday.

THE SEVEN PLAYS THAT LIFTED UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One player tells of being in almost a trancelike
state as he made the play. He moved as if in slow motion, and he
insists the stadium, despite 80,568 fans roaring all around him,
was deathly still.
</P>
<P>
   Another player is urged to recount a play he made, but as soon
as an interviewer cites the down and distance, the player
interrupts to say, ``You're sending chills down my spine already.''
</P>
<P>
   An assistant coach describes play after key play, in meticulous
detail, as if there is a reel of tape running in his head. Of a
quarterback sack that occurred seven years ago, he even describes
the move the linebacker used to shed a block, and says, ``I
remember the play like it was yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the essence of the USC-UCLA series, a college football
rivalry so unique it fosters out-of-body experiences and indelible
memories.
</P>
<P>
   Because the proximity of the schools is so close, the ties of
the participants so tight, emotions soar in this game. Commanding
leads are readily overcome, and in recent years, the outcome has
hung in the balance as late as the third quarter, the fourth _ or
the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Until a single play occurred. A linchpin. The pivot on which the
game turned.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has produced seven of them in a row, resulting in an
unprecedented win streak in the 69-year series. An interception, a
sack, a mad scramble by the quarterback, a recovered fumble. After
each, USC was never the same again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had them down and we let it slip away,'' said USC
defensive backfield coach Dennis Thurman, a noted Bruins-killer
during his playing days with the Trojans in the late 1970s. ``If
you talk to UCLA, they'll say they went out there and took it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made the plays when they've had to. We've had great
comebacks, gotten close, and then, all of a sudden, we don't make
that play to get us over the hump. And they've made those plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering three of the seven games, USC was ranked and UCLA was
not. In another, the Trojans had a superior record. And yet UCLA
has prevailed, narrowly _ the seven straight victories have been
accomplished by an average margin of 5.6 points, less than a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Players on both sides cite a single factor for this: emotion.
Extreme emotion. The rivalry commands it.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Ale, a hero of the '91 game, said a cousin and three of
his high school teammates played for USC that year. Current UCLA
tackle Kris Farris revealed his girlfriend is a USC student, and he
catches heat whenever he walks into her sorority house. Thurman
recalled the time (1972-73) when Rod McNeill was a tailback for the
Trojans and brother Fred a linebacker for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``People probably exert more energy than they realize they're
exerting just because the game is so hyped up,'' said Danjuan
Magee, who produced the decisive play for UCLA in '96. ``It's like
a Super Bowl. People go to the wall, reckless disregard, don't care
what happens to their limbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting scenes can border on the surreal.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA linebacker Nkosi Littleton, who knocked down a pass on
USC's two-point conversion attempt in the final seconds of the '92
game at the Rose Bowl, said, ``It was like a movie. It was like
slow motion to me. Even though there were 100,000 people there,
while the play was in motion, you can't hear one word. Not one
thing. It is a dreamlike thing.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, it leaves USC wanting to be pinched. Safety Grant
Pearsall has yet to experience victory in this game despite being a
fifth-year senior for the Trojans. ``I think we're due,'' he said,
``for one of those lucky big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   It's undeniable that at critical junctures lately, the ball has
been bouncing only in UCLA's direction. &QL; 
1991: Blind-sided
</P>
<P>
   USC was down 17-0 just before the half, but quarterback Reggie
Perry brought the Trojans back. They trailed by three and were at
the UCLA 37, facing fourth-and-5, when they called time out with 1
minute, 19 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA opted to blitz Ale from the right, Perry's blind side. Ale
arrived practically with the shotgun snap, sacking Perry and
jolting the ball loose. Teammate Mike Chalenski recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember reading in the paper, their coach said I came
through clean,'' Ale said. ``But there was somebody in front of me.
All I remember is giving a head fake inside, the tackle bit, and I
swam outside. I was home free. I had a kill shot on the
quarterback, but I guess instinct told me to go for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fourth down. I didn't even bother going after the
fumble. I remember thinking the game was over. I just put my arms
in the air. What a great feeling.'' &QL; 
1992: Into coverage
</P>
<P>
   An excruciating defeat for USC. The Trojans had been up 31-17
early in the fourth quarter, but the Bruins swarmed them and took a
38-31 lead with just over three minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   USC quarterback Rob Johnson led a 69-yard touchdown drive and
sneaked in from 1 to pull his team within one point with 41 seconds
left. But on the two-point conversion try, Littleton broke up a
pass to the end zone for tight end Yonnie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outside linebacker didn't get on (Jackson) right away, so
I just ran over there,'' Littleton said. ``I didn't think (Johnson)
was going to throw it, because I was over there. But he had a
history of throwing into coverage. (Laughs.) And he threw it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Repeated attempts to reach Johnson through the Buffalo Bills
were unsuccessful.)
</P>
<P>
   Littleton: ``They had called a time out. We were on the
sideline, and T.D. (then-coach Terry Donahue) said, `Who's going to
be the one to make this play?' I thought it would be me.'' &QL; 
1993: Picked off
</P>
<P>
   USC was down by six points when Johnson again directed a late
rally. He had the Trojans at first-and-goal from the UCLA 3 with
just over a minute left, but the Bruins stuffed running plays on
first and second down.
</P>
<P>
   On third down from the 2, Johnson's pass for Tyler Cashman was
intercepted by safety Marvin Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the same defense for second and third down, because I
thought they might throw it on second down,'' said UCLA assistant
head coach Bob Field, then the Bruins' defensive coordinator. (USC
rushed for only 7 yards in the game.) ``They came with play action
on third down. We were anticipating pass.'' &QL; 
1994: Maximum coverage
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the culprit yet again, this time as USC held a
two-point lead in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After UCLA's Darren Schager punted 49 yards to the USC 12,
Phillip Ward sacked Johnson back to the 1 on first down. Then, on
third-and-21, disaster: A pass over the middle was tipped by Paul
Guidry and intercepted by Abdul McCullough.
</P>
<P>
   That set up the go-ahead touchdown for the Bruins and sparked
them to a 12-point victory.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA rushed only three men on the play and blanketed the
secondary with the rest. ``You've got to know it's a pass,'' said
Guidry. ``I was kind of anxious. I wanted to make some kind of
play, leave some kind of mark on the game. I deflected it and Abdul
just happened to be in the right place at the right time... He
still thanks me for it.'' &QL; 
1995: `Keep it'
</P>
<P>
   Cade McNown was a true freshman, all of 18 years old, playing
quarterback in a potentially terrifying situation at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Toledo, then the offensive coordinator, made a daring call
to heighten the tension even more.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA led 21-0 in the second quarter, but USC charged back,
pulling to within 24-20 with 3:30 to play. On the ensuing UCLA
possession, a false-start penalty and two 1-yard runs put the
Bruins in third-and-13 from their own 29. USC hungrily sought to
force a punt and mount a game-winning drive.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo put McNown in the shotgun, called a handoff to the
running back for a sweep left... and then told McNown _ and no one
else _ ``Keep it.'' McNown faked the handoff, fooled USC in
addition to his teammates, and dashed around right end for 21 yards
and a first down.
</P>
<P>
   USC never got the ball back. &QL; 
1996: Jarring it loose
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that mirrored '92 in terms of the miraculousness
of UCLA's comeback and the shock of defeat for USC.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were up 31-14 early in the third quarter before UCLA
rallied to within a touchdown (38-31) inside the final three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins' subsequent onside kick went out of bounds, and
USC took over in the middle of the field, needing to run only 2:49
off the clock.
</P>
<P>
   On second-and-10 at the UCLA 41, USC's LaVale Woods gained 7
yards, only to lose the ball in a collision with Magee. Kusanti
Abdul-Salaam recovered for UCLA and returned the ball 11 yards. It
set up a game-tying touchdown for the Bruins, who went on to win in
two overtimes.
</P>
<P>
   Said Magee: ``If you watch it on TV, (then-USC coach John)
Robinson is going out there before the play telling Woods to hold
the ball, hold the ball, going like this (clamping hands
together)... I kind of jumped on him (Woods), threw myself toward
the ball and hung on it, almost parallel to the ground.'' &QL; 
1997: At the improv
</P>
<P>
   It was 21-21 in the third quarter, anyone's game, when McNown
came up to the line under daunting conditions: third-and-17 from
his own 18. He was nearly sacked, ducked out of trouble, scrambled,
and hit Danny Farmer for a 36-yard completion.
</P>
<P>
   It kept alive a drive that led to a 38-yard touchdown pass to
Mike Grieb, which put UCLA ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   The play was pure improvisation. ``It exemplifies the way Cade
and I really know what each other is thinking,'' said Farmer.
``We've experienced so much together, our minds kind of work the
same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Said offensive coordinator Alan Borges: ``I think that's what
great players do _ they bail you out of some jams. Look, over the
years, at every great quarterback, whether it's Joe Montana or
Roger Staubach: They always had that escape dimension or ability to
buy a couple of extra seconds to get somebody open.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown has spent the week going into contortions to play down
his miracle-working against USC. ``It's the biggest game of the
year, but I'm not worried about what has happened or what may
happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McNown is probably kidding himself. Every player who takes the
field Saturday at the Rose Bowl will be mindful of making the play
on which the game will swing.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost count on a play or plays ``in the critical part
of the game,'' said UCLA's Field, ``that will go down in history.
And a few years from now, somebody will be wanting to recall
those.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows,'' said USC's Thurman, ``when that one play is
coming?''!end!
</P>
<P>
   BACK-BREAKERS &QL; 
Pivotal plays during UCLA's seven-game win streak against USC. &QL; 
Year: 1991. &QL; 
Play: Trailing by three points, USC is at the UCLA 37 with 1:19 to
play, and faces fourth-and-five. After quarterback Reggie Perry
takes the snap in the shotgun, linebacker Arnold Ale tracks him
down from the blind side, producing a sack that results in a
fumble. &QL; 
Final score: UCLA 24, USC 21. &QL; 
Year: 1992. &QL; 
Play: USC is down by seven when quarterback Rob Johnson burrows in
from the 1-yard line with 41 seconds left to cut the lead to one.
On the two-point conversion try, Johnson's pass is knocked down in
the end zone by linebacker Nkosi Littleton. &QL; 
Final score: UCLA 38, USC 37. &QL; 
Year: 1993. &QL; 
Play: With 50 seconds left, as USC is attempting to tie the game
with a touchdown, Johnson's third-down pass from the 2 is
intercepted in the end zone by Marvin Goodwin. &QL; 
Final score: UCLA 27, USC 21. &QL; 
Year: 1994. &QL; 
Play: UCLA trails by two in the third quarter as Johnson delivers a
pass from his own 1-yard line. Paul Guidry deflects the ball and
Abdul McCullough intercepts for UCLA to set up the go-ahead
touchdown. &QL; 
Final score: UCLA 31, USC 19. &QL; 
Year: 1995. &QL; 
Play: USC has rallied to within four points, and UCLA faces
third-and-13 from its own 29 with less than three minutes left.
Freshman quarterback Cade McNown scrambles for a 21-yard gain and
the Trojans never get the ball back. &QL; 
Final score: UCLA 24, USC 20. &QL; 
Year: 1996. &QL; 
Play: USC has a seven-point lead and the ball with 1:37 to play.
But UCLA linebacker Danjuan Magee strips LaVale Woods of the ball
and Kusanti Abdul-Salaam recovers. It sets up the tying touchdown
in the final minute, and UCLA goes on to win in two overtimes. &QL; 
Final score: UCLA 48, USC 41. &QL; 
Year: 1997. &QL; 
Play: With the game tied 21-21 in the third quarter, UCLA faces
third-and-17 from its own 18. McNown scurries out of danger to
complete a 36-yard pass to Danny Farmer, which sets up the
game-deciding touchdown. &QL; 
Final score: UCLA 31, USC 24. &QL;

STARR CHOSE NOT TO SEND REPORT ON WHITEWATER TO CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Late last year, Kenneth Starr wrote a draft
impeachment report centering on President Clinton's purported
involvement in the complicated Whitewater land deal, but decided
not to send it to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel shelved the report after concluding that
the key witnesses accusing Clinton of wrongdoing were felons whose
credibility was suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The description of what brought Starr and his prosecutors to the
brink of a confrontation with Clinton is outlined in the 58-page
presentation that the independent counsel will deliver on Thursday
in his high-stakes appearance before the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Starr exonerates Clinton of personal
culpability in several other inquiries, including the dismissal of
the White House travel office staff and the administration's
improper gathering of hundreds of FBI files on former Republican
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr makes clear that the travel office investigation ``is
not terminated,'' with an announcement of ``decisions and actions
soon.'' Starr also notes there are still ``outstanding issues''
involving one person in the FBI files matter.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony represents Starr's most detailed accounting of his
investigations outside the Monica Lewinsky matter since his
appointment in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In summing up the four-year, $40 million inquiry, Starr says,
``The pattern of obstruction of justice, false statements and
misuse of executive authority in the Lewinsky investigation did not
occur in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   As Starr sought to show a pattern of obstruction and
stonewalling by the Clinton administration, he emphasized, and
reserved his strongest language, for the Arkansas land deal.
</P>
<P>
   The basic outlines are well known. Madison Guaranty Savings and
Loan, a Little Rock entity run by the Clintons' business partners,
James B. McDougal and his then-wife, Susan, collapsed. Mrs. Clinton
performed legal work in the 1980s for Madison, which Starr called a
``metaphor'' for the savings and loan crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madison Guaranty was a disaster,'' he said. ``It gambled with
investments, cooked the books and ultimately bilked the taxpayers
of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's inquiry focused on whether Madison money had been used
illegally to help business and political figures in Arkansas.
Indeed, one loan of $300,000 went to what Starr called Susan
McDougal's ``make-believe'' company, Master Marketing, and $50,000
of that benefited Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Subpoenaed as a defense witness, Clinton testified at the trial
of McDougal and Jim Guy Tucker, a former Arkansas governor, that he
did not know about the loan to Susan McDougal and had never
discussed it with McDougal or an Arkansas businessman, David Hale.
But Hale contradicted the president's statement.
</P>
<P>
   And, Starr said, so did McDougal, after he was convicted and
agreed to cooperate with the indpendent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim McDougal said on one of his first sessions with our office
that the president's trial testimony was, in his words, `at
variance with the truth.'''
</P>
<P>
   Starr acknowledges for the first time that Tucker was not as
useful as prosecutors believed he would be, though he did ``shed
light'' on some Whitewater related deals.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also says that Clinton encouraged Susan McDougal to
stonewall. Starr refers to a September 1996 interview Clinton gave
to PBS, in which he said, ``there's a lot of evidence to support''
various charges that Ms. McDougal made against Starr's office. But
Clinton cited no evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's language is searing: ``Essentially, the president of the
United States, the chief executive, sided with a convicted felon
against the United States, as represented by United States District
Judge Susan Webber Wright, the United States Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit, and the Office of the Independent Counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   An offshoot of the original inquiry centered on the work done
for Madison in 1985 and 1986 by the Rose Law Firm, where Hillary
Rodham Clinton was a partner. Billing records related to Mrs.
Clinton's work at the firm were subpoenaed, but for two years could
not be found. They had apparently disappeared in the White House
residence. Two years later the records mysteriously turned up.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a thorough investigation, we have found no explanation
how the billing records got where they were or why they were not
discovered and produced earlier,'' Starr says in his testimony.
``It remains a mystery to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate Whitewater committee concluded that there was no
other credible explanation than that Mrs. Clinton concealed the
records.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Starr says that he believed Webster L.
Hubbell, a partner at the Rose Law Firm with Mrs. Clinton, and
later a top Justice Department official, might have additional
information.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Hubbell became the focus of Starr's inquiry, after he
had resigned his Justice position, he received payments totaling
$550,000 from several companies and individuals. Many were campaign
donors.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Starr gives his strongest assertion so far
that Clinton supporters bought Hubbell's silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of this $550,000 was given to Mr. Hubbell for little or
no work,'' Starr states. ``This rush of generosity obviously gives
rise to an inference that the money was essentially a gift. And if
it was a gift, why was it a gift? This money was given despite the
fact that Mr. Hubbell was under criminal investigation for
fraudulent billing and was a key witness in the Madison Guaranty
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Starr indicted Hubbell on 15 counts of false
statements and other charges, and said in his statement it would be
inappropriate to discuss the case further.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Starr gives a dispassionate account of the
facts _ as he and his prosecutors see them. But at the end, he
adopts a much more personal tone as he defends his office, his
employees, his methods and his mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the hurricane-force political winds swirling about us,
we were well aware that, no matter what decision we made, criticism
would come from somewhere,'' Starr says.

LOCAL VOLUNTEER PART OF AIDS VACCINE TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   (Kansas City, Mo.) _ There was nothing
he could do when his best friend died of AIDS. He felt helpless as
the disease felled dozens of other friends and acquaintances.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now this 45-year-old Kansas City man, who wants to remain
anonymous, is taking bold steps against AIDS. Last week, he became
the first local person to participate in testing of an experimental
AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he met with reporters to urge others to volunteer
for the vaccine trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of this is hope,'' he said at a press
conference at the Kansas City AIDS Research Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all we have. We watched our friends, our families, our
lovers die of AIDS and we were helpless. Now with the vaccines and
new drugs, and with hope, we'll be here for the cure.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is among the first 10 cities to take part in a
three-to-four-year study of AIDSVAX, the only AIDS vaccine so far
to reach the final stage of testing.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hope to eventually enroll about 5,000 men and women
in several dozen U.S. cities to see if AIDSVAX can protect people
from infection with HIV, the AIDS virus. Each subject will receive
a series of seven injections of either the vaccine or a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, the AIDS Research Consortium expects to enroll
150 subjects in the study.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium's first volunteer describes himself as a longtime
political and gay rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, he became an AIDS activist as well after his lifelong
best friend developed AIDS-related pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call in the middle of the night that he was dead. It
was a shock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That shock has been followed by many others over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of weeks ago I was reading the obituaries and I
realized, if I were to put the name of every person who was a
friend or that I knew who had died of AIDS it would cover the whole
obituary page of BEGIN ITAL The Kansas City Star END ITAL.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is open about his bisexuality, the consortium's
first volunteer wants to remain anonymous to protect himself from
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   This safeguard is necessary because the vaccine study uses
volunteers who are free of HIV, but who engage in sex that puts
them at high risk of infection, said Jan Meier, the consortium's
clinical director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell people you're in the study, you've admitted you
engage in some unsafe sexual behavior,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In other cities where the vaccine has been used for some time,
people who have gone public about their participation in the study
have been met with hostility by friends, family and co-workers,
Meier said.
</P>
<P>
   All study participants receive periodic counseling sessions on
safe sex to avoid infection. They also are warned that they might
have received a placebo rather than the vaccine. One-third of the
participants get a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Although AIDSVAX is considered safe, there is no proof yet that
it offers protection against infection. In fact, some researchers
doubt this vaccine is strong enough to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other AIDS vaccines being developed, AIDSVAX does
not use HIV itself. Instead, it contains a protein the virus uses
as a biological ``key'' to enter and destroy human cells.
</P>
<P>
   By priming the body's immune system to recognize this protein,
scientists hope people exposed to HIV will be able to mount a
successful fight against the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings to avoid unsafe sex and the possibility of HIV
infection may not be needed by the consortium's first volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always tried to practice safer sex,'' he said. ``That's
why I'm HIV-negative today.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I will also continue to try and protect myself.
This (vaccine) does not give me permission to go out and practice
unsafe sex. I consider everyone at risk. There's no such thing as
(completely) safe sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen more local volunteers will receive their first shots
this week, and the consortium is on target to have 40 or 50
subjects enrolled by the end of the year, Meier said.

MILES PRENTICE RAISES HOPES ON LOCAL FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   When Miles Prentice put his effort to
buy the Royals over the top, it culminated an individual leadership
initiative the likes of which Kansas Citians rarely see anymore.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thus, keeping major league baseball in Kansas City also seems to
bring with it the bonus of a powerful new dynamic in the higher
echelons of local civic life.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice no doubt will have his hands full creating contenders
on the field and achieving profitability off it. Nevertheless, by
establishing his credentials as a can-do guy, he's raised a lot of
hopes in a community where can-do types are at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   If Prentice is to fulfill the community expectations he's
created, he'd be well advised to counsel early and often with R.
Crosby Kemper Jr., who's another can-do guy.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to all others who partnered up with Prentice to save
the Royals for Kansas City, but Kemper is arguably the first among
ownership equals when it comes to exerting influence on local civic
and business life. The willingness of Kemper to get on Prentice's
bandwagon early gave the New Yorker's quest much-needed credibility
when most other heavy hitters were conspicuous by their absence.
</P>
<P>
   If Prentice is amenable to some mentoring by Kemper, the most
important thing he's likely to learn is the importance of
individual action in Kansas City. Kemper has been critical of the
local ``committee mentality,'' and was quoted earlier this year as
saying, ``We like to do things in groups so we're not overly
criticized.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a keen insight, because it recognizes that when everyone is
in charge, nobody is in charge. This has often created a leadership
vacuum in local circles.
</P>
<P>
   What has distinguished Kemper over the years is his willingness
to act decisively as an individual and stand any gaff that may come
his way as a result. Ewing M. Kauffman, who willed his Kansas City
Royals to his hometown, was another shining example of a business
leader and civic benefactor who did great things for his community
while marching to his own drummer.
</P>
<P>
   As a new kid on the block, Prentice will be subject to criticism
and vulnerable to the yearning it often creates to become one of
the crowd. Kemper may not know much about baseball, but his most
important contribution to the Royals' success will be as Prentice's
rock when the going gets tough. If Prentice is as keen a student of
people as he seems, he knows by now Kemper is the sort you want in
a foxhole with you. The other co-owners should also understand
this.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive aspect of Prentice's job of assembling his
diverse group of co-owners is where he went to find them. While
most everyone recognizes the marquee value of co-owners such as
Kemper and golf legend Tom Watson, most others who stepped up for
Kansas City in this instance aren't part of the usually

(REFILING TO FIX SLUG IN NOTES FIELD) 
STARR CHOSE NOT TO SEND REPORT ON WHITEWATER TO CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Late last year, Kenneth Starr wrote a draft
impeachment report centering on President Clinton's purported
involvement in the complicated Whitewater land deal, but decided
not to send it to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel shelved the report after concluding that
the key witnesses accusing Clinton of wrongdoing were felons whose
credibility was suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The description of what brought Starr and his prosecutors to the
brink of a confrontation with Clinton is outlined in the 58-page
presentation that the independent counsel will deliver on Thursday
in his high-stakes appearance before the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Starr exonerates Clinton of personal
culpability in several other inquiries, including the dismissal of
the White House travel office staff and the administration's
improper gathering of hundreds of FBI files on former Republican
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr makes clear that the travel office investigation ``is
not terminated,'' with an announcement of ``decisions and actions
soon.'' Starr also notes there are still ``outstanding issues''
involving one person in the FBI files matter.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony represents Starr's most detailed accounting of his
investigations outside the Monica Lewinsky matter since his
appointment in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In summing up the four-year, $40 million inquiry, Starr says,
``The pattern of obstruction of justice, false statements and
misuse of executive authority in the Lewinsky investigation did not
occur in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   As Starr sought to show a pattern of obstruction and
stonewalling by the Clinton administration, he emphasized, and
reserved his strongest language, for the Arkansas land deal.
</P>
<P>
   The basic outlines are well known. Madison Guaranty Savings and
Loan, a Little Rock entity run by the Clintons' business partners,
James B. McDougal and his then-wife, Susan, collapsed. Mrs. Clinton
performed legal work in the 1980s for Madison, which Starr called a
``metaphor'' for the savings and loan crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madison Guaranty was a disaster,'' he said. ``It gambled with
investments, cooked the books and ultimately bilked the taxpayers
of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's inquiry focused on whether Madison money had been used
illegally to help business and political figures in Arkansas.
Indeed, one loan of $300,000 went to what Starr called Susan
McDougal's ``make-believe'' company, Master Marketing, and $50,000
of that benefited Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Subpoenaed as a defense witness, Clinton testified at the trial
of McDougal and Jim Guy Tucker, a former Arkansas governor, that he
did not know about the loan to Susan McDougal and had never
discussed it with McDougal or an Arkansas businessman, David Hale.
But Hale contradicted the president's statement.
</P>
<P>
   And, Starr said, so did McDougal, after he was convicted and
agreed to cooperate with the indpendent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim McDougal said on one of his first sessions with our office
that the president's trial testimony was, in his words, `at
variance with the truth.'''
</P>
<P>
   Starr acknowledges for the first time that Tucker was not as
useful as prosecutors believed he would be, though he did ``shed
light'' on some Whitewater related deals.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also says that Clinton encouraged Susan McDougal to
stonewall. Starr refers to a September 1996 interview Clinton gave
to PBS, in which he said, ``there's a lot of evidence to support''
various charges that Ms. McDougal made against Starr's office. But
Clinton cited no evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's language is searing: ``Essentially, the president of the
United States, the chief executive, sided with a convicted felon
against the United States, as represented by United States District
Judge Susan Webber Wright, the United States Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit, and the Office of the Independent Counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   An offshoot of the original inquiry centered on the work done
for Madison in 1985 and 1986 by the Rose Law Firm, where Hillary
Rodham Clinton was a partner. Billing records related to Mrs.
Clinton's work at the firm were subpoenaed, but for two years could
not be found. They had apparently disappeared in the White House
residence. Two years later the records mysteriously turned up.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a thorough investigation, we have found no explanation
how the billing records got where they were or why they were not
discovered and produced earlier,'' Starr says in his testimony.
``It remains a mystery to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate Whitewater committee concluded that there was no
other credible explanation than that Mrs. Clinton concealed the
records.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Starr says that he believed Webster L.
Hubbell, a partner at the Rose Law Firm with Mrs. Clinton, and
later a top Justice Department official, might have additional
information.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Hubbell became the focus of Starr's inquiry, after he
had resigned his Justice position, he received payments totaling
$550,000 from several companies and individuals. Many were campaign
donors.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Starr gives his strongest assertion so far
that Clinton supporters bought Hubbell's silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of this $550,000 was given to Mr. Hubbell for little or
no work,'' Starr states. ``This rush of generosity obviously gives
rise to an inference that the money was essentially a gift. And if
it was a gift, why was it a gift? This money was given despite the
fact that Mr. Hubbell was under criminal investigation for
fraudulent billing and was a key witness in the Madison Guaranty
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Starr indicted Hubbell on 15 counts of false
statements and other charges, and said in his statement it would be
inappropriate to discuss the case further.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Starr gives a dispassionate account of the
facts _ as he and his prosecutors see them. But at the end, he
adopts a much more personal tone as he defends his office, his
employees, his methods and his mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the hurricane-force political winds swirling about us,
we were well aware that, no matter what decision we made, criticism
would come from somewhere,'' Starr says.

JUDGE GIVES EX-LOCKHEED WORKERS ULTIMATUM OVER LAWSUIT DAMAGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Former Lockheed workers who were awarded $760
million in punitive damages have been given a choice by the judge
who presided over their case: Accept a new verdict that slashes the
amount in half or face a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard Hubbell stated in a
one-page ruling this week that the 38 plaintiffs who worked on
stealth fighters at the company's suburban Burbank facility have
until Friday to make their decision.
</P>
<P>
   All of the damages were levied against Exxon, Shell Oil, Ashland
Inc., Unocal Corp. and DuPont Co. Lockheed settled out of the
lawsuit for $33 million in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court in its independent judgment determines from the
evidence that (the) amount of the reduced judgment is fair and
reasonable,'' Hubbell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The jury reached its verdict on the punitive damages Aug. 6,
awarding $760 million -- believed to be the largest payout of its
kind in California history. Hubbell's ruling would cut the award to
$380 million.
</P>
<P>
   The workers claimed they contracted cancer, skin ailments,
breathing problems, psychological damage and other conditions
because of inadequate warning labels on dozens of chemicals and
solvents near the Lockheed assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless what choice is made, defendants' attorney Kevin Mayer
said the five companies will appeal the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our position that no amount of punitive damages should
have been awarded in these cases,'' Mayer said.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyer Thomas Girardi could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell's ruling, which was signed Monday, states that the
punitive damages awarded were excessive.
</P>
<P>
   He said a new trial would be granted if the plaintiffs do not
accept the reduction in damages. The ruling does not change the
$25.4 million verdict for compensatory damages, determined by the
same jury a week before the punitive damages verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants' lawyers were critical of the judge's conduct during
the trial, claiming he erred when he told jurors to ``send a
message'' with the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed's Skunk Works plant produced several top-secret
aircraft, including the U-2 spy plane. The plaintiffs, one of
several groups to sue the chemical manufacturers over alleged
problems at Lockheed, claim they were exposed to toxins while
working on stealth fighters.

 &HT;    UT to defend pamphlet policy against U.S. court challenge
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Think Erwin Center at the University of Texas
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Hear the rock music blaring from an Aerosmith concert _ or the
sweet, sugary sounds of an Ice Capades show.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the place you'd expect to be a battleground in a
fight for free expression. But in 1996, four environmental
activists say they were threatened with arrest outside the Erwin
Center after attempting to pass out pamphlets _ a violation, they
later learned, of a university policy that prohibits any
nonstudents, nonfaculty or nonstaff from distributing leaflets on
UT property.
</P>
<P>
   Today in federal court the four activists will challenge the
policy, which they say is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university is supposed to be a place of free inquiry and
speech and intellectual dialogue, so to prevent people from
peaceably passing out information is terribly wrong,'' said
environmentalist Robert Brister, 43, a plaintiff in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   James Todd, an attorney representing UT, said that like many
universities, UT restricts the distribution of leaflets for fear of
having such activities overrun the campus and interfere with
students attempting to get to class.
</P>
<P>
   ``University space is not unlimited,'' he said. ``It's still
primarily an educational institution, and the first priority is the
teaching of students in classes and laboratories.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 19, 1996, Brister and three other members of Austin
Greens and Austin Earth First _ Roger Baker, Eric Samson and
William Medaille _ attempted to pass out fliers outside the Erwin
Center. The fliers, titled ``World Scientists' Warning to
Humanity,'' documented the toll of pollution and exploding human
populations on the environment. The group targeted the delegates of
the National Issues Convention, which brought together
representatives from all 50 states to discuss issues ranging from
the environment to campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the people taking part would not be exposed to any
views outside the mainstream Democratic or Republican points of
view,'' said Brister, a founding member of Austin Greens, the local
chapter of the national Green Party USA, a group that supports
issues ranging from protecting the environment to promoting femi-
nism. Since filing
</P>
<P>
   his lawsuit, Bristol has moved to California.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the sidewalk outside the Erwin Center is considered
university property, according to UT officials, and therefore only
officially sanctioned student, staff or faculty groups can
distribute fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Todd said such policies are common on college campuses. ``Any
state university is entitled, if it wants to, to reserve its
properties for the activities of students, faculty and staff,'' he
said. ``Courts all the way up to the Supreme Court have upheld a
university's right not to open its facilities to free speech by
people who are not students, faculty or staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Owen, an attorney representing Brister and the other
plaintiffs, argues that the Erwin Center, which has come to play
host to a wide range of nonuniversity public events from concerts
to dance shows, is in the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they open it up for access, they can't pick and choose
who can come or what they do once they get there,'' Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, environmental groups such as Save Our Springs have
gotten around the regulation against passing out fliers on campuses
by recruiting students to form their own chapters, in order to
distribute the group's literature, Todd said. Such affiliate
student groups must be approved by the dean of students. They can
then distribute any information, so long as it doesn't constitute
solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   UT police said the policy has not been an issue in the past
because outside groups rarely come to campus intending to pass out
leaflets, and if they do, they go about their business so subtly,
they don't attract the attention of campus police or
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that happens often,'' said Sgt. Dennis
Chartier. ``Occasionally, someone will put up posters or fliers
inside buildings. In those cases, people usually will report it to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks will hear testimony from both
sides today.

 &HT;    Students call for swift, strong action on racial hate incidents
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Ohio _ Miami University students Wednesday night called
on University President James Garland to expand diversity efforts
and react more swiftly and strongly to racial hate incidents on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   While some students painted a dismal picture of race relations
on Miami's campus, others defended the university's record and
called on students to initiate needed changes.
</P>
<P>
   The event was billed as a discussion between Garland and a group
of 50 students about the climate on campus for minority students. A
crowd of nearly 500 attended the discussion, but participation was
limited to the 50 selected by Miami's Black Student Action
Association and Student Government Association.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting followed an Oct. 30 incident in the University's
Black Cultural Center in which someone installed racist messages on
computer screens and posted racist leaflets. Last week, a group of
students protested what they viewed as a lack of action by Miami
officials, blocking a street near campus. Seven students were
arrested during the second demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Garland announced Wednesday the creation of a reward fund of at
least $1,000 for information that assists in apprehension of
suspects involved in the racist messages.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion Wednesday included some spirited exchanges, often
interrupted by applause or grumblings from the audience, but was
overall calm and well-mannered.
</P>
<P>
   Black students described insensitive and insulting remarks by
professors in class and said Miami's diversity efforts are
insufficient. And they pressured Garland to block any university
punishment of the seven arrested students. Garland declined, saying
it would be unfair to treat some students who break the law
differently from others.
</P>
<P>
   One student noted the small proportion of black students and the
hostile climate on campus. ``This campus trains people to be
racist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nathan Estep, Miami's Student Government President and a
black student, suggested that he and other Miami students are
``spoiled.''
</P>
<P>
   Students ``come here expecting it be a utopia'' _ with no
racism, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Estep called on students to improve the climate on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Garland can't make it happen from his office,'' Estep
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Estep issued a statement expressing ``disdain'' for his
fellow students' protest tactics last week. He said the student
protesters ``insist instead of understand, attack rather than
heal.''
</P>
<P>
   After the forum, Garland led a unity rally outside the Student
Union that featured remarks from Oxford's mayor, local residents,
faculty and others.

CLINTON VOWS TO PRESS JAPAN ON TRADE, REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 3rd graf of optional material, That thought ..., to FIX
figures.) 
 (JT) 
 By JAMES BENNET    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Leaving Washington for an abbreviated five-day trip to
Asia, President Clinton vowed Wednesday to press Japan to take
``decisive steps'' to open its markets and revive its economy in
hopes of easing the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the cool if not downright suspicious reception that
the Clinton administration has given to the $195 billion package of
tax cuts and spending announced here Monday, the president did not
even mention the package. Instead he emphasized the need for
follow-through on longstanding commitments to such policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is more important to restoring stability and growth in
Asia than efforts to restart Japan's economy,'' Clinton said before
boarding a helicopter on the South Lawn of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that the economy here has been ``stalled for five
years,'' he said he looked forward to ``discussing how Japan can
promptly and effectively implement its commitment'' to reforming
its banking system, opening protected industries to foreign
competitors and priming consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton canceled the first part of the trip, to the annual
summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
organization, held this year in Malaysia, as he planned and then
aborted a military assault on Iraq. He sent Vice President Al Gore
instead and then left to complete the other legs of the trip, to
Japan, South Korea and Guam.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to make the rest of the stops had the incidental
benefit of placing Clinton out of the country as Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr testifies before the House Judiciary
Committee, which is weighing possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials hope that the trip will display Clinton
as pointedly removed from Washington wrangling, conducting
high-minded business _ confronting economic and security worries _
as Starr squares off with friendly Republicans and hostile
Democrats. But the trip was long planned, and White House aides
dismissed as preposterous any suggestion that Clinton was fleeing
at Starr's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international financial issues have been at the top of the
president's agenda, and this trip offers him the chance to go and
make the case for the new global financial architecture that he's
been talking about, directly to the people of Japan and Korea,''
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton will probably not avoid unpleasant matters at home
altogether. He plans to answer reporters' questions Saturday, in a
joint appearance with President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea. White
House aides said Clinton was highly unlikely to take more than two
questions, however, insisting that the Koreans had set the ground
rules.
</P>
<P>
   As always Clinton tried Wednesday to emphasize the stakes for
Americans in his financial negotiating abroad. ``If people overseas
lose their jobs,'' he said, ``they can't afford American products,
and our workers and farmers pay the price.''
</P>
<P>
   That thought seemed also to reflect the administration's
increasing worry about the possibility of rising protectionist
sentiment. The U.S. trade deficit with Japan totaled $5.1 billion
in September, a great part of the nation's overall $14 billion
deficit, Washington announced Wednesday. In particular, the
administration has come under great pressure from the U.S. steel
industry to address a surge in steel imports from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that there has been a surge and that that
is certainly causing pain, real pain, in some steel communities in
this country,'' said Gene Sperling, Clinton's national economics
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to take his economic message directly to the
Japanese people Thursday. He is to hold a televised town-hall
meeting with what the White House is billing as a cross-section of
young Japanese, from 20 to 40.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, where the administration is pleased with
economic steps that the government has taken, Clinton is planning
to deliver a gentler message of encouragement. But he said
Wednesday that he would also press Kim to reform South Korea's
banks and the huge conglomerates, whose debt is dragging down the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan and South Korea Clinton is planning to discuss growing
concerns in the region and in Washington over North Korea. After
some tentative signs of lessening tensions on the Korean Peninsula,
North Korea is resisting U.S. demands to allow the inspection of a
vast new site that the CIA suspects could be a nascent plant for
nuclear weapons. Officials in Japan and South Korea worry that the
administration, distracted by Iraq and domestic politics, has been
paying too little attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Clinton said, ``If Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
have dominated recent headlines, we must be no less concerned by
North Korea's weapons activities.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited ``its provocative missile program and developments that
could call into question its commitment to freeze and dismantle its
nuclear-weapons effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Clinton plans to visit at least two U.S. military bases
in South Korea. Joel Witt, a senior associate at the Henry L.
Stimson Center, a military research organization in Washington,
said that Japan and South Korea also wanted ``to hear from the
president that he's committed to seeking peaceful resolution of our
differences with the North.''

 &HT;    2 Falcons feather nests with `Bird' shirts
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To the victors go the spoils.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what two Falcons players are hoping.
</P>
<P>
   Starting right guard Gene Williams and deep snapper Adam
Schreiber have started a corporation named Dirty Birds Football, in
honor of the team's new touchdown celebration dance, and have
started selling T-shirts and hats.
</P>
<P>
   The players are trying to capitalize on the Falcons' NFC
West-leading 8-2 start.
</P>
<P>
   By next week, fans will be able to place orders on the Internet.
A Web site _ dirtybirdsinc.com _ is under construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam and myself thought this was a pretty good thing, so we
paid $250 to apply for a trademark for the term `Dirty Birds
Football,' and we hired an attorney to help form a corporation,''
Williams said. ``Basically, our mission is to get the Dirty Birds
out there in the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The first black T-shirts say ``Dirty Birds Football'' on the
front and ``You can do eet'' on the back and were worn by players
Friday after practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Dirty Birds name was bestowed on the team by tight end O.J.
Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Philadelphia game (Sept. 13), an old guy in the
stands pointed at me and said, `Dirty Birds, baby,' and from then
on I was saying it everywhere,'' Santiago explained. ``I took it
into the locker room, and before long everybody was saying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a few days before the New England game Nov. 8, many of the
players saw the movie ``The Water Boy'' and borrowed the ``You can
do eet'' line.
</P>
<P>
   The players repeated the line often in the locker room before
the game against the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   When Santiago scored two touchdowns and unveiled his end-zone
dance, the Dirty Bird theme took flight.
</P>
<P>
   So Williams, an 8-year veteran from Omaha, Neb., and Schreiber,
a 15-year veteran from Galveston, Texas, got busy.
</P>
<P>
   They hired former Falcons public-relations assistant Bill Rosen,
who was with the team from 1994-97. Thursday, Rosen went to
Hartsfield International Airport to see if vendors were interested
in the merchandise and has talked with numerous retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some business cards printed up, and I was handing them
out at last Sunday's (game) in the Georgia Dome,'' Rosen said.
``We've taken orders for a few dozen T-shirts, but I've placed an
order for 25 dozen more. They'll be available in black and white.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes the Department of Trademarks and Patents between three
and six months to process an application. But Williams and
Schreiber said they already have secured exclusive rights to the
phrase. Williams said other slogans will appear on shirts soon.

BEIJING: employer.  (Eds: SUBS 1st graf to ADD `Development' to
name of planning commission; NO other changes, 1st Take stands.) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cities like Shanghai and Beijing recently started requiring
patients covered by state insurance plans to pay themselves for any
Western drugs. And this month the State Development Planning
Commission announced it was planning to issue new regulations to
reform the drug pricing system _ for the third time in three years
_ but added ``the consequences of the hospitals' sales business can
not be dealt with overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America opposes
China's proposed price controls, said Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman
for the trade organization. ``Virtually all companies are putting
into that country much more than they are taking out,'' he said.
``Most are not making money; they are investing in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, at the third Great Wall International Symposium on
Interventional Cardiology, a small army of Chinese sales
representatives of Western drug and medical equipment manufacturers
welcomed Chinese cardiologists with slides, wristwatches and tote
bags _ most promoting drugs that cost more than the average Chinese
earns in a day, and tests that cost a month's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that by 2001 our sales revenue in China will reach
100 million marks,'' said Li Yumin, who was working at a booth
promoting Bayer's new heart drugs. ``There are 120 million people
with high blood pressure in this country. Their incomes are rising,
and they have better knowledge of disease. So we take every
opportunity to have contact with Chinese doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the pill he was promoting, a once-a-day
high blood pressure pill and heart medicine called Adalat GITS, was
too expensive for most Chinese to use every day for life, which is
the recommended way to treat these chronic ailments. He said the
average Chinese patient takes the medication for only 28 days. It
costs about $1 a pill, compared to the Chinese-made version of the
same drug, which costs pennies but must be taken three times a day,
and so produces less consistent blood pressure levels.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 Chinese take Adalat GITS long term, most all them
from the shrinking group of Chinese who still have government
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   To help advertise this and its new cholesterol-lowering drug,
Bayer helped pay for the heart conference, printing programs, name
cards and financing a satellite hook-up where doctors could watch
advanced heart procedures beamed in from operating rooms. Bayer
also hosted a special seminar, featuring a prominent Chinese
cardiologist describing some of the latest foreign drug trials, the
last of which supported the widespread use of drugs like Adalat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I argue that those who can afford it should take more
effective and expensive drugs,'' said the heart specialist, Dr. Hu
Dayi.
</P>
<P>
   It was a forum that could have been sponsored by any of the
dozens of Western drug companies operating here _ including giants
like Glaxo Wellcome, Eli Lilly and Novartis. And most of the 200 or
so heart specialists in the audience said they appreciated the
update, despite its heavy editorial overlay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to learn about new techniques and medicines,
although they will be difficult to use where I come from because of
financial reasons,'' said Dr. Lian Mingfeng, a heart specialist
from a small hospital in Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
   Drug representatives who work in China like to emphasize their
role as educators. But Western doctors who have attended recent
Chinese medical conferences say they are shocked to see the
representatives sometimes giving the central lectures at what are
billed as impartial scientific meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like the Wild West with a lot of flagrantly unethical
behavior and few rules,'' said one, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   And Chinese bioethicists have themselves bemoaned the merging of
academic meeting and sales bazaar. Qiu said that his wife, a
stomach specialist, had attended English-language medical
conferences in Hong Kong, where many of the Chinese doctors could
not understand a word of the proceedings. Drug companies ``pay for
their travel and hotel,'' he said. ``The doctors go sight-seeing
and shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Li, the hospital vice president, said that he disliked the close
relationship between hospitals and drug companies, even though it
now keeps his hospital afloat. ``Now the state gives us policies,
but no money,'' he said. ``So for survival the hospital has to have
more patients and prescribe more drugs and scans.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban Chinese are avid hospital-goers and have a strong bias
towards treating ailments with a tonic or pill. Indeed, every
sneeze in China seems to be greeted with the concerned inquiry,
``Are you taking medicine?'' After a spate of newspaper exposes
about counterfeit pills and the poor quality control at some
Chinese pharmaceutical plants, many people have grown at least a
bit suspicious of domestic products. And _ in handbags or in
medicines _ the Chinese are extremely fond of name brands, leaving
Western pills with gangbuster sales and Chinese hard pressed to
afford them.
</P>
<P>
   At a clinic in Yuyao, a city in Zhejiang province, Dr. Fu Zhiyin
prepared to give 35-year-old Huang Yifeng antibiotic pills for her
serious pelvic infection. How many should she take?
</P>
<P>
   ``She should take 36,'' said Fu, matter-of-factly. ``But it
depends how many she can afford.''

CITY RENOVATING CIVIC BUILDING SCHEDULED FOR DEMOLITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK McGREEVY and DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The city is spending $470,000 to renovate the
one-stop building permit facility at the Van Nuys Civic Center,
even though the building is scheduled to be torn down in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles City Council approved the project based on a
report that failed to say the building will be razed to make way
for the new, $35 million center for government services in the
suburban San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Some city officials said the Valley deserves an improved
building permit office, even if it will be demolished in just two
years. But some council members said that if they had known the
Civic Center was to be torn down, they might have opposed spending
money on remodeling the one-stop permit center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not have been in favor of that,'' said Councilman Nate
Holden. ``The money should be used to remodel only if it was not
going to be demolished.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer also now questions the need for such a
project, said spokesman Daniel Hinerfeld. ``He does not think it
makes sense to pour that kind of capital into a building that is
not going to be around in two years,'' Hinerfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   But Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who championed the
renovation project, said the work is justified. She said the fact
that the demolition wasn't noted in the report is unimportant
because the center is needed, even if just for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that there is a building boom and Van Nuys is
encountering a large number of new applications for permits, I
think it's money well spent,'' Miscikowski said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the money is coming from a surcharge imposed on
each building permit issued, so the city is not spending money from
its general fund.
</P>
<P>
   The $470,000 project was approved by the City Council last month
to relieve crowded conditions at the Van Nuys Construction Service
Center. The office allows residents and developers to obtain
necessary permits from city agencies at a single location.
</P>
<P>
   About $233,000 will be spent to enlarge the public area,
lengthen the public counter and redesign the layout of the office,
said Claire Bartels, the city's project manager for the Van Nuys
Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Other money will be spent to relocate workers to temporary
offices during the renovation. About $100,000 will be spent on
computers and other equipment that can be transferred to the new
Civic Center, Bartels said.
</P>
<P>
   But roughly 80 percent of the cost, or about $376,000, will not
be transferable, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, workers were replacing stand-up counters with
desk-height ones, and they moved them back from the walls to create
a larger waiting area.
</P>
<P>
   When completed, the remodeled center will have a computerized
check-in system and a waiting area with a free fax machine, copier,
computer and phones, said Steve MacDonald, director of development
services for building and safety.
</P>
<P>
   The renovations have been needed but deferred since the
mid-1980s, when the building was last remodeled, MacDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a choice to make: Do we provide improved conditions for
Valley residents now, or make them wait?'' he said. ``And it was
the opinion of our department, the One-Stop Committee, the City
Council and the mayor that we provide the type of customer service
the Valley deserves now.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers waiting for service seemed unaware of the improvements
under way for their benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really familiar with it, but I just stepped in a big
puddle of cement over there,'' said Roger Camras of Van Nuys,
cleaning gray muck off his shoe as he waited to submit plans for a
new garage. ``I don't know what they're doing. Looks like they're
improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Bergerson said the office, whether before or after, was
fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked pretty well before,'' said Bergerson, an architect
in nearby Woodland Hills. ``And anything that they can improve on
will be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Valley civic activists who routinely push to improve Valley
services said the expenditure is wasteful and a sign of poor
planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to spend that kind of money now. It does not
make sense,'' said Gordon Murley, president of the San Fernando
Valley Federation, a coalition of area homeowner groups. ``They can
wait until the new building is finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, also said the
money could be better spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears shortsighted,'' Silver said, noting that the city
needs more money to buy up property around the expanding Civic
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said he is concerned that wasting money will only add
momentum to a create a Valley city that would be separate from Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Don Schultz, president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Association,
said he believes work on a new Civic Center will take more than two
years, which will extend the usefulness of the one-stop permit
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we see this in five years, we'll be lucky,'' Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   Final plans for the new Civic Center, including a lease
arrangement with the developer, are scheduled to go to the City
Council in two months for approval, with construction expected to
take two years. The existing Building and Safety Department
structure will not be demolished until the new Civic Center is
completed, Bartels said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Civic Center is rebuilt, the one-stop permit center
will be relocated there. The 50-year-old building that houses the
office now will be torn down to provide a pedestrian mall, Bartels
said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Close, chairman of Valley Voters Organized Toward
Empowerment, said he wonders whether spending money on a building
permit office is a sign that the city might back away from the
Civic Center project.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always get suspicious when you put more money like this
into a temporary building,'' Close said.

CHINA TO DEPORT FOREIGN REPORTER, SECOND IN A MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 6th graf, Kremb, 41 ..., to CORRECT number of years he
has reported FROM China to EIGHT, sted seven.) 
 (JT) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China Wednesday expelled a reporter for the German
news magazine Der Spiegel, one day after eight officials burst into
his office and accused him of possessing secret documents. The
reporter, Juergen Kremb, said he was told he must leave China
within 48 hours and could not return for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Last month another foreign reporter, from the Japanese newspaper
Yomiuri Shimbun, was also charged with possessing state secrets and
was deported.
</P>
<P>
   Both reporters denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   In China almost any political or economic information that has
not been published in the state media or announced by a senior
official can be defined as a state secret, giving the authorities a
ready tool for attacking people seen as opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Both recent cases involved reporters who have angered security
agencies with their reporting on human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   Kremb, 41, has reported from China for eight years. He is the
author of a recent biography of Wei Jingsheng, the prominent
democracy advocate who was sent from prison into exile in the
United States last fall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Kremb was detained for two days when he visited Wei's
family in Anhui Province. In a spottily enforced rule, journalists
are supposed to obtain the permission of provincial authorities
before conducting interviews anywhere in China.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer Kremb began working in Singapore, but he was in
Beijing this week in the latest of several reporting trips before
his official accreditation and visa to work here as a journalist
expire at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Kremb said the agents who raided his office pushed him roughly
against a wall and read loudly from a document accusing him of
violating the law. They searched the office for three hours, then
confronted him with what they said were secret papers he held, and
demanded that he sign a confession.
</P>
<P>
   Kremb said he had refused to sign, and suggested that the
officers might have planted evidence. ``I was shown documents but
refused to touch or even read them,'' he told the Reuters news
agency. ``I haven't been in my office for a long time and I don't
even know if they were mine.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, the Chinese foreign ministry said,
``Mr. Kremb illegally possessed secret Chinese documents in
violation of the law.'' The security agents lawfully searched
Kremb's office, the statement said, ``found a large amount of
evidence and ordered him to leave China.''
</P>
<P>
   The German foreign ministry said it had complained about the
treatment of Kremb to the Chinese ambassador in Bonn.

KINGS' FISET NERVOUS ABOUT RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ For Stephane Fiset, the past month on the sidelines
has been a taxing time, both physically and mentally, as he's
worked to recover from the effects of the two groin strains that
have deprived the Kings of their No.1 goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't feel like you're part of the team,'' Fiset said
after a full practice Wednesday morning before the Kings' game
against the San Jose Sharks. ``You feel sad and frustrated every
day. You want to go out and help the team win some games.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as soon as tonight, when the Kings play host to the New
York Rangers, Fiset will get the chance to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he says he's ready to go (today),'' Kings coach Larry
Robinson said Wednesday, ``he's in.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he returns tonight _ or Saturday at home against
Chicago, or later than that _ Fiset said he will be a tad wary.
After all, he's working on a two-game groin-straining streak, and
he doesn't want it to reach three.
</P>
<P>
   Originally injured in a 5-5 tie with Colorado on Oct.18, Fiset
returned 10 days later against New Jersey, only to suffer another
groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, I'm going to be thinking about it, and I'm going to
be scared about it,'' Fiset said. ``But if I think about it, I'm
going to go out there and get hurt again. I have to think about
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Storr almost ready: Trainer Peter Demers said goalie Jamie
Storr, who also suffered a groin strain on Oct.18, also is close to
returning. Once he is deemed healthy, Storr may play a couple of
games for the Long Beach Ice Dogs before rejoining the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week from now, hopefully we'll have them both back,'' Demers
said of Fiset and Storr.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, this most likely will mean a return to Long Beach
for goalie Manny Legace. Because he's been with the Kings on
emergency recall, Legace will not need to clear waivers to return
to the minors. Legace did have to clear waivers when the Kings
assigned him to Long Beach before the season.
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Demers said the return of No.1 center Jozef Stumpel
_ who on Monday sprained his right ankle for the second time in two
months _ is uncertain. ``The next day or two will tell us quite a
bit,'' Demers said. ``Once we get past the acute stage of the
injury, we'll take a look at it.'' Stumpel, the Kings' leading
scorer last season, has played in just eight of the Kings' first 19
games.... The healthy scratches against San Jose were center Ray
Ferraro and winger Josh Green.... Defenseman Doug Bodger (broken
hand) may return to the lineup within two weeks.... Eric Lacroix is
the latest King to sport a closely shaven head of hair, joining
Mattias Norstrom, Vladimir Tsyplakov and Ian Laperriere. In fact,
Laperriere was Lacroix's barber. ``You've got to start somewhere,''
Laperriere said when asked about his fledgling career as a
hairdresser. Describing Lacroix's hairdo, Ferraro said, ``You ever
see `Full Metal Jacket?'''

FROGS' WIN SPARKED BY FOWLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jennifer Floyd 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU coach Billy Tubbs posed a rhetorical
question about guard Prince Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think we'd be in trouble if he doesn't play?'' Tubbs
said.
</P>
<P>
   He got his answer in last night's 74-61 victory against New
Orleans (0-1) at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum, and the evidence said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler didn't start, and TCU (3-1) struggled.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said Tubbs had benched him for an altercation with a
teammate in practice this week. Fowler finally came in with 14:54
remaining before halftime, when TCU had more turnovers (4) than
points (2).
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he didn't start Fowler, Tubbs simply said: ``I
didn't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler admitted that he and freshman guard Michael Causey had
exchanged a few pushes and a few unkind words. He said both were
fine now, and that he had learned from his experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing serious. I understood what coach Tubbs meant,''
Fowler said about being unable to start. ``I had to wake up after
that. I know this team needs me.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU lost Fowler again late in the second half when he aggravated
a groin strain after slipping on a wet spot on the floor. Fowler
said he had been struggling with the strain for about a week, but
that he'd likely play in Saturday's game at UT-El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped he'd sit out the whole game,'' New Orleans coach Joey
Stiebing said. ``I think he was the key to the game. Every time we
got close, he hit big shots.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fowler came in, he immediately assisted on buckets by Lee
Nailon and Ryan Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a couple of crucial 3-pointers in helping the Horned
Frogs distance themselves from pesky New Orleans. He finished with
15 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's in, everything runs so smooth,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs looked anything but smooth in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   They attempted to bang the ball inside to Nailon despite double
teams that swamped him. Turnovers resulted, 25 in all and 12 that
Tubbs characterized as careless and unforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had Lee Nailon, I'd be trying to get it to him, too,''
Stiebing said.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans anticipated this and sent a swarm of bodies to
surround him. His shots were all contested. His body constantly
banged. His arm constantly bumped.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon finished with 17 points, seven on free throws, and 12
rebounds, and Frogs forward Marquise Gainous had 14 points and 12
rebounds. It was the first time both players had a double-double in
the same game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to shoot when you have 210 pounds draped on your
arm,'' Tubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Stiebing said that had been his plan. He wanted to force
somebody other than Nailon beat him.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler answered that call when he came in. He said being unable
to start had inspired him, as he had been trying to do in practice.
He said he just got a little too aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get a fire into the team because we've been
slacking,'' Fowler said. ``Nobody has stepped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler looks like he just did.

McKAY WAS ARCHITECT OF USC POWERHOUSE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was no one, not Bear Bryant, not Woody Hayes, not Bo
Schembechler, not Bob Devaney, not anyone else at the time, bigger
in college football than John McKay was in 1975 when he decided to
leave the sport.
</P>
<P>
   There was no one who had a built a stronger program than the
colossus he created during his 16 seasons at the University of
Southern California when his teams went 127-40-8.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, John McKay willingly gave up his fiefdom and the power and
adulation that went with it to accept a lucrative offer to take
command of an NFL expansion team called the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   He would have moments of success with the Buccaneers during
those three seasons the team qualified for the playoffs, but there
were lengthy bleak periods like a 26-game losing streak that
resulted in his having to endure national mockery and cruel
ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   It always has been the feeling here that John McKay chose the
wrong career path, that he would have become one of the revered
figures of American athletics had he remained at USC.
</P>
<P>
   I've always wondered about his feelings on the subject, and I
finally got a chance to ask him about it the other day when I
reached him at his home in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any regrets about leaving USC when you did?'' I
asked McKay, who wound up 44-88-1 during his nine seasons with the
Bucs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought at the time it was good for me to make a change,''
he said. ``I had gone about as far as I could go at the university.
They weren't making me a wealthy man. I was making $48,000 at the
time I left.''
</P>
<P>
   John McKay would earn a lot more money working for Hugh
Culverhouse in Tampa Bay, but he never again would ascend to the
dizzying heights he did when his Trojans were rolling through the
autumns with a monotonous ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``So no regrets leaving USC?'' I said again.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief pause, but this time John McKay answered
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, to be honest with you, I wish I never would have
left,'' he said. ``I was happier in L.A. The people treated me so
well there. I've been treated well in Florida, too. But it was
different in L.A. I think the family liked it better there. I wish
I had never left.''
</P>
<P>
   McKay's voice evokes images of USC gridiron grandeur ...
astounding comebacks against Notre Dame, O.J. Simpson's 64-yard,
game-winning, Rose Bowl-clinching run against UCLA, Anthony Davis'
spectacular kickoff returns, historic victories over Alabama,
maulings of Woody Hayes, national championships, etc., etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   His voice still is strong and vibrant, as it was when it barked
orders to a generation of athletes that turned USC into the most
feared football school in the country.
</P>
<P>
   John McKay is 75 years old now and has been out of coaching
since 1984, but has continued to watch both college and pro
football games on television.
</P>
<P>
   He admits one of the most astonishing developments during his
departure has unfolded in L.A., where the Trojans have not beaten
the Bruins since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   When McKay was at USC, he had a 10-5-1 record against UCLA, and
the longest losing streak he had against the Trojans' crosstown
rivals was two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe that USC has lost seven straight games to
UCLA?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope ... and I don't understand why it has happened,'' he
replied. ``It just doesn't seem right.''
</P>
<P>
   Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess times change,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, times do change, as USC, once the dominant football
power in this vicinity, has suffered the indignity of being
enveloped in UCLA's shadow in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think of this year's game?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we (the Trojans) have a good chance,'' he said. ``UCLA
no doubt scores a lot of points, but its defense has had problems.
You always have a chance against a team struggling on defense. I
also think the Trojans have been getting stronger and stronger as
the season has gone on. I like the new quarterback (Carson Palmer).
I think there could be an upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, John McKay has many memories of the UCLA-USC matches,
but two stand out most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the highlight of the series for me was O.J. Simpson's
scoring run in the 1967 game that resulted in a Rose Bowl
appearance and national championship for us,'' said McKay. ``It was
just an incredible run. I'm not sure a normal running back would
have gained more than a couple of yards. It's probably the play
shown most often in re-runs of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there was that game in 1973 when we came down the
tunnel before pre-game introductions, and noticed the UCLA players
holding roses. If they beat us, they were going to go to the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Jimmy Sims (Trojan linebacker) was standing next to me,
and said, `Those guys are holding those roses like they think they
have a chance to win.' We wound up beating the Bruins and knocking
them out of the Rose Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   John McKay will watch Saturday's UCLA-USC game on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the full ESPN cable football package and that allows me
to watch all the important college games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and wife Corky live a tranquil life these days in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get up early, do some reading, go down to the country club,
spend a few hours there, and I'm back at home by 1:30,'' said
McKay, who still spends the first three months of each year in Palm
Desert. ``I'm usually in bed by 9 o'clock. When you're my age,
sleep becomes quite important.''
</P>
<P>
   What was John McKay's fondest recollection at USC?
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, the 1974 game against Notre Dame when we won 55-24
after trailing 24-0 late in the first half,'' he said. ``My line on
that game was that I got tied up in freeway traffic during the
first half, and made an appearance in the second half when we
scored 49 points. Nothing at USC topped that game, but I had a lot
of other great memories.''

NORTHRIDGE SUCCESS EVEN SURPRISES PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ The easy way out was to eliminate football.
Drop it and Cal State Northridge's athletic budgetary worries would
evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four years ago, the administration said no, choosing to
build the football program into a flagship sport that would
eventually draw nationwide recognition.
</P>
<P>
   People laughed at the notion, pointing to the football team's
perennial losing record. There was no way the Matadors could rise
to the top of the Big Sky Conference, arguably the best Division
I-AA football league in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In a short time, CSUN has come a long way. The 23rd-ranked
Matadors are a win away from their first conference title in 37
seasons and a likely first playoff bid. The lone obstacle is a
beaten-down Idaho State, whose program is in such turmoil that
coach Tom Walsh's firing takes effect at the end of Saturday's game
at Holt Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's solution was to drop it and some people in the
administration made some very courageous decisions to stick with it
and to make the jump into a legitimate football conference,'' said
assistant head coach Jeff Kearin, in his fourth year at CSUN. ``The
real courageous part was the administration saying, `Let's make
this a football school.' Ever since that time, the only talk of
dropping football has been by people that don't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in CSUN's past provided an indication this was possible.
Not four years ago and certainly not coming into this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be a rough season,'' CSUN junior
defensive end Brennen Swanson said. ``I knew we had good things to
come with (coach Ron) Ponciano coming in, but I didn't think it was
going to be this year. After spring practice but before the season,
I knew we were going to have a pretty good team. I just didn't know
how good.''
</P>
<P>
   A steady increase in scholarships from 17 to 50, going up to 55
next season, helped CSUN's movement, as did a bevy of Division I-A
transfers who found their way to the school during the summer. CSUN
opened training camp in August with 49 players who weren't with the
4-8 Matadors of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   More administrative support, mostly behind the scenes, enabled
Ponciano to dream during training camp until...
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line was devastated by injuries. So the philosophy
of patchwork _ usually implemented to keep the program afloat _ was
refocused toward keeping the offense from falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Taffe Aina was an academic casualty. Beau Cherry, Mike Barnes
and Joe Bergman went down with injuries. All of a sudden, freshmen
Tim Shoffeitt and Keith Kincaid were starting on the right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a very nice transition from a really bad I-AA team
to the 15th-ranked team in the power ratings,'' Ponciano said.
``Early, I thought we could make a run. There wasn't a coach in the
Big Sky that didn't think they could make a run. Then the stuff
happened with the offensive line, and you think, `Oh, boy, how can
we keep this going?' But right now we have a good chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely season has the Matadors (7-3, 5-2 Big Sky) a win
from the league title. If they defeat Idaho State (2-8, 1-6), they
would claim a share of the conference title. If that happens and
Montana beats Montana State, the Matadors would gain the league's
automatic bid to the playoffs. If Montana State and CSUN win, the
Matadors would have to wait for a 10 a.m. call Sunday to get an
at-large bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought we'd be in this position,'' senior wide
receiver Mike Ogas said. ``I saw Aaron Flowers graduate, Marc
Goodson graduate, a couple other key seniors graduate. We were
losing leadership.... I never thought we'd win the Big Sky this
year. It's still amazing to me that we're in this spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Ponciano said defensive linemen Sean Beard (leg) and
Jacob Mageo (knee) most likely won't make the trip. He also said he
is leaning toward leaving defensive lineman Quinton Reed (shoulder)
home.... It's unlikely kicker Manny Marquez will go to Idaho,
leaving punter Ethan Beck as the place-kicker.

PATRIOTS SET TO ANNOUNCE MOVE TO DOWNTOWN HARTFORD  
(rl-nk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. &UR;  &LR; _ Gov. John G. Rowland and the owner of the New
England Patriots scheduled a news conference at the Capitol
Thursday to announce an agreement to move the National Football
League team from Massachusetts to downtown Hartford, a spokesman
for the governor said early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials have agreed to build a stadium for the
owner, Robert K. Kraft, in return for 10 percent of its revenues
over the 30 years of the agreement. The stadium is expected to take
three years to build, meaning that the first games would be played
in the stadium in 2001. The league would have to approve any move
by the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   A tentative agreement, which was reached in a matter of days
after years of on-and-off talks, came in a late-night phone call
between Rowland and Kraft, according to Dean C. Pagani, the
governor's spokesman. Stacey T. James, the Patriots' director of
media relations, confirmed that he expected an announcement
Thursday about the team's relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford Mayor Michael P. Peters said the team would lure
businesses and visitors, helping to rescue a city that has tried in
frustrating fits and starts to emerge from decades of decay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ripple effect is beyond belief,'' he said. ``We won't just
be known for finance or insurance. Now, we've got all the pieces of
the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, working on the final details of the deal at the Capitol
on Wednesday, said the Patriots would do more in one stroke to help
downtown Hartford than countless smaller projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge deal for everybody,'' he said, coatless and in
shirtsleeves as he shuttled between his office and a stadium war
room that he set up. ``In the scheme of the things we could do,
this is an 800-pound gorilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, Rowland summoned two dozen legislative and
business leaders to show off drawings of the proposed stadium and
explain how it would be paid for. The stadium would be part of a
$350 million redevelopment project on the Connecticut River that
would include a convention center and a hotel, state officials
said. The state had already committed $300 million to build a
redevelopment project on the site, known as Adriaen's Landing.
Kraft would pay no money for the stadium, but would be expected to
help pay for another part of the project, possibly the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The deal seems to carry risk for all the parties involved.
Hartford lost its National Hockey League team, the Whalers, in
1996, raising questions about its ability to support a major league
franchise. And the National Football League, which lacks teams in
Houston and Los Angeles, would be adding Boston to its list of
lucrative markets without a team.
</P>
<P>
   But Kraft has said through years of bitter negotiations with
Massachusetts officials that he was determined to keep the team in
New England.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut lawmakers said that in recent conversations Kraft
has said he was livid that the Massachusetts Legislature had not
come up with an acceptable plan to replace the team's Foxboro
Stadium, which is 27 years old. He said that if Connecticut's final
offer met his needs, he would take it and not seek to match it in
Massachusetts, according to legislators who spoke to him.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft proposed to spend $200 million for a new stadium near the
current one, 30 miles of south Boston, and in return he wanted the
state to pay $72 million to buy land, build roads, and install
lighting and other utility lines. The Massachusetts Senate passed
the package. But Thomas Finneran, speaker of the Massachusetts
House, and his colleagues in the House refused to approve more than
$57 million, which killed the deal for Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that aides to Roland and Kraft were working on
the deal, Finneran was once again refusing to come to the aid of
the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes them special?'' Finneran said outside his office.
``What makes them different? What makes them entitled to a deal
that goes beyond the bounds of anything that's reasonable and quite
frankly bullies and pillages the taxpayers?''
</P>
<P>
   Acting Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci, who supported the Senate plan,
said Wednesday in a statement, ``I urge the citizens of the
Commonwealth to call their state representatives and let them know
they want to keep the Pats here.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Aiello, the National Football League's vice president of
public relations, said a move would require the approval of 24 of
the league's 31 clubs. ``The fact that the Patriots would be
staying in New England would be viewed as a positive by the rest of
the league,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when Connecticut officials last made a pass for
the team, legislators became boosters, parading around the Capitol
in Patriots caps and jerseys. This time, to avoid being used as a
bargaining chip by Kraft in his negotiations with the Massachusetts
Legislature, Rowland conducted the talks quietly and played down
the possibility in public.
</P>
<P>
   So legislative leaders were taken by surprise on Monday morning,
when Rowland told them that he had made an offer to Kraft during a
two-hour meeting on Friday, and that he seemed ready to move.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kraft has not commented publicly on his plans, he flew
into Hartford on Monday afternoon and signaled his approval of the
proposal by visiting legislators to answer their questions.
</P>
<P>
   A special session of the Connecticut Legislature would be called
next month to approve the project. ``We don't want to give
Massachusetts time to react,'' said a senior official involved in
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Moira K. Lyons, a Democrat from Stamford who is the
incoming Speaker of the Connecticut House, said she wanted to see
more financial details before she would commit to supporting the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a lot of enthusiasm, and that's
understandable,'' she said. ``But we have an obligation to look at
it and analyze it to be sure it will be beneficial to the region
and to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local officials expressed caution, however, saying that the
Patriots alone were not a solution to a downtown that seems
deserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be an Atlantic City, where we have one
shining strip and two blocks away there's dire need,'' said state
Rep. Marie M. Kirkley-Bey, a Democrat from Hartford. ``Those of us
who have districts where there is a lot of blight would hope
there's a way to use the project to help refurbish our
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   As sketched by legislative and administration officials, the
deal calls for a 65,000-seat open-air stadium with a grass surface.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would last for 30 years, and the stadium would be
paid for with the sale of bonds. State officials said that to pay
off the bonds, Kraft would pay the state a 10 percent cut of
tickets, concessions and parking.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the stadium would not impose any new costs
on taxpayers. But skeptics in the Legislature who have reviewed the
plan said it relied on quite optimistic projections of attendance.

 ALICE McDERMOTT WINS NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FOR FICTION 
 (nk) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alice McDermott, author of ``Charming Billy,'' a
quiet novel about Irish-Americans and the way a lost love can
continue to haunt a life, was the surprise winner of the National
Book Award for fiction Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The expected winner had been Tom Wolfe's `` A Man in Full''
(Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux), a big, muscular book about race and real
estate in the New South. It also beat another strong contender,
``Damascus Gate'' (Houghton Mifflin) by Robert Stone, the story of
a conspiracy to blow up the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the judging panel for fiction, Thomas Mallon,
said ``Charming Billy'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux) had ``a voice
like nothing we could recall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It found us,'' he said. ``It was what we kept hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel is told from the point of view of a young narrator
about two men: her father and his cousin Billy, a romantic charmer
who falls in love with an Irish housemaid. Billy thinks he has lost
her when he is told she has died. But years later, he discovers
that she is living. Now married to a plain and devoted wife, Maeve,
Billy sees his decision to marry as a betrayal of ``the faith he
had sworn to an unrealized future.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDermott, who lives in Washington and was a National Book
Award finalist in 1987 for her novel ``That Night'' was taken aback
by the award. She hadn't even bothered to compose an acceptance
speech, she told the crowd of over 800 people at the ceremony at
the Marriott Marquis Hotel in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be true to my Irish heritage if I thought this were
entirely a good thing,'' Ms. McDermott said. ``I will clutch onto
my Irish humility with great vigor.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonfiction award went to Edward Ball for his first book,
``Slaves in the Family,'' about his search for the descendants of
the slaves owned by his ancestors in South Carolina, and his
attempt to confront the moral burden of slavery. Ball, who was a
columnist for The Village Voice, said he planned to use a fourth of
his book's earnings to set up a foundation with both black and
white members ``to create restitution programs we design
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the poetry award was Gerald Stern for ``This Time:
New and Selected Poems'' (W.W. Norton). Stern, whose book is a
summary of a lifetime's work of poems about the city, memory and
faith, was the expected winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I, like a hare, like a hare, like a hare, I watch the
turtle lift a leg,'' Stern said, reciting from one of his poems,
``then head for home roaring with vigor.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Sachar won the award for young people's literature for
``Holes'' (Francis Foster Books/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux), his
darkly humorous story of a teen-ager who is wrongly sent to a
juvenile detention center.
</P>
<P>
   Each winner received $10,000, with $1,000 each for the
runners-up.
</P>
<P>
   The National Book Foundation, which administers the awards, gave
John Updike, author of 49 books, the 1998 National Book Foundation
Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and
$10,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech, Updike remembered his childhood and
falling in love with books. He recalled going to the library with
his mother, who wrote fiction but suffered many rejections.
Nonetheless it was she, Updike said, who imbued him with his love
of books.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something glamorous about the Reading, Pennsylvania,
Library,'' Updike said, ``a romantic savor to the much thumbed
books.''
</P>
<P>
   Updike noted that he had won the National Book Award twice
before. First for ``The Centaur,'' his first novel, in 1963 _ ``a
moment I am still dizzy from,'' he said _ and then for ``Rabbit Is
Rich'' in 1981. ``Like some graying comet I return every 17 years
or so from the realm of the unnominated,'' Updike said.
</P>
<P>
   As they are nearly every year, this year's nominations, chosen
from 916 titles submitted by publishers, were the subject of some
second-guessing by publishers and editors, especially because
several major novels, including Philip Roth's ``I Married a
Communist,'' Updike's ``Bech at Bay,'' Russell Banks's
``Cloudsplitter'' and Ron Chernow's biography of John D.
Rockefeller Sr., failed to receive nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright Wendy Wasserstein, who was host at the awards,
said that the ceremony was a celebration of ``the author's craft,
integrity, loneliness and insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What this evening is about,'' Ms. Wasserstein said, ``is the
continuity of the American voice.''

SMALL SALE AT CHRISTIE'S YIELDS PRICES TO MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `It was ..., to CORRECT quote. )  
 (js) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dealers and collectors who jammed Christie's Park
Avenue salesroom Wednesday night kept a watchful eye on prices as
Impressionist and 19th-century artworks by masters like Monet and
Signac, Cezanne and Bonnard, spun around on the turntable. Only
when a top-quality work was offered did the room come alive with
bidders. Even then, heads remained cool, and only 14 works out of
the 43 offered exceeded the expected price.
</P>
<P>
   The sale totaled $44.9 million, less than its low estimate of
$47.6 million. Only 35 of the works found buyers.
</P>
<P>
   One of Wednesday night's most popular paintings, and the most
expensive work of the evening, was Monet's ``Boatmen at
Argenteuil'' (1874), being sold by the heirs of the Paris dealer
Paul Durand-Ruel. The sun-dappled scene of sailors and rowers,
which had not been on the market since 1895, was estimated at $6
million to $8 million. Three people seriously wanted the painting,
and after bids flew around the room, it went to David Nahmad, a
Manhattan dealer, for $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite surprising, the number of people who really
fought to buy the Monet,'' said Franck Giraud, head of
Impressionist and 19th-century art at Christie's. ``It is
Impressionism at its best.''
</P>
<P>
   Vuillard's ``Conversation (Terra Cotta Pot),'' a tapestry-like
1895 domestic interior from the artist's Nabi period, had four
people who wanted to take it home. It sold to an unidentified
bidder for $4.7 million, the second highest price ever paid for a
painting by the artist.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   Christie's had an advantage over Sotheby's, which had its sales
of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art on Monday and Tuesday
evenings. After those sales produced mixed results, Christie's
warned sellers of the tepid market (as both auction houses
generally do, given the chance), and in some cases, reserves _
secret minimum prices agreed upon by the sellers and the auction
house _ were obviously lowered.
</P>
<P>
   Which, in some cases, made the difference between selling a
painting and not selling. Often, works sold for far below their low
estimates. Courbet's ``View of Ornans and Its Steeple'' (1858),
which had been owned by the British Rail Pension Fund Collection
until it was sold at Sotheby's in London in 1990, was again on
offer Wednesday night. It went to an unidentified telephone buyer
for $607,500, far below its $800,000 low estimate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Monet was well represented, but the results were mixed. His
``View of the Water Lily Pond'' (1917-19) was estimated at $6
million to $8 million but sold to an unidentified telephone bidder
for $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another Monet, ``The Ducal Palace,'' a 1908 scene of the Grand
Canal in Venice with the palace reflected on the water, was
estimated at $3.5 million to $4.5 million. Nobody was willing to
pay more than $2.7 million, and it went unsold.
</P>
<P>
   Other water scenes performed well. Signac's ``Concarneau.
Morning Calm. Opus 219 (Larghetto),'' from 1891, was painted at a
time when the artist was inspired by his love of music, combining
colors that were divided and then harmonized in much the same way a
composer produces a melody. The scene of boats on the water was
expected to bring $2.5 million to $3.5 million. Three bidders tried
to buy it, and the painting eventually sold for $4.4 million to
David Nash, the former director of Impressionist and modern art at
Sotheby's, who now runs Mitchell-Innes &AMP; Nash, a Madison Avenue
gallery with his wife, Lucy Mitchell-Innes.
</P>
<P>
   Another strong price was paid for Bonnard's ``Tea in the
Garden'' (1891). Estimated at $800,000 to $1.2 million, it finally
sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   An 1877 Cezanne landscape, ``The Winding Road,'' had three
people wanting it, but at the right price. It sold to an
unidentified bidder for $2.8 million, its low estimate.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, pastel dancers by Degas brought big prices, but
not on Wednesday night. ``Le Pas Battu'' (1879), estimated at $2
million to $3 million, remained unsold when nobody wanted to pay
more than $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   As generally happens when bidding is controlled, bottom-fishers,
especially dealers, came out in full force. ``Prices have been so
strong until now that dealers couldn't afford to buy,'' said
Abigail Asher, a Manhattan dealer. ``It was clear tonight that the
Impressionist market is still trying to find its price point.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some happy buyers were seen leaving the sale. Scott
Black, president of Delphi Management in Boston, took home a
Bernard and a Toulouse-Lautrec. ``Good paintings found buyers,'' he
said. ``But overall the evening was pretty lackluster.''

RANGERS' GONZALEZ IS NAMED MVP FOR AMERICAN LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAY CORIO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pattern seems apparent: the New York Yankees win the pennant
and Juan Gonzalez captures the most valuable player award.
</P>
<P>
   It unfolded again Wednesday when Gonzalez, the slugging
outfielder for the Texas Rangers, was named American League MVP for
the second time in three seasons in the kind of landslide vote the
1998 Yankees could identify with.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when the Yankees eliminated Gonzalez's Rangers in
the first round of the playoffs on the way to a pennant and World
Series title, Gonzalez beat Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez,
290-287, to win the MVP ``The first time was too tight,'' he said
Wednesday, speaking from San Juan, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   This season, when the Yankees became one of the best teams of
the century with a league-record 114 victories, they knocked the
Rangers out in Round 1 again en route to another Series title. And
Gonzalez, in a romp of his own, beat another shortstop, Nomar
Garciaparra of the Boston Red Sox, 357-232.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for this year was staying healthy, playing 154
games,'' Gonzalez said. ``When I'm healthy, I'm putting up the best
numbers I can.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 numbers helped make him the first Latin American native
to win two MVP awards. Gonzalez batted .318 with 45 home runs and
157 RBIs, the most RBI in the American League since Ted Williams
and Vern Stephens each had 159 for Boston in 1949. Gonzalez had 101
RBIs by the All-Star Game break.
</P>
<P>
   In voting by two baseball writers from each of the league's 14
cities, Gonzalez received 21 of the 28 first-place votes and seven
seconds. Garciaparra, last season's rookie of the year, had five
firsts, seven seconds and seven thirds.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who were saluted all season for their emphasis on
team play rather than individual accomplishments, underscored that
in the MVP voting with four players among the first 16. Shortstop
Derek Jeter received two firsts, six seconds and three thirds and
finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Bernie Williams was seventh with 96 points, right
fielder Paul O'Neill 12th and David Wells, who pitched a perfect
game and had an 18-4 record, was 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Not often does a team as proficient as the 1998 Yankees, who won
the division by 22 games and the World Series in a sweep, fail to
produce a serious contender for MVP.
</P>
<P>
   On the 1961 Yankees, for example, Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle
finished 1-2, and three teammates were in the top 14.
</P>
<P>
   On Cincinnati's Big Red Machine teams of 1975 and 1976, Joe
Morgan was a two-time winner, with Pete Rose, Johnny Bench and
George Foster in the hunt. And on the powerful 1970 Baltimore
Orioles, Boog Powell led the voting, with Brooks Robinson and Frank
Robinson also in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the Yankees' showing in this year's MVP voting most
closely resembles that of their crosstown rivals, the Mets, among
highly successful teams of recent decades. When the Mets won 108
games and a World Series in 1986, their best MVP showing _ like the
1998 Yankees _ was third (Gary Carter). They also had a fourth
(Keith Hernandez), a 14th (Ray Knight) and a 17th (Roger McDowell).
The Phillies' Mike Schmidt topped the voting.

CHRIS DUNDEE, 91, PROMOTER OF HUNDREDS OF BOXING BOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Pa., Va., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Dundee, who promoted hundreds of fights and turned Miami
Beach into a boxing center in a career that spanned six decades,
died at the Miami Jewish Home for the Aged on Nov. 16. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Dundee promoted eight world championship fights, including the
Miami Beach bout in which Muhammad Ali, then known as Cassius Clay,
won the world heavyweight title with a knockout of Sonny Liston on
Feb. 25, 1964.
</P>
<P>
   An older brother of the trainer Angelo Dundee _ both of them are
members of the International Boxing Hall of Fame _ he also promoted
bouts for such renowned fighters as Sugar Ray Robinson, Jake
LaMotta, Ezzard Charles, Archie Moore, Kid Gavilan, George Foreman
and Sugar Ray Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   Born Cristofo Mirena in Philadelphia on Feb. 25, 1907, he
changed his last name to Dundee as a teen-ager, following the lead
of his older brother, Joe, a club fighter in South Philadelphia at
the time, who had taken the name of a noted fighter, Johnny Dundee.
</P>
<P>
   Dundee dropped out of school at 13, had an abortive stint as a
boxer, and then moved to Norfolk, Va., in 1932. It was there that
he discovered a naval recruit named Ken Overlin, who possessed a
punishing right hand. Overlin became world middleweight champion in
1940, giving Dundee his first national exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Dundee was later a promoter in Richmond, Va., Washington and New
York before setting up his headquarters in Miami Beach. It was 1950
and he quickly put the city _ and his Fifth Avenue Gym _ on the
nation's boxing map.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was Mr. Chamber of Commerce on Miami Beach, because he
promoted the first televised fight out of here,'' Angelo Dundee
said, referring to the Livio Minelli-Bobby Dykes fight. In 1952,
Dundee put together what was believed to have been the first
interracial bout in Florida, in which Kid Gavilan of Cuba, who was
black, successfully defended his welterweight title against Bobby
Dykes. The bout helped break down barriers against interracial
fights in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Dundee's gym in Miami Beach was the center of his operations for
more than 30 years. In the 1960s, Ali kept in shape in the three
and a half years he was banned from boxing because he refused to
register for the draft. Joe Louis and Rocky Marciano also trained
at the gym, which was razed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Kaplan, a boxing historian, remembered how Dundee had a
keen sense of when to show his face around fight fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he put on a great show, he'd walk out with the patrons
and accept all the handshakes and congratulations,'' Kaplan said.
``On the rare occasion he'd have a stinko, he'd hide. You couldn't
find him. But his shows usually were class acts. They went like
clockwork.''
</P>
<P>
   As much success as he enjoyed, Dundee never thought the old days
were better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like boxing better today,'' he said shortly before suffering
a stroke in 1990 that incapacitated him. ``Who wants yesterday?
Yesterday is gone. Who ever heard of Jimmy Durante? The kids today
don't know him. They don't know a Jack Dempsey either.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't forget the old-timers. Former champions and club
fighters alike remembered him for his annual parties on
Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his brother Angelo, Dundee is survived by a son,
Michael; a daughter, Suzanne Bonner; his brother Frankie Mirena; a
sister, Mary Galone, and two grandchildren.

 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Craig Salazar walked into the basement, his face
betrayed his pain. He was worried about his grandmother, who was
gravely ill in the hospital, and annoyed that he had got himself
suspended from school for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike so many of his friends, Craig, 14, had a way to
channel his stress. Picking up a carpenter's plane, he began to
drag it briskly and repeatedly along a quarter-inch-thick piece of
mahogany plywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I do this, it just clears my mind,'' he told a visitor
between strokes, as the layers of wood peeled away and the
tightness in his forehead receded. ``I think about what I am
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   What he was doing was building a boat _ a 14-foot replica of a
19th-century Hudson River rowboat known as a Whitehall _ in the
basement of an apartment building in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems a bit of a non sequitur to be sanding, hammering and
gluing together a wooden rowboat in such a space _ one that, just
weeks earlier, had stored rusty appliances _ then that's sort of
the point, Adam Green says.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Green, a 25-year-old graduate of Vassar, opened an
after-school boat-building workshop for neighborhood children in
the basement of the New Settlement Apartments, a mixed-income
development that rose from the rubble of Morris Heights eight years
ago and now includes 300 formerly homeless families among the 900
families that reside there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of the last thing you'd think of as happening where
it's happening,'' said Green, whose wiry red beard gives him the
look of a mariner, albeit not an ancient one. ``I want the kids to
do something that stands out completely from anything they've ever
done before and from anything that anyone around them has seen
happen in their community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't,'' he added, ``have to go to Maine to build a
boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he plastered the neighborhood last month with posters
bearing an Uncle-Sam-wants-you come-on _ ``Build a 14-foot wooden
boat from scratch and then sail it in the rivers around the Bronx''
_ 10 teen-agers signed up to join Green on his 12-week construction
project. (Two additional boats are to be built in the shop by
different groups of children beginning early next year.)
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have become regular fixtures in the shop are
Jeffrey Bernardez, 13, an eighth-grader who dreams of becoming a
professional wrestler but who is as comfortable with a screwdriver
as a pile driver; Erika Torres, 13, the shop's only female worker,
who quickly impressed the boys with woodworking skills mostly
superior to theirs, and Collin Powell, 14, who is not named after
the general _ ``I have the same middle initial, but mine's for
Lashawn and his is Luther'' _ but who does share his charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait till I get here,'' said Collin, surveying the
shop in his work wear, a blue-and-gray-striped rugby jersey
untucked at the waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little crazy,'' he said of the project's mission. ``But
you're like the first to do it. I feel special.''
</P>
<P>
   To Green, whose carpentry experience was largely limited to a
summer spent building houses upstate and whose major in college was
Hudson Valley storytelling and folk tales, the fashioning of a boat
out of a pile of white oak planks and plywood is a vehicle to many
educational outposts. But the setting in which the teen-agers are
learning is intended to be as unlike school as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Collin, for one, has noticed. ``We don't have to write down
stuff,'' he said. ``We don't have to bring textbooks. You get
treated like an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Green has already used the design phase to teach his crew about
geometry, fractions and trigonometry. He's also plied his charges
with history lessons describing the Whitehall's role in the 1800s
as a ship-to-shore transporter of food and supplies, as well as a
small ferry from the Battery to points north.
</P>
<P>
   Two weekends ago, he took his young workers rowing on the Harlem
River on a boat just a foot longer than the one they are building,
giving them a sneak peak at the finished product and a glimpse of
the aquatic life just one and a quarter miles away from their homes
_ 14 brick buildings clustered near 172nd Street and Townsend
Avenue. The boat they rowed was built several years ago by Floating
the Apple, a Manhattan organization seeking to draw attention to
the city's waterways.
</P>
<P>
   The dreamer that frequently seizes hold of Green's speech makes
clear that his and his workers' journey is as much a philosophical
one as one intended to steer them clear of the temptations of the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to learn something from creating,'' he said, ``then
to use it to transport ourselves to places that give us a whole new
realm of experience: That's phenomenally powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the three afternoons each week that he meets
with the teen-agers, Green demonstrates what he wants his crew to
do, and then gets out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Delegating Collin and Jeffrey, the wrestler, to pare down the
outer keel, Green crouched beside them at the side of a wooden
workbench, the beam held tight in a vise, and showed them how bumpy
it looked. He told them how they could tell if they were planing in
the right direction. ``If you're going with the grain, it's a
smooth sound and it looks kind of shiny,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each boy then grabbed his plane with both hands and, standing
sideways next to the wood, began propelling it in short bursts
across the wood's surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like punching,'' Jeffrey told an observer.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, pausing to survey his work, he confessed he was
having trouble seeing the finished product in his mind, with nine
weeks still to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like the bottom of the boat,'' he said of the
plank, which was narrow at its tips but grew gradually wider on
either side to its midsection. ``To me, it looks like a
surfboard.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Green, the son of a social worker and an editor in the
publications department of the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, learned to love the water at a young age. Though he grew
up on Central Park West at 95th Street, he was a frequent visitor
aboard the Clearwater, the 106-foot sloop that the folk singer Pete
Seeger helped launch as a floating classroom on the lower Hudson
River 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Clearwater's twofold mission, to teach about the environment
and to promote conservation, influenced Green greatly, and Seeger
is serving as an informal adviser on Green's project.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview from his home overlooking the Hudson at the
Newburgh-Beacon Bridge, Seeger said, ``They are learning that life
is more than just, `Sit there and keep an eye on the screen,' or
standing around doing the same thing over and over, making just
enough money to pay the rent and feed themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Green took time off in his senior year at Vassar to work and
live as a crew member on the Clearwater. He built on that monthlong
experience by volunteering to help students at an East Harlem
junior high school construct a small dinghy, using a diagram from a
magazine as his guide. It was the first boat he had ever built, and
he was as amazed as his students when it survived a test float in
the school pool.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Green came to the conclusion that there was a career
in such work, and last year he brought his idea to Hostos Community
College in the Bronx, where he led an after-school crew in the
construction of his first Whitehall. It took eight months.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he has expanded his operation greatly. During the
summer, he raised $53,000 in grant money, enough to pay his $30,000
salary and buy material for three boats, as well as to pay two
part-time assistants.
</P>
<P>
   He moved the project to New Settlement, which provides him with
work space, electricity and a pool of eager volunteer crew members.
He chose the housing development, he said, in part because he loved
the idea of showing the children that a boat could arise from the
basement of one of the places they live in.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, the boy whose fighting earned him a week's suspension
from school, said he had arrived at Green's shop under duress. His
older sister had all but forced him to join, he said, ``to keep me
out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says, he needs no prodding to go to the shop. Jeffrey
went further, saying that, though it had not altered his plans for
a career in the ring, working in the shop had him thinking about
starting a similar after-school program wherever he chooses to
settle down.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he should wait to see if the boat floats, when it is
launched during a neighborhood festival in the spring, Jeffrey grew
insistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you work with all the people and you picture how it's going
to float _ no cracks, no leaks _ it will float,'' he said. ``You've
got to have confidence.''

   ANAHEIM _ Wayne Gretzky might be The Great One, but Marty
McInnis is proving to be the great pickup of the year, and Guy
Hebert is just playing great.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis scored the game-winning goal and Hebert made 29 saves as
the Mighty Ducks defeated the New York Rangers 3-1 Wednesday night
before 15,245 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' fourth win in five games moved them over the .500
mark (7-6-4) for the first time since Nov. 14, 1997, when they were
8-7-5. It also improved Anaheim's record over New York to 6-2-1
overall and 5-0 at the Pond, which has become the Rangers' personal
house of blues.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway Blues were already in a major funk coming in. New
York (4-8-5) is dead last in the Eastern Conference and has won
only once in its last seven games (1-4-2).
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers outshot the Ducks 30-16 on Wednesday, but they were
scoreless on the power play and gave up game-winning goal in the
third period after Kevin Stevens took a foolish elbowing penalty.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis gave the Ducks the lead for good with 13:18 left in the
game with a big assist from Paul Kariya while Anaheim was on the
power play. Kariya, playing the left point, faked Adam Graves to
the ice, skated around the the New York forward and got shot off.
Mike Richter made the save, but he had no chance when McInnis
picked up the rebound in the slot and wristed in his fifth goal as
a member of the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya later iced the game with an empty-net goal in the final
minute of play.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis' goal came less than two minutes after Hebert had turned
away another New York threat, stopping a shot by Niklas Sundstrom
on a two-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   After spending much of the first period killing penalties, the
Ducks couldn't generate any offense until the Rangers got yet
another power play chance late in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim had managed but one shot in 15 minutes, but just after
Pavel Trnka stepped back on the ice, Steve Rucchin intercepted
Alexei Kovalev's pass intended for Brian Leetch and was off on a
breakaway against Richter. Rucchin cut across the goal mouth and
outlasted the New York goalie before flipping a backhander in for
his fifth goal of the year at 15:12 on team's second and final shot
of the period.
</P>
<P>
   New York quickly tied the game when Gretzky, shortly after being
leveled by Trnka, centered a pass from Sundstrom. The New York
winger overpowered Trnka in the slot to get in position to beat
Hebert at 16:34.
</P>
<P>
   The Gretzky-Sundstrom combination nearly clicked again with just
over a minute left in the period. Hebert, however, managed to stop
Sundstrom's deflection from point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Before the period would end, Hebert had to come up big one more
time, flopping on his back to stop Leetch, who appeared to have a
wide-open net.
</P>
<P>
   Only three teams in the league had scored fewer goals than the
Rangers' 33 coming into the game, but New York carried the play
most of the opening period thanks in part to four power plays.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert stopped all 13 New York shots, including a blast from the
slot by a wide open Graves with 4{ minutes left in the period and a
slap shot from Gretzky, who left Jason Marshall skating in circles
via a nifty move at the blue line with about two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's only good chances were early in the period. Richter
stopped McInnis from close range on a power play in the opening
minute. Four minutes later he stopped Kariya and Mike Crowley in
succession on another Ducks power play.

SPITZER HANGS ON TO LEAD WITH ALMOST ALL VOTES COUNTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the counting of paper ballots nearly done in the
state attorney general's race, state election officials said
Wednesday that Democratic challenger Eliot Spitzer was maintaining
a thin lead, and aides to Spitzer said he was preparing to declare
victory Thursday over Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, aides to Vacco say they are far from conceding
defeat, and lawyers for his campaign went to state Supreme Court in
Manhattan on Wednesday to challenge the vote count in New York
City, saying there were widespread discrepancies in the tallies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, Spitzer had a 22,334-vote lead over Vacco _
2,064,036 votes to 2,041,702 _ with about 20,000 paper ballots left
to be counted, said Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the state Board
of Elections.
</P>
<P>
   He said the uncounted ballots were from 10 counties, including
Westchester, Oneida and some in New York City. In the counting so
far, Spitzer has had an advantage in the city greater than 3 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials said they would not declare a winner in the
Nov. 3 race until all the votes were counted. They said they
expected the counting to be completed sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken a week before election day showed Vacco with a
healthy lead, but election night ended with Spitzer ahead by about
18,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, election officials around the state have engaged in
a tedious rechecking of machine tallies and hand counting of paper
ballots, all the while watched by representatives of both camps.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the current count and Spitzer's demonstrated strength in
New York City, aides to the Democratic candidate said that he would
hold a news conference Thursday at which he intended to declare
victory, 16 days after the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put a fork in this election,'' said Steven Goldstein,
Spitzer's campaign press secretary. ``It's done.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Vacco campaign was equally adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an election that will be decided not by press
conference but by counting the votes,'' said Kieran Mahoney, a
political consultant for the Vacco campaign. ``I can hold a press
conference tomorrow declaring myself the pope, but that doesn't
mean the College of Cardinals is going to listen to me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a hearing in state Supreme Court on Wednesday, Vacco's
lawyers raised questions about the counting of votes in the days
since the election.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that the number of votes reported on election
night did not correspond to the number released by the Board of
Elections a week later based on a recount of tallies from voting
machines in New York City and Westchester County. They said that
the count was off by about 34,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are addressing the verification of machine
numbers,'' said Thomas Spargo, a lawyer for Vacco's campaign. ``Our
problem has been the lack of reliability, from our perspective, in
how the final voting machine numbers were tabulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Thomas Keegan told officials of both campaigns to spend
the next few days inspecting the thousands of voting machines in
the city and to report their findings to him in court on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the New York City Board of Elections said they
were confident that their figures were accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board's numbers will definitely hold,'' said Daniel
DeFrancesco, the board's executive director. ``Mr. Vacco is
entitled to his day and Mr. Spitzer is, too. But I honestly believe
that the board's numbers are good.''

KINGS FIND NEW WAY TO LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ The latest bizarre twist in the decline and fall of
the Kings comes to us courtesy of defenseman Philippe Boucher,
former King Tony Granato and referee Terry Gregson.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday night, with the score tied and the Kings on a
power play, they discovered an interesting way to allow a
shorthanded goal and, in the process, lose their fifth consecutive
game.
</P>
<P>
   Everything appeared under control. Boucher had the puck deep in
the Kings zone and passed it ahead. But it hit Gregson, resulting
in a point-blank shot by Marco Sturm. Goalie Manny Legace made the
save, but Granato fired in the rebound with 7:07 to play, and the
Kings went on to lose 5-4 before a San Jose Arena crowd of 16,703.
Granato had scored the tying goal for the Sharks six minutes
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when rookie defenseman Mark Visheau recorded the
first two points of his career, a night when Legace notched his
first NHL assist, and a night when the Kings (5-11-3) scored three
goals in a period for the first time this season, they still found
a way to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The day began badly when Legace took a shot by coach Larry
Robinson off the mask during the morning practice, which left him
with a mild headache.
</P>
<P>
   And the night did not go so well, either. Before the game was
two minutes old, they'd allowed a 3-on-1 that resulted in the third
goal of the season for Joe Murphy and a 1-0 lead for the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings sank deeper 6:28 into the second period, when Jeff
Friesen made it 2-0, a margin that ordinarily would appear
mountainous for their struggling offense to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   In stunning fashion, though, the Kings responded with their
version of a volcanic eruption, scoring two goals in a 32-second
span midway through the second period to even the score.
</P>
<P>
   First, Glen Murray set up Luc Robitaille on a 2-on-1, and
Robitaille slid the puck between goalie Mike Vernon's pads for his
team-high 10th goal of the season. Then, Murray deflected home a
shot from the right point by Mark Visheau, who recorded his first
NHL point and later in the period would record his second.
</P>
<P>
   A minute after Murray tied the score, however, the Kings went on
a penalty binge that threatened to instantly negate the comeback.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:33, Eric Lacroix was sent off for goaltender interference,
and at 12:31, Nathan LaFayette received a double minor for
high-sticking Friesen, who was left with a gash under his chin.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks could not capitalize on a 62-second two-man
advantage, but finally scored with 31 seconds left in LaFayette's
second penalty, when Friesen scored after Mattias Norstrom had
blocked a shot from the slot by ex-King Bernie Nicholls.
</P>
<P>
   On the same play, Sean O'Donnell flattened Owen Nolan with a
cross check, so the Kings had to play shorthanded for two more
minutes. But Murray picked up Visheau's clearing pass in the
neutral zone, used his speed to create a breakaway, and tied the
score at 16:50 with his eighth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings then killed the remaining 1:10 of O'Donnell's penalty,
meaning that in the 6:27 span during which they were shorthanded,
they broke even. And at the final buzzer of the second period, a
Marcus Ragnarsson high-sticking penalty gave the Kings a power play
to open the third.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, the Kings took advantage of the extra man, with
Olli Jokinen carrying the puck from the right corner to the crease
and snapping a quick shot over Vernon's glove at 1:04, for his
second power-play goal in as many games.
</P>
<P>
   But six minutes later, Bob Rouse did a good job keeping the puck
in the Kings' zone, and it eventually landed on Granato's stick in
the right circle. Granato rifled the puck past Legace, and not much
later, courtesy of Gregson, he added the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   With Legace off for an extra skater in the last minute, Vernon
stopped a point-blank shot by Murray, preventing the Kings from
sending the game into overtime.

RANGERS BEGIN TRIP WITH A LOSS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It has become a pattern this season with the
Rangers. They play hard, they keep the score low and close. But
they lose. Wednesday night, they fell by 3-1 to the Mighty Ducks of
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had 10 power plays of various lengths but could not
score with the manpower advantage. It was their second consecutive
defeat and they are without a victory in their last three. Their
record of 4-8-5 leaves them in last place in the Atlantic Division
and the Eastern Conference. They have scored 39 goals in 17 games,
but 16 of those goals came in two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks broke a 1-1 tie on the power play at 6 minutes 42
seconds of the third period. Scoring on the rebound was Marty
McInnis _ set up by Paul Kariya _ who burst down left wing, faked
around one Ranger and fired a shot on goalie Mike Richter. The
Ducks made it 3-1 in the final minute when Kariya scored into the
empty net after the Rangers pulled Richter for an extra attacker.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of a five-game road trip for the Rangers, who
play at Los Angeles on Thursday night and at San Jose on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks scored first, just as a Ranger power play expired, at
15:12 of the second period. Getting the goal was Steve Rucchin, who
intercepted a pass from Aleksei Kovalev to Brian Leetch along the
right boards. The Rangers got it right back at 16:34 when Niklas
Sundstrom beat Guy Hebert from the slot after passes from Kovalev
and Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   The game had a combative edge to it, with players on both teams
hitting hard. Kariya, the Anaheim superstar, was roughed up by the
Rangers' Todd Harvey, who took no penalty for it. Later, Stu
Grimson roughed Harvey up in retaliation and they both went off.
Kariya took a two-minute penalty for elbowing Kovalev in the head.

FALL HIKING AT ITS BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Supposedly, black bears will run.''
</P>
<P>
   The odd utterance from my hiking partner as we hit Rattlesnake
Trail high in the heart of the San Gabriel Mountains sounded eerily
like famous last words.
</P>
<P>
   I'd already been warned about the track's dangerously steep
overhangs, where one misstep could send a hiker plummeting into a
deep chasm.
</P>
<P>
   The very name of the footpath seemed ominous, as a hiker we met
along its course made apparent. ``First off, it's called
Rattlesnake Trail, so, right off the bat, it's got a certain
something,'' said John Burnett of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Add bears to the mix, even bruins that supposedly run when
confronted, and the intrigue of the day would stand to escalate
dramatically. To our disappointment, however, by day's end there
was no evidence of bears. Nary a snake.
</P>
<P>
   But for fall hiking in the Angeles National Forest, little
compares to Rattlesnake Trail and its companion to the west, Cooper
Canyon Trail. Together they offer rugged territory accentuated by
sheer crags, crystalline streams, quaint waterfalls and a diverse
arrangement of flora and ecological zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about as attractive as any of the walks in the San
Gabriels because it has quite a variety of fauna and trees and
bushes,'' said Los Angeles corporate lawyer Robert Taylor, who
crossed our path near Rattlesnake Spring. ``Plus there is a lovely
stream down there, where we had lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor should know. He says he's hiked most of
Mexico-to-Canada's Pacific Crest Trail, which calls the entirety of
the Rattlesnake and Cooper Canyon trails its own.
</P>
<P>
   The stream he spoke of is Little Rock Creek, a defining element
of the canyon country along the Northern San Gabriels' desert
slopes. It is joined by Cooper Canyon's outlet 3{ miles from
Rattlesnake Trailhead at Eagles Roost picnic area. Hikers who make
it to this serene confluence are rewarded a quarter-mile farther
west with a waterfall that neither gets airborne nor drops a great
distance but allows visitors to get lost in its understated allure
just the same.
</P>
<P>
   The east-to-west hike covers 7{ miles from Eagles Roost to
Cloudburst Summit and is resplendent with Jeffrey, Coulter and
sugar pine, white fir, oak, alder and, most impressively, towering
incense cedar. Recreationists enjoy forest, canyon and riparian
ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   The path is seemingly far from mankind's reach, though only 1\
miles north of the paralleling Angeles Crest Highway at its most
removed point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the farther you go in, you see the trees getting
bigger and you wonder where the lumberjacks had to stop, where it
wasn't worth their trouble to come and take that tree out,'' said
hiker Burnett, who was breaking in a pack and cold-weather clothing
for winter trekking.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at an elevation of 6,725 feet, the crooked, old
Rattlesnake Trail _ a real compass buster _ winds down in about a
mile to Little Rock Creek (6,275 feet), canvassing a fire road at
first, then a narrow trail.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the route follows the creek downstream for more than
two miles along a high contour. The gorge below is stunning.
</P>
<P>
   At the 3{-mile mark, Rattlesnake Trail is bisected by the
Burkhart Trail, which traverses Pleasant View Ridge and connects
the Antelope Valley to nearby Buckhorn Campground over 8\ miles.
The aforementioned confluence of streams is found here (5,675
feet), and the waterfall is just up what is now the Cooper Canyon
Trail. The cascade is an appetizing lunch spot.
</P>
<P>
   The southern portion of the Burkhart Trail breaks off here,
while the Cooper Canyon Trail continues to the west, climbing a
rocky fire road to a wide, dry streambed until stumbling onto
Cooper Canyon Trail Camp (6,240 feet). Southerly views of
7,283-foot Buckhorn Peak come into play during the 1\ miles between
the falls and the camp. The area was frequented by American Indians
and, in the 1890s, by Pasadena hunting siblings Ike and Tom Cooper,
who targeted deer and bear, according to John W. Robinson's
invaluable guide ``Trails of the Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   New maps indicate Cooper Canyon trail takes a northwest jog as
it meets a fire road employed by maintenance vehicles that service
the trail camp via Cloudburst Summit (7,018 feet). My old map does
not make that subtle distinction, and we hoofed the final 1.6
unflattering miles up the fire road.
</P>
<P>
   The fire road saves the more hurried _ and exhausted _ hikers
time and a mile's distance, but I would have much preferred my
boots stomp a thin track than a wide swath. But don't sweat the
little things, especially on a quality trek like this one, where
it's pretty much all good. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU'RE GOING ....
</P>
<P>
   Hiking the Rattlesnake and Cooper Canyon trails is a shuttle
trip requiring two vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Drive both over Angeles Crest Highway (2) to Cloudburst Summit _
32.3 miles northeast of the highway's outset in La Canada
Flintridge. Drop off one car here at the Cooper Canyon Trailhead _
the termination of this trek.
</P>
<P>
   With all adventurers and their gear in the second auto, drive
another 4.6 miles _ using caution to avoid fallen rocks _ to Eagles
Roost picnic area and park. Rattlesnake Trail commences across the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   To be legally parked in the Angeles National Forest, a car must
have a National Forest Adventure Pass displayed. The daily fee is
$5 and the permit can be purchased en route at the Clear Creek
Visitors Station, at the junction of Angeles Crest and Angeles
Forest highways.
</P>
<P>
   The trails are found on the Waterman Mountain 7.5-minute series
topographic map and Tom Harrison Maps' recently updated ``Angeles
High Country Trail Map.''
</P>
<P>
   Allow at least five hours to complete the 7{-mile track.

MANY CHANGES IN STORE AT SKI RESORTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART BENTLEY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thou art lost and gone forever. Dreadful sorry,
Clementine.
</P>
<P>
   And good riddance. The Clementine of interest to Southland
skiers was not a miner's daughter but Bear Mountain's
excruciatingly slow fixed-grip triple chairlift. By Dec. 17,
Clementine's replacement _ a high-speed four-seater, the resort's
second quad _ should start running.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of several upgrades and changes at area resorts that
skiers and snowboarders can expect this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Those who seek access to the challenging terrain of Bear
Mountain's Bear Peak will no longer face a most exasperating
conveyance that frequently presented long lift lines. Now visitors
to the Big Bear Lake facility will enjoy a brief passage to its
base via the new lift, dubbed Access Express. From, there its up
the Bear Peak Triple to Geronimo, a double-diamond run with an
incline of 35 degrees and 1,100 feet of vertical drop.
</P>
<P>
   When the snow is abundant, Bear Peak delivers exciting off-piste
descents that are steep and thickly wooded. The management has been
longing to cut runs down these slopes and throw lifts up them for
more than a decade, but development plans have been blocked by
advocates of certain flora and fauna who say the species are
endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Access Express is the region's most skier-friendly capital
improvement; modifications at other resorts are more modest.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain High near Wrightwood, under new ownership since 1997,
is using an electronic-ticket system with computer chips that open
turnstiles to lifts. Patrons can buy tickets good at specific times
or for a specific number of rides. The chips are embedded in season
passes, club cards or wristbands sold at the resort. Widespread in
Europe, such high-tech ticketing is catching on in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Snow Valley, outside of Running Springs, is touting a 33 percent
expansion of its learning area, arguably the area's best and most
extensive beginner terrain. The base lodge has also been renovated.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, snowboarders at the little spot that calls itself Big
Air Green Valley will have company this season of a kind not seen
on the slopes for several years. Skiers will once again be
welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Baldy, north of Upland, has made what in the long term may
be one of the most significant strides of all, winning approval
from the U.S. Forest Service of a development plan and an
environmental impact report. These are among the hurdles that must
be cleared if lifts are to be installed on the precipitous slopes
immediately north of the resort's present boundary. If plans are
ever realized, the additional territory could catapult Baldy into
the big time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, up Highway 395 in the Eastern Sierra, the
metamorphosis continues at Mammoth Mountain, which gets most of its
business from the Southern California faithful. The resort has
replaced its upper gondola and installed two more high-speed quads.
</P>
<P>
   The new gondola cabins hold eight passengers instead of six and
the duration of last season's eight-minute ride from mid-mountain
to the summit has been cut almost in half.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mammoth's new quads loads near the bottom of the popular
Stump Alley intermediate run and drops off passengers at the saddle
between Lincoln Mountain and the top of Chair 5. For the first
time, runs such as Solitude, Spook and Lower Dry Creek will be
reachable via just a single lift ride from the lower mountain.
</P>

WILDFOWLER GETS STAMP OF APPROVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM MATTHEWS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BERNARDINO _ For the first time in the 65-year history of
the Federal Duck Stamp Art Contest, a painting with a hunter in the
design has won.
</P>
<P>
   The hunter and his dog in their boat may be but a small part of
the depiction of two greater scaup winging across a windswept
waterway. But it is symbolic of how hunters have largely been in
the background of the effort to conserve wetlands and waterfowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been surprised to the reaction to the hunter in the
painting,'' said Jim Hautman of Plymouth, Minn., whose artwork won
the competition for the 1999-2000 hunting-season stamp. ``Of
course, the hunters like it, but even a lot of non-hunters like the
hunter in the painting.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of three brothers, Hautman became the fourth artist
to win the contest three times. His brothers each have won the
competition once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunting and painting all go hand in hand to me. It's hard to
explain to people who don't hunt... but no one hunts something they
don't love. You don't go out and hunt something you hate,'' he
said. ``Hunters already get it; they understand. And non-hunters
may never get it. The real irony is that anti-hunters and hunters
want the same thing _ better habitat and more animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterfowl shooters are required to purchase the $15 stamp (it's
a hunting document, not a postage stamp) and carry it with their
hunting license; 98 percent of the proceeds goes to the Migratory
Bird Conservation Fund, which purchases wetlands for the National
Wildlife Refuge System. The stamp contest is the nation's only
federally sponsored art competition, according to organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Hautman's winning design and the other top 20 paintings from
this year's judging will be displayed Friday through Sunday during
the Wildlife Art Festival at the San Bernardino County Museum, 2024
Orange Tree Lane in Redlands. It is one of only two spots across
the country where the stamp art will be exhibited. Hautman and 27
other prominent wildlife artists will be on hand to show off their
paintings, sculptures, carvings and limited edition prints.
</P>
<P>
   Admission: $6 for adults; $5 for students, seniors 60 and older,
and ages 13 to 17; $4 for ages 5 to 12; and free for children 4 and
under. Hours: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday and Saturday; 9 a.m. to 4
p.m. Sunday. Information: (909) 307-2669 or (888) 247-3344.

AT ST. JOHN'S, MANETTA SEES SUN SHINING IN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ed Manetta looked over a sea of empty seats at Alumni
Hall Wednesday afternoon and admitted that he felt more at ease
than at any time in his three-year tenure as St. John's athletic
director.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Manetta has been associated with a flurry of
decisions that have taken St. John's flagship men's basketball
program through a series of transitions. The high-profile
dismissals of Brian Mahoney and Fran Fraschilla; televised Midnight
Madness, and signing to wear a line of Michael Jordan's athletic
wear. There were high-profile calls to make as St. John's tried to
find its equilibrium after Lou Carnesecca's retirement in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood in Alumni Hall on Wednesday, before St. John's 73-69
victory over UMass, Manetta said he felt that the ship was righted,
the sun was finally out and the skies were clear. The storm had
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that the magic ever left,'' he said. ``Just that
things get cloudy when you face adversity. Sometimes the silver
lining gets covered by a dark cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   The magic did leave St. John's after Carnesecca retired. There
was a wit and comfort level that comes with age, and with
experience, that his successors could not duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Mahoney succeeded Carnesecca and was selected as Big East
coach of the year that season. Then Mahoney signed two prized
recruits _ Zendon Hamilton and Felipe Lopez _ but the team fell far
short of expectations. Despite the award, despite the recruits,
Mahoney never became comfortable in his role as head coach.
Carnesecca's shoes were simply too big, the task of proving
himself, keeping his job and communicating with players was too
daunting. Manetta, in his first year at St. John's, forced Mahoney
to resign and hired Fran Fraschilla.
</P>
<P>
   Fraschilla, fresh from success at Manhattan College, where he
had taken two teams to the NCAA tournament, leaped at the
opportunity to be a Big East coach. But his hunger never subsided
and he began looking for higher ground before his foundation was
set at St. John's. Fraschilla was asked to leave after his second
season, when he seemed to be using St. John's as a springboard to a
more high-profile job.
</P>
<P>
   In Mike Jarvis, whom Manetta hired from George Washington
University before this season, St. John's finally has a coach with
the experience and vision to help the program turn the tide. Jarvis
admits that he has dreams of coaching in the National Basketball
Association. But he seems to know how his role at St. John's fits
in with his master plan and is in no rush to move. Jarvis spent 17
years as a high school coach, and 13 seasons in two college
programs before coming to St. John's. Now, for the Red Storm, there
are signs of stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very secure,'' Manetta said. ``He's got life experience.
He knows how to adjust. He's got flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis's first George Washington team had gone 1-29 two seasons
before he became head coach. In his first season with the Colonials
in 1990-91, he took them to the Atlantic 10 final and the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis has never had a losing record as a coach. He speaks in
Buddha-like riddles: He tells them that basketball is a business,
not a fashion. He tells them ``you have to do a lot of things
before you can be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Artest, one of the Red Storm's top players, had a stormy
relationship with Fraschilla, and he said the difference this
season is like day and night. ``We're having fun and we're more
relaxed,'' he said. ``Last year everyone was scared and panicky.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, 48 hours after a rout of North Carolina-Asheville in
the first round of the Preseason National Invitation Tournament,
everyone was still talking about Monday's magical moment at Alumni
Hall: a night when Carnesecca made his first appearance at Alumni
Hall since he retired six seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   During a pause in Monday's game, Mahoney, who was an assistant
to Ron Rutledge and Carnesecca before he took over as head coach,
made his first appearance at Alumni Hall since he resigned more
than two years ago. As if his presence was a sign that it was all
right to come back, many former players, now in the NBA but not
playing during the lockout, also returned to share in the opening
of the regular season: Jayson Williams, Malik Sealy, Lopez. John
Calapari, the Nets' head coach, was on hand to see his former UMass
team.
</P>
<P>
   There is an air of stability this season at St. John's, but the
Red Storm is also learning to live in the new era of sports where
everyone moves, where nothing is secure.
</P>
<P>
   How long will Jarvis stay? When someone recently asked Jarvis
about his tenure at St. John's and his NBA plans, the coach
responded with a sagelike bluntness.
</P>
<P>
   ``In life anything can happen,'' he said. ``And in this
business, there is no such thing as forever.'' &QL;

BOOK REVIEWS: POLAR OPPOSITE OF SAFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some adventures are almost off the scale in
daring. Magellan's and Lewis and Clark's voyages come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Alvah Simon's year in the Arctic, much of it alone, might not be
in that class, but it's close. His experiences are chronicled in
the well-written ``North to the Night'' (International Marine;
$24.95). The reader is not sure whether to label him crazy or
admire him for his resourcefulness and courage.
</P>
<P>
   Simon and his wife sailed from South America to a spot near the
North Pole, where the anchor was dropped while the sea wasn't
frozen. There they spent months in the icy, dark wastes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Simon's wife flew to her parents' home in New Zealand to
be with her terminally ill father. Determined to stay in the Arctic
a full year, through a long period without daylight, Simon saw his
adventure take a major turn. He suffered from recurrent
debilitating back aches and temporary blindness, an affect of the
continual darkness that made daily chores oppressive. Once he
awakened in horror to find his legs frozen in ice from melted
water.
</P>
<P>
   Depression and acute anxiety attacks _ common maladies on such
solo adventures _ plagued him. Long hikes relieved his dark moods;
he was saved by his imagination, a special place to which his inner
compass constantly pointed him.
</P>
<P>
   In the narrative, Simon's experiences, inward and outward, are
often dramatic. His reckless encounter with a polar bear is
particularly telling. Apparently offering himself to fate, Simon
decides his experience would not be complete without facing the
largest land predator alone and unarmed. He lucks out and the bear
goes his own way. But the author looks upon his fortune not as
coincidence but a reflection of his basic harmony with the land...
or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   The descriptions of the long winter and the native Inuits in the
328 pages are compelling; the tale flags when Simon writes about
some sort of spiritual awakening.
</P>
<P>
   One can't help but wonder about individuals compelled to defy
death. Should you pat someone like Simon on the back or recommend a
good psychiatrist? What does the tendency toward extreme outdoor
activities say about life in the modern world? Our rating: HH{ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fly-fishing is often seen as a mysterious activity, as difficult
to master as nuclear physics. Peter Kaminsky succeeds in untangling
its complexity in ``Fly Fishing for Dummies'' (IDG Books Worldwide;
$19.95).
</P>
<P>
   The 358-page book hooks the reader by taking a simple,
step-by-step approach. Kaminsky, outdoor columnist for the New York
Times, deals with each subject by offering tips that, yes, even
fishing dummies can understand.
</P>
<P>
   Men, for example, should not try to teach their girlfriends or
wives how to fish. Sage advice. Also, not only sounds but shadows
can warn fish of the angler's approach.
</P>
<P>
   Along with recommendations for tackle, technique, safety and
etiquette, the author includes an extensive glossary, most notably
an additional-reading section of the best books and magazines on
the subject. Our rating: HH{ &QL; 
uuu
</P>
<P>
   Society typically frowns upon people owning bears, lions and
other exotic animals as pets. Consequently, one of the best
opportunities we might get to watch predators in action in a
domestic setting is to have carnivorous plants.
</P>
<P>
   Common belief suggest that such flora thrive mostly in faraway
tropical climates and are difficult to care for. Not so, according
to author Peter D'Amato in ``The Savage Garden'' (Ten Speed Press;
$19.95). D'Amato's interest in carnivorous plants, or CPs as he
calls them, blossomed in childhood when he discovered some grew
near his New Jersey home. Today he has more than 500 species, most
of which can grow in temperate climates and are low-maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato details such factors as soil, light, containers and
feeding.
</P>
<P>
   What will CPs eat? Mostly insects, but they have been known to
devour frogs, lizards and even small rodents. D'Amato _ who runs
California Carnivores, a Forestville nursery billed as the home of
the world's largest CP collection _ has fed bits of hamburger,
cheese and even chocolate to his plants.
</P>
<P>
   The 314 pages of ``Savage Garden'' contain wonderful photos and
detailed information on cultivation of many different species of
CPs. Our rating: HH{ &QL;

GRANT LIFTS RED STORM INTO NIT SEMIFINALS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the time the lights went out for the player
introductions Wednesday night at Alumni Hall, Erick Barkley had
been through this routine in two exhibition games and the
regular-season opener. But as he stood on the floor, greeting his
teammates, he never stopped moving, jumping and fidgeting like a
student before an exam.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a test, the first true one for St. John's as the Red
Storm played Massachusetts in the second round of the Chase
Preseason National Invitation Tournament. But if the matchup gave
Barkley, the Red Storm's freshman point guard, the jitters, it did
not shake Tyrone Grant. And in this test, Grant, a senior forward,
carried the Red Storm.
</P>
<P>
   Grant scored 13 points in the second half, finishing with 20
points and 17 rebounds, both career highs, as he outdueled the
heralded frontcourt of the Minutemen to lead St. John's to a 73-69
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the points and rebounds, it was the steady hand and
head of Grant that the Red Storm needed on this night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a young team in class,'' said Grant, the captain.
``But they're mature. They've been through tough wars in basketball
before. I just had to keep them calm.''
</P>
<P>
   And Grant did, grabbing rebounds and gently starting the offense
or resetting it, taking the ball from the frantic teammates and
slowing the pace whenever the Red Storm began to rattle. Barkley
shot 1 for 10 and handed out only 1 assist. But he did convert 10
of 14 free throws, including 5 of 6 in the final 2 minutes, to
finish with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a challenge,'' Grant said. ``I had to play hard for the
team to win. With the great front-line that UMass has, I had to
give it all. My teammates felt I was due. In the last game and in
the exhibition games I was missing a lot of loose balls and easy
shots. I was due.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory over the Minutemen, ranked No. 24 in The Associated
Press preseason poll, allowed the Red Storm to advance to the NIT
semifinals in a bracket that includes Stanford and Missouri. Their
next game will be next Wednesday at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The undersized Red Storm, missing center Albert Richardson for
most of the night because of foul trouble, had to rely on the
6-foot-7-inch Grant to contend with a far larger and more
established opposing front line.
</P>
<P>
   UMass center Lari Kentner, a preseason all-American, was
frustrated inside by a pesky defense. While Richardson got in quick
foul trouble, the Red Storm was able to contain Kentner with Grant
and Ron Artest taking turns and receiving help from greedy hands
darting in every time Kentner received a pass. It was not until
5:04 remained in the first half that Kentner scored, converting a
short, turnaround jumper, after three misses.
</P>
<P>
   Kentner finished with 13 points and 7 rebounds. He got little
help from Ajmal Basit, his frontcourt mate, who fouled out with
7:56 to play with 5 points and 7 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Artest played 39 minutes, blocking two shots and coming up with
a pair of steals to go along with 9 points and 8 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by as many as 12 points in the first half, the
Minutemen closed the gap to 41-37 with 13:38 to play in the game
when Kentner scored over three defenders in the lane. When Barkley
missed a pair of free throws, it seemed to open the door for
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But Bootsy Thornton picked off a pass to start a 3-on-1 fast
break that ended with Grant tipping in a missed layup. The tip-in
triggered a 9-1 burst that gave St. John's a 50-39 advantage. With
the lead at 50-41, Grant converted a spinning layup, drawing the
fifth foul on Basit, which he converted for a 3-point play. And
when UMass Coach Bruiser Flint was whistled for a technical while
supporting Basit, Grant converted two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I liked is that this team found a different way to
win tonight,'' said Coach Mike Jarvis, who is 2-0 in his first
season at St. John's.

KINGS FIND NEW WAY TO LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ The latest bizarre twist in the decline and fall of
the Kings comes courtesy of defenseman Philippe Boucher, former
King Tony Granato and referee Terry Gregson.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday night, with the score tied and the Kings on a
power play, they discovered yet another way to allow a shorthanded
goal and, in the process, lose their fifth consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   Everything appeared under control. Boucher had the puck deep in
the Kings zone and passed it ahead. But it hit Gregson and landed
on the stick of Granato, who set up a point-blank shot by Marco
Sturm.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Manny Legace made the save, but Granato fired in the
rebound with 7:07 to play, and the Kings went on to lose 5-4 before
a San Jose Arena crowd of 16,703. Six minutes earlier, Granato had
scored the tying goal for the Sharks (4-7-4).
</P>
<P>
   ``Same story, different town,'' Kings coach Larry Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher added, ``I looked up ice and saw Yanic (Perreault). I
wanted to give it to him and I hit the ref. You've got to get it
through. You can't blame the ref. He's got to be somewhere on the
ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, on a night when rookie defenseman Mark Visheau recorded
the first two points of his career, a night when Legace notched his
first NHL assist and a night when the Kings (5-11-3) scored three
goals in a period for the first time this season, they still found
a way to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also lost winger Russ Courtnall to a bruised right
ankle late in the game. He is scheduled to undergo X-rays today.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson recently said a black cloud seems to be hanging over
his jinxed team. Almost from the start Wednesday, the monsoon
continued.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with Legace taking a Robinson shot off the mask
during the morning practice, leaving him with a headache that
remained throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   The night did not begin or end well for the Kings, either.
Before the game was two minutes old, they'd allowed a 3-on-1 that
resulted in the third goal of the season for Joe Murphy and a 1-0
lead for the Sharks, and by the time the game was seven minutes
old, the Kings had allowed two more outnumbered rushes by San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second period, Jeff Friesen made it 2-0, when his
centering pass deflected off the stick of defenseman Sean O'Donnell
and past Legace, the sort of bad bounce the Kings have been getting
all season.
</P>
<P>
   In stunning fashion, though, the Kings responded with their
version of a volcanic eruption, getting goals in a 32-second span
midway through the second period from Luc Robitaille and Glen
Murray to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard, and we came back,'' Boucher said. ``But it
seems like we find a way to lose all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Penalties almost proved the Kings' undoing in the form of a
second-period span during which they were shorthanded for 6:27, 62
seconds of that at a two-man disadvantage. But the Kings only
allowed a Friesen goal while one man down, and Murray tied the
score, 3-3, with a shorthanded goal during the same sequence.
</P>
<P>
   And at the final buzzer of the second period, a Marcus
Ragnarsson high-sticking penalty gave the Kings a power play to
open the third.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, they took advantage. Olli Jokinen gave the Kings
their only lead 64 seconds into the third with his second
power-play goal in as many games.
</P>
<P>
   But six minutes later Granato tied the score, and with an assist
from Gregson, the brother of Kings color commentator Cammi Granato
added the game-winner another six minutes after that.
</P>
<P>
   With Legace off for an extra skater in the last minute, Sharks
goalie Mike Vernon stopped a point-blank shot by Murray, preventing
the Kings from sending the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating the Kings' current theme of despair, Robinson said
grimly, ``The puck didn't want to go in.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

DUCKS DEFEAT RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Wayne Gretzky may be the Great One, but Marty McInnis
is proving to be the great pickup of the year, and Guy Hebert is
just playing great.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis scored the game-winning goal at 6:42 of the third period
and Hebert made 29 saves as the Mighty Ducks defeated the New York
Rangers 3-1 on Wednesday night before 15,245 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' third consecutive win and fourth in five games moved
them over the .500 mark (7-6-4) for the first time since Nov. 14,
1997 when they were 8-7-5.
</P>
<P>
   It also improved Anaheim's record over New York to 6-2-1 overall
and 5-0 at the Pond, which has become the Rangers' own personal
house of blues.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway Blues were already in a major funk coming in. New
York (4-8-5) is last in the Eastern Conference and has won only
once in its last seven games (1-4-2).
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers outshot the Ducks 30-16, but they failed to convert
any of nine power plays, gave up the game-winning goal after Kevin
Stevens' ill-advised elbowing penalty and allowed the game's first
goal to be scored one second after one of their power plays had
expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's game was discouraging, especially with all of the
opportunities we had in the first period (13 shots),'' said
Gretzky, who assisted on Niklas Sundstrom's goal at 16:34 of the
second period.
</P>
<P>
   That goal tied the game, 1-1, but McInnis scored his fifth goal
and 11th point in 11 games as a Duck to give Anaheim the lead for
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played against him before, he was more of an agitator,
a good penalty killer,'' said Paul Kariya, who set up the winning
goal when he faked Adam Graves to the ice and got a shot off that
resulted in a rebound that McInnis buried. ``I didn't realize he
had such good offensive skills. He goes to the net well and has a
hard shot.''
</P>
<P>
   And since being acquired from Calgary on Oct. 27 for a fourth
round draft pick, he has a new outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very excited to come here,'' said McInnis. ``I felt like
I was getting a fresh start. The coach (Craig Hartsburg) gave me
some confidence. It makes you feel confident to contribute
offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, nobody is more confident, or effective as Hebert is
right now.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim goalie came into the game with a .934 save
percentage and has lost only two of his last 13 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a goalie it's all confidence,'' said Hebert who has
started 16 of the Ducks' 18 games. ``When you feel good you don't
want to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg doesn't figured to be making any changes soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a goalie playing like this, you just keep
playing him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis' game winner came less than two minutes after Hebert had
turned away yet another New York threat, stopping Sundstrom on a
two-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   After spending much of the first period killing penalties, the
Ducks couldn't generate any offense in the second until the Rangers
got another power play chance late in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim had managed but one shot in 15 minutes, but just after
Pavel Trnka stepped back on the ice, Steve Rucchin intercepted
Alexei Kovalev's pass intended for Brian Leetch and converted the
ensuing breakaway with a backhander that beat Richter.
</P>
<P>
   New York quickly tied the game when Gretzky, shortly after being
leveled by Trnka, set up Sundstrom's goal from behind the Anaheim
net.
</P>
<P>
   The Gretzky-Sundstrom combination nealry clicked again with just
over a minute left in the period. Hebert, however, maanaged to stop
Sundstrom's deflection from point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Before the period would end, Hebert had to come up big one more
time, flopping on his back to stop Leetch, who appeared to have a
wide-open net.

CHIP OFF ASTEROID THAT DOOMED THE DINOSAURS  
 BY DAVID PERLMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    Scientists say they have found a tiny piece of a monster
asteroid that probably crashed to Earth some 65 million years ago
and drove the planet's dinosaurs to extinction.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dark brown chunk of fossil rock _ smaller than a pencil's
eraser tip _ which was found deep beneath the Pacific Ocean floor,
contains clear evidence that it originated in far-off space. Frank
Kyte, a geochemist at the University of California at Los Angeles
who discovered the fragment, is convinced that it came from a giant
asteroid that slammed into the Earth and gouged a crater more than
185 miles wide off the Yucatan peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Kyte said Wednesday that he discovered the jagged little rock
recently while studying a core sample of mud lifted from 150 feet
below the ocean floor by a scientific drilling ship in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing its minerals, Kyte found chemicals indicating that the
rock was a typical carbonaceous chondrite _ a class of meteorites
that occasionally fall to Earth from the thousands of asteroids
that orbit the sun in a belt between the orbits of Mars and
Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Kyte also found that the tiny rock contained an unusual quantity
of the rare element iridium, abundant in asteroids. The discovery
of iridium in a thin layer of rocks all around the world led UC
Berkeley geologist Walter Alvarez to propose in 1980 his seminal
theory about the extinction of the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   More evidence emerged from the 65 million-year-old fossil fish
scales that were found in the mud sample pulled from the seabed,
Kyte said.
</P>
<P>
   In the clay around the tiny rock, Kyte also found bits of
shock-blasted quartz as well as microscopically small droplets of
minerals that must have once been molten from the heat of an
asteroid's crash to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   When Alvarez first discovered the planetwide iridium layer in
ancient rocks, they were age-dated to about 65 million years ago,
when dinosaurs and more than 75 percent of all life forms became
extinct. The time is known to geologists as the Cretaceous-Tertiary
boundary.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez and many other scientists theorized that a giant
asteroid or comet plunged to Earth at that time and created a
life-destroying ``nuclear winter'' marked first by blazing heat and
then by millennia of darkness and cold that disastrously altered
the Earth's environment.
</P>
<P>
   Later, scientists unearthed powerful evidence for the event in a
giant undersea structure called the Chicxulub crater that stretches
from the Yucatan all the way to Cuba and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   No one could tell, however, whether the object from space was a
comet or a chunk of asteroid. But now Kyte's rock offers the first
bit of evidence large enough to analyze indicating that the
meteorite came from a crashing asteroid. The tiny bit of debris was
probably flung by the long-ago impact across nearly 6,000 miles of
the North Pacific _ about halfway between where San Francisco and
Tokyo now stand _ Kyte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the worst days the Earth had in the last
billion years, and it is important to understand what happened,''
said Kyte, a geochemist at UCLA's Institute of Geophysics and
Planetary Physics. ``There is a strong possibility that this is a
bullet from a smoking gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyte's full report, ``A Fossil Meteorite From the
Cretaceous-Tertiary Boundary,'' is being published Thursday in the
scientific journal Nature.

SCIENTISTS LOOK DEEP INSIDE EARTH FOR HAWAII'S SOURCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    Tracking earthquakes halfway to the center of the Earth, a team
of California scientists may have found the mysterious source of
the Hawaiian Islands.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The upwelling river of rock known as the ``Hawaiian plume,''
which has been spewing forth into a seething geologic ``hot spot''
below the Pacific floor for some 80 million years, appears to run
all the way through Earth's thick outer mantle to the boundary zone
surrounding the planet's core.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean the volcanic material that developed into the
Hawaiian Islands had to start its amazing journey about 1,800 miles
down. Some previous estimates had placed Hawaii's geologic
birthplace well within the mantle layer, perhaps only 400 miles or
so below the ocean bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it came from a plume. The question was how deep did
the plume go,'' said researcher Sara Russell at the University of
California at Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the findings appears Thursday in the journal
Nature, along with a separate report showing that another narrow
plume, also extending down to the so-called ``core-mantle
boundary,'' formed Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   The research teams in both reports mined earthquake data to
tunnel deeper than ever before into the mysteries of the inner
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian study took advantage of 54 relatively minor
earthquakes in the Tonga-Fiji region between 1990 and 1995. Energy
waves from the quakes radiated through the Pacific and were
recorded on monitoring stations along the California and Oregon
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers looked for changes in the shape and direction of the
seismic waves to decipher changes in the materials through which
the waves passed. The underground mapping process, called ``seismic
tomography,'' works in much the same way as the scanning devices
doctors use for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference is that doctors can control when and where
their patients get scanned _ earth scientists can't start
earthquakes at will and must use information generated by a limited
array of tracking stations.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions all fell into place when Russell, UC Santa Cruz earth
scientist Thorne Lay and UC Berkeley seismologist Edward Garnero
set out in search of the root of the ``Hawaiian hot spot'' _ as the
plume-fed lump of Pacific magma is called when it reaches the
Earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   Their data suggested that the root is an estimated 900
horizontal miles southeast of the present-day islands, which drift
along with the moving plates that form the Earth's outer surface.
Researchers likened it to ``a hot smoke cloud rising into a windy
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The geologically ancient events that shaped the Hawaiian plume
caused hot lumps of material to pool at the Earth's crust,
conditions which gave rise to volcanic eruptions that formed the
actual islands. Research shows that though the material they are
made from is very old, the islands themselves are quite young,
about 6 million years old or less.
</P>
<P>
   The plume that formed them are caused by the inherent
instability at the mantle-core boundary zone, where enough rock has
melted and softened to allow movement. The temperature at the
bottom of the mantle is about 3,000 degrees Celsius, owing to the
semi-molten core surrounding the solid material at the very center
of the Earth. This solid inner core is thought to be about 7,000
degrees.

the tragic horseback-riding accident that left him a quadriplegic,
actor Christopher Reeve has reinvented himself as an author, an
Emmy Award-winning director and a spokesperson on spinal-injury
issues. On Nov. 22, however, he will make his long-awaited return
to acting in an ABC remake of the classic Hitchcock film ``Rear
Window.'' Reeve talks about the new film, the challenge of
undertaking a role made famous by James Stewart, why he still
believes that someday he'll walk again and how so physically
commanding an actor managed to reinvent his style using only his
face and voice to act. By Ian Spelling. 1,400 words + photo.

Timothy ``Speed'' Levitch is the most unusual tour guide in America
- and probably the world. Levitch, 28, is a guide on a Manhattan
double-decker tour bus. He's been called a madman, a genius, an
artist, a freak. Young documentary filmmaker Bennett Miller was so
intrigued by Levitch that he made him the subject of his first
feature film, ``The Cruise,'' a revealing cinema-veriti portrait of
Levitch and New York. By J. Mooney. BPI. 1,300 words + photo.

TODD HAYNES MINES GLITTER OF GLAM ROCK'S ENDLESS PARTY It was a
time of flamboyance and hedonism, of bisexual chic and open drug
use. ``Glam rock'' flickered during the early to mid-1970s. Todd
Haynes was fascinated by the sounds and images of David Bowie, T.
Rex, Roxy Music, Slade and The Sweet in England, the New York Dolls
and Lou Reed in New York, Iggy and the Stooges in Detroit. Last
year, Haynes, now 37, began filming ``Velvet Goldmine,'' his homage
to the glam rock era. By Jim Sullivan. From The Boston Globe. 1,400

CATE BLANCHETT TAKES A FRESH LOOK AT GOOD QUEEN BESS Elizabeth I of
England was one of the most imposing women in history, and the role
is a challenge for any actress. Australian actress Cate Blanchett
carries it off with panache - and with rumours of an Oscar
nomination. In this interview she talks about the new film
``Elizabeth,'' how she tackled the demanding title role, how she
compares her ``Elizabeth'' co-star Joseph Fiennes with her ``Oscar

CLINTON FINDS LEWINSKY CASE FOLLOWS HIM TO TOKYO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As the House began impeachment hearings in Washington
Thursday, President Clinton traveled more than 8,000 miles to Tokyo
only to be confronted by an indignant Japanese housewife who
questioned his apology to his wife and daughter for the Monica
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you apologize to Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea?'' the
mother of two asked in a nationally televised 43-minute
question-and-answer session with the president. ``I feel I would
never be able to forgive my husband for doing that, but did they
really forgive you, Mr. President?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had been jocular and animated during the opening
minutes of the broadcast, appeared startled by the question from a
woman in a television audience in Osaka that was linked via
television hookup to Clinton, who was sitting in the studios of the
Tokyo Broadcasting System here in the Japanese capital.
</P>
<P>
   The invited audience of 100 of Japan's future leaders seated
before him reacted with a collective sigh to the question, which
the unidentified housewife posed in Japanese and the president
heard through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had already fielded seven questions, replied in a
deliberate, patient tone with a strained smile crossed his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well I did it in a direct and straight forward manner,''
Clinton explained, speaking slowly. ``I believe they did, yes. But
that's really a question you could ask them better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   He clinched his jaw after completing his response.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Chelsea accompanied the president to
Tokyo. Mrs. Clinton is touring hurricane-damaged nations in Central
America; Chelsea is a sophomore at Stanford University, in Palo
Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   TV personality Tetsuya Chikushi, host for Clinton's town-meeting
session, quickly injected, ``Let's change the subject now.''
</P>
<P>
   Chikushi shifted the subject to U.S.-Japan relations, observing:
``Now our bilateral relationship is the most important of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Chikushi is Japan's version of former talk show host Phil
Donahue. He and the president sat before the live audience on two
bar stools with a large video screen before them that linked the
studio to Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delighted his audience with a series of personal
insights.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question,, Clinton boasted about his close
relationship with his daughter, who he had helped with her homework
``until it became too difficult for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered public speaking advice to another questioner, telling
her to pretend ``that you're speaking to a few of your friends''
rather than addressing a large audience via television. ``You don't
have to change; you just have to be yourself,'' Clinton counseled.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told of his efforts during a busy presidency to achieve
``a balanced life'' with work, family time, church and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do the things that remind me that I'm a normal person and I
need a balanced life,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name the favorite ``dishes that your wife cooks,''
Clinton said that he is known in America for liking a variety of
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people make fun of me because of that,'' said
Clinton. ``But I suppose my favorite dish is a Mexican dish _
chicken enchiladas,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he and the first lady usually have dinner
together at the White House three or four times a week. ``My wife
and I have dinner together every night when we're both home,''
Clinton explained. ``That is unless she has to go out to an
engagement or I do.''

 &HT;    RUSSIA TO LAUNCH FIRST COMPONENT OF INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 780 words.
 &HT;    With SPACE-MIR-1119; SPACE-STATION-1119.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Considering Russia's deep economic troubles, it will be
the shot the world never quite expected to hear.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday(Nov. 20), a Russian Proton rocket is scheduled to
blast off carrying the first component of the world's grandest
peacetime project, the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   The space complex, to be assembled in earth's orbit, will take
nearly six years to complete by a consortium of 16 nations.
Although the greatest burden -- both technically and financially --
is being carried by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The unmanned Zarya module will be launched from Russia's version
of Cape Canaveral, the launch site at Baikonur, in the former
Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. Zarya, which will provide power for
the fledgling station, was built in Russia with American assistance
and financed with $190 million from NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Like the first piece in a giant erector set, Zarya (Russian for
``sunrise'') will be added to in coming years with components
brought by U.S. shuttles and Russian rockets. The result in 2004
will be a 460-ton station stretching the length of two football
fields. The final construction costs could top $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's scheduled launch is a milestone that did not come
easily. Russia's economic crisis forced delays. NASA was compelled
to pledge a face-saving bailout of $660 million to complete Russian
construction of a living-quarters service module to be launched
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear it is merely the first of many problems to come and
the result of a space policy based on international politics rather
than American scientific aims. Already the space station is 18
months behind schedule, largely due to Russia's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly more problems involved in doing it this
way. But it is worth it. International cooperation succeeds because
we share the burdens and we share the benefits. It's a small
planet, and it is getting smaller,'' said Mike Baker, a shuttle
astronaut and head of NASA's human space flight program office in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Russia has been the leader in space endurance
flights, beginning in 1971? with its Salyut series of space
stations and since 1986 with Mir. With the country's economy a
wreck and future funding for their space program in doubt, the
Russians are sensitive about their role playing second fiddle to
NASA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a year or even less, three modules will be in orbit and
then few people will recall these problems,'' said Alexei Krasnov
of the Russian Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, America's efforts toward a space station began in
1984, when it was proposed by President Reagan not long after he
branded the Soviet Union the ``evil empire'' and initiated research
on Star Wars, the high-tech plan for an orbital defense against
nuclear missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cold War ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991, and America and Russia became co-dependent partners -- the
United States had the money and space shuttle; the Russians had
space-station experience aboard Mir.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems that have bedeviled the 12-year-old Mir, or
perhaps because they have been overcome, space remains one of the
few arenas in which Russians can proudly point out their
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the field of manned space missions, they are at the very
top because of their experience with Mir and the previous space
stations. It is experience that nobody else in this world has,''
said Alain Fournier-Sicro, director of the Moscow office of the
European Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the International Space Station actually
began in 1995, when American astronauts started living aboard Mir.
Seven U.S. astronauts spent almost 27 months on the station,
gaining technical and operational experience.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more importantly, they learned how the Russians worked
-- desperately mending the problem-plagued station and taking risks
that some American officials felt were too high.
</P>
<P>
   James Oberg, a former space engineer and author, claims America
is playing ``Russian roulette'' by committing itself to cooperation
at a time when the Russian space program is crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Russian civilian space budget was $3.2 billion,
according to the Russian Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now our state budget is like that of a Third World country,''
said Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian Space Agency. ``Not in a
single year have we got the money we were promised. We're getting
one-fourteenth of what we got in 1989.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is not good, obviously,'' NASA's Baker said in
an interview with Cox News Service. ``They keep telling us they
will keep up their commitments. Time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Finances aside, multinational cooperation has generated
world-class headaches. There are myriad details and construction
schedules to coordinate in America, Russia and other countries,
astronaut training to conduct and shuttle and rocket launches to
plan. And cumbersome language barriers to contend with as engineers
and astronauts often must work via interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Space Agency and NASA even had difficulty deciding
when and whether to hold a pre-launch press conference this week.
</P>
<P>
   But on a grand scale, the International Space Station is the
stuff of pre-Space Age fantasy. The result will be a maze-like
station circling the globe and inhabited by an international team
of astronauts and scientists working for the welfare of humankind.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials suggest it will pave the way for a manned mission
to Mars later in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Four space station crews are now in training, spending about 60
percent of their time at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and
the rest at the Russian space training facilities at Star City,
near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is irrational to duplicate efforts, senseless not to unite
our experience and resources,'' said German Titov, Russia's second
man in space and now a member of parliament. ``Space is there for
everybody. Let's make one international system for everyone's
use.''

 &HT;    TROUBLED MIR TO COME DOWN TO EARTH AS NEW SPACE STATION GOES UP
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-SPACE-1119; SPACE-STATION-1119.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As the new International Space Station goes up, Russian
space officials are trying to decide just when to bring down their
battered but beloved Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities have announced that they intend to bring the
12-year-old Mir station to earth in mid-1999, concluding its
service with a fiery re-entry into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But some Russian officials believe Mir should remain aloft, as a
symbol of Russian autonomy in space, and as a hedge against delays
in completion of the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at Mir's history:
</P>
<P>
   1986 -- Mir's 20-ton central module is launched into orbit; with
an estimated life-span of five years, Mir replaces the series of
smaller Salyut space stations operated by the Soviet Union in the
1970s and '80s
</P>
<P>
   1987 -- The 11-ton Kvant-1 module, with astrophysics and
life-support equipment, is launched and added to Mir.
</P>
<P>
   1989 -- A biological research station, the 20-ton Kvant-2
module, is attached to Mir.
</P>
<P>
   1990 -- The 20-ton Kristall research module is launched and
added to Mir; Soviet authorities shelve plans to launch a Mir-2
space station as talks proceed with international partners on
building an international space station.
</P>
<P>
   1991 -- The Soviet Union collapses; ensuing economic problems
prompt Russia to begin talks with United States on sharing Mir.
</P>
<P>
   1994 -- Russia and the U.S. agree to joint missions aboard Mir,
with NASA paying $500 million to subsidize the Russian program; a
docking module is added to Mir to allow link-up with American space
shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   1995 -- In February, the shuttle Discovery docks with Mir; In
May, Mir expands with the 20-ton Spektr module, carrying Russian
and American research equipment
</P>
<P>
   1996 -- Launch of the 20-ton Priroda research module.
</P>
<P>
   1997 -- On Feb. 23, a flash-fire occurs aboard Mir, the first in
a series of mishaps culminating on June 25, when the unmanned
Progress cargo ship collides with Spektr, nearly forcing the crew
of two Russian cosmonauts and American astronaut Michael Foale to
evacuate Mir.
</P>
<P>
   June 1998 -- The final U.S. mission to Mir as the shuttle
Discovery picks up the seventh and last American astronaut to serve
on Mir, Andrew Thomas, on board since January.
</P>
<P>
   1999 -- Sometime in the summer or fall, after 13 years of
service and clocking more than 2 billion miles, Mir is scheduled to
be pushed into a lower orbit and then disintegrate as it falls into
earth's atmosphere.

 &HT;    U.S., RUSSIA AND 14 OTHER NATIONS BUILD A SPACE STATION
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-SPACE-1119; SPACE-MIR-1119.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The world's most ambitious construction project begins
Friday(Nov. 20), more than 200 miles above the earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   The International Space Station is scheduled to be assembled
over the next five years at an ultimate cost that could run $40
billion to $90 billion. More than 100 components will be launched
on dozens of flights by and American space shuttles and Russian
booster rockets.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a 460-ton space research station will take shape --
five times larger than the Russian space station Mir. It will be
the third brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and
Venus.
</P>
<P>
   When completed in 2004, as scheduled, the complex will include a
dozen interlocking modules providing living quarters, research
laboratories and support equipment -- interior space equivalent to
two 747 jumbo jets.
</P>
<P>
   THE CONSTRUCTION PLAN:
</P>
<P>
   Friday -- The first space station component, Zarya, (Russian for
``sunrise'') is to be launched aboard a Russian Proton rocket from
Russia's version of Cape Canaveral, the launch site at Baikonur, in
the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. Zarya will provide
initial propulsion and power for the station. It was built by a
Russian company under contract to Boeing and financed by NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Early December -- The space shuttle Endeavour will ferry the
Unity module to link it with Zarya. Two astronauts will perform
three spacewalks over five days to connect data and power lines.
Unity, built by Boeing, is a hub unit that will interlock with six
other station components.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-1999 -- Russia is scheduled to launch the main service
module, though the country's economic problems have put the target
date in jeopardy. The module will contain living quarters,
navigation and life-support systems, and rocket boosters to
periodically nudge the station back into its proper orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Through early 2000 -- Shuttle missions and Russian rockets will
transport components to expand the station, including labs, solar
energy-collecting panels, a Soyuz return vehicle, communications
systems and a robot arm.
</P>
<P>
   March 2000-January 2004 -- Labs from Japan and the European
Space Agency will be added, along with U.S.-built living quarters
big enough for a permanent crew of seven.
</P>
<P>
   THE PRICETAG:
</P>
<P>
   Latest estimates put the cost at about $40 billion, more than
half to be paid by the United States. As Russia struggles in its
current economic crisis, Americans may well pay more. If the cost
of operating and servicing the shuttle fleet is included, the total
estimate rises to over $90 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Also joining the project are Japan, Canada, Brazil and 11
nations of the European Space Agency: Italy, Germany, France,
Britain, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden
and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   NASA said earlier this year that American costs would likely be
about $21.3 billion and an independent study commissioned by the
agency suggested in April that United States costs could climb as
high as $24.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The original Russian contribution to the program was expected to
be $8 billion to $10 billion before the current economic crisis.
The other partners' shares amount to about $3.1 billion from Japan;
$850 million from Canada; and $3.8 billion from the European group,
with a separate $550 million from Italy.

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ It was already a sad day for the Guerrero family.
Alfonso, the family patriarch, was in the hospital for a serious
cancer operation, and his children and grandchildren had come
together for a vigil outside his room at Mexico City's Santa
Patricia Hospital.
 &HT;    But things got worse thanks to some thugs. As relatives waited
for news, two men burst into the waiting room. One removed a pistol
from a fake plaster cast on his arm. They took everything from
everyone in the waiting room: money, jewelry, watches, cellular
telephones, even pens.
 &HT;    Hospitals, apparently, have become the final frontier for
Mexico's ever bolder thieves.
 &HT;    ``In the end, we didn't care that much about the robbery because
my grandfather pulled through the operation,'' says Ariadna Alba
Guerrero, 28, a kindergarten teacher. ``But being robbed in the
hospital? These people have no shame.''
 &HT;    No one anywhere seems safe. Crime in Mexico, once a sore on the
fringes of society, has come to infect the entire country.
 &HT;    Many of the horror stories make the Guerrero family seem lucky.
There was the murder last December of Peter John Zarate, a U.S.
real estate executive and father of three. He was killed in a
taxicab robbery gone wrong. Then there was Jan Reid, a writer for
Texas Monthly magazine. She was shot under similar circumstances
and left partially paralyzed, prompting the U.S. State Department
to repeat its warning that U.S. visitors should only take special
``Sitio Taxis'' from taxi stands.
 &HT;    Then there are the countless muggings, cargo robberies,
kidnappings, and murders that occur every day. About half of all
Mexicans say they have been the victim of a crime during the last
year, particularly armed robbery, according to informal surveys
conducted by security experts. Nearly all say they know someone who
has been a victim.
 &HT;    Crime often seems to reach into the least likely venues. This
reporter lost a washload of clothes when gun-toting thieves
sauntered into a Mexico City laundromat and demanded the business's
money. Because the proprietress only had US$25, they took all the
customers' clothes.
 &HT;    Official figures indicate that crime doubled between 1994 and
1996, though security specialists note that public distrust of the
police means many crimes are never reported.
 &HT;    ``Police are part of the problem,'' says Pete Palmer, the
director of Problem Solvers, a private security firm in Mexico
City.
 &HT;    The lack of public safety has gotten so bad that political
analysts are talking about the government's failure to provide for
citizens' basic security needs. And many foreign companies are
wondering if Mexico is such a good place to do business after all.
 &HT;    The worst problem for them might not be muggings and
kidnappings, but cargo theft. According to the National Truck and
Cargo Chamber, 200 trucks were robbed of their loads in the first
half of 1998, though chamber oficials said most of such robberies
are not reported. Several hundred more passenger buses have been
robbed, a third in or near Mexico City.
 &HT;    ``Crime is a huge issue for the companies we work with,'' says
Phillip Hendrix, the director of the Texas state trade office in
Mexico City, adding that Texas companies account for more than 40
percent of U.S. exports to Mexico and provide a large share of
foreign direct investment. ``We recruited 10 Texas companies to
come here for a trade show, and six canceled because of the State
Department advisory on taxis. We have other people who simply won't
come to Mexico, regardless.''
 &HT;    The crime situation in Mexico may seem outrageous, but a little
perspective might be in order. Yes, crime is bad, particularly in
Mexico City. And yes, private-sector experts believe it's getting
worse, despite the claims of the city government. But in one sad
sense, Mexico City has only been catching up to big cities in the
rest of the region, including New York, Bogota and Rio de Janeiro.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, we got a hell of a lot of crime, but it is not as
violent as north and south of here,'' says Palmer. ``The good news
is that criminals are not hopped up on some chemical the way they
often are in other countries, so they're less likely to shoot. And
you can get them to pick on someone else.''
 &HT;    Mexico City was once one of the safest cities in the hemisphere,
and it's still considered safer than New York. The Big Apple had
5,800 crimes per 100,000 persons every year; Mexico City had 3,000
per 100,000 persons (although experts say that number might be
understated because many victims do not report crimes).
 &HT;    Experts trace the current crime wave to a laundry list of
factors. Among them, the incipient family breakdown and the popular
perception of wealthy politicians, such as former president Carlos
Salinas de Gortari and his brother, Raul, as thieves. There's also
the sense of disorder that seems to accompany Mexico's political
and economic transition, and the increased respect for human rights
that goes with Mexico's democratic political development, but also
prevents police from using strong-arm tactics. There are few police
who know how to do proper investigations, and antiquated laws that
make them cumbersome, anyway.
 &HT;    But one statistic jumps out more than any other. For every 1,000
crimes committed (and reported to police), only 36 lead to arrest
and conviction.
 &HT;    ``Criminals evaluate their risks just like everyone else,'' says
Tom Cash, a senior managing director with the U.S. multinational
security firm Kroll-O'Gara. ``But there are so few arrests that the
chances are pretty good that things will work out for them.''
 &HT;    Many police officers actually participate in crimes, and the
honest ones simply don't have the manpower to handle the deluge.
Impunity reigns, say experts.
 &HT;    Responding to growing public outrage, President Ernesto Zedillo
recently unveiled a ``National Crusade against Crime and
Delinquency.'' Experts welcomed the $350 million program as a step
in the right direction in some ways. For example, the program
proposes counting all the police officers in the country _ an
unknown figure _ and keeping files on each one. That should help
prevent dirty officers from escaping their past by moving to
another state.
 &HT;    ``We have faltered, but we will not fail,'' says Zedillo.
 &HT;    The program also proposes to toughen penalties for white collar
crimes, which today are laughably light. For instance, for nearly
four years, the Mexican government assembled such a strong case
against fugitive banker Angel Isidoro Rodriguez, who is accused of
bilking shareholders of Banpais bank of more than $10 million, that
a court in Spain agreed to extradite him. But when he arrived in
Mexico this summer, he was released on bail because his alleged
offenses were not deemed ``serious'' under Mexican law.
 &HT;    But Zedillo's National Crusade could be a costly failure in
other respects, says Rafael Ruiz Harrell, Mexico's leading
criminologist. The plan stresses building more prisons and
toughening sentences, a deterrent whose effects are debatable.
Moreover, the plan does not consider ways to prevent crime before
it happens, an idea that was a cornerstone of the New York Police
Department's successful ``zero tolerance'' program.
 &HT;    ``The words preventive police are not even used in the wording
of the Crusade,'' says Ruiz Harrell. ``Zero tolerance was based on
the idea of promoting problem-solving police instead of reactive
police, but they haven't understood that here. For the government,
crime is a mechanical problem that occurs in a world parallel to
society. Let's just hope that the lack of stress on prevention
doesn't lead to human-rights abuses or repression.''
 &HT;    Perhaps the only good news to come from Mexico's crime wave is
that the average person is not entirely defenseless. While criminal
gangs dominate the kidnapping and auto theft industries _ infamous
kidnapper Daniel Arizmendi, known for cutting the ears off his
victims, worked with several dozen associates before his arrest in
August _ most run-of-the-mill thieves are amateurs. And while
assaults in hospitals or dark alleys or taxis might be hard to
avoid once they start, average people can take some precautions.
 &HT;    First, many thieves thrive on the element of surprise, and
prefer to avoid confrontation. Making eye contact and appearing
alert can scare them off.
 &HT;    ``If you've lived in New York or Los Angeles, you can handle
Mexico City, but don't leave your common sense on the airplane,''
says Palmer. ``It's not your profile that's dangerous, it's your
behavior. If you take certain precautions, the problem goes away.''
 &HT;    A little effort can help avoid other types of crime. Private
security firms offer courses that teach advanced driving techniques
to avoid assaults. Top executives should vary the routes they take
to work, make sure their office buildings are safe and consider
security guards, specialists say.
 &HT;    Cargo theft can be greatly reduced if companies keep careful
track of who's hauling their merchandise. The old system of
informal carriers is giving way to more professional trucking
companies.
 &HT;    The problem is that many of these measures are expensive. Top
security firms charge around $1,500 per day for consulting services
and courses, putting them out of the reach of most companies that
are not big multinationals.
 &HT;    The difficulty of reorganizing police forces and rewriting laws,
plus the recent rise in drug use registered among teenagers,
suggest that the fight against crime has only just begun in Mexico.
One question is whether it can be won. Another question is if it
can be won in time.
 &HT;    ``One big danger to Mexico is if these multinational businesses
leave because of unsafe conditions,'' says Cash, of Kroll-O'Gara.
``Do they move to Monterrey or Hermosillo? Or do they move to
Dallas or Houston or Miami?''

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO D.F. _ El dia ya era triste para la familia Guerrero.
Alfonso, el patriarca del clan, estaba hospitalizado para una
complicada operacion de cancer, y sus hijos y nietos se habian
reunido frente a su cuarto en el hospital Santa Patricia, en la
capital mexicana.
 &HT;    Mientras los familiares esperaban, dos hombres entraron en la
sala de espera. Uno saco una pistola de una escayola en el brazo.
Todos tuvieron que entregar sus pertenencias: dinero, joyas,
relojes, telefonos celulares, hasta las estilograficas.
 &HT;    Al parecer, los hospitales se han convertido en la ultima
frontera para los ladrones mas audaces de Mexico.
 &HT;    ``No le dimos gran importancia al robo porque mi abuelo salio
bien de la operacion,'' dice Ariadna Alba Guerrero, de 28 anos y
maestra.'' Pero que la asalten a una en un hospital? Son unos
sinverguenzas.''
 &HT;    Nadie se siente seguro en ninguna parte. La delincuencia, que
antes era una llaga en la periferia de la sociedad, ha llegado a
infectar a todo Mexico.
 &HT;    La anecdota de la familia Guerrero parece insignificante frente
a muchas historias de horror. En diciembre asesinaron a Peter John
Zarate, un ejecutivo norteamericano del sector inmobiliario,
durante un asalto a un taxi. Luego ocurrio el caso de Jan Reid,
escritor de la revista Texas Monthly. Lo balearon en circunstancias
similares y quedo parcialmente paralitico, lo cual llevo al
Departamento de Estado norteamericano a advertir de nuevo a los
estadounidenses de visita en Mexico que solo tomaran taxis desde
sus puestos centrales.
 &HT;    Ademas, cada dia suceden incontables asaltos, robos de
cargamentos, secuestros y asesinatos. Casi la mitad de los
mexicanos dicen que han sido victimas de un delito durante los
ultimos 12 meses, especialmente robo a mano armada, segun encuestas
informales realizadas por especialistas en seguridad. Casi todos
dicen conocer a alguna victima.
 &HT;    El delito parece llegar a los lugares mas inesperados. Este
reportero perdio varias prendas de ropa cuando unos ladrones
armados irrumpieron en una lavanderia de la capital y exigieron el
dinero del negocio. Como la propietaria solo tenia US$25, se
llevaron la ropa de todos los clientes.
 &HT;    Las cifras oficiales indican que el indice de delitos se duplico
entre 1994 y 1996, aunque los especialistas senalan que la
desconfianza del publico hacia la policia significa que muchos
delitos no se denuncian.
 &HT;    ``La policia es parte del problema,'' dice Pete Palmer, director
de Problem Solvers, una firma privada de seguridad de la capital
mexicana.
 &HT;    La falta de seguridad publica se ha agravado hasta el punto de
que los analistas politicos hablan del fracaso del gobierno en
ofrecer a la ciudadania un minimo de seguridad. Y muchas empresas
extranjeras se preguntan si Mexico, despues de todo, es un buen
lugar para invertir.
 &HT;    El peor problema para esas empresas tal vez no sean los asaltos
ni los secuestros, sino el robo de cargamentos. Segun la Camara
Nacional de Camiones y Carga, en la primera mitad de este ano los
ladrones robaron toda la carga de unos 200 camiones, aunque
funcionarios de la camara afirman que la mayor parte de esos robos
no se denuncian. Tamben han sufrido asaltos varios centenares de
autobuses, la tercera parte en la capital o en las cercanias.
 &HT;    ``El crimen es un gran problema para las companias con las que
trabajamos,'' comenta Phillip Hendrix, director de la oficina de
comercio estatal de Texas en Mexico D.F. Agrega que las empresas
tejanas representan mas del 40 por ciento de las exportaciones de
Estados Unidos a Mexico y aportan una gran parte de la inversion
extranjera directa. ``Invitamos a 10 empresas de Texas a participar
aqui en una feria comercial y seis cancelaron su participacion
debido al aviso del Departamento de Estado sobre los taxis. Otros
sencillamente se niegan a venir a Mexico.''
 &HT;    El problema del crimen en Mexico puede parecer terrible, pero
hay que verlo en perspectiva. No cabe duda de que es grave, sobre
todo en la capital. Y los especialistas del sector privado opinan
que empeora, a pesar de las afirmaciones del gobierno municipal.
Pero en cierto sentido, la capital mexicana se limita a ponerse al
mismo nivel de urbes como Nueva York, Bogota y Rio de Janeiro.
 &HT;    ``Si, es verdad que hay muchos delitos, pero no son tan
violentos como al norte o al sur de aqui``, dice Palmer. ``La buena
noticia es que los delincuentes no actuan bajo los efectos de
alguna droga, como ocurre a menudo en otros paises, asi que es
menos probable que abran fuego. Y uno puede lograr que elijan a
otra victima.''
 &HT;    La capital de Mexico fue en otros tiempos una de las ciudades
mas seguras del hemisferio, y todavia se la considera mas segura
que Nueva York, donde se cometen 5.800 delitos por cada 100.000
habitantes al ano; en Mexico D.F. la cifra es de 3.000 por cada
100.000, aunque los expertos dicen que podria estar por debajo de
la realidad porque muchas victimas no denuncian los delitos.
 &HT;    Los especialistas mencionan varios factores como causa de esta
ola de delitos, como la ruptura de los lazos familiares y la
percepcion popular de que los politicos adinerados, como el ex
presidente Carlos Salinas de Gortari y su hermano, Raul, son unos
ladrones. Tambien esta la sensacion de desorden que parece
acompanar a la transicion politica y economica de Mexico, y el
mayor respeto por los derechos humanos unido al desarrollo de la
democracia en el pais, que impide a la policia tratar a los
infractores con mano dura. Pocos policias saben como hacer
investigaciones adecuadas, lastradas ademas por leyes anticuadas.
 &HT;    Un dato estadistico se destaca mas que los otros. Por cada 1.000
delitos cometidos (y denunciados a la policia), solo 36 terminan en
arresto y sentencia.
 &HT;    ``Los delincuentes evaluan sus riesgos, como todo el mundo,''
senala Tom Cash, director gerente de la multinacional
norteamericana de seguridad Kroll-O'Gara. ``Pero hay tan pocos
arrestos que los infractores tienen muchas probabilidades de salir
bien.''
 &HT;    Es mas, muchos policias cometen delitos, y los honrados no son
suficientes para contener el diluvio. Reina la impunidad, dicen los
expertos.
 &HT;    Respondiendo al clamor publico, el presidente Ernesto Zedillo
puso en marcha recientemente una Cruzada Nacional contra el Crimen
y la Delincuencia. Los expertos consideran que el programa de
US$350 millones es un paso en la direccion correcta en muchos
sentidos. Por ejemplo, el plan contempla contabilizar a todos los
policias del pais (una cifra desconocida) y mantenerles un
expediente. Eso ayudaria a impedir que los agentes corruptos
escapen al castigo por delitos cometidos mediante la huida a otro
estado.
 &HT;    ``Hemos titubeado, pero no fallaremos,'' afirma Zedillo.
 &HT;    El programa tambien contempla penas mas severas para los delitos
administrativos, que hoy son ridiculamente leves. Por ejemplo,
durante casi cuatro anos, el gobierno mexicano preparo un caso tan
fuerte contra el banquero fugitivo Angel Isidoro Rodriguez, acusado
de desfalcar a los accionistas del banco Banpais en mas de US$10
millones, que un tribunal espanol acordo extraditarlo. Pero cuando
Rodriguez llego a Mexico este verano, lo dejaron en libertad bajo
fianza porque la ley mexicana no consideraba ``graves'' sus
presuntos delitos.
 &HT;    Pero en otros sentidos la cruzada nacional de Zedillo podria ser
un fracaso costoso, apunta Rafael Ruiz Harrell, el principal
criminologo de Mexico. El plan da gran importancia a la
construccion de mas carceles y a sentencias mas severas, pero el
efecto disuasorio de esas medidas es discutible. Ademas, el plan no
considera formas de prevenir el delito, la piedra angular del
exitoso programa de ``tolerancia cero'' de la Policia de Nueva
York.
 &HT;    ``Las palabras policia preventiva ni siquiera estan en el lexico
de la Cruzada,'' senala Ruiz Harrell. ``La tolerancia cero se baso
en la nocion de una policia que prevenia los problemas, en vez de
reaccionar a un delito ya cometido, pero aqui no se ha entendido
ese concepto. Para el gobierno, el crimen es un problema mecanico
que ocurre en un mundo paralelo a la sociedad. Esperemos que la
falta de enfasis en la prevencion no conduzca a abusos contra los
derechos humanos y a la represion.''
 &HT;    Quiza la unica buena noticia es que el ciudadano comun no esta
completamente indefenso. Mientras las bandas criminales dominan el
negocio de los secuestros y el robo de automoviles (el infame
secuestrador Daniel Arizmendi, tristemente celebre por cortarle las
orejas a sus victimas, trabajaba con numerosos asociados antes de
que lo arrestaran en agosto), la mayoria de los ladrones son
aficionados. Y aunque un asalto en un hospital o en un callejon
oscuro puede ser dificil de evitar una vez que ha comenzado, la
gente comun puede tomar ciertas precauciones.
 &HT;    En primer lugar, muchos ladrones cuentan con el factor sorpresa
y prefieren evitar una confrontacion. Hacer contacto visual y dar
la impresion de estar alerta puede desanimarlos.
 &HT;    ``Si uno vive en Nueva York o en Los Angeles, puede defenderse
en Mexico, siempre que no deje su sentido comun en el avion,''
afirma Palmer. ``El peligro no esta en las caracteristicas de uno,
sino en su comportamiento. Si uno toma ciertas precauciones, el
problema desaparece.''
 &HT;    Un pequeno esfuerzo puede evitar otros tipos de delito. Las
firmas de seguridad privada ofrecen cursos donde se ensenan
tecnicas avanzadas para evitar asaltos. Los altos ejecutivos nunca
deben seguir la misma ruta para ir al trabajo, deben asegurarse de
que sus oficinas esten protegidas y deben considerar el empleo de
guardias de seguridad, dicen los especialistas.
 &HT;    El robo de cargamentos puede reducirse en gran medida si las
empresas mantienen un registro cuidadoso de los que transportan sus
mercancias. El viejo sistema de usar a transportistas informales
cede su puesto a empresas mas profesionales.
 &HT;    El problema radica en que muchas de esas medidas son costosas.
Las principales firmas de seguridad cobran unos U$1.500 diarios por
servicios de asesoria y cursos, demasiado costoso para muchas
empresas medianas y pequenas.
 &HT;    La dificultad de reorganizar los cuerpos policiales y modificar
las leyes, ademas del reciente aumento del uso de drogas entre los
jovenes, indican que la batalla contra el crimen en Mexico acaba de
empezar. Cabe preguntarse si esa batalla se puede ganar. Y tambien
si se ganara a tiempo.
 &HT;    ``Mexico corre el gran peligro de que estos negocios
multinacionales se vayan debido a la inseguridad,'' dice Cash, de
Kroll-O'Gara. ``Se mudaran a Monterrey o a Hermosillo? O se mudaran
a Dallas, a Houston o a Miami?''

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ It was already a sad day for the Guerrero family.
Alfonso, the family patriarch, was in the hospital for a serious
cancer operation, and his children and grandchildren had come
together for a vigil outside his room at Mexico City's Santa
Patricia Hospital.
 &HT;    But things got worse thanks to some thugs. As relatives waited
for news, two men burst into the waiting room. One removed a pistol
from a fake plaster cast on his arm. They took everything from
everyone in the waiting room: money, jewelry, watches, cellular
telephones, even pens.
 &HT;    Hospitals, apparently, have become the final frontier for
Mexico's ever bolder thieves.
 &HT;    ``In the end, we didn't care that much about the robbery because
my grandfather pulled through the operation,'' says Ariadna Alba
Guerrero, 28, a kindergarten teacher. ``But being robbed in the
hospital? These people have no shame.''
 &HT;    No one anywhere seems safe. Crime in Mexico, once a sore on the
fringes of society, has come to infect the entire country.
 &HT;    Many of the horror stories make the Guerrero family seem lucky.
There was the murder last December of Peter John Zarate, a U.S.
real estate executive and father of three. He was killed in a
taxicab robbery gone wrong. Then there was Jan Reid, a writer for
Texas Monthly magazine. She was shot under similar circumstances
and left partially paralyzed, prompting the U.S. State Department
to repeat its warning that U.S. visitors should only take special
``Sitio Taxis'' from taxi stands.
 &HT;    Then there are the countless muggings, cargo robberies,
kidnappings, and murders that occur every day. About half of all
Mexicans say they have been the victim of a crime during the last
year, particularly armed robbery, according to informal surveys
conducted by security experts. Nearly all say they know someone who
has been a victim.
 &HT;    Crime often seems to reach into the least likely venues. This
reporter lost a washload of clothes when gun-toting thieves
sauntered into a Mexico City laundromat and demanded the business's
money. Because the proprietress only had US$25, they took all the
customers' clothes.
 &HT;    Official figures indicate that crime doubled between 1994 and
1996, though security specialists note that public distrust of the
police means many crimes are never reported.
 &HT;    ``Police are part of the problem,'' says Pete Palmer, the
director of Problem Solvers, a private security firm in Mexico
City.
 &HT;    The lack of public safety has gotten so bad that political
analysts are talking about the government's failure to provide for
citizens' basic security needs. And many foreign companies are
wondering if Mexico is such a good place to do business after all.
 &HT;    The worst problem for them might not be muggings and
kidnappings, but cargo theft. According to the National Truck and
Cargo Chamber, 200 trucks were robbed of their loads in the first
half of 1998, though chamber oficials said most of such robberies
are not reported. Several hundred more passenger buses have been
robbed, a third in or near Mexico City.
 &HT;    ``Crime is a huge issue for the companies we work with,'' says
Phillip Hendrix, the director of the Texas state trade office in
Mexico City, adding that Texas companies account for more than 40
percent of U.S. exports to Mexico and provide a large share of
foreign direct investment. ``We recruited 10 Texas companies to
come here for a trade show, and six canceled because of the State
Department advisory on taxis. We have other people who simply won't
come to Mexico, regardless.''
 &HT;    The crime situation in Mexico may seem outrageous, but a little
perspective might be in order. Yes, crime is bad, particularly in
Mexico City. And yes, private-sector experts believe it's getting
worse, despite the claims of the city government. But in one sad
sense, Mexico City has only been catching up to big cities in the
rest of the region, including New York, Bogota and Rio de Janeiro.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, we got a hell of a lot of crime, but it is not as
violent as north and south of here,'' says Palmer. ``The good news
is that criminals are not hopped up on some chemical the way they
often are in other countries, so they're less likely to shoot. And
you can get them to pick on someone else.''
 &HT;    Mexico City was once one of the safest cities in the hemisphere,
and it's still considered safer than New York. The Big Apple had
5,800 crimes per 100,000 persons every year; Mexico City had 3,000
per 100,000 persons (although experts say that number might be
understated because many victims do not report crimes).
 &HT;    Experts trace the current crime wave to a laundry list of
factors. Among them, the incipient family breakdown and the popular
perception of wealthy politicians, such as former president Carlos
Salinas de Gortari and his brother, Raul, as thieves. There's also
the sense of disorder that seems to accompany Mexico's political
and economic transition, and the increased respect for human rights
that goes with Mexico's democratic political development, but also
prevents police from using strong-arm tactics. There are few police
who know how to do proper investigations, and antiquated laws that
make them cumbersome, anyway.
 &HT;    But one statistic jumps out more than any other. For every 1,000
crimes committed (and reported to police), only 36 lead to arrest
and conviction.
 &HT;    ``Criminals evaluate their risks just like everyone else,'' says
Tom Cash, a senior managing director with the U.S. multinational
security firm Kroll-O'Gara. ``But there are so few arrests that the
chances are pretty good that things will work out for them.''
 &HT;    Many police officers actually participate in crimes, and the
honest ones simply don't have the manpower to handle the deluge.
Impunity reigns, say experts.
 &HT;    Responding to growing public outrage, President Ernesto Zedillo
recently unveiled a ``National Crusade against Crime and
Delinquency.'' Experts welcomed the $350 million program as a step
in the right direction in some ways. For example, the program
proposes counting all the police officers in the country _ an
unknown figure _ and keeping files on each one. That should help
prevent dirty officers from escaping their past by moving to
another state.
 &HT;    ``We have faltered, but we will not fail,'' says Zedillo.
 &HT;    The program also proposes to toughen penalties for white collar
crimes, which today are laughably light. For instance, for nearly
four years, the Mexican government assembled such a strong case
against fugitive banker Angel Isidoro Rodriguez, who is accused of
bilking shareholders of Banpais bank of more than $10 million, that
a court in Spain agreed to extradite him. But when he arrived in
Mexico this summer, he was released on bail because his alleged
offenses were not deemed ``serious'' under Mexican law.
 &HT;    But Zedillo's National Crusade could be a costly failure in
other respects, says Rafael Ruiz Harrell, Mexico's leading
criminologist. The plan stresses building more prisons and
toughening sentences, a deterrent whose effects are debatable.
Moreover, the plan does not consider ways to prevent crime before
it happens, an idea that was a cornerstone of the New York Police
Department's successful ``zero tolerance'' program.
 &HT;    ``The words preventive police are not even used in the wording
of the Crusade,'' says Ruiz Harrell. ``Zero tolerance was based on
the idea of promoting problem-solving police instead of reactive
police, but they haven't understood that here. For the government,
crime is a mechanical problem that occurs in a world parallel to
society. Let's just hope that the lack of stress on prevention
doesn't lead to human-rights abuses or repression.''
 &HT;    Perhaps the only good news to come from Mexico's crime wave is
that the average person is not entirely defenseless. While criminal
gangs dominate the kidnapping and auto theft industries _ infamous
kidnapper Daniel Arizmendi, known for cutting the ears off his
victims, worked with several dozen associates before his arrest in
August _ most run-of-the-mill thieves are amateurs. And while
assaults in hospitals or dark alleys or taxis might be hard to
avoid once they start, average people can take some precautions.
 &HT;    First, many thieves thrive on the element of surprise, and
prefer to avoid confrontation. Making eye contact and appearing
alert can scare them off.
 &HT;    ``If you've lived in New York or Los Angeles, you can handle
Mexico City, but don't leave your common sense on the airplane,''
says Palmer. ``It's not your profile that's dangerous, it's your
behavior. If you take certain precautions, the problem goes away.''
 &HT;    A little effort can help avoid other types of crime. Private
security firms offer courses that teach advanced driving techniques
to avoid assaults. Top executives should vary the routes they take
to work, make sure their office buildings are safe and consider
security guards, specialists say.
 &HT;    Cargo theft can be greatly reduced if companies keep careful
track of who's hauling their merchandise. The old system of
informal carriers is giving way to more professional trucking
companies.
 &HT;    The problem is that many of these measures are expensive. Top
security firms charge around $1,500 per day for consulting services
and courses, putting them out of the reach of most companies that
are not big multinationals.
 &HT;    The difficulty of reorganizing police forces and rewriting laws,
plus the recent rise in drug use registered among teenagers,
suggest that the fight against crime has only just begun in Mexico.
One question is whether it can be won. Another question is if it
can be won in time.
 &HT;    ``One big danger to Mexico is if these multinational businesses
leave because of unsafe conditions,'' says Cash, of Kroll-O'Gara.
``Do they move to Monterrey or Hermosillo? Or do they move to
Dallas or Houston or Miami?''

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO D.F. _ El dia ya era triste para la familia Guerrero.
Alfonso, el patriarca del clan, estaba hospitalizado para una
complicada operacion de cancer, y sus hijos y nietos se habian
reunido frente a su cuarto en el hospital Santa Patricia, en la
capital mexicana.
 &HT;    Mientras los familiares esperaban, dos hombres entraron en la
sala de espera. Uno saco una pistola de una escayola en el brazo.
Todos tuvieron que entregar sus pertenencias: dinero, joyas,
relojes, telefonos celulares, hasta las estilograficas.
 &HT;    Al parecer, los hospitales se han convertido en la ultima
frontera para los ladrones mas audaces de Mexico.
 &HT;    ``No le dimos gran importancia al robo porque mi abuelo salio
bien de la operacion,'' dice Ariadna Alba Guerrero, de 28 anos y
maestra.'' Pero que la asalten a una en un hospital? Son unos
sinverguenzas.''
 &HT;    Nadie se siente seguro en ninguna parte. La delincuencia, que
antes era una llaga en la periferia de la sociedad, ha llegado a
infectar a todo Mexico.
 &HT;    La anecdota de la familia Guerrero parece insignificante frente
a muchas historias de horror. En diciembre asesinaron a Peter John
Zarate, un ejecutivo norteamericano del sector inmobiliario,
durante un asalto a un taxi. Luego ocurrio el caso de Jan Reid,
escritor de la revista Texas Monthly. Lo balearon en circunstancias
similares y quedo parcialmente paralitico, lo cual llevo al
Departamento de Estado norteamericano a advertir de nuevo a los
estadounidenses de visita en Mexico que solo tomaran taxis desde
sus puestos centrales.
 &HT;    Ademas, cada dia suceden incontables asaltos, robos de
cargamentos, secuestros y asesinatos. Casi la mitad de los
mexicanos dicen que han sido victimas de un delito durante los
ultimos 12 meses, especialmente robo a mano armada, segun encuestas
informales realizadas por especialistas en seguridad. Casi todos
dicen conocer a alguna victima.
 &HT;    El delito parece llegar a los lugares mas inesperados. Este
reportero perdio varias prendas de ropa cuando unos ladrones
armados irrumpieron en una lavanderia de la capital y exigieron el
dinero del negocio. Como la propietaria solo tenia US$25, se
llevaron la ropa de todos los clientes.
 &HT;    Las cifras oficiales indican que el indice de delitos se duplico
entre 1994 y 1996, aunque los especialistas senalan que la
desconfianza del publico hacia la policia significa que muchos
delitos no se denuncian.
 &HT;    ``La policia es parte del problema,'' dice Pete Palmer, director
de Problem Solvers, una firma privada de seguridad de la capital
mexicana.
 &HT;    La falta de seguridad publica se ha agravado hasta el punto de
que los analistas politicos hablan del fracaso del gobierno en
ofrecer a la ciudadania un minimo de seguridad. Y muchas empresas
extranjeras se preguntan si Mexico, despues de todo, es un buen
lugar para invertir.
 &HT;    El peor problema para esas empresas tal vez no sean los asaltos
ni los secuestros, sino el robo de cargamentos. Segun la Camara
Nacional de Camiones y Carga, en la primera mitad de este ano los
ladrones robaron toda la carga de unos 200 camiones, aunque
funcionarios de la camara afirman que la mayor parte de esos robos
no se denuncian. Tamben han sufrido asaltos varios centenares de
autobuses, la tercera parte en la capital o en las cercanias.
 &HT;    ``El crimen es un gran problema para las companias con las que
trabajamos,'' comenta Phillip Hendrix, director de la oficina de
comercio estatal de Texas en Mexico D.F. Agrega que las empresas
tejanas representan mas del 40 por ciento de las exportaciones de
Estados Unidos a Mexico y aportan una gran parte de la inversion
extranjera directa. ``Invitamos a 10 empresas de Texas a participar
aqui en una feria comercial y seis cancelaron su participacion
debido al aviso del Departamento de Estado sobre los taxis. Otros
sencillamente se niegan a venir a Mexico.''
 &HT;    El problema del crimen en Mexico puede parecer terrible, pero
hay que verlo en perspectiva. No cabe duda de que es grave, sobre
todo en la capital. Y los especialistas del sector privado opinan
que empeora, a pesar de las afirmaciones del gobierno municipal.
Pero en cierto sentido, la capital mexicana se limita a ponerse al
mismo nivel de urbes como Nueva York, Bogota y Rio de Janeiro.
 &HT;    ``Si, es verdad que hay muchos delitos, pero no son tan
violentos como al norte o al sur de aqui``, dice Palmer. ``La buena
noticia es que los delincuentes no actuan bajo los efectos de
alguna droga, como ocurre a menudo en otros paises, asi que es
menos probable que abran fuego. Y uno puede lograr que elijan a
otra victima.''
 &HT;    La capital de Mexico fue en otros tiempos una de las ciudades
mas seguras del hemisferio, y todavia se la considera mas segura
que Nueva York, donde se cometen 5.800 delitos por cada 100.000
habitantes al ano; en Mexico D.F. la cifra es de 3.000 por cada
100.000, aunque los expertos dicen que podria estar por debajo de
la realidad porque muchas victimas no denuncian los delitos.
 &HT;    Los especialistas mencionan varios factores como causa de esta
ola de delitos, como la ruptura de los lazos familiares y la
percepcion popular de que los politicos adinerados, como el ex
presidente Carlos Salinas de Gortari y su hermano, Raul, son unos
ladrones. Tambien esta la sensacion de desorden que parece
acompanar a la transicion politica y economica de Mexico, y el
mayor respeto por los derechos humanos unido al desarrollo de la
democracia en el pais, que impide a la policia tratar a los
infractores con mano dura. Pocos policias saben como hacer
investigaciones adecuadas, lastradas ademas por leyes anticuadas.
 &HT;    Un dato estadistico se destaca mas que los otros. Por cada 1.000
delitos cometidos (y denunciados a la policia), solo 36 terminan en
arresto y sentencia.
 &HT;    ``Los delincuentes evaluan sus riesgos, como todo el mundo,''
senala Tom Cash, director gerente de la multinacional
norteamericana de seguridad Kroll-O'Gara. ``Pero hay tan pocos
arrestos que los infractores tienen muchas probabilidades de salir
bien.''
 &HT;    Es mas, muchos policias cometen delitos, y los honrados no son
suficientes para contener el diluvio. Reina la impunidad, dicen los
expertos.
 &HT;    Respondiendo al clamor publico, el presidente Ernesto Zedillo
puso en marcha recientemente una Cruzada Nacional contra el Crimen
y la Delincuencia. Los expertos consideran que el programa de
US$350 millones es un paso en la direccion correcta en muchos
sentidos. Por ejemplo, el plan contempla contabilizar a todos los
policias del pais (una cifra desconocida) y mantenerles un
expediente. Eso ayudaria a impedir que los agentes corruptos
escapen al castigo por delitos cometidos mediante la huida a otro
estado.
 &HT;    ``Hemos titubeado, pero no fallaremos,'' afirma Zedillo.
 &HT;    El programa tambien contempla penas mas severas para los delitos
administrativos, que hoy son ridiculamente leves. Por ejemplo,
durante casi cuatro anos, el gobierno mexicano preparo un caso tan
fuerte contra el banquero fugitivo Angel Isidoro Rodriguez, acusado
de desfalcar a los accionistas del banco Banpais en mas de US$10
millones, que un tribunal espanol acordo extraditarlo. Pero cuando
Rodriguez llego a Mexico este verano, lo dejaron en libertad bajo
fianza porque la ley mexicana no consideraba ``graves'' sus
presuntos delitos.
 &HT;    Pero en otros sentidos la cruzada nacional de Zedillo podria ser
un fracaso costoso, apunta Rafael Ruiz Harrell, el principal
criminologo de Mexico. El plan da gran importancia a la
construccion de mas carceles y a sentencias mas severas, pero el
efecto disuasorio de esas medidas es discutible. Ademas, el plan no
considera formas de prevenir el delito, la piedra angular del
exitoso programa de ``tolerancia cero'' de la Policia de Nueva
York.
 &HT;    ``Las palabras policia preventiva ni siquiera estan en el lexico
de la Cruzada,'' senala Ruiz Harrell. ``La tolerancia cero se baso
en la nocion de una policia que prevenia los problemas, en vez de
reaccionar a un delito ya cometido, pero aqui no se ha entendido
ese concepto. Para el gobierno, el crimen es un problema mecanico
que ocurre en un mundo paralelo a la sociedad. Esperemos que la
falta de enfasis en la prevencion no conduzca a abusos contra los
derechos humanos y a la represion.''
 &HT;    Quiza la unica buena noticia es que el ciudadano comun no esta
completamente indefenso. Mientras las bandas criminales dominan el
negocio de los secuestros y el robo de automoviles (el infame
secuestrador Daniel Arizmendi, tristemente celebre por cortarle las
orejas a sus victimas, trabajaba con numerosos asociados antes de
que lo arrestaran en agosto), la mayoria de los ladrones son
aficionados. Y aunque un asalto en un hospital o en un callejon
oscuro puede ser dificil de evitar una vez que ha comenzado, la
gente comun puede tomar ciertas precauciones.
 &HT;    En primer lugar, muchos ladrones cuentan con el factor sorpresa
y prefieren evitar una confrontacion. Hacer contacto visual y dar
la impresion de estar alerta puede desanimarlos.
 &HT;    ``Si uno vive en Nueva York o en Los Angeles, puede defenderse
en Mexico, siempre que no deje su sentido comun en el avion,''
afirma Palmer. ``El peligro no esta en las caracteristicas de uno,
sino en su comportamiento. Si uno toma ciertas precauciones, el
problema desaparece.''
 &HT;    Un pequeno esfuerzo puede evitar otros tipos de delito. Las
firmas de seguridad privada ofrecen cursos donde se ensenan
tecnicas avanzadas para evitar asaltos. Los altos ejecutivos nunca
deben seguir la misma ruta para ir al trabajo, deben asegurarse de
que sus oficinas esten protegidas y deben considerar el empleo de
guardias de seguridad, dicen los especialistas.
 &HT;    El robo de cargamentos puede reducirse en gran medida si las
empresas mantienen un registro cuidadoso de los que transportan sus
mercancias. El viejo sistema de usar a transportistas informales
cede su puesto a empresas mas profesionales.
 &HT;    El problema radica en que muchas de esas medidas son costosas.
Las principales firmas de seguridad cobran unos U$1.500 diarios por
servicios de asesoria y cursos, demasiado costoso para muchas
empresas medianas y pequenas.
 &HT;    La dificultad de reorganizar los cuerpos policiales y modificar
las leyes, ademas del reciente aumento del uso de drogas entre los
jovenes, indican que la batalla contra el crimen en Mexico acaba de
empezar. Cabe preguntarse si esa batalla se puede ganar. Y tambien
si se ganara a tiempo.
 &HT;    ``Mexico corre el gran peligro de que estos negocios
multinacionales se vayan debido a la inseguridad,'' dice Cash, de
Kroll-O'Gara. ``Se mudaran a Monterrey o a Hermosillo? O se mudaran
a Dallas, a Houston o a Miami?''

oscuro puede ser dificil de evitar una vez que ha comenzado, la
gente comun puede tomar ciertas precauciones.
 &HT;    En primer lugar, muchos ladrones cuentan con el factor sorpresa
y prefieren evitar una confrontacion. Hacer contacto visual y dar
la impresion de estar alerta puede desanimarlos.
 &HT;    ``Si uno vive en Nueva York o en Los Angeles, puede defenderse
en Mexico, siempre que no deje su sentido comun en el avion,''
afirma Palmer. ``El peligro no esta en las caracteristicas de uno,
sino en su comportamiento. Si uno toma ciertas precauciones, el
problema desaparece.''
 &HT;    Un pequeno esfuerzo puede evitar otros tipos de delito. Las
firmas de seguridad privada ofrecen cursos donde se ensenan
tecnicas avanzadas para evitar asaltos. Los altos ejecutivos nunca
deben seguir la misma ruta para ir al trabajo, deben asegurarse de
que sus oficinas esten protegidas y deben considerar el empleo de
guardias de seguridad, dicen los especialistas.
 &HT;    El robo de cargamentos puede reducirse en gran medida si las
empresas mantienen un registro cuidadoso de los que transportan sus
mercancias. El viejo sistema de usar a transportistas informales
cede su puesto a empresas mas profesionales.
 &HT;    El problema radica en que muchas de esas medidas son costosas.
Las principales firmas de seguridad cobran unos U$1.500 diarios por
servicios de asesoria y cursos, demasiado costoso para muchas
empresas medianas y pequenas.
 &HT;    La dificultad de reorganizar los cuerpos policiales y modificar
las leyes, ademas del reciente aumento del uso de drogas entre los
jovenes, indican que la batalla contra el crimen en Mexico acaba de
empezar. Cabe preguntarse si esa batalla se puede ganar. Y tambien
si se ganara a tiempo.
 &HT;    ``Mexico corre el gran peligro de que estos negocios
multinacionales se vayan debido a la inseguridad,'' dice Cash, de
Kroll-O'Gara. ``Se mudaran a Monterrey o a Hermosillo? O se mudaran
a Dallas, a Houston o a Miami?''

   MOSCOW _ Russia's pressing task is as old as winter: Find a way
to stay fed and unfrozen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the country must do it under severe economic pressure
following the onset of Russia's economic crisis in mid-August. The
crash of the ruble has sent the average Russian income to $40 a
month; most Russians survive by cutting luxuries like meat from
their diet and surviving on vegetables they grow in their own
gardens and pickle for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   At greatest risk are the 12 million Russians living in the
country's northern and far eastern regions; remote areas near and
above the Arctic Circle that have always depended on help to
survive. Mainly mining and fishing outposts, the towns were founded
in Soviet times, but post-Communist Russia is struggling to keep
them supplied.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the economic crisis and unpaid bills, deliveries of
food and fuel were slow to arrive before the ports froze over. Now
the harbors are solid ice and Russia's fleet of ice-breaking cargo
ships, a traditional means of supplying the northern mining towns,
is broken down.
</P>
<P>
   The governors of Yakutia and Murmansk, among other regions, have
declared states of emergency. The region of Kamchatka prepared a
direct appeal to the United Nations. The Far East city of Magadan
said at the end of October that it had only enough food supplies to
last a month and had received only 16 percent of its coal supplies
for winter.
</P>
<P>
   Among the aid to help Russia through its winter:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The United States has pledged $625 million to supply grain,
meat, milk, soybeans and other food assistance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The European Union has offered $472 million worth of food aid.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Red Cross has requested donations of $15 million to supply
emergency aid to the following regions it designated as the hardest
hit:
</P>
<P>
   1. Kaliningrad
</P>
<P>
   2. Murmansk
</P>

   PETROPAVLOVSK-KAMCHATSKY, Russia _ At Public School 17, students
and teachers are bundled in winter coats and thick wool sweaters.
Each breath fogs in the frigid air as they recite grammar lessons.
The potted plants on the window sill, intended to add some life to
the drab classroom, are frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a thick blanket of snow already covers the remote
Kamchatka peninsula in Russia's Far East. Temperatures have been
below freezing for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the school on a recent November morning, the mercury
wasn't much higher, because after weeks of numbing cold, the
heating came on for the first time this season only hours ago.
</P>
<P>
   Winter arrives early and hard in this Pacific port city, and
throughout Russia's remote regions in the Arctic, central Siberia
and the Far East. Russia's economic crisis and the annual arrival
of ice and snow are a dangerous combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live like primitive people. No heat. No lights. No money.
Things are awful. The coming 21st century doesn't matter in
Kamchatka. It matters only in other countries. Here it is the 19th
century,'' complained Oxana Ivanova, 17, a student at P.S. 17.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, fuel shortages cut heat and electricity to
homes, businesses and schools and caused several deaths on
Kamchatka, nine times zones and 5,000 miles east of Moscow. Similar
shortages have hit other remote areas and forced evacuations as the
government in Moscow cannot afford to supply food and fuel.
</P>
<P>
   At Public School 17, perched on a ridge in the shadow of a
dramatic range of snow-peaked volcanic mountains that meet the
Pacific Ocean, heat and lights were restored this week, as they
were to most parts of Kamchatka, a peninsula roughly the size of
California and home to 400,000 Russians.
</P>
<P>
   But for weeks, temperatures inside apartments, classrooms and
offices dipped below 45 degrees as winter storms descended. Lacking
fuel to run two main power plants, electricity was rationed to
three hours a day and the central heating network, which supplies
virtually every building on the peninsula with steam heat, was not
turned on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about such conditions from my grandfather and now this
year I found myself in such terrible times,'' said Ludmilla
Nanovskaya, an English teacher at P.S. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Adding financial anxiety to the aching cold, the region's
teachers have not been paid since the school year began on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity and heat began flowing -- at least for now -- after
embarrassed authorities in Moscow acknowledged the emergency and
ordered 10,000 tons of fuel oil from the Pacific navy fleet's
reserves to feed the peninsula's power plants.
</P>
<P>
   They were goaded to the task after the local Kamchatka
legislature drafted and threatened to send a direct appeal for
humanitarian assistance to the United Nations. Other strapped and
suffering regions in Russia have made similar appeals, an ominous
and awkward reminder to the Kremlin of the country's vulnerability
as four months of brutal winter begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this problem is solved we will continue to work from
crisis to crisis,'' said Yevgeny Klochkov, director of
Kamchatskenergo, the local utility that provides heat and
electricity to the peninsula. ``The problem is not resolved for the
entire winter because we do not have the cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian weather forecasters have predicted the harshest winter
in 30 years. This discouraging news came amid last month's report
that Russia's grain harvest was nearly half the levels of 1997 and
the worst in 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the economic crash of August, which sent the ruble
plummeting, has made more than half of all Russians poor. According
to the Russian Center of the Standard of Living, 79 million
Russians now live in poverty, out of a total population of 147
million.
</P>
<P>
   To help alleviate concerns about food supplies, the United
States and Russia last week reached a deal to ship 3.1 million tons
of American food aid, including grain and meat -- about half of it
in the form of direct aid.
</P>
<P>
   Here by the sea in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky there are no food
shortages. But as in much of Russia, food is out of reach with the
country's economy in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has this problem. There are things to buy but no one
is buying because no one can afford it. So people grow their own,''
said Olga Kosmynina, editor of the local Rybak Kamchatsky
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia's economic crisis erupted in mid-August, her paper
has been running a regular ``how to survive'' feature -- such as
tips on how to pickle cabbage for the winter and how to better seal
your windows from the icy winter winds.
</P>
<P>
   The predicament in Kamchatka was caused by a chain reaction that
reflects the paralysis of Russia's economy today, not quite a free
market and not quite the welfare state of Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, virtually bankrupt, cannot pay the
military, the largest single consumer of energy in Kamchatka, which
is dotted with naval and air force bases. Thus, the military cannot
pay the local utility, which has amassed $146 million in debts and
was unable to buy fuel to run its plants.
</P>
<P>
   Until mid-November, people read by candlelight and there was no
hot water. They slept in their parkas and wool caps. The school day
and business hours were cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   This in a country that is the world's premier producer of
natural gas and on a peninsula seething with active volcanoes --
geothermal energy just waiting to be tapped. Plans call for a new
gas pipeline and geothermal plants, but construction has been
hampered by Russia's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The perplexing irony is that if this region were gauged by its
natural resources, geography and educated populace, it would be
rich. The peninsula and the surrounding waters are bountiful in
seafood and deposits of gold, copper and nickel. Kamchatka is
nearer to Tokyo and Anchorage than to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, such outposts were supported by the communist
government, who settled the remote regions to fortify the empire
and exploit the natural resources. But post-Soviet Russia, rife
with corruption, struggling to reform its economy and nearly out of
cash, finds it increasingly difficult to subsidize the regions.
</P>
<P>
   Russian lawmakers have called for the evacuation of over 1
million residents of the worst-hit areas. Heating fuel rations and
electricity cuts also have reached the Yakutia region in
northeastern Siberia and Sakhalin Island, Chukotka and Koryak on
Russia's northern Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   In Kamchatka and elsewhere, Russians approach the coming winter
with docile forbearance, relying on food they have grown during the
summer to last them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   No one predicts catastrophe, yet no one is happy about their
circumstances either as they cope to combat hunger and cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, we like to emphasize that Russia is so great, so
large,'' said Vladimir Yefimov, director of the local television
station in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. ``But there is less and less
of that. Russia is being whittled away.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: IS WINDOWS AN 'ESSENTIAL FACILITY?'
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial queues for release
Sunday, Nov. 22.

   WASHINGTON _ Like the software suites that roll out of
Microsoft's labs, the stakes in the government's antitrust case
keep growing ever more complex.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the trust-busters were quite content when a judge
ruled that Microsoft must untangle Windows 95 from its Internet
browser tool. But that ruling was reversed. And Windows 95 gave way
to Windows 98, which implants the browser eye so close to the
operating brain that tearing them apart risks total blindness.
</P>
<P>
   In filing a somewhat broader case last May, the antitrust police
still focused mainly on Microsoft's bruising browser battle with
Netscape. But when they used their vast subpoena powers to flush a
cache of e-mails, they were shocked to find that when Microsoft
dictates, the personal computer world trembles in fear and
foreboding.
</P>
<P>
   So the prosecutors are now trying to move the goal posts anew.
They remain shy about suggesting any real-world remedies until the
final verdict is in. But with the trial entering its sixth week,
it's clear that everything is on the table.
</P>
<P>
   That signal came when top litigator David Boies asked Netscape
chief Jim Barksdale whether Microsoft Windows is an ``essential
facility'' _ an item that is required by all competitors in a given
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' Barksdale replied. ``They run the show. Our product
cannot operate without it. We need access to key technologies and
plans at the same time as Microsoft's in-house engineers.'' And
since Microsoft is the ``800-pound gorilla, you have to circle and
sniff and be a good guy to get this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Whisper ``essential facility'' in the ears of antitrust lawyers,
and their cogs turn differently from those of the techno-nerds who
cover the Microsoft trial.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys harken to a 1990 brief (written by Kenneth Starr)
that prompted the Supreme Court to rule (in a railroad case) that
``a lawful monopolist has a duty to deal with a rival on terms
(that allow) the rival a reasonable profit without regard to the
effect on competition of a refusal to deal on such terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Such arcana cuts no ice with Microsoft's minions. ``We lack
monopoly power, regardless of how the market is defined. Nor are
there high barriers to market entry,'' says spokesman Mark Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nowadays most computers come with Windows like most
trains come with tracks. And if it makes sense to rivet a browser
into the basic system, why not also (save for the antitrust laws)
bolt on a powerful word processor, spreadsheet, database and a
digital kitchen sink?
</P>
<P>
   These legal issues change if Windows becomes a regulated common
carrier that treats all comers equally. But what incentive would
Microsoft's Bill Gates then have to enhance a public utility?
</P>
<P>
   Gates might have more of an incentive if his empire were broken
up into several competing ``Baby Bills.'' But such a course would
repeal the ``virtuous circle'' that a universal standard offers.
The trouble is such a beneficial standard also creates a vicious
circle for the losers in a fixed software game.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: A program that rights current wrongs, without
spawning new wrongs, has yet to be written for Windows.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: U.N. tribunal too gentle on war criminals
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Nov. 22, 1998.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the many who believe the U.S. criminal justice system,
particularly the courts, has gone too soft, meet the United Nations
war crimes tribunal. Last week, a three-member court in The Hague,
Netherlands, found three men guilty of war crimes against Bosnian
Serb prisoners in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But did the punishment fit the crimes?
</P>
<P>
   Well, what do you get for being a prison camp commander who
allowed guards to murder nine Serbs and torture six?
</P>
<P>
   Seven years. That's it, seven years. No wonder Zdravko Mucic
smiled when his sentence was handed down. He's only 42, will be 49
he gets out; plenty of time for more negligent command.
</P>
<P>
   He could have gotten life imprisonment. In the U.S., he likely
would have gotten a ticket to a lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Mucic's deputy, 37-year-old Hazim Delic. He was
convicted of murdering two people, raping two women and torturing
other prisoners. The price for multiple murder, rape and torture,
according to the U.N. tribunal? Twenty years. Not life, but 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   The upside of it, I suppose, was that at last rape is being
treated as a war crime after millennia of it being seen as nothing
but a spoil of war.
</P>
<P>
   It was in sentencing Delic that presiding judge Adolphus
Karibi-Whyte of Nigeria said that rape was ``a despicable act which
strikes at the very core of human dignity.'' But it wasn't
despicable enough, along with a couple of outright murders and some
torture, to get Delic life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In the 483-page ruling, the three judges said Delic appeared
``to take a sadistic pleasure in causing the detainees pain.'' Just
20 years, though.
</P>
<P>
   Esad Landzo, a guard at the Celebici prison camp in central
Bosnia in 1992, was convicted of three murders and of torturing at
least three other inmates. The 24-year-old had been charged with
killing five, but convicted of only three. Prosecutors said Landzo
beat one prisoner to death with a wooden plank and that he and
Delic beat another man to death, then nailed a badge of the Muslim
political party into his head.
</P>
<P>
   For all this, young Landzo, described as a thug, got 15 years.
In the United States, that's a likely sentence for robbing a
7-Eleven with a handgun _ before they start taking off gain time.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier stories about their atrocities, written when the men
went on trial 20 months ago, said their prisoners were beaten with
steel cables, wood and metal bars, burned with heated scissors,
kept in vats of water. They also were forced, according to a wire
service story, to act like animals and perform oral sex on each
other. And the women were raped.
</P>
<P>
   The officer who had overall command of the camp, outranking
Mucic, was aquitted by the court of all charges, for which he told
the tribunal that it was ``a very wise judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the weakness of the U.N. sentencing _ capital punishment
not allowed, by the way _ makes the American system any better; it
just looks that way. We still are tethered to a system where plea
bargaining, prison overcrowding, gain time, sentencing guidelines,
parole boards and wimpy judges put too many thugs, murderers and
rapists back on the streets too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison with the U.N., however, we look tough.
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to comprehend one thing: I had been led to believe,
in what I read and saw, that the World War II war crimes trials set
the standard. Didn't a bunch of German and Japanese war criminals
get their necks stretched for what they did to humanity? Now, 50
years later, it's only 15 or 20 years?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: 'Unfinished Business' forum needs a champion
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. Many useful words and even some important
ones were spoken in the three days of the ``Unfinished Business''
forum in Birmingham, Ala., last weekend, as some 400 activists
agonized toward a new agenda for a New South. But I think I know
what was missing.
</P>
<P>
   There was no architecture of national caring to house the
undertaking, no validating political context as a frame of
reference. What was missing, in short, was the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   The conference echoed the brave Southern Conference for Human
Welfare in the same city 60 years earlier. Then, some 1,500
progressives convened to write and adopt a social wish list for a
region marred by the grossest racism, ignorance and what looked
like permanent economic depression.
</P>
<P>
   The 1938 meeting was brazenly biracial, and although the basic
racial and economic justice it called for is now acknowledged as an
essential precursor to the modern boom that has brought prosperity
to much of the old South, the agenda was widely denounced at the
time as radical and frightening. Even so, it had a certain implied
cache just by being issued under the protective cover of the
reformist New Deal, recently reinforced by President Franklin
Roosevelt's re-election by near-acclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Even to our own conservative times, there is little that is
comparably scary in the recent conference's calls for strengthened
public education (a disavowal of the voucher hustle to fund private
schools), universal health care, full employment, affordable and
safe housing and a justice system scrubbed of its racial
grotesqueries and economic inequities.
</P>
<P>
   But if not such a bugaboo as the original, there is something a
bit forlorn about the new agenda even so. It is easier to get
notice at least, and engagement if not concurrence, in a can-do
atmosphere than in today's stubborn stasis, compounded as it is of
smug satisfaction, indifference to such distortions as the
dangerously widening gap between rich and poor and a political
fatalism that bars any public intervention for the common good.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there aren't worthy and even heroic efforts under way
for something better.
</P>
<P>
   The Workforce Alliance has pulled public and private sectors
together in Mississippi County, Ark., to upgrade worker skills, cut
unemployment and increase incomes. Birmingham's Bethel-Ensley
Action Task, a partnership of churches and neighborhood groups, has
revived a seemingly moribund part of the city. In Greensboro, N.C.,
the Partnership Project managed to get at least a few crucially
placed whites to see that, although overt racial discrimination is
tamped down, its deadly assumptions and purposes remain imbedded in
our basic social fabric, producing such racial deformities as those
of the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   But however admirable in their own right, those and the many
more similar gestures struggling in near anonymity around the
country will remain patchy palliatives until we become willing to
look up from the busy perfecting of our pocketbooks and
additionally begin to work again on the well-being of the nation.
Not all of our unfinished business will take care of itself.

JAVA'S UNIVERSALITY IS THREAT TO MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Also see MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST, MICROSOFT-SUN, MICROSOFT-DEFENDERS) 
(editors: in references to Cplus-plus, replace plus-plus with the
symbols)  
 (bl)  
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why is Java such a big deal?
</P>
<P>
   Java, the programming language at issue in the contract dispute
between the Microsoft Corp. and Sun Microsystems, is fundamentally
different from other computer languages like C, Cplus-plus, Pascal
or Basic.
</P>
<P>
   Other programming languages are dependent on the underlying
operating system that controls the basic functions of the computer
running the programs. A program written in Cplus-plus for an Apple
Computer Macintosh will not work on a personal computer using the
Microsoft Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But Java _ invented by Sun Microsystems, which controls Java
licensing _ is intended to act as a lingua franca of computing.
Java enables software to be used over networks _ especially over
the Internet _ by many kinds of computers running sundry operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Java, a graphic artist with an Apple Macintosh
computer running the Mac operating system, an engineer on a Sun
Microsystems Sparc work station running a version of the Unix
operating system and a student with a Pentium-chip personal
computer running the Microsoft Windows operating system can all
play poker with one another other on the Yahoo World Wide Web site.
That's because the poker game is written in Java, which can operate
on those different computers at the same time, over the network.
</P>
<P>
   But this works-anywhere flexibility also means that from a
programmer's point of view Java makes all operating systems equal.
And that poses a serious threat to Microsoft, whose market
dominance is based on the fact that its Windows operating system is
the industry standard _ controlling the basic operations of some 90
percent of PCs sold.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary as Java may sound, though, programs written in
this language are not always impressive. For any given computer to
use a Java program, each line of code _ or each block of re-usable
code known as an ``object'' _ must be interpreted before it can be
understood by the operating system, which then must translate it
yet again for its instructions to be understood by the computer's
microprocessor chip.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Java's speed has improved a great deal in the last
18 months, all this translating means that running a Java program
can still be excruciatingly slow compared with running the same
program written in a language like C.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Java interpreter, known as the ``virtual machine,''
or VM software, is also the language's greatest strength. It allows
for the ``write once, run anywhere'' capability that enables
programmers to create a single piece of software that can be
understood by any major operating system. Thus, Java software can
not only cut development time for individual programs but can also
result in programs that have a much larger potential market than
programs written in other languages.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, once a user installs Java _ which happens
automatically when a Web browser is installed _ the Java virtual
machine resides permanently on the user's hard drive. From then on,
it stands ready to run a Java program whenever it is needed. This
is what is known in computer jargon as a ``platform'' _ that is,
foundation software on with other programs run.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage this holds for the Internet is that tiny bits of
Java code, known as applets, can be sent to and used by any kind of
computer that has a Java virtual machine. The small size of the
applets makes them usable even on computers with slow Internet
links like dial-up modems.
</P>
<P>
   All of this poses a threat to Microsoft because it marginalizes
the importance of Microsoft's platform, the Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   In the conventional computing world, in which programs run on
only one operating system, Microsoft's Windows tends to be a
self-perpetuating monopoly. If a user has invested several thousand
dollars in software that will run only on Windows, he is not likely
to switch to a Macintosh computer or to install, say, a Unix
operating system, because in addition to the cost of the new
machine, he will have to buy all new software.
</P>
<P>
   But if at some point in the future that same user could purchase
all Java software, he would have much more freedom to change
computers and operating systems. While that is not now possible, a
number of major software developers, including IBM, its Lotus
subsidiary and Corel Corp. have committed to major development of
Java software.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's lawsuit traces to Microsoft's obtaining a Java license
from the company in 1996 and then setting to work altering parts of
the virtual machine. To be sure, some changes made Java run more
efficiently on Windows machines, but other alterations stripped the
translator of certain capabilities _ functions that Sun contends
Microsoft wanted to keep the sole province of the Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun lawsuit asserts that these changes violated the 1996
licensing agreement. And many in the software industry are watching
this case with great apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft is allowed to distribute a nonstandard form of
Java, the resulting industry fragmentation would mean that
different Java code would have to be written for different
operating systems. That might remove a threat to Microsoft, but for
for the lingua franca of computing, the resultant babble of
variants would destroy the Java language's greatest strength.

NYC IS SAID TO USE MORE PESTICIDES THAN FARM COUNTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This city appears to use more pesticides to kill its
rats, roaches and other urban pests than the state's major
agricultural counties use to protect their apples, corn and
potatoes from bores and bugs, according to a report issued
Wednesday by two environmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   After examining data collected by the state, the New York Public
Interest Research Group and Environmental Advocates found that
Manhattan ranks first in the state in terms of the amount of liquid
pesticides used, and Brooklyn leads in terms of solid pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enormous amounts of pesticides are being used in New York
City,'' said Audrey Thier, pesticide director for Environmental
Advocates. ``More than 90 percent of the pesticides are neurotoxic
insecticides, which pose a particular risk for infants and young
children whose immature nervous systems are vulnerable to permanent
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions are based on an analysis of data collected by
the state in 1997 under a new reporting law enacted the year
before. The law requires applicators of pesticides _ including
insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides and fungicides _ to report
all their applications by ZIP code. Sellers of pesticides to
farmers had similar requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The industry trade group, the New York State Professional
Applicators Coalition, along with individual exterminators and the
state itself immediately took issue with the report, saying it was
fallacious to draw broad conclusions on one year's data.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who run the program say it's way too early to draw
these kind of conclusions,'' said Gary Sheffer, a spokesman for the
state Environmental Conservation Department, which conducts the
pesticide reporting program. ``The information will be a lot more
useful over the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   But the study's authors defended the report, and Ms. Thier of
Environmental Advocates said the analysis carried the state's raw
numbers a step further by breaking down pesticides to their active
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the report found that by far the most commonly
used active ingredient was chlorpyrifos, which is contained in
Dursban, the bug-killing product used the most in the city. It can
cause humans to suffer headaches, fatigue and depression. A 1997
report by the federal Environmental Protection Agency termed it
``one of the leading causes of acute insecticide poisoning in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups advised takinG a number of steps to better protect
the public from dangerous pesticides. These include banning the
most risky pesticides, developing new nontoxic alternatives and
imposing a new tax on pesticide sales to finance programs to reduce
pesticide use.
</P>
<P>
   Exterminators in the city countered that they were performing a
critical function and doing it with a carefulness unimaginable a
decade or two ago. Gil Bloom, the third-generation owner of
Standard Exterminating Co. in Queens, said his employees now just
use a gallon or two of herbicide to kill pests in 30 apartments,
perhaps a fifth what they would have used a decade ago. He also
uses boric acid as a pesticide base, one of the nontoxic
alternatives recommended by the environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Schroeder, executive director of the State Professional
Applicators Coalition, said the state's numbers might be
questionable because a number of exterminators in the city were
confused and gave the state the amount of diluted pesticide,
instead of the pure amount as requested. He said the state
reporting rules were issued at the last minute, which added to the
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not conceivable that Manhattan and Brooklyn could be
using more than the upstate area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder faulted the Public Interest Research Group, which put
out the report, for its eagerness to ``leap on'' state data that he
said must be regarded as preliminary at best.
</P>
<P>
   He said the damage caused by pests was a much greater problem
than the judicious use of pesticides, and cited his own
exterminating career. ``I've been in circumstances where I've
cried,'' he said. ``I've seen cockroaches in a crib.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Dr. Marion Moss, an opponent of pesticides who is director
of the Pesticide Education Center in San Francisco, had trouble
believing that city pesticide use dwarfed that in rural New York.
In a telephone interview, she said agricultural use might be
understated because the final user is not required to report its
use, something that the industry has battled as an intrusion on
privacy. She said that in the United States as a whole more than 70
percent of pesticide use was agricultural.
</P>
<P>
   But she agreed with the environmentalists' finding that
pesticides were an enormous problem in buildings in New York City,
where she lived in three apartments that were roach-infested. She
said she banished them with traps, nontoxic poisons and scrupulous
housecleaning. ``You don't have to use neurotoxic chemicals to kill
cockroaches,'' she said.

CLINTON FINDS LEWINSKY CASE FOLLOWS HIM TO TOKYO 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: New 7th graf with Clinton demeanor.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As the House began impeachment hearings in Washington
Thursday, President Clinton traveled more than 8,000 miles to Tokyo
only to be confronted by an indignant Japanese housewife who
questioned his apology to his wife and daughter for the Monica
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you apologize to Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea?'' the
mother of two asked in a nationally televised 43-minute
question-and-answer session with the president. ``I feel I would
never be able to forgive my husband for doing that, but did they
really forgive you, Mr. President?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had been jocular and animated during the opening
minutes of the broadcast, appeared startled by the question from a
woman in a television audience in Osaka that was linked via
television hookup to Clinton, who was sitting in the studios of the
Tokyo Broadcasting System here in the Japanese capital.
</P>
<P>
   The invited audience of 100 of Japan's future leaders seated
before him reacted with a collective sigh to the question, which
the unidentified housewife posed in Japanese and the president
heard through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had already fielded seven questions, replied in a
deliberate, patient tone with a strained smile crossed his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well I did it in a direct and straight forward manner,''
Clinton explained, speaking slowly. ``I believe they did, yes. But
that's really a question you could ask them better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   The president clinched his jaw after completing his response.
Appearing weary from the overnight flight to Tokyo, he spoke slowly
and was less effusive than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Chelsea accompanied the president to
Tokyo. Mrs. Clinton is touring hurricane-damaged nations in Central
America; Chelsea is a sophomore at Stanford University, in Palo
Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   TV personality Tetsuya Chikushi, host for Clinton's town-meeting
session, quickly injected, ``Let's change the subject now.''
</P>
<P>
   Chikushi shifted the subject to U.S.-Japan relations, observing:
``Now our bilateral relationship is the most important of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Chikushi is Japan's version of former talk show host Phil
Donahue. He and the president sat before the live audience on two
bar stools with a large video screen before them that linked the
studio to Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delighted his audience with a series of personal
insights.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question,, Clinton boasted about his close
relationship with his daughter, who he had helped with her homework
``until it became too difficult for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered public speaking advice to another questioner, telling
her to pretend ``that you're speaking to a few of your friends''
rather than addressing a large audience via television. ``You don't
have to change; you just have to be yourself,'' Clinton counseled.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told of his efforts during a busy presidency to achieve
``a balanced life'' with work, family time, church and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do the things that remind me that I'm a normal person and I
need a balanced life,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name the favorite ``dishes that your wife cooks,''
Clinton said that he is known in America for liking a variety of
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people make fun of me because of that,'' said
Clinton. ``But I suppose my favorite dish is a Mexican dish _
chicken enchiladas,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he and the first lady usually have dinner
together at the White House three or four times a week. ``My wife
and I have dinner together every night when we're both home,''
Clinton explained. ``That is unless she has to go out to an
engagement or I do.''

 &HT;    REVIEW: Allen's `Celebrity' both bearable, funny
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Celebrity.'' 3 stars. Starring: Kenneth
Branagh, Judy Davis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Winona Ryder, Charlize
Theron, Melanie Griffith. Director: Woody Allen. Screenwriter:
Woody Allen MPAA rating: R for language, sex, some drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The films of Woody Allen in the 1990s have been ragged, hasty
affairs, premised on watery conceits and executed with an alarming
disregard for the medium's capacity for beauty and order. Worse,
they haven't been very funny.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decade, Allen's film-a-year output has spanned the
trifling and haphazard (``Bullets Over Broadway,'' ``Manhattan
Murder Mystery'') to the luridly unbecoming (``Deconstructing
Harry''). In only one instance, ``Husbands and Wives,'' did humor
and thematic heft intersect rewardingly. And that movie, the camera
quivering like Jell-O on horseback, required Dramamine to endure.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sad testament to the artist, but Allen has been at his
best alluding to his most popular phase of filmmaking, that
feverish interlude which began with ``Annie Hall'' (1977) and
petered-out with ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986). Woodyphiles
could have a field day cataloging the recycled jokes littering the
later films.
</P>
<P>
   His new comedy ``Celebrity'' is chock full of knowing allusions
to Allen's unofficial golden age, which helps to make ``Celebrity''
two things most of his recent work has not been: 1) bearable, and
2) pretty funny.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Celebrity,'' a whooshing, heavily populated movie that
takes a weed-whacker to the fields of fame, also shares qualities
of the sloppy late works. It's unfocused, ungainly, swollen with
distracting cameos by a Hollywood Who's Who, and requires the lead,
in this case Kenneth Branagh, to fussily mimic the famous Allen
persona. (Remember when even Mia Farrow was doing the stammering,
gesticulating nebbish routine? That was icky.) Allen's new vulgar
streak _ the X-rated invective, the juvenile fixation on oral sex _
is also disturbingly present.
</P>
<P>
   Branagh, hiding his British accent, plays Lee Simon, a celebrity
journalist in _ where else? _ Manhattan. More sycophant than
scribe, Simon gloms onto the glitterati like a pilot fish to a
shark, feeding off the vestigial glow under the pretext of chasing
stories.
</P>
<P>
   In a careworn Allen plot point, Simon has dumped his wife (a
harried, shrewish Judy Davis, repeating her roles in ``Husbands and
Wives'' and ``Harry'') and is panting after celebrity women often
half his age (Winona Ryder as a fledgling actress, Melanie Griffith
as a starlet, and Charlize Theron as a supermodel).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Simon's life is a sham. He's spent it hydroplaning
the surface and pinballing to anyone he believes can advance his
hollow course. He's a tragic figure, chasing the impossible as a
way to distract himself from the hard work of charting a meaningful
existence. This is beaten terrain for Allen (he played essentially
the same unenlightened sap in ``Manhattan''), but there's a
satisfying kick in walking it again.
</P>
<P>
   As far as its titular promise, ``Celebrity'' is not strenuous
satire. Staged like an Altmanesque cavalcade, the story lopes
through the starry milieus of film, acting (see Leonardo DiCaprio
snort coke and smash furniture!), fashion, art, television, books
and sports, with mocking pit stops at Christianity (celebrity
priests and Jesus action figures) and the weird world of famous
criminals and their victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can learn a lot about a society by who it chooses to
celebrate,'' says a character. I'm not sure what we can learn that
we don't already know, and in ``Celebrity'' it's never clear what
Allen wants to teach. Clearly, he revels in hating the sick,
symbiotic fame game, a distaste he so bitterly displayed in the
recent documentary ``Wild Man Blues'' and the 1980 hate-letter to
his fans, ``Stardust Memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen mocks the swank milieus with gimlet-eyed observation
rather than harsh commentary, yet it still feels nasty. He
satisfies his editorial druthers by staging the scenes with a sheen
of hyperbole, giving the characters enough rope to hang themselves.
</P>
<P>
   What to say about Branagh's tic-specific, Woody wannabe act?
Branagh (a man, it should be noted, with no lips) blows through the
film's teeming vignettes like a dried leaf. He has ``Woody Allen''
nailed: His shoulders cave-in as his arms do their stubby
gesticulations. He whines in that piercing singsong, and the
chronic stammers grind his lines to elliptical sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   (Why Allen encourages this bald aping is beyond me. It's more
than a little embarrassing and is further confirmation of Allen's
vaunted narcissism.)
</P>
<P>
   If the material is untidy, ``Celebrity'' looks fabulous. Allen
has recovered control of mise-en-sce(accent)ne, not to mention
directorial command of his actors. Filmed in his famed superlong
takes, scenes possess an artful order: the depicted chaos flows,
doesn't pile-up. The film was shot in silken black-and-white by
famed cinematographer Sven Nykvist.
</P>
<P>
   Like the bulk of his recent films, there's something palpably
off in ``Celebrity.'' Allen is increasingly becoming film's sour
old man, and although the throwback humor is mildly satisfying, the
movie is never as funny as you'd like it to be. It kind of hangs
there, another oddity in the Allen oeuvre.

 &HT;    Fighting off the fungus, bugs and other evils
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The grass is always greener...
</P>
<P>
   I'm nearly six months into my role as sole Lawn Boy out here in
the semi-country. My massive spread of San Augustine sod survived
the Summer from Hell; as a result I can take sole credit for the
city's budget surplus, due to the ridiculous amount of water it
took to keep 60 pallets of grass alive during the Time it Never
Rained. I had water bills that rivaled car payments for a while.
</P>
<P>
   All that is past, a distant memory now that cool weather has
finally arrived. It's interesting how quickly we forget unpleasant
things, like 35 straight days of 100-plus degree temperatures. I
read somewhere that's why women are often willing to go through
childbirth more than once, because nature blots out the memory of
the pain they went through the first time. I don't know about that,
being of a different gender and averse to all forms
</P>
<P>
   of pain. I'm just proud not to be sweating seconds after walking
out the front door.
</P>
<P>
   But all is not coming up roses here. A yard of San Augustine
grass is like having a sickly child. It's always something. Chinch
bugs. Armyworms. Brown-patch fungus. Fireants. Gophers. Armadillos.
Weird weeds, whose name I don't care to know. My precious grass,
and I mean that in all senses of the adjective, has been under
constant attack from the dark side of Mother Nature since Day One.
</P>
<P>
   I have fertilized, fungicided, weeded, whacked, sprayed and
flayed this lawn. It is an obsession with me. And like most
obsessions, something is always going haywire.
</P>
<P>
   A landscaping fetish is in general a male thing. Women, and I'm
</P>
<P>
   stereotyping here, generally look at the lawn after their spouse
or
</P>
<P>
   significant other has sweated and labored for hours, and say,
``That's nice, dear,'' then head back into the air-conditioning. I
figure they're getting even for childbirth. Men consider their
lawn-taming accomplishments a temporary triumph of the will against
the way of the jungle _ no small feat, a big deal that is
unappreciated by other household members.
</P>
<P>
   This y-chromosome thing is also what's at play in vehicles with
trip meters. Men generally reset the trip meter after filling up or
when about to go on a trip. We do this to keep track of vital
information, such as gas mileage, how far 'til we get there, and to
make sure the gauge hasn't gone haywire. I know I can get about 300
miles to a tank, so it's a backup for the gauge. I always reset the
trip meter after filling up.
</P>
<P>
   Women in general regard the trip meter as a useless device,
right up there with the emergency brake. They don't give a whit
about gas mileage, figure they'll get there when they get there,
and plan on suing someone if the gas gauge doesn't work as
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm getting off track. Back to the grass. The brown-patch
fungus began wreaking havoc on the lawn once the weather cooled.
Once I figured it out, not being real observant, huge chunks of
grass had turned yellow, wide circles of sick sod. I have put out
several sacks of fungicide at $23 a bag to stop the damage, and the
grass likely won't die. But it looks tacky, a sad result after all
those months of anal-retentive care.
</P>
<P>
   So, against my better judgment, I bought a 50-pound sack of rye
grass and over seeded the lawn last week, to hide the yellow grass.
I did this once before, out in the country, but I used regular
pasture rye grass, which grows at an alarming rate. That grass
would grow before your eyes. You could mow in the morning and have
to hop back on the mower by sundown. Since I planted about two
acres of the stuff, it became a burden in a hurry. Before it was
over, I ended up buying three cows and letting them loose on the
lawn. This is true.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, I'm using regular golf-course/lawn seed, which
grows much slower, I'm told. Despite slow growth, I will be mowing
throughout the winter, through sleet and rain, harsh winds and all.
I figure Christmas Day will consist of opening presents and mowing
the lawn. Ditto with New Year's. Maybe even Valentine's Day, too.
</P>
<P>
   By then, I may be hunting a few cows, which I'm told are cheap
right now. I'll have to check the homeowners' association rules to
see if livestock is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   At least I'm not having to water anymore. The city is on its own
again, financially speaking.

THE OTHER `OTHER CUOMO' SAYS NO TO POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christopher Cuomo has just declared that he is having
a ``bad camera day.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not something that somebody who has landed a job in
television ever wants to have. Luckily for Cuomo, the camera he has
been facing is only taking stills for Fox News to use in
advertisements promoting the magazine show he is working for. No
video this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no box of chocolates,'' he says, apparently referring to
his looks. Here he differs from such recognized authorities as
People magazine, which named him one of the 10 sexiest men of 1997.
Earlier, People had anointed him one of the world's 50 most
beautiful people and W magazine had called him New York's most
eligible bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   It is a year later, and women are still mentioning his name in
the same sentence with words like ``cute'' and ``hunk'' and
``unmarried'' and ``John F. Kennedy Jr.'' But now the Fox
photographer has pulled his collar out over his jacket. ``Who does
he think I am, John Travolta?'' Cuomo asks.
</P>
<P>
   It is always some kind of who-is-he question.
</P>
<P>
   The family-tree answer (son of Mario, brother of Andrew,
brother-in-law of a Kennedy) is one that he does not come close to
giving. And he sounds uncomfortable with being a celebrity. That
raises the how-could-you-not question, as in how could you not be
somebody important?
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, 28, has struggled with expectations all his life. ``I get
lumped into `pretty boy,''' he says during a lunchtime
conversation. ``A, I don't think the esthetics bear it out, and B,
there is a roughness to me that doesn't make me that lovable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovable, in his lexicon, seems to apply to his Rottweiler,
Cosmo. ``He's so larger than life we refer to him in the third
person, the Cos,'' he says. `` `Does the Cos want to sit?' And Cos
either sits or bites your leg off. The only dog I ever met that you
don't command, you speak in dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   But back to the who-is-he question. ``I am what I do. I am not
an interesting person. I don't have interests or hobbies. I talk
about what I do. I bother people in subways. It's what makes me
happy. Get people to hit on that 2030 Web site or watch `Fox
Files.' As soon as it's about me, that's not what makes me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2030 web site (www.2030.org) is run by a nonprofit ``action
tank'' on whose board he sits. Its goal, he says, is to try to
interest people between 20 and 30 in public affairs and,
specifically, the idea that Social Security might run out before
they are between, say, 60 and 70. ``Fox Files'' is the magazine
show whose photographer has rearranged his shirt collar. After
running for several weeks in the summer, it is scheduled to
reappear next month, on Thursdays at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Because of who he is, Cuomo, reporter, has to take questions. So
why did his father not run for president in 1992? ``I will tell
you, `Ask him,''' he says. ``No one speaks for my father.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one speaks for the son, either, and the next statement is
from somewhere off the political radar screen. ``I think he should
run now,'' he says. ``I think it's his best shot if he wanted to
run. He doesn't want to run. Andrew's the new lion in the pride.''
</P>
<P>
   He talks about why the old lion should venture out of the den,
then does the smoothest of gear changes and becomes an Andrew
loyalist. His brother has been fueling speculation that he will run
for the Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take on my brother is he is without exception the most
promising politically inclined person in the country,'' he says,
``and people don't even know him. He's like an elixir. He's what
you need in here. He took that HUD job. Who wants that?''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly does not. ``I do not see myself in elected
office,'' he says. ``I see myself at my brother's side when he
fights the fight.'' He is not saying what his brother will do.
``He's only 40 years old, he doesn't have to jump at anything. He's
got to answer the questions, is that what he wants for his life?
For his family?''
</P>
<P>
   Back to Chris Cuomo, the Cuomo who calls himself a ``populist''
and has problems with the Democratic Party. ``This party isn't my
party,'' he says. ``They're not for me. The Democratic Party has
fallen prey to professional politicians. Nobody has held any jobs
except lawyer or banker in the world they come out of.''
</P>
<P>
   The world he came out of was different, he says, and it changed
the year he turned 13 and his father was inaugurated as governor.
``It was an unnatural transition,'' he says. ``I went from being a
normal kid in a middle-class neighborhood in Queens to being the
governor's son. From `Eight Is Enough' married with `All in the
Family,' to `Benson,''' a program about a governor and the people
around him. He was sent to Albany Academy, then an all-boys
military school. ``In retrospect, it would have been better if I
had gone to the bigger public high school. I was more used to kids
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he was off to Yale University and Fordham Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a couple of years at a big-name Manhattan law firm
and a couple of years with a smaller investment-management group,
he hungers for something grittier than Barbara Walters-style
interviews. Yes, on that most unreal of mediums, television, he
wants to be real. And yes, he has a reason that only a Cuomo could
give.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get tagged as a phony, I disgrace my entire family,'' he
says, ``and I'm not ready to do that.''

 &HT;    MAMA crusade urges clear-eyed look at crutches, cures
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ She's an anti-drug abuse crusader who also
crusades for legal medical use of marijuana. She's an anti-drug
abuse crusader who calls for a re-examination of the nation's
get-tough drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   Every day of Sandee Burbank's life is a campaign against drug
abuse. But every day she also lashes out at the way society tries
to deal with drugs, the legal kind and the illegal kind.
</P>
<P>
   Just say no? Don't be ridiculous, says Sandee Burbank. For as
``no, no'' is on most parents' lips, ``yes, yes'' is in their eyes
in how they deal with drugs in general, particularly alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   She says common-sense stewardship by parents is the key to
common sense about drugs by young people. Until parents fully
understand the drug culture they inhabit, replete with Madison
Avenue huckstering, they will have trouble getting ahead of the
curve on influences that make people slaves of their urges.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank in 1982 founded Mothers Against Misuse and Abuse _ MAMA.
It is one of the few anti-drug abuse organizations willing put all
drugs, legal and illegal, into one kettle for inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The nation is outraged by the deaths of 10,000 Americans a year
from illegal drugs. MAMA asks for comparable alarm over the 400,000
killed each year by tobacco, 135,000 by alcohol (drunk driving not
included), and, estimated by a recent study from the University of
Toronto, 102,000 killed by the side effects of prescription
medicine _ appropriately administered, legally approved.
</P>
<P>
   Know your prescription
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of prescription drugs, the MAMA mantra is ``ask
your pharmacist.'' Understand what's in your prescription. Put the
brand name out of your mind and know the drug. Know the side
effects. Know about correct dosage. Know how drugs interact. Ask.
And be skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank said that like most consumers, physicians can fall prey
to marketing ploys for hot new products. Patients can end up in
valleys of pharmaceutical trial and error.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency is to want the instant fix, the push-button cure,
which isn't always there. That attitude can translate into the
habits of young people who seek instant escape, push-button
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   MAMA's appeal is clear-eyed and hysteria-free. Drug abuse is
drug abuse. Americans young and old are captives of merchandizing,
social symbols and the age-old repulsion of the young by authority
draped around hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   TV-sanctioned abuse
</P>
<P>
   Though marijuana commonly is touted as a ``gateway drug'' to
harder stuff, MAMA directs attention to deadly abuse advertised by
social habits and TV. Gateway drug? Miller Lite.
</P>
<P>
   MAMA advocates that all drugs be judged by the same
pharmaceutical standards, which by nature would force a
re-examination of laws that put hundreds of thousands behind bars
for marijuana posession. Using data from the National Institute for
Drug Abuse and the University of San Francisco, MAMA offers a chart
of ``hazard potential'' for common legal and illegal drugs. It
rates alcohol as the most intoxicating, with the most severe
withdrawal. It ranks nicotine first in the area of dependency.
Heroin ranks high in every area. Marijuana barely ranks in any
category.
</P>
<P>
   MAMA isn't promoting the weed, though. To every audience of
young people, Burbank warns that based on the penalties, marijuana
possession can rob a teen of his or her childhood. Or an adult can
lose his or her livelihood based on a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   To get children past dangerous straits takes a combination of
sharing and the setting of limits, said Burbank. Some parents ``are
trying to be their kids' best friends instead of their parents,''
she said.
</P>
<P>

Ore., 97040. On the Internet, find it at http://www.mamas.org.

 &HT;    Jet-setting Levi finds a refuge in Mahler
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yoel Levi sounds like a conductor in a candy store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, I'm excited to come back,'' says the maestro,
calling between rehearsals for this weekend's Atlanta Symphony
Orchestra concerts, his first since Oct. 3. Not only is he
conducting Mahler's Symphony No. 7 _ and recording it for Telarc _
but at Saturday night's glitzy ASO ball, he'll lead the orchestra
in a selection of Broadway show tunes.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, folks. It's Mendelssohn and Mahler one night,
``Girl Crazy'' and ``My Fair Lady'' the next.
</P>
<P>
   But before we go there, Levi wants to tell us about that darned
staircase in Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, where he recently led the
Netherlands Radio Philharmonic in works by Delius, Arensky, Liszt
and Ives. The acoustics are legendary, Levi says, but those steps
are the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come through the audience going down, and everyone watches
you. It's a big tradition there _ how do you negotiate the stairs?
You can imagine negotiating those stairs every time you finish a
piece. ... I should have worn a cape, since I was born in
Transylvania _ like Dracula.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh ... was it Halloween?
</P>
<P>
   ``When was Halloween?'' he asks blankly, sounding as if a few
cobwebs might've crept in among the music. Momentarily confused by
his jet-setting calendar, he soon remembers that he was in fact in
the Dutch city Oct. 31. And before returning to Atlanta, he stopped
in Stockholm, Sweden, for a festival honoring 77-year-old composer
Ingvar Lidholm.
</P>
<P>
   The music was difficult, but Lidholm ``was absolutely blown off
his feet when he realized I conducted everything from memory,''
says Levi, 48. ``He was totally shocked. He was so sweet and
grateful. He came and hugged me and kissed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Levi's elated to be home, conducting his hands-down favorite
composer, Mahler. After recording Mahler's fourth, fifth and sixth
symphonies for Telarc, the ASO is adding No. 7 to its shelf in
recording sessions Sunday and Monday. Compared to Mahler's bleaker
fin de siecle works, No. 7 contains passages of sheer ecstasy and
even has solos for guitar and mandolin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no composer who was able to express and portray all
the different aspects of life the way Mahler did, the hopes and
dreams and struggles,'' says Levi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cynical part of life and the bad part of life and the
question of death are always there.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does he feel when it's all over?
</P>
<P>
   ``It really takes many hours until you wind down. The music
keeps ringing and playing in your brain, and it takes forever to
fall asleep. You cannot detach yourself from what happened a few
minutes ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Should be an ennobling moment _ for the conductor and the
symphony.

 &HT;    `Beedies' seen as safe smokes but risks loom
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They're shaped like marijuana joints, but they're
perfectly legal.
</P>
<P>
   They're flavored with mint, vanilla and cinnamon. But when lit,
they smell like burning garbage.
</P>
<P>
   And while anti-smoking forces wage their uphill battle against
tobacco _ symbolized by today's annual Great American Smokeout, an
invitation for smokers to quit _ the demand for these obscure
little cigarettes, called ``beedies,'' has been booming.
</P>
<P>
   Like clove cigarettes, which touched off a craze in the 1950s,
beedies are becoming the countercultural smoke of choice among
young people who mistakenly think they're healthier than the
standard cigarettes their parents have been trying to kick for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Densua Williams, 17, has been smoking beedies for two years.
Waiting for a bus with friends recently at Five Points, Williams
pulled out a cone-shaped pack, fired up a beedie, cocked her head
and blew a neat column of smoke into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know anybody who smokes cigarettes. They give me
a headache,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't smoke a lot, but I enjoy the taste of beedies. They
calm my nerves and give me a little buzz. They're easier to get
than cigarettes and they help relieve my stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Beedies, also spelled ``bidis,'' are not new. Considered the
poor man's cigarette in India, where they are made and sold for
pennies a pack, beedies have been available in the United States
for decades. But they've suddenly become the latest smoking
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   About half the size of a typical cigarette, beedies are usually
unfiltered. Tapered at one end, they're packed with finely flaked
tobacco, hand-rolled in dark-brown ebony leaves and tied with a
short length of thread.
</P>
<P>
   Beedies cost about $2 to $3 for a pack of 20 and are available
at Atlanta convenience stores and tobacco shops where specialty
cigarettes, pipes and cigars are sold. Several metro tobacconists
said beedies have a relatively small, but loyal following,
especially among teenagers and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell about 40 packs of beedies a week. They do pretty good
for us,'' said Marc Rabinowitz at the Tobacco Loft in Buckhead,
which also sells other specialty cigarettes with names such as
``Buzz'' and ``Black Death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of our customers are mostly college kids who like
the shock effect of people asking them, `What the heck are you
smoking?'''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the major brands, packs of beedies sold in the United
States must carry the standard surgeon general's health warnings
and are regulated for tax purposes by the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and state revenue agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Kretek International in California is one of the largest makers
and distributors of beedies in the United States, selling about 1
million cartons a year, including about 10,000 in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Company director Shawn Ulizio says beedies have a trendy cachet
among younger people who haven't been swept up in the better-known
cigar craze.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't advertise them at all, and we don't have any
billboards, but beedies have their own little following and demand
for them is increasing,'' Ulizio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not for people who smoke two or three packs a day. I
think they're for nightclub smokers. They're a very social
cigarette that people consider a conversation piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Ulizio also speculated that many of his customers are looking
for a ``healthier'' smoke and are puffing beedies under the false
impression that they are somehow less harmful than American brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beedies contain about one-tenth the tobacco as a regular
cigarette, so it's a shorter smoke,'' Ulizio said. ``Some people
say it's all-natural because in India they don't process ... the
tobacco like they do here, and it's all handmade. But there's no
such thing as a healthy cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, in the case of beedies, less is more.
</P>
<P>
   Suresh Ralapati, an ATF biochemist in Washington, tested several
brands of beedies in 1994. He found that the tobacco in beedies
contains up to four times more nicotine than American-made
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Ralapati suggests that's probably why many beedie smokers report
a noticeable buzz, even though the cigarettes contain no
hallucinogenic ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's smaller, but the tobacco is a different species that has
a higher level of nicotine,'' Ralapati said. ``When you're smoking
such a strong product, it hits you harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The beedie mini-boom comes as smoking rates have been rising
after years of promising declines. From 1991 to '97, the percentage
of high school students who smoked jumped from 27.5 percent to 36.4
percent. And from 1993 to '97, the smoking rate among college
students increased from 22 percent to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is trend that puzzles anti-smoking advocates.

   ``The more I work with teen-agers, the less I know about them,''
said Linda Lee, chair of the tobacco prevention project for the
American Cancer Society of Georgia. ``Any new little trend in
smoking, teenagers pick up on it. They don't want to smoke the same
things that Mom and Dad did, but they're doing the same stupid
things, and because they're young, they think nothing is going to
hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   Damien Moulden had heard about the dangers of smoking, but that
didn't stop him from lighting up his first beedie four months ago.
After buying a pack recently at the Tinderbox in Lenox Square, the
clean-cut Morehouse University student said he just likes the taste
and has no plans to quit anytime soon. ``I don't pay attention to
ads. I already know that smoking cigarettes is bad for you,'' said
Moulden, 18. ``Beedies have a better taste than cigarettes, and I
don't think they're as bad for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they are, I'm definitely going to stop when I get
older.''

   GSD&AMP;M Is Chosen By Mirage Resorts
</P>
<P>
   Mirage Resorts Inc. in Las Vegas, Nev., said Wednesday that it
had named GSD&AMP; M in Austin, Tex., to handle the creative portion of
its account, with billings estimated at $30 million. The account
had been handled for a decade by Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney in San
Francisco, part of Publicis S.A., until Riney and Mirage mutually
parted ways last month.
</P>
<P>
   John Schadler, vice president for advertising at Mirage Resorts,
said that GSD&AMP; M, a unit of Omnicom Group, was awarded the
assignment after a monthlong informal review that also included
Richards Group in Dallas and TBWA/Chiat/Day in Playa del Rey,
Calif., another Omnicom unit. The Los Angeles office of Western
International Media, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies,
continues to handle media services for Mirage Resorts, which
operates properties that include the new Bellagio hotel, the Golden
Nugget, the Mirage and Treasure Island.

was founded by Delphi Studios and Progressive Internet
Alternatives. In July, Louis Madigan, chief executive at New York
Studios, and Cary Hart, its president, signed a contract for a
70-year lease for the project with the Brooklyn Navy Yard

 &HT;    Juggernaut of `Star Wars' prequel merchandising headed this way
 &HT;    By Hank Stuever
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Six months from the release of the next ``Star
Wars'' movie (yea) and the galactic bees are busy . . . very busy.
Fans can expect a two-minute trailer of the film _ currently titled
``Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'' _ in theaters Friday. Which movie
will have the trailer attached to it? More like which movie won't:
Lucasfilm Ltd. and Twentieth Century Fox have cleverly scattered
the sneak peek across several releases and several thousand
megaplex screens to avoid a rabid fan rush to just one film.
</P>
<P>
   Prequel toys are already popping up in stores _ just what is a
``Battle Droid with STAP,'' anyway? Apparently, it's some kind of
bad-guy robot on an upright, flying motorcycle. He was in your
local Target and Toys `R' Us stores for about a parsec before fans
snatched them all up. Local showbiz gossip king Harry Knowles wrote
a lovely, ecstatic description of walking into the Highland Mall
Kaybee Toys and _ by luck _ finding his very own Battle Droid with
STAP. Knowles immediately sat down on a mall bench to play with it
and make laser cannon noises with his mouth. Remember, this is a
26-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, that dull roar you hear in the background is the
approaching tidal wave of ``Star Wars'' junk that's coming our way.
Take a new character named Jar Jar Binks, for example: He's an
outcast swamp thing with a sort of Rastafarian accent who befriends
the Jedi heroes in ``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   The prequel geeks at TheForce.Net, based in Houston, got curious
and ran a trademark check of any merchandise that Lucasfilm has
connected to ``Jar Jar Binks,'' and look what they found on the
U.S. government trademark database. (Take a deep breath, start
humming the theme song, and ask yourself, who is going to need a
Jar Jar sports bra? Or a Jar Jar ``prepared fried flour
confection''? Well, after May 21, everybody.)

 &HT;    REVIEW: Noisy `Enemy' bleeps, twitches through thin plot
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Enemy of the State.'' 1 star. Starring: Will
Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight. Director: Tony Scott.
Screenwriter: David Marconi. MPAA rating: R for violence, language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' bleeps and chirps, tweeps and twitches in
a cacophony of high-tech hubbub. It's filled with scenes of techie
dweebs wearing headsets, their gripped faces bathed in the sallow
glow of computer monitors. They talk in clipped, military phrases
as their fingers perform furious tap-dances on the plastic keys,
sounding like so much popcorn popping.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is noisy, noisome and numbing.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by baron of bombast Tony Scott (``Top Gun,'' ``The
Fan''), ``Enemy of the State'' is a puny bore made to look large
under the magnifying glass of high production values, an
over-two-hour running time and dense pileups of techie
gobbledygook. The only thing that's large, however, is the movie's
soaring tedium.
</P>
<P>
   The story, about an innocent everyman blackmailed by a powerful
baddy, is as thin as pantyhose. It probes the scary proposition of
government surveillance technology pervading our lives, down to
tracing our every move behind closed doors. It presents themes that
were cool in, oh, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, screenwriter David Marconi and uber-action producer Jerry
Bruckheimer get all fussy on us, though, and turn the smooth,
groomed concept into a tousled, impenetrable rat's nest of kinetic
. . . stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Things happen fast and blurry, and jargon is tossed like
confetti. Star Will Smith runs a lot. All the while, the soundtrack
swoops with faux patriotic anthems, played presumedly on an antique
Casio keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Arthritic cliche(accent)s abound. Computer lettering flickers
across the screen to announce establishing shots, including neat-o
military time. (``Reynolds' Residence 2236 Hours.'') For the
climax, Scott steals the bullet-showered climax from his own ``True
Romance.'' Shameless.
</P>
<P>
   The finest moment in ``Enemy of the State'' comes when Smith
catches on fire. But he's put out with disappointing haste and our
delight with it.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Gene Hackman is in the movie, too. The cinematography is
kinda pretty.

WHEN YOUR CHILD STEALS FOR ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Dr. Joy Browne, a licensed psychologist, has joined the New
York Times Syndicate to give your readers the warm, friendly _ and
professional _ advice that she supplies to 9 million listeners in
the United States and Canada through the WOR Radio Network. Her
weekly Q&AMP;A column, ``Dr.Joy,'' will answer readers' questions about
personal relationships that are key in having happy and productive
lives.) 
 By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 10-year-old son is bringing home all sorts of
goodies from school. I don't think they're his, but I don't want to
accuse him of stealing. How common is stealing with kids, and if I
ignore it, are banks next? _ Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: It's not unusual for kids to steal, but it's not
something you want to encourage as a way to garner attention. Don't
condone or ignore his stealing, but shift the emphasis from
negative to positive. Make sure he is not stealing to get
attention. You don't need your kid to be the first jailbird in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   If your son is stealing, ask yourself why he is doing this. Who
sees his booty? If no one, he probably wants it for its own sake.
If he shows his friends, he wants their approval. If he shows you,
he's most likely asking for help. He's figured out how to get your
attention, and unfortunately punishing him will only emphasize the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Does he have an older sibling who gets a lot of attention for
sports or grades? Or a new baby in the house? Then he needs
reinforcement from you, including gold stars on the forehead, pats
on the back for positive behavior and help in making purchases.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to accuse him of stealing. Just explain you're
uncomfortable with his trading efforts and to cut it out before
other parents object. Suggest he takes no goodies to school and
brings no goodies home. If he doesn't already have an allowance or
job to pay for his own ``must-haves,'' institute a series of chores
to earn money that you will match.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I've been going with a woman 20 years my junior for a
little over a year. She's been divorced for a little under a year.
While she was married, she had numerous affairs. When I asked her
about them, she gave me sketchy details. Later I found out she'd
lied about the number and length of affairs. I want to leave her,
but I'm supporting her and her two children, ages 5 and 9, since
she doesn't work and doesn't receive sufficient alimony. What
should I do? _ Toronto
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Heavens! So many red flares shot up as I read your
letter my office is on fire. Despite your noble intentions, you've
stumbled into nearly every relationship pitfall there is.
</P>
<P>
   What she did before is none of your business. What matter is
what's going on between the two of you today. Stop supporting this
woman, so both of you can evaluate your feelings for each other.
She needs to grow up, get a job and realize that a romance is not a
rescue. Stop being ``Wally the Wallet'' and take a breather from
this troubled relationship for six months.
</P>
<P>
   After that your head should be clear enough to see who this
woman is as a person _ not a project. If at that time, you still
want to pursue a relationship, proceed with caution. You never know
when a booby trap might spring up and bop you on the shins again.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm a guy trying to save money to buy a car, so I'm
living at home while I attend college. But my parents wait up for
me every night and want to know everything that goes on in my life.
Aren't I entitled to any privacy? _ Milwaukee
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Of course, but you may have to get it the old-fashioned
way _ earn it by moving out. Everything in this life has a price
tag. You're finding the price tag for free room and board is
expensive in terms of personal privacy and independence.
</P>
<P>
   Live under your parents' roof and I guarantee you're going to be
treated like a child whether you're 14 or 114. If you're unwilling
to change your living arrangements, compromise. Volunteer
information if they promise not to ask. Tell them you'll be home by
a certain time and say goodnight when you get in. Your parents are
always going to be interested in your life even after you move out.
It doesn't mean they're nosy, just that they're your parents and
they love you.
</P>
<P>
   Your best long-term solution is to earn more independence, which
may mean finding less luxurious housing with a friend, foregoing
the car temporarily, getting a job or finding campus housing in
exchange for some work. Not only will your parents drive you less

   QUESTION: I am a 57-year-old bachelor, and have a demanding job
that I enjoy although it leaves me too exhausted to do anything at
night. My company is offering an early retirement package. I'm
thinking of accepting it, but I worry about not having enough to do
with my time and becoming bored and morose. _ Detroit
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Look, if you've been in that job all those years, you
know how to do it. Your exhaustion at the end of the day is most
likely psychological, not physiological.
</P>
<P>
   What I want you to do before making a decision is get yourself a
life. Join a club, work on a political campaign, take dancing
lessons. Get out of the house and see if you can make a life WITH
your job.
</P>
<P>
   My concern is that you have been completely defined by your
work. Take the work away and you may have nothing left. But if you
can define a life for yourself, you'll have the best of all worlds.
You'll likely find your work isn't as time-consuming as you
thought. And if your life outside of work feels just too fabulous,
you can opt for early retirement. Just don't retire from life by
hiding behind work.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My mother died when I was 16, and my father moved out
shortly later. Now 10 years later he lives in South America with a
new wife and three stepdaughters. He never calls, writes or tries
to help me or my sister here in the States. Should I write him out
of my life or call and tell him off? I'm too angry to forgive and
forget, but holding onto this anger is not good. My sister wants
nothing to do with him. What should I do? _ Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: I would have never guessed that what you're talking
about happened 10 years ago. Clearly you are keeping this anger
alive. Admittedly it is hard to lose your mom. I'm sure you feel
you lost your dad at the same time, but you didn't. Your father
went on with his life, which is a perfectly legitimate thing to do.
My guess is that your behavior was not above reproach, so there may
need to be a little forgiving on both sides. I'd absolutely get in
touch with him. Not for his sake, but for yours.
</P>
<P>
   Beware, however: If you're getting in touch to say, ``Please
send money,'' he's not going to have much to do with you. But say,
``Gee, Dad, I'm now a little older, a little more grown-up. I'd
love to meet your children and your wife and have you as part of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Begin slowly building a bridge to him. You and your sister don't
have to act in concert. You can act on your own on this.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My closest friend has been involved with a married man
for almost two years. I firmly believe he will never leave his
wife. In fact, he still lives with her! I'm uncomfortable hanging
out with my friend and this man. I disapprove of her affair, but at
the same time I won't turn my back on her. Should I stay out of it
or tell her exactly how I feel? _ Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: You are right when it comes to disapproving of your
friend's adultery, but take care not to lecture her about it.
Sermons and friendships are an unpalatable combination.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bad news. The good news is that you don't have to
listen to her talk about the dude. Tell your friend: ``I will
listen to you talk about anything in your life except George. And I
will hang out with you, but not with George. I'm not against him,
just the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, some months or years from now when it all hits the
fan and she ends up in tears, do her and yourself a favor by NOT
saying ``I told you so.''
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My ex-husband and his new wife, our former baby
sitter, just had a baby and now he's miffed at ME.
</P>
<P>
   She answered the phone when I called to discuss important
questions about our children's college expenses. I was polite but
businesslike, identifying myself and why I was calling, and
immediately asked to be passed on to her husband. He thinks I
should have chatted, asked about the baby, offered congratulations
_ and sent a baby gift.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's throwing up roadblocks whenever there's a decision
about our children. I've moved ahead with my life and don't want
him and his new family in it. Acting as though we are one big happy
extended family turns my stomach. Is this a question of my bad
manners? _ Lansing, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Good manners are always a worthwhile investment,
especially since this woman is going to be part of your life. You
can minimize wear and tear by contacting your ex at work or through
e-mail. And if your kids are in college they are old enough to make
money-calls to dad on their own.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's tough to be on your best behavior but if you can
behave it will make everyone's life much easier. And your families
are interwoven whether you like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have to send a baby gift? Nah!

 &HT;    U.S. could use history lesson to remind them of oil crisis
 &HT;    By Ana Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In these days when we're drowning in cheap oil, it's startling
to think that 25 years ago we were being told we would be out of
the stuff by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Arab oil embargo?
</P>
<P>
   Those were the times of odd/even days when the numbers on your
license plate determined whether or not you got a fill-up, or
whatever gasoline was available.
</P>
<P>
   People were hesitant to travel for fear they would find no fuel
for a return trip. And no one paid attention to the pleas to not
top off our tanks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange and new sight to see service stations with
``closed'' and ``out of gas'' signs posted. Strange and
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   When you did see a station open, you stopped regardless of what
your fuel gauge said because you didn't know when your next chance
would come. You stopped if you could afford it, that is.
</P>
<P>
   David Fuller, an attorney for R Lacy, a family-owned oil
exploration company, said he was a ``poor, struggling law student
living in a $70 a month apartment'' near Baylor University in 1973.
Finances and the oil shortage caused him and his friends to choose
activities within walking distance of campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worse in other parts of the country,'' he said,
recalling news accounts of violence in the long gas lines,
especially on the East and West coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a couple of slumps and one war later, the United States has
slid into an even greater dependence on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been lulled into a false sense of security that it will
always be that way,'' he said, referring to plentiful, and cheap,
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   And we are much more vulnerable than we were 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Exploration is almost exclusively off U.S. shores and in foreign
countries. Oil was what the Gulf War was about and the other areas
on which we depend for oil are not exactly bastions of political
stability: Russia, South America, Mexico, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, who returned to his hometown of Longview, Texas, 10
years ago, said he really hopes that oil-supplied energy will
always be plentiful, but that is by no means a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do forget what it was like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of comical to think about it now. The government
actually thought we were truly running out of oil. Now, 25 years
later, the world is literally awash in oil. ... Go back and look at
what the Department of Energy was saying in 1973. Reports published
by credible people said we would be out of oil by the year 2000,
(others said) we would be using it for only 10 percent of our
energy needs. But no one predicted that we would be as heavily
dependent as we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are some folks who don't have to learn a lesson more
than once.
</P>
<P>
   My dad, who operated a gas station for some 40 years, supplied
me with a 1959 Buick when I turned 16 in 1972. All my friends and
their friends could fit in that car.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime shortly after 1973, I was driving a Volkswagen Beetle.

CHRISTOPHER REEVE: MAN OF ACTION ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Christopher Reeve and
Daryl Hannah in ``Rear Window.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For the first time since the horseriding accident in l995 that
left him paralyzed and unable to walk, Christopher Reeve is back in
the starring spot in a movie- ABC's ``Rear Window,'' airing Nov.
22.
 &HT;    In this remake of Alfred Hitchcock's classic l954 thriller,
Reeve plays architect Jason Kemp who has been left a quadriplegic
after a catastrophic car crash. He shares the spotlight with
gorgeous Daryl Hannah, (reprising the role made famous by Grace
Kelly) as a man who, though confined to his room, witnesses what he
believes is a brutal murder.
 &HT;    Last year Reeve went behind the camera to direct the HBO movie
``In the Gloaming,'' a gem that brought him an Emmy nomination for
best director.
 &HT;    In the l997 TV film, ``Snakes and Ladders,'' he played a small
role as a quadriplegic who becomes a mentor to young man paralyzed
in a diving accident.
 &HT;    But this time he's back as the star, above the title, the
position he occupied before a balking horse changed his life
forever. Reeve was Superman on and off screen. The man who could
leap tall buildings in a single bound was in real life a real man
of action, flying gliders as well as jets, sky diving, sailing and
skiing, until, in the cruelest of ironies, he fell during a
relatively simple horse show, breaking the top two vertebrae of his
spinal column.
 &HT;    His courage has been challenged as never before. And ``Rear
Window,'' he says, allowed him to incorporate into the character
many of the terrifying things he himself has experienced. ``I
wanted to do this film because many times disabled people are shown
in a somewhat pathetic light or they're bitter or angry,'' he
explains. ``But this character is really more positive _ a
resourceful man who has been through the ringer. This movie shows
how far someone can come in reclaiming his life.''
 &HT;    Speaking from his home amid the woods of Bedford, N.Y., Reeve
has made incredible progress since the accident. Many thought he
wouldn't live out the year let alone have a career.
 &HT;    Now as an actor he has a unique opportunity to show an audience
at least a small part of what being a quadriplegic really entails.
For him this is not just acting.
 &HT;    ``Jason's experiences are very close to mine,'' he says. ``For
example, he experiences a 'pop off.' This means that some part of
the hose he depends on for breathing becomes separated from the
vent, or a hole develops in the hose. That's happened to me a
number of times. I stopped getting air and had absolutely no
breath.
 &HT;    ``And when we did that scene in the movie we did it for real.
The poor actor playing the nurse was terrified, but I told her it
was perfectly safe. There were actually nurses around and others
who could reconnect the vent in a second. I can also breathe off
the vent for short periods of time, so there was no real danger.
But when you see the pop-off on the screen, it's real. I'm actually
not breathing.''
 &HT;    It certainly takes Hitchcock's concept of the thriller a step
beyond. ``I think audiences will see what it's really like to go
through some of these very anxious moments,'' says Reeve. ``They
will see how those moments can be lonely and frustrating when
someone is just learning to cope with the situation.''
 &HT;    In the original film James Stewart played a photographer who was
sidelined with a broken leg. ``Our movie updates the story. The
idea is to raise the stakes,'' says Reeve. ``To do the same story
but with a ... quadriplegic puts the lead character in so much more
jeopardy. We wanted to create something exciting that forges new
ground.''
 &HT;    Hannah says Reeve was a joy to work with. ``He has a sparkle in
his eye that is sort of hypnotic and it kind of shoots out across
the room and tantalizes and hypnotizes you. He's got so much energy
and life it's just intoxicating.''
 &HT;    In his own life of course, Reeve has become a hero to millions
around the world since his accident. Besides directing, he has
narrated the film ``Without Pity,'' a plea for the disabled to
enjoy more rights in society. He's also penned a best-selling
autobiography, ``Still Me,'' which has helped ease his huge medical
bills.
 &HT;    In between he crisscrosses the country campaigning for a
national spinal cord registry and other legislation to help further
rights for the handicapped. His 37 year old wife Dana, (``my
rock'') is now rehearsing for a Broadway show, ``More to Love,''
and their son Will, 6, is at school. He also sees a lot of his
children from a previous relationship, Matthew l8, and Alexandra
15.
 &HT;    Reeve says of his wife: ``We're very much in love. Whether I
have zero recovery or full recovery our relationship will
survive.''
 &HT;    Progress, he says, is slow but perceptible. When he turned 43,
just four months after the accident, he couldn't blow out his
candles. Now when they wheeled in a cake for his 46th birthday he
proudly blew out the lot.
 &HT;    Through practice, he can now breathe without the ventilator for
up to 30 minutes a day. He exercises for three hours daily and is
now able to sneeze _ something he couldn't do a couple of years
ago.
 &HT;    But he still loses his cool when people, some of them doctors,
describe his quest as futile. And he insists he doesn't worry about
his medical insurance running out. ``By that time,'' he says,
``I'll be up and walking.''

WHY BUY BOSE?

<TEXT>
<P>
   You've seen the ads. ``The Bose Wave Radio is no ordinary
radio.'' It's ``a sonic marvel,'' a ``genuine breakthrough.'' Such
a little thing _ barely the size of a shoe box _ yet it puts out
the ``full, rich sound'' of a ``primary music system.'' It costs
$349, startlingly high for a clock radio but not unreasonable if
the claims are not overstated. Are the claims overstated? Come on.
How could they not be?
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Bose is bad. In fact, it may be the second-best
tabletop radio out there. But just this month, what may be the best
tabletop radio hit the market. It's the Cambridge SoundWorks Model
88 and, at $199, it's very nearly everything the Bose Wave claims
to be _ at a little over half the price. The Cambridge delivers a
smoother, more coherent, more rhythmic, more dynamic, more tonally
true picture of the music.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on a Vladimir Horowitz piano solo, the keys sounded
clangy, a bit metallic, on the Bose; they were warmer, but no less
hammered, on the Cambridge. When the quartet Anonymous 4 sang a
medieval chant, I wasn't sure on the Bose if there were four
singers (were there three? five?) _ there was no doubt at all on
the Cambridge. When the Heath Brothers played a hard-bop jazz tune,
the hi-hat cymbal sounded smeared on the Bose. I couldn't hear the
accent on the beat. On the Cambridge, I got the percussive thwack
as well as the shimmering whoosh all around it. And though the Bose
hit the low octaves of the acoustic bass, the Cambridge caught the
finger-pluckings of the bass strings.
</P>
<P>
   The differences weren't night and day. But they were of the sort
that, over time, make you feel at ease or slightly tense _ and
which, in a moment of leisure, make you want to stop and really
listen or move on to something else.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, I hooked up each unit to a compact disc player.
(Both radios sport input jacks in the back for plugging in a CD
player, computer, tape deck, television, or VCR.) I used not some
humdrum portable but the Discovery/Pentagon CD-70, a
top-of-the-line machine that retails for $5,000. And I pulled out
two of my most sonically demanding discs _ Henryk Gorecki's Third
Symphony, by the London Symphony Orchestra, on Nonesuch; and Kendra
Shank's Afterglow, a chanteuse-plus-jazz-trio session, on
Mapleshade.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the Gorecki know that, on some full-size (if
not very good) stereo systems, the first minute or so _ bass
violins growling quietly _ comes off as a vague rumble, its melody
barely audible. Both the Bose and the Cambridge navigate this
passage clearly. However, the Cambridge gets more of the bowing on
the basses, more of their rhythmic inflections. When a second,
louder bass line starts in about a minute into the piece, the Bose
cracks up for a second. The Cambridge doesn't exactly keep
everything straight (teeny speakers and teenier amplifiers can do
only so much), but it keeps going _ it doesn't lose the thread.
</P>
<P>
   On the Shank disc, when she modulates her voice, accenting a
certain word or dipping another to a whisper, the Bose makes it
sound as if the engineer is sharply turning up or down the volume.
The Cambridge gets the subtleties right. How do these radios eke
such relatively big sounds out of such small boxes? The Bose isn't
exactly a technical ``breakthrough,'' but it is clever. In the back
of the speakers is a 7 foot tube that has been folded into a thin,
tight maze to fit inside the radio box. The frequency of a sound
wave is defined by its length: The longer the wave, the deeper the
bass. Such a long tube gives sound waves lots of room to enlarge.
Each speaker is also powered by an amplifier equipped with circuits
that boost the bass as you turn up the volume. However, once the
speakers get to the middle and upper octaves, their limitations
become more apparent; hence, the steely pianos, smeared cymbals,
ungainly dynamics, and the rest. The Cambridge SoundWorks 88, half
an inch taller but otherwise the same size as the Bose, takes a
different approach. Its bass comes from a 4 1/2 inch woofer cone,
which takes up two-thirds of the radio's internal space and is
powered by its own amplifier. The two smaller main speakers, each
of which has its own amp, are freed up to focus their energies on
the less burdensome middle and treble octaves. (The 88 also has a
separate volume knob for the woofer, so you can adjust the bass
level, which would otherwise depend greatly on room placement.)
</P>
<P>
   The 88 is designed by Henry Kloss, a hi-fi legend who made his
mark (with the KLH speakers of the 1950's and the Advents of the
'60s) by figuring out how to manipulate electronics so that a
speaker sounds smooth from octave to octave. He applied 47 years of
experience with this art to the rather skimpy components of the
Model 88, which explains how he gets such a smooth, coherent sound
from not only a small box but also a cheap one.
</P>
<P>
   Bose is the property of Amar Bose, a man long regarded as
hi-fi's most brilliant marketer but whose products tend to be built
around a technical fad. His Bose 901 loudspeakers, the company's
premium line for 30 years, have nine speaker cones, positioned all
over the cabinet, so that the sound bounces around your room ``just
like in a concert hall.'' One problem, among many, is that most
people's living rooms aren't Carnegie Hall; as a result, the music
just sounds muddy. His methods also encourage high prices: The 901s
cost $1,400 a pair (some companies make $300 speakers that sound
better) because nine cones cost more than two or three; the Wave
radio costs $350 because that 7 foot tube was a bear to design. The
Wave is one of Bose's better devices. But he stretched too far, in
his price tag and his claims, and now Kloss' Cambridge has
delivered his comeuppance.
</P>
<P>

800-681-BOSE, the Cambridge SoundWorks from 800-FOR-HIFI.)

   Have you noticed how everyone wants to get their hands on your
new baby?
</P>
<P>
   Of course the attention and affection showered on the baby are
nice, but what's nice isn't always the same as what's needed, and
what new moms need is a no-holds-barred buddy who wades into the
trenches, rolls up her sleeves and asks, ``How can I help?''

a ``clip- and-save'' guide to making life a little easier for a new
mom and dad.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring (real) food.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping off a home-cooked meal (or great take-out) is an act of
friendship every new mom and dad dream of. A devoted friend might
even cook the meal, bring it over, serve it (holding the baby so
the new parents can actually eat it), and clean up afterward,
leaving nothing but happy, full bellies in her wake.
</P>
<P>
   Milk, juice, bread, fruit, and other staples are always
appreciated. After all, food is love.
</P>
<P>
   2. Come bearing brooms.
</P>
<P>
   A baby creates an avalanche of chores. After baths, diapering,
spit-up removal and laundry, there's no time (or energy) for much
else. Like many a new parent you shudder as the constant stream of
well-wishers wades through unread newspapers and dust balls in what
used to be a tidy home.
</P>
<P>
   New parents fantasize about buddies showing up, bucket and mop
in hand, cheerfully tackling the kitchen, shower, living room and
cluttered corners until they sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   For loving friends who live too far away for the do-it-yourself
approach and want to give a baby shower gift that will really make
a difference, how about three months of prepaid cleaning service?
It's guaranteed to earn the sponsor a spot in the Helper's Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   3. Hold a crier (and don't complain).
</P>
<P>
   No matter how deeply a new mother adores her baby, she needs a
break sometimes (yes, even when the little sweetie is screaming for
all she's worth). In this ultimate test of friendship, people fall
into one of two categories: heroes who are willing to hold a crying
child and wimps who sing out ``Here, Mom!'' at the first squawk a
newborn makes, holding her at arm's length as if she were about to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   So the baby is crying. It's only a little voice, after all, and
a new mom will be eternally grateful if she can finish going to the
bathroom, just this once. Giving Mom time away from baby (crying or
not) is a necessity, not a luxury. It means she can have a minute
to herself to relax in a hot bath, take a walk or catch a nap.
</P>
<P>
   4. Offer on-the-spot childcare.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how a new mom ``runs out'' to pick up a quart of milk:
Feed the baby; change the baby; pack the diaper bag; feed the baby;
change the baby; change the mom; feed the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? Two hours later you're finally on your way, but
the minute you enter the store, the little guy begins to wail.
</P>
<P>
   The probability of task completion increases tenfold with the
help of another adult who can hold the baby, change a diaper or
finish errands while Mom nurses. For new parents who don't get out
much, walking into a store with free hands, knowing that the baby
is nearby, safe in the care of a trusted friend, is liberating.
Moms might even complete two errands in one outing!
</P>
<P>
   5. Polish your penmanship.
</P>
<P>
   New mothers who send out thank-you notes for all the baby
presents before their child is 3 months old are either developing
an obsessive-compulsive disorder, getting a head start on the
supermom complex or lucky enough to have family and friends who
help them organize a mass mailing in between feedings and diaper
changes or during the baby's naps.
</P>
<P>
   New moms need buddies who seize the
thank-you-for-your-lovely-gift mission as their own, bringing over
stamps and addressing envelopes while Mom writes the notes, or
putting their best penmanship forward as Mom dictates.
</P>
<P>
   With all the other intense emotions of new parenthood, you can
at least keep guilt over unwritten thank-you notes out of the mix.
</P>
<P>
   6. Roll up your sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors whom dads and moms love most are those who stop by
not just to shoot the breeze or offer unsolicited advice but also
to fix the banging screen door. Or hang new curtains, recycle the
newspapers, take the dog for a walk, rake leaves, water the
houseplants, brush the cat and clean out the litter box.
</P>
<P>
   These little extras are acts of love in their best form:
hands-on care.
</P>
<P>
   7. Be a ``big sister'' to the new big sister.
</P>
<P>
   When a second child is born, mothers are confronted with a
knife-in-the-heart feeling, certain that in showering attention on
the new arrival they are ruining their firstborn's childhood
forever. Fortunate are those who have family and friends to push
big sister on the swings, take her to the park or library, build
block towers, play tag and hang around for the sole purpose of
helping with her bedtime routine.
</P>
<P>
   It's the people who show up at the door with barely a glance in
the new infant's direction, calling out, ``Where's my big girl?''
with their arms flung wide, who show they know what real help is
about.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, new moms need encouragement and congratulations as well,
but when it comes to changing diapers, running errands, cleaning
up, or finding a moment to themselves, kind words can't do the job.
But friends and family can, by showering new moms with love in the
form of tangible help.

<P>
   If you like to exercise with a group, you've probably attended
more than a few aerobic classes over the years, from dance to
hip-hop to high energy to low impact.
</P>
<P>
   You may also have tried the popular ``step'' classes offered at
health clubs, where exercisers step up on a plastic bench in a
series of choreographed movements.
</P>
<P>
   But what about weight-lifting? Does the thought of heaving
barbells put you off? What if you were able to do that in a class
where the atmosphere was fun and high energy, and the whole routine
was set to music?
</P>
<P>
   That's the concept of BodyPUMP, an increasingly popular new
exercise program that was developed in New Zealand in 1990 and
introduced in U.S. fitness clubs this year.
</P>
<P>
   BodyPUMP will ``breathe new life into the group fitness
market,'' says Rich Boggs, president of the Step Co. in Marietta,
Ga., which brought the step aerobic program to health clubs in the
early '90s and is marketing the new BodyPUMP program.
</P>
<P>
   Instructors can become certified in the method after attending
three-day workshops, then going through quarterly workshops to
learn new choreography and ensure their workouts are being taught
safely and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are often held in fitness centers' aerobics rooms.
Participants use a specially designed barbell system that allows
them to adjust weights for intensity and fitness levels. They lift
the barbells through a set of choreographed routines that are
designed to work every major muscle group, Boggs said, including
squats, presses, lifts and curls. The bar ranges from 3 pounds
without weights to a maximum of 91 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The focus: correct lifting using light to moderate weights with
high repetitions. ``You don't get big,'' Boggs says. ``Just toned
and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The user-friendly format is attracting females, who
traditionally shy away from free weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``BodyPUMP is the first opportunity for women to strength train
to music,'' says Debbie Lee, general manager at the Fitness
Connection for Women in Gainesville, Fla. ``You don't have to be a
body builder to do it. It's attractive to all groups, from novices
to advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Classes on average can accommodate 50 participants and last from
45 to 60 minutes. While the routine is not aerobic, the
weight-lifting helps build lean muscle mass, reversing bone loss,
which is increasingly important to women with concerns of
osteoporosis, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs recommends using BodyPUMP as part of a balanced exercise
program, two to three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, see Bogg's company Web site at
www.bodypump.com, or call the Step Co. at (770) 859-9292.

   MOVIE REVIEWS

   ELIZABETH _ Movie review: ``Elizabeth,'' with Cate

her transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler (sort of the total woman, Elizabethan-style). ''
Grade: A- (Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   REVIEW-RUGRATS _ Movie review: ``The Rugrats Movie.'' Movie
based on Nickelodeon TV hit. ```The Rugrats Movie' takes the
Nickelodeon hit from the small screen to the big. And it tackles a
big subject matter: making room for baby. Adults will probably feel
antsier than the children, having to listen to adult actors
performing in baby voices, and mispronouncing words in
gosh-darn-cute-kid fashion. But hey, look at it this way: It could
be another Barney flick, or a Teletubbies feature.'' (StMurray,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   REVIEW-CELEBRITY _ Movie review: ``Celebrity.'' ``...perhaps
(Woody) Allen himself has been famous for too long. His film is
less a thought-through investigation of an omnipresent phenomenon

JACQUES MEDECIN, 70, EX-MAYOR OF NICE 
</HEADLINE>

 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Jacques Medecin, mayor of Nice from 1966 until 1990,
when he fled to Uruguay in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid
prosecution on corruption charges that later landed him in jail for
nearly two years, died in Uruguay on Nov. 17 after several heart
attacks, his family said. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Nice, where the conservative Medecin made casinos, business
leaders and the tourist industry rich but left municipal coffers
nearly empty, loved him like a godfather and prepared to lay him
out in state in the City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The city plans to pay for funeral ceremonies and arrange a Mass
in Ste. Reparate Cathedral on Saturday, Medecin's successor,
Jacques Peyrat, announced, and even Medecin's left-wing critics
raised little objection.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day in 1938, I decided I would be the mayor of Nice, like
my father,'' Medecin wrote in a self-exculpatory book. ``I was 10
years old.'' Between him and his father, Jean, the Medecins ruled
Nice for 62 years, as naturally as the Grimaldis just down the
coast ruled Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   Jacquou, as people of Nice called him, had been an indifferent
student and never got the law degree he studied for, soaking up a
background in politics at home and as a journalist for Paris-Presse
and the local daily, Nice-Matin, before picking up the reins after
his father died in December 1965, in the 37th year of his reign.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet 38, Jacques succeeded his father as mayor early the
following year, and as member of Parliament in Paris in 1967. In
1973 he consolidated power on the Cote d'Azur by becoming president
of the General Council of the Alpes-Maritimes region. And for most
of the next 15 years, there seemed little he could do wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Medecin method, as it was called, was to spread public money
around, lavishly _ a few hundred million francs for a convention
hall here, a few hundred million for a water-purification plant
there, a few hundred million more for an arts pavilion in the
center of town, not forgetting the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   It was too much for British author Graham Greene, who lived in
Nice and denounced the mayor in the early 1980s for supposed ties
with the local mafia. The Nicois did not seem to care: the economy
was booming and jobs were plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   And people loved the way their irreverent, bald and mustachioed
mayor could thumb his nose at Charles de Gaulle, Georges Pompidou
and other bigwigs in faraway Paris, exploiting impunity conferred
on him by his position as head of an independent party his father
had founded, Entente Republicaine.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the anti-Gaullist Valery Giscard d'Estaing for the
French presidency in 1974, Medecin was briefly rewarded two years
later by being named a junior government minister for tourism,
until Prime Minister Raymond Barre summarily ejected him from the
post in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Still at the height of his power in Nice, he was divorced from
his first wife, Claude, who had been a model for the Jacques Fath
fashion house, and in 1979 married an American 21 years his junior,
Ilene Graham, a 31-year-old Southern California beauty whose uncle
was Max Factor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 Medecin's nemesis, the Socialist Party, came to power
nationally with the election of President Francois Mitterrand. Soon
government tax inspectors and independent investigating magistrates
began looking into the mayor's methods, while he began to take
increasingly long trips to Miami and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors investigated his ties with a French
traffic-signal company and found that it had paid many of his
campaign expenses. They discovered that Nice-Opera, which he had
set up to finance the municipal theater, had also been sending
money to his private bank accounts in Panama. And they found that
municipal contractors had been taking paid advertisements out in
the mayor's campaign newspaper, Action Nice Cote d'Azur.
</P>
<P>
   He was only doing what all other French politicians had done for
years, the Mayor protested, but investigation followed
investigation, and muck-raking articles about him piled up in
left-leaning national newspapers like Le Canard Enchaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Nice-Opera affair, I am guilty of carelessness,'' he
later told another French newspaper, Le Figaro. ``I paid certain
expenses incurred for the city of Nice or for promoting it, without
proper documentation. But I would like to repeat that the amounts
drawn from this account never exceeded $24,000.''
</P>
<P>
   From the president of the traffic signal company, he admitted,
he had received $800,000 over four years. But that was before
campaign financing laws made such payments illegal, he protested,
and more than a dozen other politicians had received contributions
from the same company. Prosecutors paid no attention.
</P>
<P>
   In Nice the municipal debt continued to rise, eventually
reaching $900 million, and on Sept. 15, 1990, Medecin cracked under
the pressure while on a city-paid promotional trip to Japan. He
would not be returning to Nice, after all, he announced after
boarding an Air France commercial flight to Uruguay instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never will I accept being photographed with my wrists in
handcuffs on the courthouse stairs,'' he declared. ``That would
please my enemies and the left too much.''
</P>
<P>
   His second marriage had fallen apart, and in Uruguay, where he
thought he would be safe from extradition to France, he settled in
the beach resort of Punta del Este, eventually meeting and marrying
Berta Bittar, his third wife. She survives him, as do two daughters
from his first marriage and another daughter from his second.
</P>
<P>
   In France in 1992, a court convicted him of malfeasance, and
prosecutors obtained a court order for his arrest in Uruguay, where
authorities jailed him in November 1993 while they debated sending
him back to France. A year later, after Uruguayan courts ruled
against him, he was flown to France to face further trials on the
Nice-Opera and traffic-signal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Released on appeal in September 1995 after being convicted of
embezzlement and fraud and sentenced to three and a half years in
prison, Medecin never went back to jail again. In January 1996 the
appeals court in Grenoble upheld the convictions but sentenced him
to time already served, and Medecin went back to Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   With about $800,000 _ all from the sale of family property in
France, he insisted _ he invested in real estate near Punta del
Este, where he was living happily until last Sunday, when he was
felled by heart attacks.

HOECHST PLANNING TO SPIN OFF CELANESE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Buffeted by slumping sales on many fronts,
Hoechst AG intends to spin off Celanese, its big American chemical
subsidiary, and another unit by issuing new shares to all its
stockholders. The company said on Tuesday that it would give every
stockholder one share in a new company made up of Celanese and
Ticona, a smaller subsidiary, for every 10 Hoechst shares.
</P>
<P>
   Jurgen Dormann, the company's chairman, said the move would give
both Hoechst and Celanese more flexibility and advance Hoechst's
goal of leaving the chemical industry by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Few concerns have tried to reinvent themselves more drastically
than Hoechst. Under Dormann, it has sold billions of dollars worth
of chemical businesses and tried to rebuild itself as a life
sciences company.
</P>
<P>
   But the transformation has run into disappointments. The
pharmaceutical business, Hoechst Marion Roussel, is still
struggling to bring a new generation of drugs to the market, and
its most important older drugs are losing patent protection.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst executives refused to comment on news reports that they
might be close to a merger with the French drug maker Rhone-Poulenc
SA.

HEDGE FUNDS MAY HAVE TO DISCLOSE MORE DATA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As federal regulators tighten their scrutiny of hedge funds,
officials say they will likely require the often secretive funds to
reveal more about how much debt they use and the risks they take
with their money.
</P>
<P>
   Examinations of hedge funds and the banks and brokerage firms
that deal with them began in September, after Long-Term Capital
Management, the giant hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn., was
rescued from bankruptcy by a consortium of Wall Street banks. The
$3.6 billion rescue was coordinated by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York and raised questions about how the failure of a single,
unregulated investment company could threaten world financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, are conducting separate reviews
of brokerage firms, traders and banks that they supervise,
officials from each of the agencies said Wednesday. Their efforts
are being coordinated by the President's Working Group on Financial
Markets, a committee headed by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC in recent weeks has reviewed the books of major Wall
Street firms that had dealings with Long-Term Capital, including
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch
&AMP; Co. The examinations were intended to learn more about how
brokers deal with hedge fund clients, said an SEC official who
asked not to be identified by name. The Fed has also required banks
it regulates to provide detailed information on their lending to
hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely outcome of the scrutiny is that regulators will
require hedge funds and their lenders to reveal more information,
though people involved with the working group's discussions say it
is still too early to say what form those measures will take or
whether they will be voluntary or mandatory. Government officials
involved with the working group study said they were unlikely to
recommend direct regulation of hedge funds themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``More disclosure and reporting is the first step,'' said CFTC
Chairwoman Brooksley Born in an interview Wednesday. ``I have
become convinced that that is most necessary.'' She said regulators
planned to conclude their study of hedge funds early next year,
though any new regulatory measures to emerge from the research
would take longer to enact.
</P>
<P>
   SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. has said that requiring more
disclosure about hedge fund debt and risk levels was at the top of
the regulators' agenda. Speaking to reporters recently, Levitt said
he believed that any steps the United States took should be agreed
to internationally as well. ``To be effective, the kind of
transparency we're talking about should be global,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has also sought more information about hedge funds and
how they are supervised. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., chairman of
the Senate Agriculture Committee, has called a hearing on
derivatives next month. The hearing is expected to be the first in
a series that could determine whether the government should take a
direct role in overseeing the largely unregulated over-the-counter
market for derivatives, and, if so, which federal agency should do
the regulating.
</P>
<P>
   Like many hedge funds, Long-Term Capital was a major user of
derivatives, which are financial instruments that derive their
value from stocks, bonds or currencies. The fund had derivatives
exposure that totaled nearly $1.2 trillion, making it one of the
largest derivatives users in the world. The size of Long-Term
Capital's portfolio and its near collapse have added urgency to a
debate in Washington over whether derivatives contracts pose
dangers to the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of activity by regulators comes amid questions about
what kind of disclosure Long-Term Capital made in the past, and
whether government officials might have taken action earlier to
guard against the September crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Born confirmed a report in The Washington Post on Wednesday
that the CFTC received a regular annual statement from Long-Term
Capital earlier this year. The filing disclosed the hedge fund's
assets and showed that it had a relatively high debt-to-equity
ratio of 25 to 1. But she said the filing was the same annual
report that Long-Term Capital provided its investors and lenders,
and that it did not in itself raise red flags about the fund's
stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The annual report showed no indication that it was about to
collapse. It was successful and it was similar to other hedge
funds'' in its use of debt, Ms. Born said. She added that by
August, when financial markets had turned against Long-Term
Capital's trading positions, its capital had shrunk drastically and
the ratio of debt to capital increased sharply. But she said, by
that time her agency's information was outdated.

AT BARNARD, CELEBRATING A PIONEER OF FEMINISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before Betty Friedan, before Gloria Steinem, before
Kate Millett, there was Millicent Carey McIntosh _ a feminist role
model for women in the 1940s and '50s who wanted to combine family
and career.
</P>
<P>
   A mother of five (including twins), headmistress at the Brearley
School and then president of Barnard College, she was the first
married woman to head a Seven Sisters college. In 1951, she was on
the cover of Newsweek, which proclaimed that at a time when women's
education was trying to figure out ``whether it should turn out
homemakers or Who's Whoers _ or both,'' Mrs. McIntosh had
``successfully combined marriage and a career for 19 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McIntosh is now verging on 100 and many more women follow
her path today, even as the debate about meshing home and career
continues. With her centennial birthday approaching Nov. 30,
students, faculty members, administrators and friends gathered
Wednesday at Barnard to celebrate this early symbol of women's
liberation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a president who was ahead of her time,'' Judith
Shapiro, Barnard's president, said to the audience of about 100,
adding that Mrs. McIntosh explored ``the struggle of both women and
men to find their true roles in a changing world.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Mac, as she is known, is 80 years older than many
of today's students, her name remains hallowed on campus and
students crowded into the McIntosh Student Center on Wednesday to
pay tribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came from a different era, but the work and family issue
is really very important and a lot of Barnard students struggle
with this today,'' said Leora Hanser, president of the student
government and another of the featured speakers, who pinned a
``Barnard bear'' on Mrs. McIntosh's lapel.
</P>
<P>
   Never one for unnecessary words, Mrs. McIntosh sat quietly in a
wheelchair at the front of the student center hall, a small but
commanding figure in a gray glen-plaid suit and a pink blouse with
an ascot, her short silver hair softly framing her face. As four
speakers rose to praise her, she fixed her eyes intently on each,
as if to take their measure. Again and again she nodded her
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Although she did not make a speech, she greeted a parade of
well-wishers, dispensing compliments and posing for pictures. It
was, she said, ``a wonderful occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   She came to Barnard in 1947 when women's colleges were trying to
demonstrate that women could be educated as rigorously as men. But,
as the Newsweek article noted, some women were left feeling that
college had prepared them to be men and that they were on their own
in figuring out how to be successful women.
</P>
<P>
   It was that divide that she crossed so emphatically, lacing a
curriculum of Latin verbs and English sonnets with doses of the
practical.
</P>
<P>
   At Brearley, for example, where she was headmistress from 1930
to '47, she instituted a sex education course for sixth graders and
taught it herself. When she moved to Barnard, she created and
taught a required course in ``Modern Living.''
</P>
<P>
   Her influence reached well beyond Barnard's walls, for Mrs.
McIntosh spoke widely, using language that might well have come
from some modern-day text written by Carol Gilligan, the Harvard
psychologist, or Mary Pipher, the author of ``Reviving Ophelia.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, for example, Mrs. McIntosh told students at Sarah
Lawrence that motherhood need not be an all-absorbing affair and
that women make better mothers if they do not spend all their time
on the physical care of children. She said that when girls were
with boys, they typically felt it necessary to subordinate their
own interests or use the ``foolish technique'' of pretending to be
stupid to be popular. ``We sell our souls into bondage,'' she said.
``Girls should be conditioned against it. The boys, too, need some
conditioning for the new world.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of her feminist views were of the 1990s variety.
Although she received a doctorate in English from Johns Hopkins,
she preferred to be referred to as Mrs. rather than Dr. _ she said
that one doctor in the family was enough (her husband, Rustin
McIntosh, who died in 1986, was a pediatrician). She also advised
women that when job and family collided, family should take
precedence.
</P>
<P>
   From her farm in Tyringham, Mass., in the Berkshires, where she
has lived since leaving Barnard in 1962, Mrs. McIntosh has watched
the women's movement with interest. She identified herself as a
comrade in arms in a 1973 article in the Annals of the New York
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're grateful to Women's Liberation for working to solve lots
of sticky problems that remain, and most of us try to help when we
can,'' she wrote. ``But we feel that the querulous members of the
movement have failed to recognize one basic fact about women:
provided that they are willing and able to work hard, with
self-discipline, they can do anything they REALLY Want to.''

COMMENTARY: PUTTING PROFIT INTO PUBLIC TRANSIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Subway trains are running erratically, stations are
dirty, buses are packed _ and Gene Russianoff has been very busy.
The city's most quoted ``passengers' advocate'' has blitzed the
subways with advertisements, lined up support from politicians and
planned a little street theater for Monday's board meeting of the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. A demonstrator in a turkey
costume will urge the MTA not to gobble up the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for good photo opportunities, and it will probably
result in benefits for some passengers. Russianoff's group, the
Straphangers Campaign, has done wonders pressuring the MTA for
lower fares and better service. But how much has he _ or anyone
else _ done to advocate the long-term interests of passengers?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the turkey costume accomplishes, New York's riders will
still be trapped in a dysfunctional system, because fare box
revenues cover only about half the costs. The conventional wisdom,
espoused by the Straphangers as well as the MTA, transit unions and
politicians, is that this shortfall should be made up with money
from taxpayers, which is why Russianoff has become so adept at
pressuring politicians for subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another way to advocate for passengers, as was
demonstrated in London over the last decade. Instead of begging for
money to cover its losses, London Transport tried a system that
existed in New York early this century, when private companies
profitably operated buses and subways. In the 1980s, London
officials began contracting out bus routes and eventually
privatized all the buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition among private operators brought our costs
tumbling down,'' said David Bayliss, the director of planning for
London Transport. Thanks to reduced costs, improved service and
increased ridership, the London bus system showed a slight profit
last year _ a far cry from New York's bus system, which loses $2
per ride. London officials are now studying ways to privatize some
subway operations.
</P>
<P>
   Similar experiments are under way in cities around the world,
but not in New York. The only serious challenge to the MTA's
monopoly has come from jitneys offering $1 van rides in Queens and
Brooklyn. But the City Council, under pressure from the transit
unions, refuses to issue them licenses, and Russianoff has done
nothing to advocate for their passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one reason Russianoff fought for fare discounts (like
free transfers from buses to subways) was to take business back
from the van drivers. ``We don't want vans siphoning off riders
from the buses,'' he said, ``because we think it will hurt bus
service in the long run. There may be a role for the vans in some
neighborhoods with poor bus service, but we don't want to take
money out of the public system.''
</P>
<P>
   This position happens to jibe with the interests of the transit
unions, as do many stances taken by the Straphangers Campaign. The
group joined a coalition of transit unions to sponsor the ad
campaign in the subways this fall, showing pictures of sardines and
snails with the slogans ``End the crush'' and ``End the crawl.''
The ads urged passengers to call politicians to demand more money
for more service _ and therefore more union jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plead guilty that we have an ongoing relationship with the
transit unions,'' Russianoff said. ``We fight them on some issues,
but we've worked well with them, too. The unions have political
power, and you need that to get things done. We had to build a
consensus to get money for a system that was near death's door.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the long run, confronting the unions could yield even
more, said Wendell Cox, a consultant who has analyzed transit
systems in America and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advocacy groups are making a mistake to keep throwing money at
transit monopolies,'' Cox said. ``It goes mainly to expand
management bureaucracies and improve union contracts. New York's
fundamental transit problem is spending, not funding. If it started
contracting out bus service and some subway operations, the system
could easily pay for itself within 10 to 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, as Russianoff maintains, it would be fruitless for the
Straphangers to advocate radical measures. ``We have to be
pragmatic,' he said. ``This has long been a labor town, and
privatization isn't even in the public policy debate yet.'' That's
true, and it will remain true if we wait for union leaders or MTA
managers to suggest giving up their monopoly. But shouldn't the
passengers' advocate at least be raising the issue?

TRIPP SHOPS FOR AN AGENT  
 SCANDALOUS ENDOWMENT  
 MODEL BEHAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON WITH JOYCE WADLER AND MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda Tripp, who surreptitiously punched the record button when
Monica Lewinsky poured out her heart on the phone, is looking for
an agent. No, not Lucianne Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Ms. Tripp who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said that she and Ms. Goldberg never had a formal
arrangement for Ms. Goldberg, a Manhattan literary agent, to
represent her. This person said that Ms. Tripp and Ms. Goldberg
remained friends but had ``agreed'' that Ms. Goldberg's appearance
before a grand jury in Maryland last week made it impossible for
them to have a ``formal relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury is considering whether Ms. Tripp, who lives in
Howard County, Md., broke the Maryland wiretapping law by taping
about 22 hours of conversations without Ms. Lewinsky's knowledge.
Ms. Goldberg said after she testified last week that she was wrong
when she told Ms. Tripp it would be legal to make the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The person close to Ms. Tripp said that Ms. Tripp had been
dining with media types in Washington, including Larry King, the
CNN talk-show host. ``She certainly would be well within her rights
to write a book,'' the person said. The Pentagon's refusal to let
Ms. Tripp return to her job there and the possibility that she
might be dismissed ``makes it particularly important for her now to
explore her economic options,'' the person said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Goldberg, she, too, said that she had never
represented Ms. Tripp. ``I don't know why,'' she said Wednesday,
``but it's taken me a year to get people to realize I'm not Linda
Tripp's agent and I never was.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bit Too Jumbo
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The U.N. Sculpture Garden now has a full-size bronze
elephant, a gift from Kenya, Namibia and Nepal. And it caused a
stir even before its unveiling Wednesday at a ceremony attended by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   It was too well-endowed for some.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sunday, I received a call from the ambassador from Nepal,
who said: `The penis is enormous. We brought in an expert to look.
There has to be a surgical operation,''' said Hans Janitschek,
chairman of a nonprofit group that had raised money for the
project. ``Where this expert came from I do not know.''
</P>
<P>
   Narendra Bikram Shah, the permanent representative from Nepal,
said Wednesday that he had no problem with the sculpture. But such
was the concern at the United Nations that a meeting was held in
the office of Undersecretary- General Alvaro Desoto. The solution?
To plant some bushes that block the view.
</P>
<P>
   Runway Irregulars
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So they were not really supermodels. But on Tuesday
evening, half a dozen women looked like runway regulars in the
Fifth Avenue showroom of Asprey &AMP; Garrard, jewelers for the English
royals.
</P>
<P>
   The models, women in their 30s who belong to the director's
council of the Museum of the City of New York or the store's
``tastemaking'' advisory board, included Whitney Fairchild, Tara
Rockefeller, Rachel Hovnanian, Alexia Pickett and Olexa Farrell.
They got to dress up in beaded evening wear by Tomasz Starzewski.
They had hair and makeup done by John Barrett at Bergdorf Goodman.
And they got to wear baubles from Asprey &AMP; Garrard _ several
million dollars' worth of diamonds, emeralds and gold.
</P>
<P>
   They had to give back the dresses and the jewelry. But that was
after they had paraded in front of 350 guests, who had packed the
store and spilled out onto the sidewalk on 56th Street at Fifth
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a fantasy,'' said Ms. Hovnanian, who was perhaps a
little too attached to the $57,000 diamond pave dropped earrings
she had been wearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look great on you,'' a woman at the party said to her,
and then suggested that maybe Ms. Hovnanian's husband, Ara, a New
Jersey real-estate executive, might buy them for her.
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged. The earrings went back to the vault.

CLINTON TO WARN JAPAN ABOUT NORTH KOREAN MISSILE THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ President Clinton will warn Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi that fresh intelligence shows that North Korea can
launch a second long-range ballistic missile over Japan at any
time, U.S. officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton is discussing the development
with Obuchi during his two-day visit to Tokyo before flying to
Seoul late Friday to discuss the issue with South Korean President
Kim Dae Jung.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the president hopes the warning will
forge greater cooperation among the United States, Japan and South
Korea to deal with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official on the White House National Security Council
said U.S. officials ``anticipate that there will be additional
missile launches'' by North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone is going to be surprised that they're
going to have a test and that there will be political reaction to
that,'' said one U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea rang alarm bells across Asia on Aug. 31 when it
conducted a surprise test launch of a three-stage rocket with an
estimated range of 3,300 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The Taepodong II missile, ostensibly carrying a satellite into
orbit, crossed over Japan and broke up over the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials also are concerned that Pyongyang's construction
of a suspicious underground cavern may be a step in nuclear weapons
development and a violation of an agreement to cease such work.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea agreed in 1994 to freeze _ and eventually dismantle
_ its nuclear weapons program in return for international shipments
of heating oil and construction of two nuclear power reactors by a
U.S.-led international consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention North Korea during his public remarks
here. However, during a ``town hall'' meeting, the president
recalled the terrorist nerve gas attack in the Tokyo subway system
in 1995 that killed 12 and injured thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Japan faces a threat from chemical or biological weapons in the
hands of terrorists or ``rogue nations,'' Clinton said. ``This is
not an academic issue to you; this is a real issue to you,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Nations must retain the option of combating such potential
threats, as the United States has done with Iraq, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is always better than war if you can do it consistent
with the long term security and freedom of the people,'' Clinton
said. ``If you can do something to stop it now, we should do it _
even if it requires military action.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke a day after his special envoy on Korea, Ambassador
Charles Kartman, left Pyongyang after failing to gain access to the
suspicious underground construction site.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials say spy satellites show thousands of
North Koreans burrowing into the side of a mountain in what may be
an effort to construct a nuclear weapons' site.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council (NSC),
said NSC staffer Jack Pritchard, who accompanied Kartman into North
Korea, arrived in Tokyo Thursday to brief Clinton's national
security adviser, Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese public remains acutely concerned about developments
on the Korean peninsula. A recent survey conducted before the
missile test found 75.3 percent of those surveyed identifying the
Korean peninsula situation or weapons of mass destruction as their
top concern.
</P>
<P>
   In response to North Korea's missile firing, Japan has taken a
hard line toward North Korea, halting famine relief and delaying
resumption of negotiations for diplomatic relations. Japanese
authorities have kept the nation's armed forces on alert, as well,
and warned that a second test would be ``totally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the United States and South Korea have kept open
the door to North Korea, continuing the cross-border dialogue and
urging Japan to continue cooperation with international efforts to
substitute alternative sources of power for North Korea's
weapons-oriented nuclear reactor program.
</P>
<P>
   A cruise ship bearing 780 South Korean tourists docked in the
North Korean port of Changjon on Thursday, bringing the first South
Korean tourists to North Korea since the start of the Korean War in
1950.

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR NOV. 19.  
 STARR: DWARF OR GIANT
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USA Today, the New York Times and Los Angeles Times lead with
Kenneth Starr's testimony Thursday before the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post has two Starr stories on its front, but
leads instead with the Republicans' House leadership elections,
which garner big front space at the other papers. The only real
news there is that J.C. Watts, the House's only black Republican,
ascended to one of the party's top House posts.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody stresses that Starr will claim that President
Clinton's conduct in the Lewinsky matter was part of a general
pattern of misusing his office to prevent the dissemination of
damaging information about him, but it's also pointed out
everywhere that his testimony will contain the first revelation
that Starr has exonerated President Clinton in the White House
travel office firings and in connection with the transferal of FBI
background files to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It's apparent from the accounts that the other major area of
alleged Clinton dissembling Starr has in mind is his original
raison d'etre, Whitewater, both in connection with Clinton's
testimony at the Arkansas trial of the McDougals and Jim Guy
Tucker, and in the president's apparent involvement in the
channeling of funds to Webster Hubbell after the latter's
conviction. And the WP points out that Starr goes out of his way to
condemn Clinton for his encouragement, in a TV interview, of Susan
McDougal's continued silence.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT states most clearly the dimension in which Thursday's
testimony is an advance over Starr's previous written report: that
document spoke of possible grounds for impeachment, whereas
according to the LAT, Starr will say Clinton ``should be removed
from office.''
</P>
<P>
   All the papers write from advance copies of his prepared
testimony made available by Starr, and they all report that Clinton
will be in Asia during Starr's appearance. They also all mention
that Clinton has not yet replied to the 81 questions submitted to
him by House Judiciary chairman Hyde, pleading lack of time given
the Iraq crisis, but it's the WP that mentions in this connection
that Clinton played golf on Monday. On the other hand, the Post
also has a quote from Hyde in which he gives up the game of merely
being a disinterested searcher for truth. Asked if Starr needed to
hit a home run today, Hyde is quoted: ``I'd settle for a line drive
over third.''
</P>
<P>
   The papers also mention that neither the White House nor
committee Democrats are pleased that the time to question Starr has
been limited, but none mentions that in his testimony before
Starr's grand jury, Clinton likewise limited the amount of time he
sat for questions.
</P>
<P>
   A Wall Street Journal front-page feature depicts the
interactions of a computer industry consortium focused on keeping
Microsoft at bay, the so-called NOISE group: Netscape, Oracle, IBM,
Sun and Everybody else. The paper claims that in the service of
their goal, the companies have engaged in ``cabal''-like behavior,
and that the fate of the alliance may affect the future of the
software industry far more than the outcome of the Microsoft
anti-trust trial. The story states the Justice Department
explanation of why such consorting is not an anti-trust issue the
way it says Microsoft's activities are: ``monopolies and their
competitors play by different rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder where, in a tickerless financial world, all that
paper for ticker tape parades come from? Well, Thursday's Journal
reports, in the Business Bulletin, that for John Glenn's parade at
least, some of the stuff was a resume. No word on how the paper,
er, pieced the story together.
</P>
<P>
   There is a bunch of coverage Thursday on the prospects for any
internal, U.S.-supported overthrow of Saddam Hussein. A NYT
front-pager describes U.S. officials as weary of the squabbling
between anti-Hussein dissident groups, and says that at least one
the U.S. is still funding is likely riddled with double agents. And
a confluent NYT editorial concludes Hussein cannot be overthrown
without an American invasion and occupation. The LAT has a
front-page effort that quotes a U.S. expert as saying the plan of
one rebel is akin to the Bay of Pigs. The piece also includes this
ringing assessment from another expert: ``The only military skill
(the Iraqi Kurds) have ever demonstrated is the ability to fight
each other over smuggling rights.'' Apparently, there is no Kurdish
Anti-Defamation League.

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Even as a child, I was the family cynic. And nothing brought out
the Diogenes in me more than Thanksgiving. What, I used to ask,
were we _ our mother and my five siblings _ to be thankful for?
After all, as black people in the South, we did not count for much
in the eyes of white people and even fellow blacks.
 &HT;    Sometimes, I thought that God had abandoned us. Our father ran
off for good when I, the oldest, was 10 years old. We never had
enough money and lived in a two-bedroom, run-down apartment in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. Weekdays, my mother cleaned hotel rooms; weekends
she picked vegetables.
 &HT;    We rarely had new school clothes, almost everything coming from
`used' shops. We did not own a car. And we never had enough food _
which caused my mother more shame than anything else.
 &HT;    What did we have to be thankful for?
 &HT;    When I was 14, I finally learned that we had much to be thankful
for. I had been living for three years with grandparents in
Crescent City, Fla., because my mother simply could not support all
of us. In Crescent City, I had everything _ delicious food, new
clothes, my own bedroom, a new bicycle, books and all of the Nehi
grape soda I could drink.
 &HT;    In 1959, my mother asked me to return to Fort Lauderdale to
celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of the family. Always the
traveler, I caught the Greyhound bus the day before Thanksgiving.
 &HT;    The family lived in the same cramped apartment, and when I saw
the grime and smelled the stench of the trash cans behind the
complex, that old feeling of hopelessness and anger returned. I did
not want to be there for Thanksgiving.
 &HT;    What did my mother and the other children have for which they
should be thankful?
 &HT;    I was in the courtyard when my mother got off the bus hugging
several grocery bags. She had worked all day. I ran to her, took
the two largest bags and carried them inside, asking if we were
having turkey and ham. No, she had bought ``two roasting hens.''
But hens are chicken, I said, knowing full well that these two
small birds would not feed seven hungry people.
 &HT;    Seeing my disappointment, my mother reassured me that we also
would have collard greens, yams, green beans, potato salad, corn
bread and sweet potato pie for our Thanksgiving meal. But for
supper that night, we had rice and flour bread that we used to sop
up the juice from neckbones. I noticed that mother did not eat.
Asked why, she said that her stomach was upset.
 &HT;    On Thanksgiving morning, we had flour bread and cane syrup and
powdered milk for breakfast. Again, my mother did not eat. After I
finished washing dishes, I joined my brothers and sisters in the
courtyard while my mother began to prepare our meal.
 &HT;    Occasionally, I would pretend to use the bathroom so that I
could take a peek at the food. I was thinking of my grandparents in
Crescent City and the turkey and ham feast that they would have. I
wanted to be with them.
 &HT;    Once, as I came out of the bathroom, my mother asked me to baste
the hens while she peeled potatoes. Using a large spoon, I dipped
drippings from the bottom of the roasting pan and poured it evenly
over the birds. Before long, I was enjoying myself. Apparently
noticing the change in me, my mother asked me to wash the collards.
I dumped them into a sink of cold water, where I swished them
around. Then I cut them thinly and put them into a pot of boiling
water and smoked neckbones.
 &HT;    Next, I snapped beans and put them into a pot. Mother told me
that I was a good cook. From that point on, I moved from task to
task without being told. It was giving me real pleasure and I felt,
too, that I was making a difference.
 &HT;    After everything was done, I told my mother not to set the table
until I returned from the grocery store near the apartment. With
part of the money my grandmother had given to me, I bought two cans
of cranberry sauce. Mother was surprised and grateful.
 &HT;    Setting the table, I was proud of the brown, juicy hens. Mother
told me that, since I was the man of the house, I could carve the
meat and serve the plates.
 &HT;    Seeing that my mother had not set a plate for herself, I removed
mine from the table. I was catching on: Mother had not eaten supper
and breakfast so that the children would have enough to eat. She
was waiting until they had finished Thanksgiving dinner before she
ate. After we said grace, my brothers and sisters ate with relish,
each taking several slices of cranberry sauce. Each took a big
helping of collards, which I had cooked, and each seemed to enjoy
my stringed beans.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Even as a child, I was the family cynic. And nothing brought out
the Diogenes in me more than Thanksgiving. What, I used to ask,
were we _ our mother and my five siblings _ to be thankful for?
After all, as black people in the South, we did not count for much
in the eyes of white people and even fellow blacks.
 &HT;    Sometimes, I thought that God had abandoned us. Our father ran
off for good when I, the oldest, was 10 years old. We never had
enough money and lived in a two-bedroom, run-down apartment in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. Weekdays, my mother cleaned hotel rooms; weekends
she picked vegetables.
 &HT;    We rarely had new school clothes, almost everything coming from
`used' shops. We did not own a car. And we never had enough food _
which caused my mother more shame than anything else.
 &HT;    What did we have to be thankful for?
 &HT;    When I was 14, I finally learned that we had much to be thankful
for. I had been living for three years with grandparents in
Crescent City, Fla., because my mother simply could not support all
of us. In Crescent City, I had everything _ delicious food, new
clothes, my own bedroom, a new bicycle, books and all of the Nehi
grape soda I could drink.
 &HT;    In 1959, my mother asked me to return to Fort Lauderdale to
celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of the family. Always the
traveler, I caught the Greyhound bus the day before Thanksgiving.
 &HT;    The family lived in the same cramped apartment, and when I saw
the grime and smelled the stench of the trash cans behind the
complex, that old feeling of hopelessness and anger returned. I did
not want to be there for Thanksgiving.
 &HT;    What did my mother and the other children have for which they
should be thankful?
 &HT;    I was in the courtyard when my mother got off the bus hugging
several grocery bags. She had worked all day. I ran to her, took
the two largest bags and carried them inside, asking if we were
having turkey and ham. No, she had bought ``two roasting hens.''
But hens are chicken, I said, knowing full well that these two
small birds would not feed seven hungry people.
 &HT;    Seeing my disappointment, my mother reassured me that we also
would have collard greens, yams, green beans, potato salad, corn
bread and sweet potato pie for our Thanksgiving meal. But for
supper that night, we had rice and flour bread that we used to sop
up the juice from neckbones. I noticed that mother did not eat.
Asked why, she said that her stomach was upset.
 &HT;    On Thanksgiving morning, we had flour bread and cane syrup and
powdered milk for breakfast. Again, my mother did not eat. After I
finished washing dishes, I joined my brothers and sisters in the
courtyard while my mother began to prepare our meal.
 &HT;    Occasionally, I would pretend to use the bathroom so that I
could take a peek at the food. I was thinking of my grandparents in
Crescent City and the turkey and ham feast that they would have. I
wanted to be with them.
 &HT;    Once, as I came out of the bathroom, my mother asked me to baste
the hens while she peeled potatoes. Using a large spoon, I dipped
drippings from the bottom of the roasting pan and poured it evenly
over the birds. Before long, I was enjoying myself. Apparently
noticing the change in me, my mother asked me to wash the collards.
I dumped them into a sink of cold water, where I swished them
around. Then I cut them thinly and put them into a pot of boiling
water and smoked neckbones.
 &HT;    Next, I snapped beans and put them into a pot. Mother told me
that I was a good cook. From that point on, I moved from task to
task without being told. It was giving me real pleasure and I felt,
too, that I was making a difference.
 &HT;    After everything was done, I told my mother not to set the table
until I returned from the grocery store near the apartment. With
part of the money my grandmother had given to me, I bought two cans
of cranberry sauce. Mother was surprised and grateful.
 &HT;    Setting the table, I was proud of the brown, juicy hens. Mother
told me that, since I was the man of the house, I could carve the
meat and serve the plates.
 &HT;    Seeing that my mother had not set a plate for herself, I removed
mine from the table. I was catching on: Mother had not eaten supper
and breakfast so that the children would have enough to eat. She
was waiting until they had finished Thanksgiving dinner before she
ate. After we said grace, my brothers and sisters ate with relish,
each taking several slices of cranberry sauce. Each took a big
helping of collards, which I had cooked, and each seemed to enjoy
my stringed beans.
 &HT;    I was surprised that the children left two pieces of hen _ a
breast and a drumstick. My mother offered me the breast because it
was my favorite. I insisted, though, that she eat it because it was
bigger than the drumstick. She did not argue, and we sat down to
the best Thanksgiving dinner I have ever had.
 &HT;    I knew that I was fortunate to have a mother who worked hard and
sacrificed for us. I have appreciated the essence of our most
American holiday ever since.

THANKSGIVING: INDIANS MUST FIGHT FOR THEIR PLACE AT THE TABLE

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Ah, Thanksgiving. Time once again for all good Americans to kick
back with the family, have a little turkey, and give thanks for the
NFL, four-day weekends, and Manifest Destiny.
 &HT;    It is also time once again to open the mythical family album and
cast our collective gaze upon our forebears, those who brought us
the First Thanksgiving nearly 400 years ago, with all the Pilgrims
and Indians peacefully seated around the table, engaged in a joyous
and mutually salutary feast.
 &HT;    This portrait of a benign birth of America is engraved in the
minds of citizens at an early age, with the rather unpalatable
images of native genocide, black slavery, large-scale land theft,
and gender oppression against women conveniently airbrushed out.
 &HT;    I am fascinated with the staying power of the Thanksgiving myth.
Every year, primary school children around the nation re-enact the
pageantry of this seminal moment in American history. A myriad of
greeting cards and kitsch ceramic Pilgrim and Indian figurines are
sold and displayed as reminders of that grand event. While the
narratives of much younger American holidays like Labor Day and
Veteran's Day recede in the collective conscience, the imprint of
the Thanksgiving story remains strong.
 &HT;    Though fascinated, I am not mystified by this. It is clear to me
why this narrative stays in place. Like every creation story, it
puts the world in an orderly manner.
 &HT;    In the story of Thanksgiving, the Pilgrims are placed at the
center of God's grace and privilege. It is the Pilgrims who express
gratitude to their God for the bounty placed before them.
Ironically, the Indians _ the native people of the land _ are
marginalized by this story. They are at best the guests of the
Pilgrims, and at worst a part of the bounty itself.
 &HT;    The myth is critical for inscribing the cultural templates that
continue to dictate social roles today. One is either The Chosen or
The Other. Fortunate Pilgrim or tragic Indian. Meritorious
candidate or affirmative action hire. Citizen or alien. Despite our
multicultural society, there is no room for any other roles; this
was established in the beginning.
 &HT;    Beyond that, the Thanksgiving fable serves as a necessary salve
when confronted with the actual bloodiness of the founding of
America. It is important for Americans to believe that despite all
the gore, there was a moment in history when the Pilgrims
(oppressed in their own right by religious intolerance in Europe)
sat down in peaceful co-existence with the natives (perhaps naive
in their generosity) and gave thanks together.
 &HT;    From a native perspective, it seems that if that sublime moment
ever existed, it has been downhill for us ever since. And I say
that not only for Native Americans who today suffer the highest
rates of poverty and massive underrepresentation in positions of
power, but for all those who have been categorized as ``Other'' in
America's grand scheme.
 &HT;    Still, there are subversive ways to read this story. While for
much of mainstream America, the Thanksgiving myth re-inscribes a
position of power, for others of us it serves as a reminder: we
cannot stop fighting for our place at the table.

 &HT;    Like everyone of my generation or older, I celebrated
Thanksgiving in the classrooms of the public school. We made
costumes out of construction paper, using crayons out of a bucket
of broken stubs to decorate, paste out of huge cannisters to hold
the pieces together. We playacted a meeting between the Pilgrims
and the Indians. We called the corn ``maize'' and we carved the
pumpkins into jack-o-lanterns.
 &HT;    Children could feel that most adults, too, shared the
excitement. The seasons changed, the clocks were turned back, and
the leaves started to fall. The Salvation Army Santa Clauses began
to ring their bells outside stores. The Christmas shows commenced
their appearance on television.
 &HT;    Twenty-five years later, I sense that the quaint innocence of
that scene already contained messages about multi-culturalism. But
they weren't quite understood.
 &HT;    I grew up in the Detroit suburbs, shortly after the riots that
propelled ``white flight'' progressively farther into land where
maize and pumpkins had actually been grown.
 &HT;    At my elementary school, there was not a single African American
person: no students, no teachers, and no administrators. Until my
younger brothers turned up, I was about the only person of color.
There were no Native Americans. There were no Hispanics. There were
only a few Catholics and no Jews.
 &HT;    Perhaps my family was typical of immigrants. We tried to copy
what our neighbors did.
 &HT;    We sought to have the same public displays around the holiday
season: if they strung up twinkling lights next door, we'd visit
the hardware store and then stand outside our home struggling to
connect the extension cords together, too. But somehow, the very
public nature of the good cheer made it all the stranger and more
difficult to understand.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving was especially odd, because it is at once less
religious but more American than Christmas. It is invested with
symbolism about what it means to be a citizen.
 &HT;    Like Columbus Day, Thanksgiving has become controversial because
it is a ritual about the New World becoming European and
`civilized.' We re-enact a script that emphasizes two groups coming
into contact as equals, but we know from the subsequent events that
the encounter worked out well for the Pilgrims only.
 &HT;    So I wonder, when I was dressed up for Thanksgiving _ I forget
which role _ whether anyone noticed the lone pair of Oriental eyes
among the white faces. Or if today, as the thousands of
schoolchildren _ whose parents brought them from all over Asia _
become Pilgrims, anyone wonders how they are there.
 &HT;    Now, I make my living as a teacher, lawyer, and writer pointing
out these uncomfortable facts. And though I mean to change the
spirit of Thanksgiving, it is not my intention to ruin it.
 &HT;    It is important for all of us who have the opportunity to enjoy
turkey and cranberry sauce to reflect on the amenities of life that
we take for granted. We have much to be thankful for. That we are
Americans. That we possess civil rights. That we may participate in
shaping our future.
 &HT;    To be thankful requires that we be aware of these advantages and
their implications. That others are not Americans. That others lack
civil rights. That they might not participate in shaping their
future.
 &HT;    So, merely to be thankful is not enough.

spirit of Thanksgiving, it is not my intention to ruin it.
 &HT;    It is important for all of us who have the opportunity to enjoy
turkey and cranberry sauce to reflect on the amenities of life that
we take for granted. We have much to be thankful for. That we are
Americans. That we possess civil rights. That we may participate in
shaping our future.
 &HT;    To be thankful requires that we be aware of these advantages and
their implications. That others are not Americans. That others lack
civil rights. That they might not participate in shaping their
future.
 &HT;    So, merely to be thankful is not enough.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    When I was a child in the 1940s and '50s, Thanksgiving signified
Pilgrims and feathers. At school we cut out Pilgrim hats and
re-enacted the First Thanksgiving Dinner. The Pilgrims were paper
heroes; the Indians were copper-toned, featherered, and happy
helpers.
 &HT;    When I grew up, in the 1960s, I began to understand the
impossibility of Europeans ``discovering'' an already inhabited
land. As Dick Gregory famously quipped, ``Hey man, I just
discovered this Cadillac sitting by the curb.''
 &HT;    I began to learn more about just who had owned the Cadillac. I
discovered that helpful Squanto himself was captured by an English
sea captain and sold into slavery in Spain, where he lived for
years before working his way back to his native land, only to
discover that all the members of his tribe, the Patuxet, were wiped
out by epidemics. This, just before the First Thanksgiving.
 &HT;    And I learned that Lord Jeffrey Amherst, after whom the
illustrious college town in Massachusetts is named, deliberately
gave smallpox-infested blankets and handkerchiefs to Shawnee,
Delaware and Mingo people.
 &HT;    I got it.
 &HT;    Which meant I could no longer commemorate a day that marked the
beginning of the end _ literally _ for Native Americans _ who
shrank from about 10 million people, pre-Columbus, to 250,000 by
the late 19th century.
 &HT;    I spent a decade boycotting Thanksgiving. I wasn't going to
participate in this cover-up, this celebration of genocide.
 &HT;    Then, for several years, I deigned to join my family for the day
_ but insisted on reading angry Indian poetry (``Off my land, white
man!'') before the meal to the properly chagrined assemblage.
 &HT;    By the late '70s, I relented. By this time I was a vegetarian;
my ever-accommodating family began to include quiche at our holiday
feasts. We served dinners to homeless people; we gave away baskets
of food.
 &HT;    During the '80s I waffled. Some years I was on, some years off.
Thanksgiving, that is.
 &HT;    Now, I celebrate the day with family and close friends, eating
the traditional turkey meal, with cranberries and pumpkin pies.
 &HT;    I seem to have come full circle. But it's a circle that includes
more perspectives: the Pilgrims aren't heroes, and they were
fleeing their own persecution; Thanksgiving is still commemorated
as a day of mourning by many Native Americans; and it's not
betrayal to use the day, so appropriate at this time of darkening
sky, to nurture each other. And to reflect.
 &HT;    Building on our Thanksgiving tradition of gathering together,
drawing close into the fertile night, and giving thanks, perhaps we
can take a tip from the Million Man March (or, for that matter, Yom
Kippur) and transform the holiday into a national day of atonement
and reconciliation, as well as a day of gratitude.
 &HT;    We might create our own version of South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission: acknowledge the land-grab, grieve for
those who lost the war, and repent. We could stimulate a public
dialogue, with space to tell the story, in all its details, from
all its perspectives: opening and healing these old wounds.
 &HT;    The United States has a dynamic culture; we often absorb new
content into old forms. Other holidays, like Halloween, have
evolved: Halloween started as a day to honor the dead. And some
rituals are newly created: Kwaanza was initiated by Ron Karenga
just a few decades ago.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving itself has not even had a clear path from that
``first'' one in 1621. That feast was a one-time event, resurrected
briefly in 1676 by the Governing Council of Charlestown, Mass., who
proclaimed June 29 as a day of Thanksgiving to God for destroying
``our Enemies ... the Heathen Natives of this land.''
 &HT;    Then Thanksgiving languished until George Washington proposed a
Thanksgiving day to celebrate the establishment of the new nation.
(Thomas Jefferson nixed it as ``the most ridiculous idea I ever
heard.'')
 &HT;    Finally, President Lincoln revived the custom in 1863, and in
1941 Congress decreed the holiday be celebrated on the fourth
Thursday in November.
 &HT;    And so, this year, at my home, we will celebrate our blessings.
We will have some turkey. (Organic, of course. Free-range and
farm-fed with only the purest ingredients; plus weekly massage and
therapy.)
 &HT;    We will sit, on Thanksgiving Day, amongst a few old friends who
have gathered together for most of a decade. Our dishes will
include raw vegetables for the Vegans among us ... as well as
marshmallow toppings for the sugar lovers. And we'll say a prayer
that acknowledges our full history: its generosity to some, its
iniquities to others. We'll conclude with thanks that we, the
living, are here today, surrounded by people we love, enjoying the
bounty of a plentiful harvest. And we'll recommit to doing our part
to create such conditions for all.
 &HT;    That's Thanksgiving in the '90s, at my house.

Moines Register in Des Moines, Iowa.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The first Thanksgiving after I was married, I decided to show my
new mother-in-law that the foreigner her son had wed could cook a
Thanksgiving meal as memorable as any she'd had in the Bronx, N.Y.
 &HT;    No ordinary turkey for this meal, I decided. Only lobster would
do.
 &HT;    Of course, only a foreigner could make such a miscalculation. My
mother-in-law, who had already put up with her only child
vacationing in India, marrying a bride who wore a red sari rather
than a white gown and one who regularly mispronounced cavatelli,
responded as graciously as she could to the news. I'm sure it was
not lost on her, however, that her new daughter-in-law thought
nothing of dispensing with centuries-old tradition on the most
original of American holidays.
 &HT;    The meal was a disaster.
 &HT;    I bought the lobsters live the day before, and stored them in
the bathtub, where, by evening, they were dead. Lobsters have to be
alive before you cook them, and they don't survive in water that is
not aerated. I learned that a little too late.
 &HT;    There was a message in this, I am certain: Tradition does not
let you go quite so easily. Try as you might to defy it, it finds
its way back into your life.
 &HT;    In retrospect, I've realized there was also a message in my
trying to bend the rules: I was subconsciously setting myself
apart.
 &HT;    As an Indian child growing up in America, tradition around
holidays was a complicated thing. There were few traditions that
really belonged to us. We'd hardly lived as a family in India, and
my parents had been away from home long enough that they'd long
since given up celebrating Indian holidays. Complicating everything
was the fact that most Indian holidays are religious anyway, and
they didn't share the same religion.
 &HT;    But I loved all holidays _ anything, in fact, that involved good
food and gift-giving. The part of me that wanted to be just like
everyone else longed to celebrate Thanksgiving, Christmas and
Easter as much as my American friends.
 &HT;    We went through the rituals at friends' homes, grateful to be
included, but not really feeling we had the right to celebrate them
on our own. By the time I was in high school, however, Thanksgiving
had become our family's holiday. The people whose homes we used to
go to now came to ours instead. I think they found some special
meaning in celebrating that quintessential of American holidays in
a non-American home. And we took some special pleasure in being
able to host it.
 &HT;    If I had to isolate a single point at which my whole family went
from being outsiders to really feeling like we belonged, it was
around these Thanksgiving dinners. Somewhere along the line, we
stopped just going through the motions and the celebration became
real.
 &HT;    I don't mean we were suddenly identifying with the Pilgrims as
they landed at Plymouth rock. But we felt we had permission to
celebrate, among friends and family, even if it wasn't our history.
 &HT;    We'd all converge at our country home in Woodstock, N.Y. for the
weekend. My father would cook an enormous turkey and a plethora of
gourmet side dishes. There'd be pate, watercress and endive salad,
corn pudding, herring, champagne and, of course, all the usual fare
of Thanksgiving dinner. He would even reach beyond Thanksgiving
tradition to add his own special touches, like notes written to
each member of the party and tucked under our dinner plates saying
why he was thankful for each of us.
 &HT;    In the early years of married life, with an Italian-American
husband and American children, I thumbed my nose at convention and
fixed the dinners my own way. If it wasn't lobster, it would be
goose. But as my children grow, they've become the sticklers for
tradition, bringing me back on track to how it's supposed to be
done _ bringing me back to turkey.
 &HT;    Not that tradition can't be expanded upon. I still throw in an
Indian dish here, an Italian one there. And so, I've made my peace
with Thanksgiving dinner.
 &HT;    But now a new problem has arisen. My 12-year-old son has become
a vegetarian. Ironically I, the Indian, am not one. The Vegetarian
Times magazines are piling up, with helpful suggestions on how to
do Thanksgiving dinner without meat.
 &HT;    So, this year it's my son wanting me to break the rules.
 &HT;    We've come full cycle, it seems.

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    When we speak of slavery, and of the slaves who escaped it, we
often talk about the Underground Railroad.
 &HT;    We forget to mention the runaway slaves taking paths to Native
American villages where black men and women found friendship and
refuge. Yet this often happened in the early days of our country,
and the offspring of black-and-Indian marriages shaped the early
days of fur trade and the alliances formed to fight the military in
frontier fights.
 &HT;    This Thanksgiving and on American Indian Day, Nov. 27,
African-Americans should pay homage to their Native American
heritage.
 &HT;    I will.
 &HT;    From memory, I can still see that giant, black and white
portrait of the woman with the waist-length black hair and the
smooth caramel complexion.
 &HT;    ``That was my grandmama and your great-grandmama. She was
Indian,'' my mother told me.
 &HT;    I later learned that my mother's ancestors were Cherokee from
North Carolina. ``She was the only person who ever loved me,'' Mom
says of her grandmother.
 &HT;    Her grandmother Sarah, who usually kept her hair pulled back in
a bun, mother said, married a freed black man named Dave Lane and
had five daughters. One of them, my mother's mom, died at age 16 _
six months after my mother was born.
 &HT;    Two years ago, when my daughter KJ did a family genealogy report
for school, she discovered sparse information about the early North
Carolina settlers.
 &HT;    Since Alex Haley's ``Roots,'' more and more of us are searching
for who we really are. But that search was mostly for African roots
for black Americans. William Loren Katz's book, ``Black Indians: A
Hidden Heritage'' explains why:
 &HT;    ``When black Americans have pursued their genealogy, they have
focused on their African roots and sought a meaningful black
heritage. Children of the black awareness of the 1960s have rarely
cared to mention an Indian ancestry because this might be seen as a
denial of their African origins and the value of blackness. All
this is part of the racial nightmare we have inherited.''
 &HT;    If the racial nightmare ever ends, it has to start with each of
us. Those of us who're looking into our Native American heritage
are not trying to avoid being called African-Americans.
 &HT;    Discovering who we are is as important to us as it was to the
family who recently got DNA test confirmation that Thomas Jefferson
fathered a child by his longtime slave, Sally Hemings.
 &HT;    But the records of these marriages between blacks and Native
Americans don't always disclose information about the Native
American ethnicity.
 &HT;    Alice Kehoe, the Marquette University professor who specializes
in Native American issues, said, ``They had to keep quiet about
what they were because the government wanted the Native Americans
to go to the reservation.''
 &HT;    Kehoe, who's written a textbook, ``North American Indians'' with
a chapter on black Indians, said the Native Americans mixed with
people of color after the Indians were segregated from whites. The
story isn't all positive, she said. The complications were that the
Cherokees bought black slaves. Some of them were well-to-do
plantation owners, but then there were other Cherokees who provided
refuge for runaways.
 &HT;    Perhaps, someday we will speak of these people who provided
refuge for runaways. Someday, when we learn all of our history.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Each Thanksgiving I see myself aboard a train, heading home from
college.
 &HT;    Leaning my forehead against the window, I watch Illinois fields
rush to meet a Wisconsin prairie. Forgotten pumpkins, round as a
rising moon, colorfully dot the gray ground _ while the slate sky
shakes loose a flurry of snowflakes. A freshman, I feel light-years
older than I did when I left for school; surely my parents will
notice the difference. As the train pulls into the depot, I spot
them standing on the platform.
 &HT;    I remember other earlier years and Thanksgivings, riding in the
back seat of the car on the way to our grandparents' house in
another city.
 &HT;    Are we there yet? How much longer? As the car pulls into the
drive, our cousins rush out to meet us.
 &HT;    Or I recall my children's youth: When I pack boots, the weather
turns springlike. When I forget, blizzards stall cars and send
others spinning into ditches. Arriving close to midnight on the eve
of Thanksgiving, we carry sleeping children into the welcoming
house where their grandparents are still up.
 &HT;    We take a journey each Thanksgiving, not only to where a table
waits for us, but to Thanksgivings past. Retracing our steps, we
travel an inner road, discovering who we once were, reaching who we
are.
 &HT;    When Mother was little, she and her family would ride into town
to share Thanksgiving with Aunt Claudine. She wanted to join the
camaraderie at the festive table, but her aunt relegated the
children to a table in another room. I still hear disappointment in
Mother's voice as she retells the story each year. (Years later,
she would give up her dining-room seat to one of her grandchildren
if there was not enough room round the family table.)
 &HT;    My mother-in-law, in her younger days and when she was home from
college, used to help her father pick watercress in a cold stream
for Thanksgiving Day's feast. What was gathered more than six
decades ago is remembered at our table today.
 &HT;    This year, our daughter will miss our family Thanksgiving to
visit her friend and his family in Boston.
 &HT;    My father and father-in-law are now forever absent. And so is my
sister.
 &HT;    As youngsters, she and I would color while sprawled on the
living room floor at our grandparent's house _ where even then,
thanks to radio, football permeated the air almost as much as the
aroma of roasting turkey.
 &HT;    With the quilt of family covering us, we slept on our way home.
Back then, we didn't worry about fitting in; we just did _ always
with a place at the table.
 &HT;    A few years later, when I tried squeezing back into my old youth
chair in the attic, I became aware of how much I had changed.
 &HT;    When I arrived home as a college freshman, I sensed another new
self, yet I easily slipped back into ``a highchair'' of old habits,
allowing clothes to spill over my bedroom chair, disappearing when
dirty dishes piled up in the sink.
 &HT;    Imperfection, however, isn't what we usually recall when past
Thanksgivings roll down the track for an annual review: It's the
perfection of faded memory _ like the image I have of my parents
sending me back to college after Thanksgiving vacation.
 &HT;    Waiting on the platform, the three of us huddled close against
the cold. How I wished the train wouldn't arrive, just as I wished
Sunday afternoon hadn't.
 &HT;    ``If we never said goodbye, we couldn't say hello,'' said
Mother, trying to cheer me.
 &HT;    ``Christmas will be here before you know it,'' Dad said.
 &HT;    The train whistled and thundered near. After I hugged my
parents, Dad pressed a $10 bill into my hand.
 &HT;    ``Here's a little something,'' he said, ``just in case.''
 &HT;    Later, from the window, I watched my parents grow smaller as the
train pulled me faster and faster into my future.

 By RAOUL LOWERY CONTRERAS 
 &HT;    (Raoul Lowery Contreras, Mexican American, is a columnist and
editorial board member of La Prensa San Diego. He hosts his own
radio talk show on KOGO-AM.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    They are the wiliest creatures in the forests that range from
Canada in the north to Central America in the south. With an
explosion of sound, they burst from the ground into the air
startling anyone in the vicinity. We are surprised, but we know
about them, the wild turkeys.
 &HT;    Imagine what the first Europeans who saw them in Massachusetts
thought as the wild turkeys flew circles around those
blunderbuss-carrying men, blunderbusses that couldn't hit anything
except maybe by accident. There were no rifles and the shotgun,
though a direct descendent of the blunderbuss, hadn't been
perfected for accuracy.
 &HT;    Unlike the British settlers who had landed at Plymouth Rock in
1620, the Spanish were far more fortunate when they landed in
Mexico in 1519, for the Mexican turkey _ guajolote (pronounced
wah-hoh-loh-teh) _ was big, fat and totally domesticated, raised
from egg to feast purposefully by the Meso-American Indians to eat.
They were herded in flocks, communal and filial, and were the
opposite of their more northern cousins who led the Pilgrims deeper
and deeper into the forests. The Pilgrims thought they were some
sort of partridge as they were used to in England, but they
weren't, of course. They were also bigger and faster than
partridges _ and, everywhere.
 &HT;    In England, the Pilgrims couldn't hunt because in most cases the
lands were owned by nobility. If they dared to do so and were
caught in the act, they were accused of poaching and subject to
prison. In America, millions, perhaps billions, of acres of land
lay before the Pilgrims, as did millions of wild turkeys, neither
of which were owned by anyone, except those they called ``savage''
natives.
 &HT;    The Pilgrims, however, didn't know how to hunt, nor what to
plant in the flinty soil of their new home. They didn't even know
what was edible in the trees or bushes around them. Certainly, they
must have been befuddled by the explosive bird with a blood red
neck that made strange noises and silently ran like the wind on the
ground and launched themselves, as a last resort, from that run
with a startling explosion of noise.
 &HT;    In Mexico, the opposite was true. The Spanish were handed cooked
turkey by their Indian `friends,' the ones who flocked to the
Spanish 200-man army of Hernando Cortez that wondrous year of 1519,
about a hundred years before the Pilgrims came to Massachusetts
from Holland and England. They flocked to the Spanish to join in on
the war against their oppressors, the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan,
rulers of many, many Indians throughout the Mexican highlands.
Where there were many, many Indians, there were many, many turkeys.
The Spanish had made one of the world's most important discoveries,
the domesticated turkey.
 &HT;    They weren't as large as today's scientifically bred versions
found by the millions in our supermarkets, nor as meaty, but they
were everywhere and took little effort to prepare into meals. The
Spanish didn't have to chase the birds, nor even shoot them, for
even then, the domesticated turkeys were dumber than their wild
cousins.
 &HT;    Did I forget to mention how smart the wild turkey is and was?
Hunting them today takes patience, smarts, good camouflage
clothing, handmade calls to imitate the hens looking for mates and
a good experienced eye. For non-hunters, however, it is easy:
America has taken what Benjamin Franklin wanted to be the national
bird, the turkey, and turned it into an entire industry. Turkey
farming has produced so many turkeys in America that they are now
exported to Mexico, their original home.
 &HT;    They are also exported as turkey bologna, salami, ham, pastrami
and good giant breasted white meated birds that are totally
delicious. The American turkey producers have worked wonders with
their bird and created a year-round industry worth hundreds of
millions of dollars.
 &HT;    The Pilgrims nearly starved despite more turkeys than they could
count in the forests around them; they nearly starved because they
didn't know what maize was, though the Spanish were flooding Europe
and Africa with what would become the world's most eaten product,
corn, a product of the Valley of Mexico. Peru's contribution, the
potato, was also introduced. The Pilgrims nearly starved in
Massachusetts until the Indians, much to their later chagrin,
showed them how to grow corn, how to hunt and cook turkeys and how
to find and pick cranberries. Today's Thanksgiving dinner, if you
will.
 &HT;    The Spanish were more fortunate. No bitter winters in Mexico.
Food? They were surrounded by dozens of tropical foods such as
pineapples, avocados, mangoes, papayas and berries of all kinds;
there was corn, there were turkeys, there were `mariscos'
(seafood): fish, oysters, clams. But, turkey was the perfect dish
for Spanish tastes. It was a delight to them. They gave the bird a
new Spanish name: pavo.
 &HT;    But pavo is such a boring, European word for such an exciting
Meso-American and American bird. The Indians had their own name for
it and it wasn't and isn't a boring turkey. G-U-A-J-O-L-O-T-E. Sure
has a ring to it, doesn't it, pilgrim?

 &HT;    
 &HT;    They are the wiliest creatures in the forests that range from
Canada in the north to Central America in the south. With an
explosion of sound, they burst from the ground into the air
startling anyone in the vicinity. We are surprised, but we know
about them, the wild turkeys.
 &HT;    Imagine what the first Europeans who saw them in Massachusetts
thought as the wild turkeys flew circles around those
blunderbuss-carrying men, blunderbusses that couldn't hit anything
except maybe by accident. There were no rifles and the shotgun,
though a direct descendent of the blunderbuss, hadn't been
perfected for accuracy.
 &HT;    Unlike the British settlers who had landed at Plymouth Rock in
1620, the Spanish were far more fortunate when they landed in
Mexico in 1519, for the Mexican turkey _ guajolote (pronounced
wah-hoh-loh-teh) _ was big, fat and totally domesticated, raised
from egg to feast purposefully by the Meso-American Indians to eat.
They were herded in flocks, communal and filial, and were the
opposite of their more northern cousins who led the Pilgrims deeper
and deeper into the forests. The Pilgrims thought they were some
sort of partridge as they were used to in England, but they
weren't, of course. They were also bigger and faster than
partridges _ and, everywhere.
 &HT;    In England, the Pilgrims couldn't hunt because in most cases the
lands were owned by nobility. If they dared to do so and were
caught in the act, they were accused of poaching and subject to
prison. In America, millions, perhaps billions, of acres of land
lay before the Pilgrims, as did millions of wild turkeys, neither
of which were owned by anyone, except those they called ``savage''
natives.
 &HT;    The Pilgrims, however, didn't know how to hunt, nor what to
plant in the flinty soil of their new home. They didn't even know
what was edible in the trees or bushes around them. Certainly, they
must have been befuddled by the explosive bird with a blood red
neck that made strange noises and silently ran like the wind on the
ground and launched themselves, as a last resort, from that run
with a startling explosion of noise.
 &HT;    In Mexico, the opposite was true. The Spanish were handed cooked
turkey by their Indian `friends,' the ones who flocked to the
Spanish 200-man army of Hernando Cortez that wondrous year of 1519,
about a hundred years before the Pilgrims came to Massachusetts
from Holland and England. They flocked to the Spanish to join in on
the war against their oppressors, the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan,
rulers of many, many Indians throughout the Mexican highlands.
Where there were many, many Indians, there were many, many turkeys.
The Spanish had made one of the world's most important discoveries,
the domesticated turkey.
 &HT;    They weren't as large as today's scientifically bred versions
found by the millions in our supermarkets, nor as meaty, but they
were everywhere and took little effort to prepare into meals. The
Spanish didn't have to chase the birds, nor even shoot them, for
even then, the domesticated turkeys were dumber than their wild
cousins.
 &HT;    Did I forget to mention how smart the wild turkey is and was?
Hunting them today takes patience, smarts, good camouflage
clothing, handmade calls to imitate the hens looking for mates and
a good experienced eye. For non-hunters, however, it is easy:

 &HT;    (Tim Giago, Lakota Indian, is publisher and editor-in-chief of
Indian Country Today. His Indian name is Nanwica Kciji.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I believe Thanksgiving Day is a holiday one grows into as a
child. It is a holiday when children went ``over the river and
through the woods'' to grandmother's house.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving is a day when old family traditions are renewed and
sumptuous meals of turkey, ham and cranberries are served; where
pumpkin pies are topped with whipped cream.
 &HT;    It is a day one learns to appreciate as a child and then its
continuation as an adult becomes a part of family tradition.
 &HT;    Thousands of Indian children never had the opportunity to grow
into this holiday as a family event. Many of us spent our
Thanksgiving Days at Bureau-of-Indian-Affairs or Indian-mission
boarding schools. We did not have our families surrounding us on
this holiday.
 &HT;    In the late 1800s, the federal government and the many churches
in America collaborated to build boarding schools and Indian
missions on, near or far away from the Indian reservations.
Children were placed in these schools from about age 6 and were
there nine months out of the year.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving Day meant something different to these boarders. To
me it meant I got to sleep until 7:00 a.m. instead of being rousted
out of my bunk at 6:00 a.m. It meant that instead of getting our
usual fare of yellow mush, we were served crisp, tasty corn flakes
for breakfast.
 &HT;    On all other days, except Sunday, we were awakened at 6:00 a.m.
by a prefect _ usually a white man studying for the priesthood _
with a large, hand-held bell. He would walk up and down the aisles
of the dormitory clanging the bell. If you turned over and pulled
the pillow over your head, he would stand at your bed and clang the
bell until you jumped out.
 &HT;    Once out of bed, we rushed to the long row of wash basins filled
with ice-cold water. We washed our faces, brushed our teeth _
shivering in the morning cold _ and got dressed for the
early-morning mass we attended every morning of the week.
 &HT;    After church we marched to the dining hall, took our places in
company ranks at the breakfast tables and said grace while keeping
a baleful eye on the stack of bread in the center of the table.
Before the ``Amen'' faded away, we dived at the bread like starving
prisoners and, if we were lucky, came away with a slice or two.
Some of the older boys chose locations around the furnace in the
center of the dining hall, placed their slices of bread on top, and
waited for it to toast. Each boy was allotted one cube of salty
butter. We often used this butter as bargaining chips. ``Give you
my butter for a whole week for some of that chokecherry jam.''
 &HT;    Some of the smaller and weaker kids never tasted butter the
entire school year. Of course, we could always count on our daily
bowl of yellow mush. We mission boys often saw hand-painted signs
outside different gymnasiums when we traveled to other schools to
play basketball. They read, ``Crush the Mush.''
 &HT;    I suppose, thinking back on it, I never really placed a
historical context in my heart for Thanksgiving. I, as all of the
other boys and girls at the boarding schools, sat in the classroom
and heard the story of the first Thanksgiving; about how the
Pilgrims and the Indians celebrated a feast to mark the first year
in this land the visitors called the New World.
 &HT;    Many years ago I heard a Caddo Indian woman speak to an audience
about her daughter coming home in tears the day before
Thanksgiving. She said, ``Mom, these kids dressed up like Indians.
They put cardboard feathers in their hair and then they danced
around and made war whoops. Why are they making fun of us?''
 &HT;    It wasn't until I left the Indian mission and got out into the
real world that I researched the conclusion to the Thanksgiving
story. I read about the mistreatment and the eventual annihilation
of the Indians who brought the first Thanksgiving to the Pilgrims.
I read about the religious intolerance practiced by the Pilgrims
and of a village of more than 300, peaceful, Christian Indians
slaughtered _ to a man _ by white Christians angry over the death
of one of their own at the hands of one lone Indian.
 &HT;    Thinking back to my childhood, I suppose my most cherished
memory of Thanksgiving is that it was one of the few days in the
year at the boarding school when we were served a delicious meal.
Instead of our usual fare of boiled meat and boiled potatoes, we
had turkey with all of the trimmings, cranberries, pumpkin pie. We
also had a chance to take a day off from studies, sleep an extra
hour and see an extra movie that day.
 &HT;    If we had not been forcibly separated from our parents and
grandparents, we might have learned to love Thanksgiving as a day
when the family gathers to give thanks for all of the good things
in life.
 &HT;    It would have been nice to go ``over the river and through the
woods'' to grandmother's house.

 By BARBARA RENAUD GONZALEZ 
 &HT;    (Barbara Renaud Gonzalez, Mexican American, is a Dallas-based
columnist and writer for several leading Texas newspapers.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Cumbia Contest was just beginning. It was midnight on
Thanksgiving, at La Esquinita. And it was rockeando, as they say on
the eastside of Austin, Texas. And my mother wanted to dance.
 &HT;    So this is how I spent my Thanksgiving. It all began the week
before when my sixty-something proud-to-be-single Mexican mother
called me in Dallas to ask what I wanted with my turkey.
 &HT;    ``Pero, Mami, why are we having turkey?'' I demanded. We never
had turkey when we were growing up _ when I wanted to play Pilgrim
Fathers. ``No, yo quiero un plato de enchiladas con pollo, por
favor.'' (No, let's have chicken enchiladas. Please.)
 &HT;    ``No te entiendo, mijita,'' (I don't understand you, child) she
said in that superior I'm-real-Mexican-and-you-are-just-a-pocha
Spanish. ``You went to college didn't you? And that school up
north? What did you learn? I'm making pan gravy con giblets,
cornbread dressing, the green beans del monte, cranberry relish,
the potato salad too, the Jello salad with real fruit cocktail, and
the pumpkin pie. But I'll make rice and beans on the side _ if you
want. The boys want their turkey. Mira, I am making 50 dozen
tamales because I know how you love them.''
 &HT;    ``Engordan.'' I was insulted by now. ``They make me fat.''
 &HT;    ``I only use Crisco,'' she said. ``That's not fat. That's
Crisco.''
 &HT;    I still do not understand Thanksgiving. It doesn't translate
well into Spanish. When I patiently explained about the Pilgrims to
my mother after a third-grade lesson, seeking some confirmation of
our role in this event, she reminded me that every celebration has
two faces.
 &HT;    ``Vaya,'' she said. ``We don't celebrate it in Mexico ... but
I'll make a special guisado (dish) tomorrow just for you. And you
can have that Trix-are-for-kids you like for breakfast.''
 &HT;    Perhaps I realized even then that no amount of turkey would make
me belong with the Pilgrim's descendants I sat with at school.
Everyone but me seemed to have an ancestor on the Mayflower. Though
I knew _ I knew _ that the sepia skin of Texas with its sunsets
strung with a thousand pinatas embraced me, too. Especially me.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving is not a day of giving, but a taking. We are
grateful for another's tradition of generosity. One we cannot ever
hope to match. A generosity that I liken to the Mexican
guelaguetza, that celebration of community founded in an ancient
reciprocity that ensures a survival of the people. It is a ceremony
of compadrazco (godparents' role) and more. It recognizes a
solidarity that is symbolized with exchanges of the earth's bounty
which sustains us.
 &HT;    It is not a day of thanksgiving, but a commitment to each other.
That we cannot survive alone.
 &HT;    ``Since you value your Mexican heritage,'' my mother says after
our feast, ``then you'll go out dancing with me and Alma and
Graciela?''
 &HT;    I feel pale at the thought of going to a cantina with my mother
and her friends, but I only say: ``What time should I be ready?''
 &HT;    So I think, let's celebrate. That we are Americans. And give

 &HT;    (Barbara Renaud Gonzalez, Mexican American, is a Dallas-based
columnist and writer for several leading Texas newspapers.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Cumbia Contest was just beginning. It was midnight on
Thanksgiving, at La Esquinita. And it was rockeando, as they say on
the eastside of Austin, Texas. And my mother wanted to dance.
 &HT;    So this is how I spent my Thanksgiving. It all began the week
before when my sixty-something proud-to-be-single Mexican mother
called me in Dallas to ask what I wanted with my turkey.
 &HT;    ``Pero, Mami, why are we having turkey?'' I demanded. We never
had turkey when we were growing up _ when I wanted to play Pilgrim
Fathers. ``No, yo quiero un plato de enchiladas con pollo, por
favor.'' (No, let's have chicken enchiladas. Please.)
 &HT;    ``No te entiendo, mijita,'' (I don't understand you, child) she
said in that superior I'm-real-Mexican-and-you-are-just-a-pocha
Spanish. ``You went to college didn't you? And that school up
north? What did you learn? I'm making pan gravy con giblets,
cornbread dressing, the green beans del monte, cranberry relish,
the potato salad too, the Jello salad with real fruit cocktail, and
the pumpkin pie. But I'll make rice and beans on the side _ if you
want. The boys want their turkey. Mira, I am making 50 dozen
tamales because I know how you love them.''
 &HT;    ``Engordan.'' I was insulted by now. ``They make me fat.''
 &HT;    ``I only use Crisco,'' she said. ``That's not fat. That's
Crisco.''
 &HT;    I still do not understand Thanksgiving. It doesn't translate
well into Spanish. When I patiently explained about the Pilgrims to
my mother after a third-grade lesson, seeking some confirmation of
our role in this event, she reminded me that every celebration has
two faces.
 &HT;    ``Vaya,'' she said. ``We don't celebrate it in Mexico ... but
I'll make a special guisado (dish) tomorrow just for you. And you
can have that Trix-are-for-kids you like for breakfast.''
 &HT;    Perhaps I realized even then that no amount of turkey would make
me belong with the Pilgrim's descendants I sat with at school.
Everyone but me seemed to have an ancestor on the Mayflower. Though
I knew _ I knew _ that the sepia skin of Texas with its sunsets
strung with a thousand pinatas embraced me, too. Especially me.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving is not a day of giving, but a taking. We are
grateful for another's tradition of generosity. One we cannot ever
hope to match. A generosity that I liken to the Mexican
guelaguetza, that celebration of community founded in an ancient
reciprocity that ensures a survival of the people. It is a ceremony
of compadrazco (godparents' role) and more. It recognizes a
solidarity that is symbolized with exchanges of the earth's bounty
which sustains us.
 &HT;    It is not a day of thanksgiving, but a commitment to each other.
That we cannot survive alone.
 &HT;    ``Since you value your Mexican heritage,'' my mother says after
our feast, ``then you'll go out dancing with me and Alma and
Graciela?''
 &HT;    I feel pale at the thought of going to a cantina with my mother
and her friends, but I only say: ``What time should I be ready?''
 &HT;    So I think, let's celebrate. That we are Americans. And give
thanks that there is room at the table for all of us. And places to
dance.

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In recent years I have hosted Thanksgiving in my home for my
husband, father, brother and his wife, close friends from
childhood, and a newer friend whose children have become as close
as family. This ritual for the holiday began after my mother died.
 &HT;    But now, again, it has changed _ as Dad has gone, too. And so,
this year, Thanksgiving won't be the same. A former sports
commentator, his colorful quips on the football games, and his
entertaining personality capped with old fashioned values was
always a hoot and a highlight.
 &HT;    But none of the years since Mother's passing have resembled the
wonderful times we had as children when she hosted several dozen in
our home for the late afternoon feast.
 &HT;    She prepared roast turkey with mushroom gravy, wild rice
stuffing, mashed potatoes, candied yams, sauerkraut, green beans
with red bell peppers and almonds, cranberry sauce with dried
cherries and cloves, potato bread, pumpkin muffins, pumpkin
cheesecake, carrot cake, pecan pie, deep-dish caramel apple pie and
blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream.
 &HT;    I intend to keep the family tradition as strong as my mother
instituted, and my father perpetuated. As time consoles my sadness,
the love of family and good friends adds to the warm glow of Mom's
silver candelabra.
 &HT;    Even though my cooking would make Julia Child weep, I am
utilizing lessons learned from both parents: mother encouraged me
to organize; dad understood the merits of great catering. Each
taught me that Thanksgiving is the time to give thanks for the good
in our lives, to nourish both our bodies and souls, and to help
others who are less fortunate.
 &HT;    I was married on Thanksgiving Day in 1984. For the following six
years my parents helped us entertain 150 for the traditional meal.
What started out as a celebration of Thanksgiving and our wedding
anniversary, eventually turned into the party of the season. Living
in south Florida, orphans, widows, bachelors, divorcees, friends
and entire families counted on us to provide their Thanksgiving
spread. It was a great deal of work and probably grew too large.
But we had lots of fun with my parents sharing these
responsibilities.
 &HT;    It continued each Thanksgiving until mother was gone. I couldn't
host such an ambitious project without her talents, nurturing and
organizational skills. And dad was relieved when we returned to a
smaller group, a more manageable event, a meal like the ones we
enjoyed in those early years.
 &HT;    This year's Thanksgiving will combine the traditional with the
modern and involve about two dozen guests. It will be hosted as a
tribute to both of my parents, and include my family and old
friends, plus a baker's dozen of preschool children, new parents,
young grandparents, and one spirited great grandparent. We
represent several religions and nationalities, including a few
native born Hawaiians.
 &HT;    My husband, a gourmet cook, will prepare the turkey, mashed
potatoes, gravy, and rich, one-of-kind stuffing with cognac, dry
Vermouth, sausage, oysters and cream. Female guests, including my
sister-in-law, have offered to make special side dishes: peas with
Parmesan butter, baked acorn squash filled with sauteed spinach and
leek, cracked pepper biscuits and orange marmalade muffins.
 &HT;    With a little bit of luck and several instructional cookbooks
(``If you can read, you can cook,'' Mom always said), I'll attempt
a contemporary array of hors d'oeuvres such as roasted-peppers and
artichoke-heart frittatas, portobello-and-herb-filled phyllos and
orange-marinated olives.
 &HT;    Though it will be my first parentless Thanksgiving, I am
learning that a good way to fight the pain at holidays is to try
and recreate the family table with good food, family and friends.

 &HT;    ENGLAND'S PLYMOUTH WANTS TO GIVE AMERICANS THAN KS
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ While the turkey will be British and the football
round, the city from which the Mayflower embarked for the New World
wants Americans to come and feel at home for Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The port city of Plymouth is making plans for its first American
Thanksgiving Festival, complete with such exotic-sounding dishes as
succotash and pumpkin pie to complement a dinner of turkey with
cranberry sauce.
</P>
<P>
   By some counts, as many as 250,000 Americans live in the United
Kingdom, and many feel somewhat dislocated during periods of
traditional U.S. holidays such as Independence Day, Halloween and
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a full embrace by many Britons of such American
cultural icons as McDonald's, shopping malls and Homer Simpson,
there is only a vague awareness that there is any significance to
the last Thursday of November.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, part of the job for Plymouth organizers is to
explain to locals what it's all about. ``Plymouth has been slow to
recognize this part of our heritage, but we're learning and want to
be recognized as being a very American-friendly place,'' said Neill
Mitchell, chief executive of the Plymouth Chamber of Commerce.
``Local people are starting to get the hang of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The city of 257,000 has a number of historic, cultural and
business connections to the United States and Thanksgiving seemed
the perfect time to take note of these, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the departure point for 102 men, women and
children aboard the Mayflower, the port also has seen ships
embarking with such noted explorers as Francis Drake, Walter
Raleigh, Capt. William Bligh and Charles Darwin. The Mayflower
Stone and Steps, the place from which the Mayflower set sail, has
been preserved as a monument to the Pilgrims who left England to
establish a colony in Massachusetts. Many died over the winter, and
a feast of thanksgiving was held the following autumn.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   The old part of Plymouth city clusters around the Hoe, the
famous patch of turf on which Drake is said to have finished a calm
game of bowls before heading off to defeat the invading Spanish
Armada in 1588. Plymouth also was an embarkation point for U.S.
troops heading for the Normandy invasion in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1813 during one of the
unpleasant spells when Britain and its former colonies were at war.
``That's when the fleet from Plymouth was being molested in
Newfoundland by your fleet,'' Mitchell told an American reporter.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put that whole jigsaw puzzle together you begin to
see that there's quite a lot of American heritage represented
here,'' he said .
</P>
<P>
   This year's festival will be from Nov. 26-29, with a 1940s-style
big band dinner held the Friday after Thanksgiving and the arrival
at Plymouth docks of a group of NATO ships led by the American
warship the U.S.S. Stark.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the event has been given scarce attention in
Britain, it has been received warmly by Americans -- including
those back in the States -- because of a six-month old posting on
the World Wide Web, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   The American community in England, a fairly affluent bunch of
corporate executives and such, relies heavily on the Internet to
keep in touch. ``Were it not for the Internet, I'm not sure what we
would have done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   True to its American style, the celebration, much as its
namesake in the United States, will have commercial undertones.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to boosting tourism and providing exposure to
American business people in Britain, the event could help lure a
few Yankee dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``When President (Franklin) Roosevelt fixed it on the calendar,
it was clearly an effort to help extend the Christmas shopping
season,'' Mitchell said. ``Americans could start the season in
Plymouth and then head on to London or Paris for Christmas
shopping.''

 &HT;    EVEN IN JAPAN, CLINTON UNABLE TO ESCAPE LONG SHADOW OF 'MONICA'
 &HT;    With CLINTON-JAPAN-1120.

<P>
   TOKYO _ President Clinton traveled 8,000 miles away from
Thursday's impeachment proceedings on Capitol Hill, but it wasn't
far enough to escape questions about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Venturing back into what was once among his favorite public
settings, Clinton hosted a televised town hall-style forum here on
Thursday, and an Osaka housewife threw him a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regarding Miss Monica Lewinsky -- how did you apologize to
Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea,'' the mother of two wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would never be able to forgive my husband for that,'' she
added. ''Did they really forgive you, Mr. President?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton paused, then delivered an answer that was succinct and
sober.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I did it (apologized) in a direct and straightforward
manner, and I believe they did (forgive), yes,'' he replied. ''But
that's really a question you could ask them better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Chelsea accompanied the president to
Tokyo. Mrs. Clinton is touring hurricane-damaged nations in Central
America; Chelsea is a sophomore at Stanford University, in Palo
Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly not wanting to build on the theme, program moderator
Tetsuya Chikushi of the Tokyo Broadcasting System took evasive
action.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's change the subject now,'' he quickly interjected.
''Let's talk about U.S.-Japan relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Chikushi and the president sat before the live audience of 100
of Japan's future leaders on two bar stools with a large video
screen before them that linked the studio to Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging exchange with Japanese from a variety of walks
of life, Clinton fielded questions about his favorite food --
chicken enchiladas, he said, ''although I like sushi too,'' -- his
advice on public speaking -- ''be yourself'' -- and even his views
on government service -- ''I can't run for a third term under our
laws,'' he said. ''If I could, I would, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   He also explained, in his fullest form yet, the thinking behind
his decision to call off air strikes against Iraq last weekend
after Baghdad agreed to submit to United Nations weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had conducted a comprehensive attack directed at their
weapons of mass destruction program, the production capacity, the
laboratories, all the support sites and the military infrastructure
that supports it,'' he said, ''unless everyone knew in advance and
left the premises, large numbers of people would be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ''the United States has a special responsibility,
because of the unique position of our military might, at this
moment in history, to be very careful in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made clear, though, that he would not shrink from air
strikes in the future, if he feels they are necessary to counter
Iraq's efforts to build chemical, biological and nuclear arms,
which, Clinton said, could one day make their way into the hands of
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can do something to stop it now,'' he said, ''we should
do it, even if it requires military action.''

 &HT;    CLINTON URGES JAPANESE TO SUPPORT GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC PLAN
 &HT;    With CLINTON-TOWN-1120.

   TOKYO _ Taking his message of hope and change far from home,
President Clinton gave Japan an economic pep talk on Thursday,
urging the country to get behind a controversial set of programs
aimed at ending seven years of stagnation here that is dragging
down the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   With Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi struggling to implement $700
billion worth of initiatives meant to shore up the country's
debt-ridden banks and stimulate spending and growth, Clinton
avoided high-pressure rhetoric, publicly at least, and instead
encouraged the Japanese to embrace Obuchi's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do not be discouraged by the present economic difficulties:
they can be overcome,'' Clinton said, taking his powers of
political persuasion abroad. ''Support your government in
aggressively dealing with the financial institutions, aggressively
moving to support greater consumption, aggressively moving for
structural changes that will create more jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who arrived here Thursday afternoon, made the remarks
during a nationally televised town hall meeting designed to help
take the edge off of the U.S. message that Japan must do more than
it has so far to get its economy out of the horse latitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to address the American business community
here and to hold additional meetings with Obuchi on Friday. In
those meetings, officials said Clinton will warn Obuchi that fresh
intelligence shows that North Korea can launch a second long-range
ballistic missile over Japan at any time.
</P>
<P>
   He will also discuss the issue with South Korean President Kim
Dae Jung after traveling to Seoul late Friday for two days of talks
expected to center on security. White House officials said the
president hopes the warning will forge greater cooperation among
the United States, Japan and South Korea to deal with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton travels to the American possession of Guam on Monday
before returning to Washington that night.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. frustration over Japan's lingering economic malaise has
strained U.S.-Japan relations over the past year, and part of
Clinton's task during a two-day summit here is to try to set the
alliance back on firm footing, largely by accentuating the
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ''The relationship between our two countries has always been
important, but never more important than now,'' Clinton said during
a toast at a state dinner hosted by Obuchi at a downtown hotel.
''Our security alliance is the cornerstone of Asia's stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, administration officials have voiced agitation with
Tokyo for being slow in responding to Japan's worst economic
performance since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Stagnant for seven of the past eight years, Japan's economy is
expected to contract by 2 percent or more this year, and economists
expect little, if any, growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The languid economy here is blamed as a key reason behind a
regional recession that has pulled down emerging markets from
Russia to Brazil, causing the United States and its wealthy
partners to pony up more than $170 billion over the past 18 months
in emergency assistance aimed at cushioning the pain of economic
woe and propping up failing currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's sorry economic performance has also put pressure on
American companies and workers. Because Japan's consumers are
buying fewer goods and services from U.S. companies than they would
during healthier times, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan is
mushrooming.
</P>
<P>
   That gap was $48 billion, in Japan's favor, just two years ago.
It soared to $56 billion last year and is on track to top $60
billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our long-term prosperity requires a healthy global economy,''
Clinton said in Washington on Wednesday before departing for Japan.
''If people overseas lose their jobs, therefore, they can't afford
American products and our workers and farmers pay the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi took office in August after his predecessor, Ryutaro
Hashimoto, resigned to take blame for the faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi announced on Monday a 24 trillion yen (roughly US$200
billion) package of tax cuts and stimulus measures, in hopes of
pulling Japan out of its funk sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   That comes on top of a plan announced earlier this year to make
up to 60 trillion yen, equal to about US$500 billion, to bail out
Japanese banks. The banking industry is saddled with an estimated
$1 trillion in bad debts. The situation has crimped lending,
creating a credit squeeze that is stifling growth.

alliance back on firm footing, largely by accentuating the
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ''The relationship between our two countries has always been
important, but never more important than now,'' Clinton said during
a toast at a state dinner hosted by Obuchi at a downtown hotel.
''Our security alliance is the cornerstone of Asia's stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, administration officials have voiced agitation with
Tokyo for being slow in responding to Japan's worst economic
performance since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Stagnant for seven of the past eight years, Japan's economy is
expected to contract by 2 percent or more this year, and economists
expect little, if any, growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The languid economy here is blamed as a key reason behind a
regional recession that has pulled down emerging markets from
Russia to Brazil, causing the United States and its wealthy
partners to pony up more than $170 billion over the past 18 months
in emergency assistance aimed at cushioning the pain of economic
woe and propping up failing currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's sorry economic performance has also put pressure on
American companies and workers. Because Japan's consumers are
buying fewer goods and services from U.S. companies than they would
during healthier times, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan is
mushrooming.
</P>
<P>
   That gap was $48 billion, in Japan's favor, just two years ago.
It soared to $56 billion last year and is on track to top $60
billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our long-term prosperity requires a healthy global economy,''
Clinton said in Washington on Wednesday before departing for Japan.
''If people overseas lose their jobs, therefore, they can't afford
American products and our workers and farmers pay the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi took office in August after his predecessor, Ryutaro
Hashimoto, resigned to take blame for the faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi announced on Monday a 24 trillion yen (roughly US$200
billion) package of tax cuts and stimulus measures, in hopes of
pulling Japan out of its funk sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   That comes on top of a plan announced earlier this year to make
up to 60 trillion yen, equal to about US$500 billion, to bail out
Japanese banks. The banking industry is saddled with an estimated
$1 trillion in bad debts. The situation has crimped lending,
creating a credit squeeze that is stifling growth.

 &HT;    ENGLAND'S PLYMOUTH WANTS TO GIVE AMERICANS THAN KS
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ While the turkey will be British and the football
round, the city from which the Mayflower embarked for the New World
wants Americans to come and feel at home for Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The port city of Plymouth is making plans for its first American
Thanksgiving Festival, complete with such exotic-sounding dishes as
succotash and pumpkin pie to complement a dinner of turkey with
cranberry sauce.
</P>
<P>
   By some counts, as many as 250,000 Americans live in the United
Kingdom, and many feel somewhat dislocated during periods of
traditional U.S. holidays such as Independence Day, Halloween and
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a full embrace by many Britons of such American
cultural icons as McDonald's, shopping malls and Homer Simpson,
there is only a vague awareness that there is any significance to
the last Thursday of November.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, part of the job for Plymouth organizers is to
explain to locals what it's all about. ``Plymouth has been slow to
recognize this part of our heritage, but we're learning and want to
be recognized as being a very American-friendly place,'' said Neill
Mitchell, chief executive of the Plymouth Chamber of Commerce.
``Local people are starting to get the hang of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The city of 257,000 has a number of historic, cultural and
business connections to the United States and Thanksgiving seemed
the perfect time to take note of these, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the departure point for 102 men, women and
children aboard the Mayflower, the port also has seen ships
embarking with such noted explorers as Francis Drake, Walter
Raleigh, Capt. William Bligh and Charles Darwin. The Mayflower
Stone and Steps, the place from which the Mayflower set sail, has
been preserved as a monument to the Pilgrims who left England to
establish a colony in Massachusetts. Many died over the winter, and
a feast of thanksgiving was held the following autumn.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   The old part of Plymouth city clusters around the Hoe, the
famous patch of turf on which Drake is said to have finished a calm
game of bowls before heading off to defeat the invading Spanish
Armada in 1588. Plymouth also was an embarkation point for U.S.
troops heading for the Normandy invasion in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1813 during one of the
unpleasant spells when Britain and its former colonies were at war.
``That's when the fleet from Plymouth was being molested in
Newfoundland by your fleet,'' Mitchell told an American reporter.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put that whole jigsaw puzzle together you begin to
see that there's quite a lot of American heritage represented
here,'' he said .
</P>
<P>
   This year's festival will be from Nov. 26-29, with a 1940s-style
big band dinner held the Friday after Thanksgiving and the arrival
at Plymouth docks of a group of NATO ships led by the American
warship the U.S.S. Stark.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the event has been given scarce attention in
Britain, it has been received warmly by Americans -- including
those back in the States -- because of a six-month old posting on
the World Wide Web, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   The American community in England, a fairly affluent bunch of
corporate executives and such, relies heavily on the Internet to
keep in touch. ``Were it not for the Internet, I'm not sure what we
would have done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   True to its American style, the celebration, much as its
namesake in the United States, will have commercial undertones.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to boosting tourism and providing exposure to
American business people in Britain, the event could help lure a
few Yankee dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``When President (Franklin) Roosevelt fixed it on the calendar,
it was clearly an effort to help extend the Christmas shopping
season,'' Mitchell said. ``Americans could start the season in
Plymouth and then head on to London or Paris for Christmas
shopping.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ President Clinton traveled 8,000 miles away from
Thursday's impeachment proceedings on Capitol Hill, but it wasn't
far enough to escape questions about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Venturing back into what was once among his favorite public
settings, Clinton hosted a televised town hall-style forum here on
Thursday, and an Osaka housewife threw him a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regarding Miss Monica Lewinsky -- how did you apologize to
Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea,'' the mother of two wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would never be able to forgive my husband for that,'' she
added. ''Did they really forgive you, Mr. President?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton paused, then delivered an answer that was succinct and
sober.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I did it (apologized) in a direct and straightforward
manner, and I believe they did (forgive), yes,'' he replied. ''But
that's really a question you could ask them better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Chelsea accompanied the president to
Tokyo. Mrs. Clinton is touring hurricane-damaged nations in Central
America; Chelsea is a sophomore at Stanford University, in Palo
Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly not wanting to build on the theme, program moderator
Tetsuya Chikushi of the Tokyo Broadcasting System took evasive
action.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's change the subject now,'' he quickly interjected.
''Let's talk about U.S.-Japan relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Chikushi and the president sat before the live audience of 100
of Japan's future leaders on two bar stools with a large video
screen before them that linked the studio to Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging exchange with Japanese from a variety of walks
of life, Clinton fielded questions about his favorite food --
chicken enchiladas, he said, ''although I like sushi too,'' -- his
advice on public speaking -- ''be yourself'' -- and even his views
on government service -- ''I can't run for a third term under our
laws,'' he said. ''If I could, I would, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   He also explained, in his fullest form yet, the thinking behind
his decision to call off air strikes against Iraq last weekend
after Baghdad agreed to submit to United Nations weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had conducted a comprehensive attack directed at their
weapons of mass destruction program, the production capacity, the
laboratories, all the support sites and the military infrastructure
that supports it,'' he said, ''unless everyone knew in advance and
left the premises, large numbers of people would be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ''the United States has a special responsibility,
because of the unique position of our military might, at this
moment in history, to be very careful in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made clear, though, that he would not shrink from air
strikes in the future, if he feels they are necessary to counter
Iraq's efforts to build chemical, biological and nuclear arms,
which, Clinton said, could one day make their way into the hands of
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can do something to stop it now,'' he said, ''we should
do it, even if it requires military action.''

 SHADOW WARS 
 By Clyde Farnsworth 
 Donald I. Fine, $24.95  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What if, like the mythical ancient alchemists, you could
actually spin gold out of a common element? At first, it would seem
an irresistible gift _ but what about the potential social and
economic ramifications? And what if this magical ability wound up
in the wrong hands? Clyde Farnsworth, a former foreign
correspondent for the New York Times, has given this premise some
serious thought and has spun from it a thriller about greed,
political intrigue and murder. His story begins on Lake Baikal,
``five miles to the southeast of Olkhon Island,'' in the former
Soviet Union. It is here that a half-Jewish physicist named Dmitri
Sherbatov is plucked from his rowboat by two foreign agents, who
whisk him to Israel. There he is to serve his newly adopted country
by sharing his recipe for creating gold from bismuth by bombarding
it with tremendous bursts of energy. Unfortunately, Sherbatov falls
under the sway of an unscrupulous former Israeli general, now the
minister of energy and natural resources, who is not averse to
lining his own pockets with the synthetic gold, as well as using it
to augment his hard-line political agenda. Meanwhile, the CIA
recruits a physics professor of its own, Hillsdale Landover, to
investigate the matter. Yes, there's murder. Yes, there's
treachery. Yes, there's a love story between Landover and the
daughter of a Mossad agent. And yes, the story hopscotches across
the globe. But somehow, in the end, ``Shadow Wars'' falls flat.
Farnsworth is a deft writer and he has researched his subject well,
but, regrettably, he falls too often into overly familiar thriller
territory, and his characters aren't sufficiently charismatic or
interesting to lift the novel above the ordinary. _ CHARLES

   &UR; THE STILLEST DAY &QL; 
 &UR; By Josephine Hart &QL; 
 &UR; Overlook, $23.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Hart is obsessed with obsession. In her best-known
novel, ``Damage,'' a member of Parliament is drawn irrevocably to
his son's future wife. Hart's latest novel, ``The Stillest Day,''
has no such easily defined plot; this year's obsession is more
cerebral than that. Her narrator, Bethesda Barnet, looks back to
the turn of the century when she was a 30-year-old painter and art
teacher in a small unnamed English village. Unenthusiastically
betrothed, she lives a quiet life caring for her invalid mother,
for whom she has little feeling. She ``walks out'' with her beau,
Samuel Keans, and pays ritual visits to her mentor, Lord
Grantleigh, who acquaints her with decadent French art. When a new
teacher, Mathew Pearson, and his pregnant wife move into the house
next door, Bethesda becomes obsessed with him. From that day on,
she paints images of his face (and later his hands, feet and
shoulders) on mirrors in her bedroom. When she looks in them, she
and he are merged. As Bethesda's narrative unfolds, she emerges as
cold and often cruel; then, on what she calls ``the stillest day,''
she commits a shocking act that changes her life and the lives of
those around her forever. In mood, Hart is something of a
present-day Daphne du Maurier: she writes ominously, creating an
atmosphere laden with mystery. But her enigmas are far less easy to
interpret than du Maurier's. Hart is a seductive writer. Despite
unpleasant characters sent out on a gloomy voyage, despite as many
overblown sentences as carefully constructed ones, we still read
on, possessed like one of Hart's own protagonists. _ CAROL PEACE

   &UR; GIVING UP AMERICA &QL; 
 &UR; By Pearl Abraham &QL; 
 &UR; Riverhead, $22.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the opening pages of Pearl Abraham's second novel, two young
New Yorkers are renovating a neglected old house, sparring over
colors and furnishings. Beginning with these seemingly minor
disagreements, Abraham offers a painful account of the dissolution
of their marriage. Deena was raised in a Hasidic family. When she
married Daniel, an orthodox Jew, her father predicted disaster,
noting that the numbers assigned to the Hebrew letters of their
names added up to the word ``pain.'' But Deena ignored his
warnings, believing that ``patterns could be read and recognized,
or not.'' Years later, cracks in their marriage begin to appear
when Daniel invites Jill, a young secretary from his office, home
for dinner. Long a rigid penny pincher, he goes on a spending
spree, taking Deena and Jill out to clubs and on skiing holidays.
Initially pleased by the changes in Daniel's attitude, Deena soon
comes to suspect his motives. As Abraham describes this emotional
evolution, her prose is sparse and exacting, tracing the inner life
of a young woman caught between the Hasidic world of her ancestors
and the materialism of secular America. _ MAGGIE GARB

<P>
   &UR; ONCE AGAIN FOR THUCYDIDES &QL; 
 &UR; By Peter Handke &QL; 
 &UR; New Directions, $18.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the subjects it so carefully describes, Peter
Handke's ``Once Again for Thucydides'' is a small, seemingly simple
thing that grows in complexity the more closely it is observed.
Translated from the German by Tess Lewis, the book is an eclectic
collection of ``micro-epics'' from Handke's travels. Whether
visiting Japan, the Pyrenees, Croatia or a city park in Munich,
Handke delights in sublime detail. In one selection, he spends
pages poring over the trunk of a tree, cataloguing insects, lichens
and the varying grain of the bark itself: ``I was gripped with
excitement at knowing that if I slowly, continuously, circled and
examined the tree, much more would be revealed.'' He employs a
similar strategy, with similar fervor, throughout the collection.
Like the tree, his subjects are frequently from the natural world,
and even when they are not -- as in a brief portrait of ``The
Shoeshine Man of Split,'' whom he describes as the ``Saint of Small
Measures'' -- he describes them with the same studied
meticulousness. At their best, these vignettes have the power of
poetry, and this seems to be his goal. Nevertheless, Handke is
clearly after more, since he frequently, though obliquely,
questions his role as an observer in an inherently political
landscape. Though the answers he suggests require strenuous
squinting to discern, his effort alone rescues the book from fussy
preciosity. _ LIAM CALLANAN

<P>
   &UR; THE SAME EMBRACE &QL; 
 &UR; By Michael Lowenthal &QL; 
 &UR; Dutton, $23.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lowenthal's deeply felt first novel portrays the
conflict between 24-year-old twin brothers whose divergent passions
threaten to separate them forever. Jacob Rosenbaum is a gay
activist, yet he is more successful in accepting his sexuality than
in sustaining intimate relationships. In contrast, his brother,
Jonathan, has embraced the strictures of Orthodox Judaism at a
yeshiva in Israel. Although Jonathan expresses disgusted hostility
when confronted with his brother's life as a gay man, Jacob still
cares for him and mourns the loss of the closeness they once had as
children. Reconciliation becomes possible only when their beloved
grandmother falls into a coma after a severe stroke, precipitating
a family crisis and exposing secrets that have shaped the lives of
all her loved ones ever since she and her husband fled the
Holocaust for America. As he blends the past and the present,
Lowenthal uses luminous language that often imbues ordinary
gestures and events with deeper meaning. ``The Same Embrace'' is an
eloquent exploration of the nature of faith, the consequences of
judgment and the stubborn endurance of family ties. _ LINDA BARRETT

 THE CENTURY 
 By Peter Jennings and Todd Brewster 
 Doubleday, $60  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This ragtag century of ours is getting to seem like a garrulous
uncle who keeps coming back with his same old stories: his great
wars and his great depressions, evils daunted and lessons sorely
learned. Crowds cheering the troops into World War I, the folly of
the Treaty of Versailles, the masses on their feet in Nazi salute
at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin -- and on and on. THE CENTURY is
comprehensive, balanced, eminently readable and fairly onerous,
taken cover to cover. The narrative by Peter Jennings, the
broadcaster, and Todd Brewster, a former editor and writer at Life,
is a good textbook history of the American experience of the 20th
century, told from the perspective of the American 1990's, rather
than what might have been more interesting, the century as seen
from each of its successive eras. Important phases and events are
captured in a series of first-person accounts, most filling a
single page, with a boxed biography of the speaker and several
photographs, often snapshots; together these form an effective, and
in some ways more satisfying narrative, and are the real meat of
this book. The photo selection of Katherine Bourbeau is excellent,
with an eye for the unfamiliar image (John F. Kennedy and Richard
M. Nixon in a handshake that separates rather than brings them
together; students at Harvard mourning Kennedy's murder), while a
familiar image like Dorothea Lange's ``Migrant Mother'' is treated
as subject rather than illustration, and captioned with a quotation
from the photographer, describing the circumstances of the shot.
With so much to browse and relive, there will be something here for
everyone. _ DAVID WALTON

   &UR; THE SCIENCE TIMES BOOK OF INSECTS &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Nicholas Wade &QL; 
 &UR; Lyons, $25 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Insects preceded people on this earth by about 300 million
years, and may well survive mankind by longer than that. Such a
prospect deserves respect, and that is what insects (and a few
other arthropods) receive in THE SCIENCE TIMES BOOK OF INSECTS,
edited by Nicholas Wade (Lyons, $25), a selection of nature
reporting, from The Times's weekly science section, about insects
and the scientists who study them. Intriguing new findings concern,
for example, the recycling tactics of dung beetles, without whom
this planet would be a mess; the invasive habits of the Halloween
ladybug, an innocent aphid eater that can alarm whole suburbs with
its vast October swarms; and, perhaps best of all, research at
Cambridge University that appears to have determined how the
proverbially unairworthy bumblebee manages, in defiance of
conventional aerodynamics, to fly.

   &UR; THE BEATLES &QL; 
 &UR; An Oral History &QL; 
 &UR; By David Pritchard and Alan Lysaght &QL; 
 &UR; Hyperion, $23.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What used to be called a clip job now passes for ``oral
history.'' ``The Beatles,'' by David Pritchard and Alan Lysaght,
two Canadian radio and television producers, is a compilation of
twice-told tales culled from interviews with the Beatles and their
contemporaries and is more seriously in need of editing than the
``White Album.'' Far too much of this material has been told more
vividly elsewhere. However, there are a few gems: George Harrison's
sister, Louise, says their mother listened to Radio India on Sunday
afternoons when she was pregnant with George, so that he may have
been influenced by the sitar before he was born. There is a
wistfulness to those left behind by the Beatles' fame: a Hamburg
nightclub owner named Horst Fascher wishes he had ``collected more
things that they threw away, like drumsticks and guitar strings.''
For die-hard Beatlephiles, there are technical tidbits like the
fact that ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' one of the
most celebrated stereo rock albums, was largely mixed in mono.
Unfortunately, the book is shapeless and stuffed with filler. An
oral history of the Beatles should have been a lot more fun. _ ERIC

   &UR; THE LONG-WINDED LADY &QL; 
 &UR; Notes From The New Yorker &QL; 
 &UR; By Maeve Brennan &QL; 
 &UR; Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some writers hold your attention with grand tales of love or
war. Maeve Brennan had smaller goals. For nearly three decades she
wrote for The New Yorker's Talk of the Town section under the
woefully apt pseudonym the Long-Winded Lady. In her vignettes of
city life she natters about little things like yappy dogs, or
dinner at her favorite steakhouse, where a stranger had the veal,
or the weather, which came in three flavors -- heat wave, downpour
and snowstorm. Brennan is a distant observer of couples in the
park, loners on the roof and cats in the alley; she is always
watching, often conjecturing, rarely engaging her subjects in
conversation. Mixed with these ramblings is a bittersweet chronicle
of New York in transition in the 1950's and 60's as the residential
hotels of her beloved neighborhoods, Greenwich Village and Times
Square, are torn down for high-rises. Unlike that other chronicler
of old New York, Joseph Mitchell, who relished its odd corners and
people, Brennan keeps her neighbors at arm's length. _ LAURA GREEN

 &UR; A Signature Life &QL; 
 &UR; By Diane Von Furstenberg with Linda Bird Francke &QL; 
 &UR; Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is almost too easy to dismiss the designer Diane Von
Furstenberg as a socialite and dilettante whose once ubiquitous
wrap dress succeeded on the merit of her connections and title (her
former husband is a prince). Indeed, several passages in ``Diane,''
the autobiography she has written with Linda Bird Francke, would
support this assumption. Attending a White House dinner celebrating
the 1979 Egypt-Israeli peace accord, she writes that she would have
argued more strenuously with the pessimism of her table mate,
Yitzhak Shamir, if only the damp night hadn't left her so cold.
After a Secret Service agent lends her a raincoat, she laments,
``There was nothing anyone could do, however, about the terminal
damage done to my new Manolo Blahnik shoes by the wet White House
lawn.'' Since the moment the Belgian-born Von Furstenberg arrived
in New York in 1969, she has lived a rarefied existence. In
difficult situations, she consults with Barry (Diller), Ronald
(Lauder) and Bianca (Jagger), and when considering applying for
American citizenship, she remarks on the section requiring her to
list visits abroad: ``Reconstructing the hundreds of trips I had
taken was just too much.'' Such blithe commentary masks what is by
any measure a success story; Von Furstenberg did not inherit
privilege. Her mother survived Auschwitz and her father built his
own business that financed the boarding school education that
introduced Von Furstenberg to the people who introduced her to the
world of Andy Warhol and Studio 54. She persuasively illustrates
how her hugely successful clothing and cosmetics businesses were
nurtured by endless hours of hard work and hundreds of personal
appearances. Despite bouts of superficiality, Von Furstenberg is a
likable and surprisingly earnest figure. This is breezy reading for
anyone who enjoys columns with a plenitude of bold-faced names. _

   &UR; HISTORY IN OUR TIME &QL; 
 &UR; By David Cannadine &QL; 
 &UR; Yale, $25 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In these reviews of other historians' books, David Cannadine
works a provocative series of transformations -- taking new angles,
amplifying themes and giving his own acerbic voice the final word.
These pieces examine the last four centuries of British history,
from Henry VIII to Diana, Princess of Wales, lingering over
imperialism, Victorian culture, Florence Nightingale and Winston
Churchill (as well as second-rank figures like the English fascist
Oswald Mosley and John Buchan, the novelist and politician). The
heart of ``History in Our Time'' is 10 essays that focus closely on
the British monarchy. There is a fascinating sketch, based on a
study by Phillip Hall, of how the Windsors made their money (mostly
done since 1910, through the hoarding of public funds and the
careful negotiation of personal tax exemptions). Ironically, when
he turns to the Royal Family, Cannadine's withering glare is very
much a spellbound gaze. He sympathizes with kings who have honored
their duties -- notably George VI, a dull, decent figurehead who
worked hard at sharing his people's wartime hardships yet amused
himself by personally designing ``a new style of trousers to wear
with the Order of the Garter.'' Cannadine wants to overhaul the
monarchy, but only to adapt it to downscaled, postimperial times.
He repeatedly intimates that princes need broader experience and
better education. ``History in Our Time'' displays its author's
range as a historian and his skills as a working critic. _ ALLEN D.

 INGENIOUS PAIN 
 By Andrew Miller 
 Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This first novel focuses on an 18th-century doctor, a brilliant
surgeon whose skill and detachment are largely due to the strange
defect he was born with: an inability to feel pain. Last year our
reviewer, Patrick McGrath, called the book ``a mature novel of
ideas soaked in the sensory detail of its turbulent times.''

   &UR; THE DIARIES OF DAWN POWELL, 1931-1965 &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Tim Page &QL; 
 &UR; Steerforth, $19 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Never give a guest Dexedrine after sundown'' is just one of
the zingers that leap from these pages, which were written in the
last half of the life of a brilliant and, to her fans, still
unappreciated satirist. These journals reflect Dawn Powell's life
in Greenwich Village, where she married foolishly, gave birth to a
severely handicapped son and wrote her novels, many of which are
now being rediscovered. The diaries are ``one of the outstanding
literary finds of the last quarter-century,'' Terry Teachout wrote
here in 1995. Steerforth has also reissued much of Powell's
fiction. THE HAPPY ISLAND ($14), first published in 1938, is a
story of bohemian life in Manhattan, centering on Prudence Bly, a
nightclub singer, and Jefferson Abbott, a playwright; both, like
Powell herself, come from small-town Ohio. In The New York Times,
E. H. Walton praised Powell's ``sardonic wit.'' THE BRIDE'S HOUSE
($14), one of Powell's earliest novels, is about a young Midwestern
farm wife, torn between her dependable but boring husband and a
much more exciting stranger. ``There is flavor and richness in the
book, and the staunchness of honesty as well,'' one critic said in
1929.

   &UR; THE SECRET WAR FOR THE UNION &QL; 
 &UR; The Untold Story of Military Intelligence in the Civil War &QL; 
 &UR; By Edwin C. Fishel &QL; 
 &UR; Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $16 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The author argues that the Northern forces were actually more
adept than the Confederacy at gathering information about the
enemy, and that their systematic use of intelligence furthered
military advancement even when it did not win battles. Fishel's
``book breaks much new ground,'' Gary W. Gallagher wrote in The New
York Times in 1996. Mariner has also reissued CHANCELLORSVILLE, by
Stephen W. Sears ($16), a history that provides a new
interpretation of a Civil War battle usually judged to be an
example of Robert E. Lee's brilliance. Lee won the battle more
through luck than strategy, the author contends, and Joseph Hooker
lost it largely because of incompetent subordinates. ``For scope,
analysis, drama and richness of detail, there is no better book on
the subject,'' Daniel E. Sutherland said in the Book Review in
1996. Sears has also contributed a new introduction to A DIARY OF
BATTLE: The Personal Journals of Colonel Charles S. Wainwright,
1861-1865, edited by Allan Nevins (Da Capo, $17.95). The only work
of its kind -- the eyewitness account of a Union artillery officer
-- it covers most of the major battles of the Army of the Potomac.
``This action diary is the stuff of which published history is
made,'' Freeman Cleaves wrote here in 1962. &QL;

   &UR; EGGS FOR YOUNG AMERICA &QL; 
 &UR; By Katherine L. Hester &QL; 
 &UR; Penguin, $12.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This debut collection of short stories is set in the author's
native South, where her characters, mostly working class, struggle
fiercely but unsentimentally with the limitations of their lives.
This is ``a remarkably assured book by a wise and provocative
writer,'' Tom Drury said in these pages last year. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; GRACE NOTES &QL; 
 &UR; By Bernard MacLaverty &QL; 
 &UR; Norton, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This novel explores the emotional life of Catherine McKenna, an
Irish musician, composer and single mother whose personal loyalties
are as divided as her country's. Having left her family, home and
Roman Catholicism behind, she returns to Northern Ireland after her
father's death. The prose is ``lyrical and hypnotic,'' Courtney
Weaver said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WAITING TO FORGET &QL; 
 &UR; By Margaret Moorman &QL; 
 &UR; Norton, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What the author was supposed to forget was the birth of her
first child, a boy she had borne when she was 16 and given up for
adoption. This book is the record of years of turmoil that finally
culminated in contact with her grown son. '' 'Waiting to Forget' is
uniquely enlightening because the author has so effectively made
the connection between the personal and the political,'' Jane
O'Reilly wrote in the Book Review in 1996. ``Variations of
circumstance become unified by her questions.'' The other side of
adoption is explored in AN EMPTY LAP: One Couple's Journey to
Parenthood, by Jill Smolowe (Pocket Books, $14). The author, a
journalist, recounts her struggle with infertility and her
husband's ambivalence about fatherhood before the couple finally
adopted a baby girl from China. Last year our reviewer, Peter D.
Kramer, called her memoir ``eminently readable.''

   &UR; THE SHOVEL AND THE LOOM &QL; 
 &UR; By Carl Friedman &QL; 
 &UR; Translated by Jeannette K. Ringold &QL; 
 &UR; Karen and Michael Braziller/Persea, $12 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1970, this Dutch novel is narrated by a young student in
Antwerp who is trying to make sense of her own and her parents'
pasts. The daughter of Holocaust survivors, she questions religion
yet finds herself drawn to the Hasidic family for whom she is a
nanny. ``The author perfectly accomplishes the delicate task of
making unspeakable stories at once accessible and shocking,''
Katherine Alberg wrote in these pages in 1996.

 WHERE THE VOICE CAME FROM 
 By JAMES OLNEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the strangest experience,'' Eudora Welty told Anne
Tyler after reading back over her short stories in preparation for
their collected publication in 1980. ``It was like watching a
negative develop, slowly coming clear before your eyes. It was like
recovering a memory.
</P>
<P>
   With the appearance of the two Welty volumes in the Library of
America series -- comprising not only the short fiction but also a
handful of acute essays, the superb ``One Writer's Beginnings'' and
five books designated ``novels'' (``The Robber Bridegroom,''
``Delta Wedding,'' ``The Ponder Heart,'' ``Losing Battles'' and
``The Optimist's Daughter'') -- Welty's admirers have the
opportunity to watch with her as the body of her work gradually
emerges, indeed like a developing photographic image, a richly
varied yet single living entity, something always there, always
coming into being but wholly perceptible only now, when it can be
viewed through the lens of memory. I specify admirers (and who is
not one? her popularity no doubt accounts in part for Welty being
the first living author included in the Library of America) for, as
she describes the process, it requires a previous knowledge of the
work and a double doubling back. Memory is a first-stage recovery
of the past; recovering a memory is akin to remembering
remembering. Welty has always been prodigious in her remarks on
memory: ``Of course the greatest confluence of all is that which
makes up the individual human memory,'' she says in ``One Writer's
Beginnings.'' ``My own is the treasure most dearly regarded by me,
in my life and in my work as a writer. Here time, also, is subject
to confluence. The memory is a living thing -- it too is in
transit. But during its moment, all that is remembered joins, and
lives -- the old and the young, the past and the present, the
living and the dead.'' Joined and living, too, one might add, in
our reading are Welty's past achievement and our present
recollection, savoring, reconstruction and re-creation of it.
</P>
<P>
   What is at issue both for Welty and for the reader of ``Eudora
Welty: Complete Novels'' and ``Eudora Welty: Stories, Essays, &AMP;
Memoir,'' edited and annotated unobtrusively but meticulously by
Richard Ford and Michael Kreyling, is a memory of things written,
of things made, which locates the life of greatest interest firmly
and first and last in the writing. Focusing there, one shares
Welty's sense of wonder yet of inevitability at how it's all come
about: no one could have predicted it would be so, but in
retrospect it could not have been otherwise. Asked in 1989 how she
would describe the vision that has sustained and impelled her
throughout a career of more than 50 years, Welty responded that
such a vision ``lies only in the work. . . . It's what the work
shows, comprises altogether.'' What she desires, she continued, is
for ``the work to exist as the thing that answers every question
about its doing.''
</P>
<P>
   If the body of her work, in its parts and its entirety, contains
the story of its writing, then this renders a biography of the
``writer's life'' (in the phrase that supplies the subtitle to Ann
Waldron's biography, ``Eudora'') not only nugatory but an
impertinence. The word impertinence is intended in the double sense
of irrelevance and of rudeness (which one can find most tellingly
in Waldron's aggrieved tone at not being allowed every confidence
of Welty's private life and in her frantic search for explanations
of the fiction in what Waldron takes to be Welty's sexual
frustration and her despair at having had no dates -- no dates at
all! -- in high school).
</P>
<P>
   To ``explain'' the fiction, as Waldron does, as compensation or
sublimation, with unfounded speculation and reckless surmise as her
principal tools -- Welty seems to have been depressed at this time,
which was likely caused by (what else?) an unhappy love attachment,
and the depression (which Waldron takes for an established fact) is
the cause of such and such a scene in ``The Robber Bridegroom'' or
a character in ``June Recital'' -- consigns Welty's work to a
presumed starting point in the ``foul rag-and-bone shop of the
heart.'' It shackles her imagination to the detritus of a life when
the desire of that life has been to create a new world not on the
basis of day-to-day grievances but in the likeness of the visible
and audible phantasmagoria surrounding her and her readers.
Everything one needs to know biographically about Welty can be
gleaned from the Library of America chronology. Her autobiography
-- the story of a writer -- is written across the whole body of her
work.
</P>
<P>
   That story, as against the one retailed in Waldron's book, is of
a pervasive and inexplicable mystery at the heart of human
existence and relationships. It is also an account, by way of the
writing, of techniques for rendering that mystery a living presence
in fiction. The tale begins with the imaginative explosion of ``A
Curtain of Green,'' a collection of 17 stories that seem
individually like so many experiments in voice, perspective,
texture.
</P>
<P>
   The volume's tonal variety is astonishing: from the somber
``Death of a Traveling Salesman'' to the hallucinatory ``Flowers
for Marjorie,'' from the wonderment at the variety of human faces
of ``Clytie'' to the foreboding near-violence of the title piece,
from the jazzy ``Powerhouse'' to the satiric ``Petrified Man,''
from the wildly comic ``Why I Live at the P.O.'' to the dignified
``A Worn Path'' (the ``grave, persistent, meditative'' sound of old
Phoenix Jackson's cane tapping the frozen earth establishes the
tone at the outset).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-WELTY-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: the outset).) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Curtain of Green,'' with marvelous success, Welty tests
voice after voice, as if the lesson learned in one story were to be
put aside, perhaps for future use, while another lesson is worked
through. ``The source of the short story is usually lyrical,'' she
says in ``Writing and Analyzing a Story.'' But she immediately goes
on to assert that, however much the lyrical impetus, and therefore
the tone and mood, may change from story to story, each story
carries the author's ``signature because of the one impulse
characteristic of his own gift -- to praise, to love, to call up
into view.'' Welty seems to offer these impulses as separate, but I
should say that to call up into view, to praise, to love -- taken
in whatever order -- are ultimately a single desire driving her
work from the first published story (``Death of a Traveling
Salesman'') right through ``One Writer's Beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   The short story is the medium in which Welty has always shown to
greatest advantage, and this is true both of the relatively brief
pieces of ``A Curtain of Green'' (1941) and of the more expansive,
slower-paced stories of ``The Wide Net and Other Stories'' (1943),
``The Golden Apples'' (1949) and ``The Bride of Innisfallen and
Other Stories'' (1955). When she moved on to the novel, as she was
urged -- against her instincts -- to do by publishers, Welty
recognized that she was taking on a form markedly different in its
demands and capabilities. Few enough writers have been brilliantly
successful at both modes, and though Welty's novels have much to
recommend them, the truth is that she never quite divested herself
of the ways of seeing and saying most appropriate to the writing of
short fiction. The novel can be and has been many things, but one
doubts it has ever been quite what we get in ``The Robber
Bridegroom'' (1942): a gallimaufry thrown together out of frontier
brags, Yeatsian folk fantasy and shape-changers, fairy-tale love
and adventure, the mock heroic and heroic mockery and high spirits,
blended with comic undercutting at every turn. There are a thousand
events in the book, but of plot hardly a hint. Much the same could
be said of plot in ``Delta Wedding'' (1946) and ``Losing Battles''
(1970) -- that there is not much more of it in those novels than in
``A Visit of Charity'' or ``Keela, the Outcast Indian Maiden'' or
``The Wide Net,'' wonderful stories all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Optimist's Daughter'' (1972) shows a fairly conventional
plot, but this is unique in Welty and achieved at the cost of being
drawn in large measure from details of her biography. And then
there is ``The Ponder Heart'' (1954), really a short story spun out
to something between novella and novel length, a pure exercise in
voice, nothing more, but a virtuoso performance and great triumph
as such (and very funny). Welty opens ``One Writer's Beginnings''
with a chapter called ``Listening'' and concludes with ``Finding a
Voice''; ``The Ponder Heart'' could be a textbook illustration --
but full of life and humor -- of how to listen to Edna Earl's voice
and reproduce it on the page.
</P>
<P>
   Edna Earl's is but one of Welty's hundreds of voices, all
different but all issuing from the artistry of one listener. In
this regard they are like the faces Clytie studies in the story
that bears her name. There were not more than 150 people in Farr's
Ginn, but ``the number of faces seemed to Clytie almost infinite. .
. . When she began to look at people's actual countenances there
was no more familiarity in the world for her. The most profound,
the most moving sight in the whole world must be a face. Was it
possible to comprehend the eyes and the mouths of other people,
which concealed she knew not what, and secretly asked for still
another unknown thing?'' That Clytie's maker shares an abiding
fascination with the infinite variety of nature, human and other,
is clear on every page of her work.
</P>
<P>
   The need to capture the otherness and the sameness in a voice,
in a face, is what accounts for the proliferation of similes and
metaphors in Welty. Such figures of speech are a reaching out to
bring that which is not us, yet is also us, within the ambit of our
emotional capacities. They are a way of bringing home the world's
mysteries without depriving them of any jot of their strangeness.
The words mystery and mysterious echo like mantras in Welty's
fiction, essays and memoir, referring to the endless oddity of the
world and of relationship (``relationship is a pervading and
changing mystery''). When, in ``Place in Fiction,'' Welty declares:
``Life is strange. Stories hardly make it more so; with all they
are able to tell and surmise, they make it more believably, more
inevitably so,'' we are reminded that there is an archaic meaning
for mystery, which is craft or trade. There has been in our time no
more assiduous practitioner of fiction than Eudora Welty, and for
the mystery that pervades her work and is her artistry there can be
no explanation (a la Waldron), only gratitude.

THE SHAMEFUL LIFE OF SALVADOR DALI
</HEADLINE>
  By Ian Gibson 
 Illustrated. 798 pp. New York: W. W. Norton &AMP; Company. $45 
 ------ 
 PARANOIA PERSONIFIED 
 By MICHAEL PEPPIATT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time he became a household name, Salvador Dali (1904-89)
was already perceived above all as a performer _ an outrageous
self-publicist and witty clown. In France, where he spent part of
the year, he could always be relied on to liven up any event or
public debate. But even in that role, he began to pall. I remember
almost bumping into him in 1971 at the Francis Bacon retrospective
at the Grand Palais in Paris. He was unmistakable, with his manic
stare, pointy mustaches and full-length fur coat. ``They're very,
very raisonnables,'' Dali repeated loudly to those around him,
pointing his silver-topped cane at the most alarming of Bacon's
images; and he was visibly annoyed when this bit of Surrealist
upstaging failed to turn more than a few heads.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Dali went from the subversive brilliance of his
youth to an increasingly hollow, money-making exhibitionism is told
with exemplary clarity in Ian Gibson's big new biography of the
Catalan artist. It is ultimately a depressing tale, because it
chronicles in great detail how Dali progressively cheapened and
squandered his enormous talent. Gibson concentrates on Dali's early
career, because it is far and away the most interesting.
``Two-thirds of this book,'' he declares, ``are devoted to
one-third of Dali's life. Such a structure was not imposed
artificially, but shaped itself irresistibly as my research
progressed. Dali's work, after he moved to America in 1940, grows
increasingly hackneyed and repetitious.'' And the man himself,
Gibson might have added, became increasingly grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of the ruthless manipulation and self-aggrandizement that
characterized the later Dali were discernible in his youth. When he
was barely 16, for instance, he announced in his diary: ``I'll be a
genius, and the world will admire me. Perhaps I'll be despised and
misunderstood, but I'll be a genius, a great genius, I'm certain of
it.'' Slim and strikingly handsome, he let his jet-black hair grow
down to his shoulders and began dressing in stylishly bohemian
clothes. Although paralyzingly shy, the adolescent Dali was already
firmly set on his conquest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson begins his book with a full description of Dali's
forebears and the area north of Barcelona, around Figueres and
Cadaques, to which the artist, forever conscious of being Catalan
rather than Spanish, was to remain so deeply attached. Dali's
childhood comes across as relatively normal (above all if one
discounts his own later, myth-making version of it), except that he
had an older brother, also called Salvador, who died some nine
months before Dali was born. His parents, who were comfortably well
off and relatively cultivated, made all the more fuss over him,
giving in to his every whim. But even at a very early age,
according to Gibson, Dali suffered intense feelings of shame,
making it ``extremely difficult for him to maintain normal
relations with the people around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other signs that Dali was not just any boy growing up in
provincial, middle-class Catalonia were not long in coming. Extreme
timidity coincided with an array of obsessions, such as buttocks
(fascination with, both male and female) and locusts (pathological
fear of), that persisted throughout his life. In adolescence, Dali
also became fixated on his unusually complex sexuality. First, he
realized that he was poorly equipped for intercourse. However
disturbing the discovery, he related it with typical verve: ``For a
long time I experienced the misery of believing I was impotent,''
he observes in his ``Unspeakable Confessions.'' ``Naked, and
comparing myself to my schoolfriends, I discovered that my penis
was small, pitiful and soft. I can recall a pornographic novel
whose Don Juan machine-gunned female genitals with ferocious glee,
saying that he enjoyed hearing women creak like watermelons. I
convinced myself that I would never be able to make a woman creak
like a watermelon.'' The other discovery was normal _ except that,
for Dali, masturbation was to be the main, indeed almost the only,
sexual activity right through his life.
</P>
<P>
   These facts would hardly be relevant if they were not vital to
an understanding of Dali's subsequent behavior and his art. An
overriding sense of sexual inadequacy was surely one of the factors
that drove him to create with such single-minded intensity; and
most of the self-styled Great Masturbator's best paintings bristle
with erotic allusions. Gibson rightly emphasizes Dali's tortured
sexuality, and in an intriguing passage he examines what appears to
have been a protracted but unconsummated love affair with the poet
Federico Garcia Lorca, whom Dali later described as the greatest
friend of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   Dali's other close companion during this period was Luis Bunuel.
Gibson's account of the immediate bonding and rivalry of this
fabulously talented Spanish trio, who had come together as students
in Madrid, is one of the most exhilarating passages in the book. It
seems almost uncanny that the three most artistically gifted young
men in the country should have met and had time to share their
dreams, thus influencing one another for life. Gibson gives a
tantalizing glimpse of Garcia Lorca, whose biography he has already
written, and records with gusto how Bunuel and Dali came to make
their subversive first film together, ``Un Chien Andalou,'' which
was shown in Paris in 1929. The lively friendship of the three was
not to last. Garcia Lorca was put to death early in the Spanish
Civil War, and Bunuel was alienated by Dali's shameless volte-face
when, on his return to Spain in 1948 after 10 years in America, he
declared his unconditional support for Franco and Roman
Catholicism.

</P>
<P>
   Two events in the late '20s shaped the rest of Dali's life. One
was his conversion _ the word is not too strong _ to Surrealism,
which took place (if Dali's own unreliable memoirs are to be
believed) when he met the movement's leader, Andre Breton: ``I felt
at the time that I had been granted a second birth,'' Dali stated
many years later. ``The Surrealist group was for me a sort of
nourishing placenta and I believed in Surrealism as if it
constituted the Tables of the Law.'' As he describes Dali's new
involvement, Gibson also conjures up the effervescence surrounding
the movement, with its constant battles, internal and external, and
its fierce resolve to turn all preconceived notions about culture
and life on their heads. For a while Surrealism's ideology kept at
bay the egomania and self-serving cynicism that later claimed the
artist entirely.
</P>
<P>
   A different involvement, however, began from its outset to egg
them on. Helena Diakanoff Devulina _ familiarly Gala _ appears to
have dominated Dali, fascinating and terrifying him, from the
moment they met in 1929. She was then married to the poet Paul
Eluard, but the couple accepted and even encouraged each other's
infidelities, to the point where Gala felt that Eluard was pushing
her at his friend Dali. She left Eluard to live with the painter.
For Dali, the highly sexed, Russian-born Gala brought some form of
physical release and the promise of intelligent companionship; for
her, the artist seems to have been a career and a fortune waiting
to be made, as well as a husband who would tolerate all the lovers
she craved. In the end, they seem to have been a monstrous match
for each other, and much of the latter part of this biography
traces their mutual degradation.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, there are moments of respite. Dali's visit to Freud,
for instance, is a vignette that seems suddenly to speak volumes
about the 20th century. And with his incredible energy, Dali
carries even the growing weight of his empty clowning and
image-making before him. As the money poured in _ from paintings,
endless prints and all kinds of merchandising _ the artist
surrounded himself with a court of beautiful young people and
managed to meet virtually everyone who took his fancy, from Pope
Pius XII and Franco to Clark Gable and Bob Hope. Once Gala died in
1982, Dali went into rapid decline, and his own end was as gruesome
as this master of unpleasant fantasies might himself have devised _
preyed on by his closest advisers and abandoned by those who were
paid to look after him in his decrepitude. Nevertheless, one
wonders whether he was in fact as ashamed of himself as his
biographer claims. It hardly matters. The book provides not so much
a cautionary tale as a trustworthy, even-handed account of a life
that continues to haunt our imagination.

DINING OUT
</HEADLINE>
  Secrets From America's Leading Critics, Chefs, and Restaurateurs 
 By Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page 
 Illustrated. 343 pp. New York: John Wiley &AMP; Sons. Paper, $29.95.

 KNIFE, FORK AND SKI MASK 
 By MICHAEL RUHLMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I almost couldn't finish reading ``Dining Out: Secrets From
America's Leading Critics, Chefs, and Restaurateurs,'' because
every time I lifted it, my fingers, against my will, began riffling
the pages for all the tasty sidebars and marginal quotations from
prominent critics and chefs. I couldn't stop; it was like eating
salted nuts. Yet it's almost impossible to do otherwise, I soon
realized, because the book is virtually composed of such random
blocks of text, plus artful (but maddeningly captionless)
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   For all its disjointedness and design-over-content feel, though,
``Dining Out'' is a fascinating collage, a study of the profession
of restaurant criticism from the vantage point of scores of critics
and the chefs those critics review, and criticism's effect on the
booming restaurant business -- ultimately, a book-length panel
discussion on cuisine's growing prominence in our culture.
</P>
<P>
   This is Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page's third book in a
trilogy that includes ``Becoming a Chef'' and ``Culinary
Artistry,'' and its method is to heap on information via quotation
after quotation, broken up by the ubiquitous sidebars. In the very
first chapter, in addition to the brief introductory text we get a
time line, beginning in 1765, of restaurants and influential
guides; references to two First Amendment cases involving critics
sued for libel; an extended quotation from the Chicago Tribune
critic William Rice; the Esquire critic John Mariani picking
America's most influential restaurants; a history of restaurant
critics at The New York Times; movies that prominently feature food
and cooking; a list of celebrity restaurateurs and their
restaurants; and more than a dozen pull-out quotations in gold
print.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for anyone serious about food, all of it is
interesting. I was enthralled to learn the tricks of the restaurant
reviewer's trade -- how critics maintain anonymity, what they do
when they're discovered, how they became critics, how they take
notes (one critic speaks throughout dinner into his tie, where,
presumably, a microphone is housed), whether they call the chef
afterward to check details and confirm guesses.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, few critics have professional cooking
experience or formal culinary education, according to Dornenburg
and Page. One unnamed chef grumbles, ``Sometimes I resent that
after working for decades in this business, I have to wait for
marks like a schoolboy, and from people who know barely one-tenth
as much as I do about cooking.'' Norman Van Aken, chef-owner of
Norman's in Coral Gables, Fla., offers a suggestion: ``Food critics
should, perhaps, be licensed.'' Even some critics agree. David
Rosengarten, who writes for Gourmet magazine and has a Ph.D. in
dramatic literature from Cornell, comments that ``there should
almost be some sort of diploma program before you can actually
start to write about food in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Reichl, once a chef and restaurateur, now the restaurant
critic of The New York Times, is arguably the most powerful food
critic in the country. She entertainingly describes how she works,
how she schedules her days, including managing all her
reservations, given that at any one time she is researching 20
different restaurants. And then there is the anxiety inherent in
her position: she says she didn't sleep for three days after she
decided to remove one of Le Cirque's four stars (she later returned
it). But some concerns of the reviewer's life are not intellectual
or critical. ``In many ways, it's a very wearing, difficult,
invasive job because it's something you devote your whole body
to,'' says Phyllis Richman of The Washington Post. ``And you eat a
lot of bad food -- probably more bad food than anybody who cares
about food would choose to eat!''
</P>
<P>
   Reichl was photographed (in semi-disguise) for the cover of this
book, and her words conclude it: ``The great thing about great food
is that it can bring people real pleasure and enjoyment, every day.
And for all of us who are committed to making food even better in
this country, that is ultimately the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   To dismiss this book as a series of articulate comments
tediously strung together, a hodgepodge of sidebars with no clear
progression or core, would be easy but unfortunate. Offering
insiders' knowledge and illuminating insights from some of the
country's best chefs and food critics, the moderators Dornenburg
and Page have brought a generous curiosity and balance to a subject
of compulsive interest to a growing number of people.

 ------ 
 AS ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT 
 By A. O. SCOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the course of investigating a suspicious insurance claim,
Lorimer Black, the hero of William Boyd's new novel, ``Armadillo,''
encounters an entirely minor character named Francis Home. Noting
Home's olive complexion and ``dark crinkly hair,'' Lorimer wonders
about his background: ``Cypriot? Lebanese? Spanish? Egyptian?
Syrian? Greek? Like himself, Lorimer knew, there were many types of
Englishmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like himself: Lorimer Black, educated in Scotland and given on
occasion to appearing at dinner parties in a kilt, is not who he
seems to be. ``You're not Angus Black's youngest, are you?'' asks
Sir Simon Sherriffmuir, head of Fortress Sure, the insurance giant
with which Lorimer is affiliated, trying to place this outsider in
his own rarefied social world. Lorimer Black -- senior loss
adjuster, research subject at the Institute of Lucid Dreams, author
of a private memoir called ``The Book of Transfiguration,''
collector of antique military helmets and obsessive pursuer of the
mysterious actress Flavia Malinverno -- is not Angus Black's son.
He's not Lorimer Black at all, but rather Milomre Blocj, the son of
Bogdan Blocj. Milomre (Milo to those few who know his real
identity) comes from a large family of East European Gypsies who
run a prosperous car-and-van service on the outskirts of London.
</P>
<P>
   The multiculturalism of modern Britain -- and of London
especially -- has become a staple of British fiction and has
supplied it with new subjects and new energies. It's impossible,
for instance, to imagine most of Martin Amis's novels (some of
which ``Armadillo'' calls to mind) without the clatter and menace
of colliding versions of the English language. And indeed many of
the most inventive British novelists of recent years -- Salman
Rushdie, Hanif Kureishi, Caryl Phillips, Kazuo Ishiguro, James
Kelman -- have reinvigorated the idioms and widened the scope of
English literature by, in effect, colonizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd's previous books have also contributed to what might be
called the globalization of the English novel. From early satirical
efforts like the comedy of postcolonial diplomatic manners ``A Good
Man in Africa'' and the American road novel ``Stars and Bars'' to
ambitious, unclassifiable mature works like ``Brazzaville Beach''
and ``The Blue Afternoon,'' Boyd has shown himself to be at ease
with a startling diversity of settings and subjects. With
``Armadillo,'' he has come home, after ranging from Africa to the
Philippines to the American South, and found his native ground as
haunting and strange as any of them. But in spite of his taste for
the exotic, all his work, including this book, manifests some
welcome English virtues: understated wit, graceful prose and an
expert sense of pacing and narrative complication.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd's blithe cosmopolitanism may confuse American readers who,
steeped in ``Masterpiece Theater'' and recent film adaptations of
Jane Austen and E. M. Forster, associate England and its literature
above all with class. But the system of rigid social codes and
carefully maintained hierarchies that defined British life (and
animated its literature) for so long has been replaced, at least on
the evidence of this novel, by something we ex-colonials may find
more familiar -- a hectic, polyglot urban world of getting and
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Lorimer Black's London -- a rendering, it seems, of the capital
of Tony Blair's ``Cool Britannia'' -- is a city on the make,
bursting with new construction projects, trendy cafes and other
signs of affluence. At first, it seems a perfect habitat for the
ironical, deracinated Lorimer, who listens to African pop music,
drinks cappuccino and reinvents himself for each social, business
and romantic encounter by subtle alterations in his mode of dress.
He is successful at his job, in spite of the psychotic bullying of
his boss, an old-fashioned Englishman named Hogg, and diverted by a
pleasant, if not exactly passionate, affair with a divorcee named
Stella Bull. He has money for exquisite clothes and his beloved
helmets. He pays regular, if somewhat strained and chaotic, visits
to his family, and looks after his aging downstairs neighbor. His
only real problem is persistent insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   But then, through a sequence of events too complex to recount
here (the connections between which, in any case, are never fully
explained), everything in Lorimer's life begins to go wrong. His
reversal of fortune is attributed to a principle defined in one of
the reflective passages from his diary that punctuate the action of
the novel:
</P>
<P>
   ``Serendipity. From Serendip, a former name of Ceylon, now Sri
Lanka. A word coined by Horace Walpole, who had invented it based
on a folk tale whose heroes were always making discoveries of
things they were not in quest of. Ergo: serendipity, the faculty of
making happy and unexpected discoveries by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what is the opposite of Serendip, a southern land of spice
and warmth, lush greenery and hummingbirds, seawashed, sunbasted?
Think of another world in the far north, barren, icebound, cold, a
world of flint and stone. Call it Zembla. Ergo: zemblanity, the
opposite of serendipity, the faculty of making unhappy, unlucky and
expected discoveries by design. Serendipity and zemblanity: the
twin poles of the axis around which we revolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Zemblanity in Lorimer's life takes many forms: a paranoid rock
star selects him as a confidant; his car is vandalized, either by
the subject of one of his insurance investigations or by Flavia
Malinverno's jealous husband; he inherits his elderly neighbor's
dog; his father dies. But if zemblanity could be personified, it
would assume the shape of Torquil Helvoir-Jayne, an erstwhile
colleague of Lorimer's who, when taken alongside the thuggish Hogg
and the unprincipled Sir Simon, may convince you that the only
thing wrong with England these days is the English.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-ARMADILLO-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: the English.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helvoir-Jayne (it's pronounced -- oh, never mind) is one of the
great comic creations of recent literature; he belongs in the
gallery of British grotesques alongside the best efforts of Martin
Amis (Keith Talent, say, in ``London Fields'' or John Self in
``Money'') and his dad, Kingsley. The spectacularly boorish
Helvoir-Jayne attaches himself to Lorimer like a leech. He
inveigles Lorimer into helping him cover up one of his tawdry
adulteries, and then moves in with Lorimer when his wife throws him
out. And Torquil seems to be involved in some suspicious doings
involving Fortress Sure and one of its clients, for which Lorimer
ultimately will take the fall.
</P>
<P>
   TORQUIL'S opposite -- Serendip to his Zembla -- is the elusive
Flavia Malinverno, first glimpsed through the window of a passing
taxi and then in a Fortress Sure advertisement. Of course,
Lorimer's pursuit of her precipitates complications of its own,
thanks to her violent-tempered husband and her propensity to shade
and amplify the truth.
</P>
<P>
   But Lorimer confronts it all with philosophical detachment: ``I
do not mind contradictions, paradoxes, puzzles and ambiguities.
What is the point of 'minding' something as inevitable and
entrenched in our nature as our digestive system is in our body?''
Such an attitude will help the reader of this novel as well.
``Armadillo'' is full of loose ends, unsolved mysteries and red
herrings. But it is also charming, unsettling and sneakily,
serendipitously profound.

THE HOURS
</HEADLINE>
  By Michael Cunningham 
 230 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. $22 
 ------ 
 PARALLEL LIVES 
 By MICHAEL WOOD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a morning in June, a woman in her early 50's steps out into
the bright, busy city that she loves. She needs to buy flowers for
a party she is giving later in the day. She bumps into an old
acquaintance, remembers moments from her earlier life. Along with a
number of other people, she catches a glimpse of a celebrity, but
isn't sure who it is. She buys the flowers, goes home and her day
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Where are we? We could, of course, be in any one of a number of
days and cities, and the possibility itself is part of the answer
to the question. But we are quite definitely, recognizably, in two
novels: ``Mrs. Dalloway,'' by Virginia Woolf, and ``The Hours,'' by
Michael Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   There are differences. The city is London in one case and New
York in the other. The time is the 1920's; it is the 1990's. The
unknown celebrity is a prince, a queen or a prime minister in a
car; she is a movie star in a trailer. The woman in both novels is
called Clarissa, but in the later work Mrs. Dalloway is a nickname.
The chief difference, perhaps, is that no one in the first novel
can have read the second, whereas almost everyone in the second
seems to have read the first.
</P>
<P>
   There are eerie consequences of this impression. When ``The
Hours'' begins to repeat some of the darker events from ``Mrs.
Dalloway,'' is this a literary parallel, a hint at the limitations
of human plots and chances -- or a suggestion that the first novel
has caused the events in the second? When someone dies quoting from
Virginia Woolf's own suicide note, you think there must be even
further options. What's clear is that the relationship between the
two novels goes beyond allusion, and even beyond the modernist
habit of borrowing previous literary structures, which T. S. Eliot
called ``the mythical method.'' ``The Hours'' is haunted by ``Mrs.
Dalloway'' -- appropriately, because its theme is the haunting of
present lives by memories and books, by distant pasts and missed
futures, by novels and poems to be read and written.
</P>
<P>
   But so far I have described only one of Cunningham's story
lines, and there are three. Their final intersection is a thing of
such beauty and surprise that I can't reveal it here, but I can
sketch out the lines before their meeting. After the New York
Clarissa, we encounter a (fictional but entirely plausible) version
of Woolf herself in 1923. She and her husband, Leonard, are living
in Richmond, just outside London. The quiet is good for her health,
but she longs to get back to the city. She is writing ``Mrs.
Dalloway,'' at this point still called ``The Hours.'' Her sister,
Vanessa, arrives with her children. Virginia slips away, almost
takes a train to London, meets Leonard while she is waiting, goes
home. Somewhere along the way, she decides that Clarissa Dalloway
will not die in her novel; someone else will.
</P>
<P>
   This story is told in seven episodes, interspersed with eight
episodes of the New York day and with seven episodes evoking
another time and place and person. A young woman called Laura
Brown, pregnant for a second time, mother of a small boy, is
married to an amiable veteran of World War II -- the date is 1949
-- and lives a slightly bewildered life in a suburb of Los Angeles.
She has a moment of sudden, surprising sexual excitement with
another woman and takes off into a little fugue rather like Woolf's
projected one. She drives into the city, finds a room in a hotel
and reads -- ``Mrs. Dalloway,'' of course. Then she goes home to
her son and husband and a birthday celebration and sex. Goes home
this time, the implication is.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in New York, Clarissa thinks about her party. It
is for her friend Richard, an AIDS-stricken poet who is about to
receive an award. Clarissa lives with her lover, Sally, and has for
many years. An old gay friend drops by, aging, weeping. Clarissa's
beautiful daughter, involved with an older woman whom Clarissa
hates, also appears, apparently unfazed by the raging hostility
between her friend and her mother. Clarissa visits Richard to see
if he's ready for the party.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief prologue, the stories alternate in an intricate
sequence, rather like a rhyme scheme. The prologue recounts, mainly
from Woolf's point of view, the writer's stepping into an English
river to her death. The time of that event is 1941. I thought,
until I was a good way into the book, that this beginning was a
mistake: too heavy, quite apart from the stylistic risk. But what
happens to Cunningham's characters fully justifies this move. He
needs the shadow cast by Woolf's death, because it represents the
condition under which we find whatever light there is. The whole
book does sound a little fussy in description, an exercise in
echoes, but it doesn't read that way. Do we need to know ``Mrs.
Dalloway'' to get the gist of ``The Hours''? No, but ``need'' is
perhaps not the right word.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have to read ``Mrs. Dalloway'' before we can read ``The
Hours,'' and no amount of pedantic comparison-hunting will help us
understand it if we don't understand it already. But the
connections between the two books, after the initial, perhaps
overelaborate laying out of repetitions and divergences, are so
rich and subtle and offbeat that not to read ``Mrs. Dalloway''
after we've read ``The Hours'' seems like a horrible denial of a
readily available pleasure -- as if we were to leave a concert just
when the variations were getting interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's two earlier novels, ``A Home at the End of the
World'' and ``Flesh and Blood,'' are remarkable for the intensity
with which their characters experience their own strangeness -- as
if to be ordinary were an accomplishment, only rarely within reach.
From such a perspective, Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway seems to be waiting,
like an older sister: ``She always had the feeling that it was
very, very dangerous to live even one day.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times in ``The Hours'' when Cunningham follows Woolf's
cadences too closely: ``Here she is then, Clarissa thinks'';
``Here, then, is the party.'' The effect is one of pastiche rather
than of being haunted. There are moments too when the writing
doesn't rise to its own challenges, merely gesturing toward the
feelings on offer: ``She is sad for him, and strangely moved. She
manages an ironic smile.'' But the overall impression is that of a
delicate, triumphant glance, an acknowledgment of Woolf that takes
her into Cunningham's own territory, a place of late-century danger
but also of treasurable hours.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a mother both understanding of and unnerved by her son's
love for her: ``He knows. He must know. . . . He is devoted,
entirely, to the observation and deciphering of her, because
without her there is no world at all. . . . He will watch her
forever. He will always know when something is wrong. He will
always know precisely when and how much she has failed.'' It is
only on reflection that we realize that the mother's fear is also a
legacy, a gift to the child, something he will always know. But
reflection is where many of our chances for happiness lie, in the
memory not of what happened but of what was promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had seemed like the beginning of happiness,'' the New York
Clarissa thinks of her early relationship with Richard, ``and
Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, more than 30 years later, to
realize that it was happiness. . . . There is still that singular
perfection, and it's perfect in part because it seemed, at the
time, so clearly to promise more. Now she knows: That was the
moment, right then. There has been no other.''

  An Irreverent Look Behind the Scenes at Thirty-eight well,
Thirty-seven) Seasons of New York Jets Football Futility 
 By Gerald Eskenazi 
 Illustrated. 333 pp. New York: Simon &AMP; Schuster. $25. 
 ------ 
 JET LAG 
 By ROY BLOUNT JR. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has any other New York institution enjoyed so little glory as
the New York Jets? There was the one great upstart moment in the
1969 Super Bowl, when their flamboyant quarterback, Joe Namath,
guaranteed that the Jets would beat the heavily favored Baltimore
Colts and thn in fact they did. But although Namath himself, long
retired, remains an icon, the Jets have come to be known, for the
color of their jerseys but also for their tendency toward
mortification, as Gang Green.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say that the history of the franchise is
devoid of interest. ``I believe,'' says Gerald Eskenazi, who has
been a sportswriter at The New York Times for some 35 years, ``the
Jets are the most famous bad franchise in sports. But that doesn't
mean they are a team that cannot be enjoyed, even loved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets started out in 1960 as the Titans. Their owner was, as
Eskenazi tells us, the former sports announcer Harry Wismer, who
``once called The New York Times, where I had just started as a
copy boy.'' The conversation went like this:
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Hello, this is Harry Wismer. Who's this?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him my name. It was unknown to anyone outside of my
family and friends and a few people in the office, who were
impressed with the way I tore copy paper off the A.P. machine and
got the coffee order right. I had yet to have a byline.
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Jerry,' he shouted into the phone, 'you're doing a great
job!'
</P>
<P>
   ``His checks bounced, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The legendary quarterback Sammy Baugh, who coached the
profoundly unlegendary Titans for two years before moving on, tells
Eskenazi: ``The last time I saw Harry, I was coaching Houston and
we played the Jets in New York. And Harry called me and said,
'Could I ride to the game on the bus?' and I said, hell, yes. He
sat on our bench the whole first half, then he went up to the press
box. He came down a few minutes later and his nose was all bloodied
and he had blood all over his shirt. Someone had beat him up. It
was the last time I ever saw Harry, all bloodied.''
</P>
<P>
   New management, most notably the Hollywood talent packager Sonny
Werblin, rescued the Titans from bankruptcy in 1963 and renamed
them the Jets, not because ``jet planes were flying over Shea
Stadium every 45 seconds throughout a game'' -- the Jets played
their first season not at Shea but at the old Polo Grounds -- but
to celebrate the jet age and to rhyme with the popular Mets. When
the Jets did move to Shea, they found it necessary to practice at
least once in a vacant lot near the stadium because the Mets
wouldn't let them use the field. Weeb Ewbank, who was the Jets'
coach at the time, recalls kids coming to watch this practice
session: ``I said to one, 'Sonny, will you move your bicycle?' And
he said, 'No, it's as much my park as it is yours.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Werblin (who preferred not to discuss show business -- when
asked what Elizabeth Taylor was like, he said: ``Short. Very
short'') signed up Namath, supposedly for $427,000 over three
years, an extraordinarily high figure for the time. (Namath was
represented in the negotiations by a law firm called Bite, Bite &AMP;
Bite.) Eskenazi points out that the contract included the list
price of a Lincoln Continental and several bonus clauses. During
the festive announcement of Namath's signing at Toots Shor's
saloon, the Jets' team doctor took Namath into the men's room and
examined his much-injured knees for the first time. He emerged to
tell Ewbank, ``Hope we've got another quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   NAMATH'S gimpy legs didn't prevent him from developing into a
sweet-throwing, high-living wonder man, ``as he became the first
quarterback ever to throw for 4,000 yards in a 14-game season . . .
as he took the field wearing white shoes, sporting long hair,
growing a Fu Manchu mustache, wearing pantyhose in a commercial,
donning a mink, telling of his white llama bedroom rug.''
Unfortunately, that passage, which would suggest a considerable
delay of game, is not unrepresentative of Eskenazi's prose in this
book, which gives the appearance of having been written in
considerably more haste, or at least with less care, than his news
dispatches in The Times. ``The Jets I came to write about were like
life as Kafka or George Carlin might have pictured it -- only more
so,'' Eskenazi writes. Hard to know what to make of that.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as the years go by, the Jets' history becomes a bit of
a blur, but ``Gang Green'' includes a number of nice anecdotes.
There was a punter, Curley Johnson, who the night before the Super
Bowl dreamed that his punts went straight up in the air and landed
at his feet. A defensive back, Johnny Sample, who intercepted a
pass meant for a Baltimore receiver and then tapped him on the head
with the ball, saying, ``This is what you're lookin' for.'' A wide
receiver, George Sauer, who carried a copy of Camus's ``Myth of
Sisyphus'' in his pocket during training camp. A head coach, the
aforementioned Ewbank, who stepped on a LeRoy Neiman sideline
sketch with a muddy shoe, looked down and said, ``LeRoy, you're
improving.'' A defensive end, Mark Gastineau, who built up his abs
so that they could be counted through his tight jersey, because he
believed that ``all strength comes from your stomach.'' (``There
was a bit of the fourth dimension about Mark,'' Eskenazi writes.
``He was fascinated with American Indian lore.'')
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the book covers the early, crazy years. The
final stage, as Bill Parcells takes over as head coach and begins
to enforce severe professionalism, is relatively upbeat: ``Perhaps,
just perhaps, the long strange saga of the New York Jets would have
a happy ending.'' A Jet fan's spirits, presumably, are lifted. The
reader misses Harry Wismer.

THE VICTORS
</HEADLINE>
  Eisenhower and His Boys: The Men of World War II 
 By Stephen E. Ambrose 
 Illustrated. 396 pp. New York: Simon &AMP; Schuster. $28 
 ------ 
 THE MEN WHO BEAT HITLER 
 By NATHANIEL TRIPP 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen E. Ambrose's latest book follows the World War II Allied
campaign in Europe from the appointment of Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower as commander of the European Theater of Operations to
the final surrender of Germany, seven days after Hitler's suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose fans will have a distinct sense of deja vu; ``The
Victors'' is largely composed of huge blocks of text from five of
Ambrose's previous histories: ``Eisenhower,'' ``Pegasus Bridge,''
``Band of Brothers,'' ``D-Day'' and ``Citizen Soldiers.'' Still,
there is a lot to be said for having it all under one cover, for
combining Ambrose's compelling portrait of Eisenhower's leadership
with the vivid experiences of the infantrymen, and following the
campaign from conception to conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger obstacle for me is that although I am only 10 years
younger than Ambrose, we are of separate generations. While he was
teaching, writing and researching military history, I was leading a
platoon in Vietnam. Like many in my generation, I felt betrayed by
what had once seemed heroic. It has been painful for me to read
about war ever since. I am always horrified, and never inspired.
But then those of us who served in Vietnam are notorious for our
cynicism, our distrust of authority. His was the good war, ours the
bad one, and I read ``The Victors'' with the hope of narrowing what
became known as the generation gap.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose starts with Eisenhower, which narrows the gap for me.
Almost everyone loved Eisenhower, and he firmly set the standards
for leadership. Ambrose quotes a remark Eisenhower made on the
subject of pacifism -- ``I doubt whether any of these people, with
their academic or dogmatic hatred of war, detest it as much as I
do'' -- and when Eisenhower tells young lieutenants they must be a
father for their men it strikes a hauntingly familiar chord. The
quality of leadership, echoed down through the ranks, is a central
theme. So are unity of purpose and the unit cohesion that results.
</P>
<P>
   While I don't envy another man's war, we didn't have that in
Vietnam, and the lack of it led to poor morale, occasional
atrocities and defeat. So I can readily relate to these themes of
leadership. I also recognize the intimate details of the
infantryman's experience: digging in, using the terrain, firing and
maneuvering. I am fascinated by the similarity of tactics, the
characteristically American reliance on heavy firepower if the
infantrymen can be spared; even the logistics of preparation can be
mesmerizing, as they are in real life. But then the invasion is
launched and men begin to die, first by the tens, then by the
hundreds and thousands. As is always true, nobody is really
prepared for the enormity of war, and no text can fully capture it.
Here the generation gap begins to widen again.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose is a superb historian. He has the details and he has the
voice. When, however, he writes about the citizen soldier, he
himself all too often sounds more like the professional soldier. He
has an admirable Eisenhower-like loyalty toward the men and a
soldier's focus on the objective ahead. He assembles a huge array
of details to support his mission, drawing heavily from interviews
and unit histories. But in the compression of thousands of pages
from his earlier books into just under 400 here, many illuminating
and insightful details have been lost and jingoism comes more to
the fore. The highest praise he can deliver to one of his heroes is
to compare him to Sergeant York, and he does it twice.
</P>
<P>
   But war brings out the worst in people as well as the best, and
behavior that is considered heroic in war would often be considered
sociopathic if not totally insane in another setting. When Ambrose
allows the men to speak for themselves, they often express very
human feelings: terror, disgust and shame as well as the flush of
victory. ``Whatever you do in this book, don't go making me into a
bloody hero,'' a British sergeant he is interviewing says. But then
Ambrose replies: ``Sergeant Thornton, I don't make heroes. I only
write about them.'' Was he really listening?
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose has said elsewhere that war is a political act, and his
accounts here superficially avoid the politics of war, even as they
deliver the message that there is something innately superior about
the soldiers of a democracy. This is a familiar theme for me as
well, because this is what we, too, were told as young officers. It
may be true, but surely all armies send similar messages to their
troops. These are messages that can lead societies toward pretty
serious misadventures when politicians are added to the brew.
Ambrose's projection of such a militaristic view thins his book's
air of authenticity. I'm afraid that at such moments he contributes
less to the history of war than to the culture of it.

 A Dream Deferred 
 The Second Betrayal of Black Freedom in America 
 By Shelby Steele 
 185 pp. New York: HarperCollins Publishers. $24  By MICHAEL ANDERSON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the subject is race, this land of free speech is deathly
afraid of plain talk. A legacy of rebellion and resentment,
complacency and commiseration has us tongue-tied; afraid to speak
our minds, we mystify ourselves with a bedazzling lexicon of code
words, euphemism and soothing gobbledygook.
</P>
<P>
   Consider ``diversity,'' for example. ``No two people define it
the same way,'' Shelby Steele writes in ``A Dream Deferred,'' his
second collection of essays. ``It is a word that is useful for the
very specific thing that it does not mean, which is racial
prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the rest of the current cliches -- ``inclusion,''
``pluralism,'' even the ubiquitous ``multiculturalism.'' For
Steele, each is a word with no meaning except that it disassociates
people ``from the stigma of racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele argues that the never-ending discussion of race relations
is, far too often, a sham battle of empty rhetoric. ``American
racial policy,'' he writes, has ``a decidedly 'post-modern' feel.
Its subtext is more important than its text.'' What is unspeakable,
Steele contended in his first book, ``The Content of Our
Character'' (1990), is white guilt and black fear -- the need of
white people for redemption from a history of oppression, the needs
of blacks to confront ``integration shock . . . the shock of being
suddenly accountable on strictly personal terms.'' And so black and
white Americans have entered into a powerful and unspoken collusion
to elude the sacrifices and risks that true racial harmony demands.
``This fear,'' he added, ``is the measure of our racial chasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, we live in a brave new world in which the cure for
discrimination is more discrimination, in which a quota mentality
is commonplace, in which good intentions form new cobblestones on
the pathway to perdition. Steele's tone has accordingly hardened.
His new essays take polemical relish in their finger-pointing at an
emperor wearing no kinte cloth. ``The president of a public
university could simply say the word 'diversity' and be justified
in excluding people from his university solely because of their
race,'' he writes. (``After all, diversity has no darkness or evil.
Thus people who serve it can do no wrong.'') In one of his sharpest
passages, Steele imagines the fate of a young Charlie Parker
subjected to a contemporary tutoring program taught by a white
college student:
</P>
<P>
   ``The tutor learns that Parker's father drank too much and
abandoned the family, and that his mother has had an affair with a
married man. Young Charlie is often late to his tutorial sessions.
Secretly the tutor comes to feel that probably his real purpose is
therapeutic, since the terrible circumstances of Charlie's life
make it highly unlikely that he will ever be focused enough to
master the complex keying system of the saxophone or learn to read
music competently.'' Charlie, having ``heard from many that the
saxophone -- a European instrument -- really has little to do with
who he is,'' gives up. The tutor is sympathetic. '' 'Can you
imagine,' he says, shaking his head in disbelief at himself,
'teaching saxophone to a poor black kid from Kansas City?' ''
</P>
<P>
   This sassy satire illustrates Steele's central thesis: What
white people really want is not to reform an unjust society but to
restore their own sense of virtue. Expunging that shame has been
the silent agenda of American social policy for a generation.
Indeed, Steele contends, much so-called reform is a continuation of
white supremacy by other means. ``The liberal looks at black
difficulties -- high crime rates, weak academic performance,
illegitimacy rates and so on -- and presumes them to be the result
of victimizing forces beyond the control of blacks.'' By this
``specific act of imagination,'' to ``always imagine blacks outside
the framework of individual responsibility,'' Steele writes, ``is
also to imagine them as inherently inferior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Double standards, preferential treatment, provisions for
'cultural difference' and various kinds of entitlement all
constitute a pattern of exceptionalism that keeps blacks (and other
minorities) down by tolerating weakness at every juncture where
strength is expected of others,'' Steele writes. ``Then, after
black weakness has been massaged, accepted, understood and felt
for, people wonder why the infamous gap between blacks and whites
on tests and other performance measures won't close. The answer, of
course, is that nobody seriously asks that it be closed.'' He is
particularly incisive on how good intentions have become an end in
themselves (``President Clinton gets credit for supporting
affirmative action, not for making it work''). Both races have
allowed themselves to be seduced by the siren song of
victimization: ``Whites agree to stay on this hook for an illusion
of redemption, and blacks agree to keep them there for an illusion
of power.'' But, as Steele wisely concludes, ``Victimhood lasts
only as long as it is accepted, and to exploit it for an empty
sovereignty is to accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For America to survive its struggle with racial shame, it will
have to stop cringing before it,'' Steele writes. ``We are no
longer trying to redeem the United States or resolve our tortuous
racial history; we are dealing with poor reading skills or a lack
of preparedness for employment or too many pregnant teen-age girls
made that way by too many young men.'' His book would benefit from
more attention to such social realities. History, like biology, is
destiny, and more attention to its patterns could only serve to
clarify the present. (For example, perhaps the different styles of
discrimination in the North and South evoked distinct
counterstrategies: a legal challenge to de jure segregation, social
engineering to the de facto version.) And Steele's agonizing over
principles too often takes on the tone of a scolding schoolmarm;
like many conservative critics, he seems all too quick to impute a
deliberate moral delinquency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Steele assuredly is correct when he declares that
integration is 20th-century America's ``elaboration of democracy.''
Too often confused with assimilation -- that (somehow) all of us
would wind up bleached blond -- integration is a dynamic process;
in little more than a generation, American society has transformed
itself. In our rather stumbling way, we continue this process. As
Steele reminds us, ``the profoundness of our relationship to
democratic principles despite our many failings and duplicities''
is what constitutes our national identity. ``The United States has
to accept its past as proof of its need for principles today.''

MADNESS ON THE COUCH
</HEADLINE>
  Blaming the Victim in the Heyday of Psychoanalysis 
 By Edward Dolnick 
 Illustrated. 368 pp. New York: Simon &AMP; Schuster. $25 
 ------ 
 TALKING CURE? 
 By DEREK BICKERTON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bleeding. Trepanning. Castration. Electroshock. Powdered unicorn
horns. Horse-blood injections. An ice pick through the eye socket.
Incarceration with snakes. Exposure to extreme temperatures.
Artificially induced epilepsy. Insulin coma.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a catalogue of ancient and modern tortures. All
these methods were used at various times, by supposedly expert and
well-meaning physicians, to treat sufferers from mental illness.
Small wonder, then, that when members of a respected school of
thought claimed they could cure psychoses by simply talking,
clinicians and the public responded with relief and approbation.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Madness on the Couch,'' Edward Dolnick, formerly the chief
science writer for The Boston Globe and now a contributing editor
for Health magazine, describes how, in the 1950s and '60s, Freudian
psychoanalysts sought to adapt their master's theories to treat
schizophrenia, autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The title
is potentially ambiguous: was the true madness that of the
patients, or did the doctors themselves, blinded by arrogance and
self-righteousness, embark on what now seems a course of lunatic
folly? Seldom has there been a more pungent illustration of the
adage ``The road to hell is paved with good intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by public acclaim and a virtual absence of critical
scrutiny, truly believing that all mental illness could be healed
if the patient could be made to confront its (purely mental)
causes, many of Freud's followers boldly entered fields where Freud
had carefully refrained from going -- even where he had warned
against going.
</P>
<P>
   Two fields were fraught with special pitfalls. Schizophrenia
affects mainly young adults; autism is diagnosed in young children.
If one rules out biology (and Freudians dismissed it on principle),
parental indiscretion is the only plausible culprit. The
possibility of ``a schizophrenogenic mother,'' casually mentioned
in a paper by a noted psychiatrist, Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, was
seized on and developed into elaborate profiles of
schizophrenia-causing families. Though it was the brainchild of a
clinical amateur, the anthropologist Gregory Bateson, the ``double
bind,'' a Catch-22 message from parent to child, received equally
enthusiastic acceptance. As for autistic children, their apparently
willful self-isolation must reflect the hostility and indifference
of ``refrigerator parents'' -- cold, mechanical creatures who,
according to Bruno Bettelheim, wished that their children ``should
not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The belief in parental cause soon passed into the popular
culture, resulting in untold agony to countless innocent people.
For Freudian psychotherapy had double binds, but no double blinds:
its devotees did not take the elementary precaution of comparing
parents of schizophrenics or autistic children with other parents,
let alone test whether ``blind'' observers, ignorant of which group
individuals belonged to, could correctly assign them on the basis
of objective data.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Freudians might have survived this lack of empirical
support, even the absence of any nontemporary improvement in their
patients, but for developments outside therapy altogether. Evidence
accumulated that biological factors did indeed predispose
individuals to schizophrenia and other disorders. Simultaneously, a
series of largely serendipitous discoveries by practicing
clinicians revealed that for many conditions, medication could do
far more, far more quickly, than psychoanalysis. Acclaimed
therapists suddenly found themselves facing huge malpractice suits
for failing to prescribe what were already proven treatments.
</P>
<P>
   This bare summary of Dolnick's theme, however, does his book
scant justice. He brings to his task a formidable array of
strengths. Interviews with Freudians, anti-Freudians and their
patients, as well as an exhaustive reading of relevant literature,
provide his persuasive account with vivid anecdotes, from the
bizarre ritual demanded by Howard Hughes (an obsessive-compulsive
in later life) before opening canned food to the naive excursion,
``akin to the idle speculation of nannies at the park,'' that the
renowned ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen made into autism. A diverse
cast of characters is captured in brilliant thumbnail vignettes:
the birdlike, charismatic R. D. Laing, who at the end delivered a
lecture ``drunk and stoned''; the dogged young doctor Leonard
Heston, who, when refused a Federal grant, did the research (on
children of schizophrenic mothers who were given up for adoption)
on his own time, money and barnstorming ingenuity; and many more.
Dolnick's narrative moves smoothly and effortlessly, never
lingering too long on any topic yet never leaving a topic until its
full significance has been explored. Despite its somber theme, the
book is a delight to read.
</P>
<P>
   But just what is its significance? In his prologue, Dolnick
limits his goal to describing the excesses of Freud's followers; he
explicitly disavows any intention of debunking psychotherapy, which
has helped people to ``cope with a divorce, or a child's death, or
a vague but oppressive feeling of inadequacy.'' But here, in a rare
misstep, he seems to confuse psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.
Freudian psychoanalysis is but one variety of psychotherapy; other
approaches -- behavioral, humanistic, cognitive -- eschew the
deep-analytic, symbol-chasing style of Freudians and Jungians for
more practical, problem-solving techniques. These alternative
therapies, which he never distinguishes, are far likelier than
analysis to be used, and useful, in dealing with grief, marital
problems and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Dolnick's disclaimer seems aimed at avoiding accusations of
Freud-bashing. His earlier chapters, where he lays the groundwork
for his assault on therapeutic hubris, show that all the errors of
Freud's disciples -- overconfidence, dogmatism, indifference to
empirical proofs, roseate evaluations of treatment outcomes,
willingness to interpret a patient's ``No'' as either ``No'' or
``Yes,'' whichever fitted the analysis -- were already latent in
Freud's own theory and practice. The excesses Dolnick recounts
sprang not from personal failings of individual therapists but from
the nature of their approach.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the book leaves one with a disturbing thought.
Practices that now seem reckless and sometimes downright cruel were
hailed in their day as pinnacles of medical achievement. Which of
today's lauded practices, one wonders, will stand condemned a few
decades hence?

CENTRAL SQUARE
</HEADLINE>
  By George Packer 
 348 pp. St. Paul: Graywolf Press. $24.95 
 ------ 
 THE LEFT BANK 
 By RAND RICHARDS COOPER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   American novelists love the city, and they love hating it, too.
From Theodore Dreiser to Jay McInerney, writers have plumbed our
ambivalence toward urban life so often, and so eagerly, that it's
tempting to call the American novel an urban art form. One doubts
cities always appreciate the attention. Cambridge, Mass., at any
rate, will not rush to embrace ``Central Square,'' George Packer's
mordant look at life along the left bank of the Charles.
</P>
<P>
   On display in ``Central Square'' is not upscale, Victorian,
boutique-and-cafe Cambridge but the grittier middle stretch of
Massachusetts Avenue, a no man's land of the benighted. Here the
raucous contrasts that novelists once discovered in urban life --
vice and hope, squalor and splendor -- have given way to
postindustrial anomie. Factories have closed down; rumors circulate
of a casino in the works; shelters and mental health centers
constitute the only growth industry.
</P>
<P>
   Packer follows a trio of characters into this drab panorama.
Paula Voorhees is a clinical social worker sliding into burnout.
The therapy she dispenses to the homeless and the battered strikes
her as farcically inadequate -- a Band-Aid applied to the gushing
wounds of the disenfranchised. In her own life, self-protectiveness
drifts toward cynicism; she fears being single (``a condition --
suppressed panic with a whiff of cat hair'') but sleeps with a man
she's careful not to risk loving. After work, back at her dingy
apartment, she and the super's needy, abused wife exchange blunt
insults, and she goes away refreshed: ``It felt like her first real
human contact of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   A different panic stalks Eric Barnes. A novelist, he has three
money-losing books on his resume and is stuck, dismally, partway
through a fourth. His career is stalled, his wife is pregnant, his
study is being remodeled into a nursery, and when he dares to
renegotiate his tiny advance, his editor humbles him with revenue
printouts. Increasingly, all Eric can see about his friends is how
successful they are -- like the lawyer who is ``deeply sentimental
in a way, Eric thought, made possible by money.''
</P>
<P>
   Packer excels at portraying the mired and anxious:
college-educated 30-somethings whose easy idealism is yielding to
bleak encroachments of failure. There's more humor to this than you
might expect -- like Eric's perception of what having children does
to one's parties (``The grown-ups discussed toilet training while
Zach smeared goat cheese on the leather ottoman'') or Paula's take
on a patient who confides homicidal feelings (``This was progress,
but it felt like training a drugged bear to perform tricks designed
to put her life at risk''). In his study, Eric soothes himself by
contemplating vengeance on a rat scratching behind the wall, even
as he conducts a running argument with a radio-show guest touting a
book called ``Hold On, You Can Have Everything!'' A generous irony
marks the best moments of ``Central Square.'' These are characters
whose last redoubt, in the face of despair, is a weary, rueful
verve.
</P>
<P>
   When Packer tries to figure out what to do with these
characters, however, things get a little dodgy. Through a chance
encounter in the Widener library at Harvard, Paula and Eric meet,
and soon become lovers. Their illicit trysts take up a lot of
terrain in ``Central Square,'' and it isn't very rich soil.
``Falling into an affair would be a . . . revolt, and yet he also
knew that the moment with Paula by the river was the best thing
about him -- cheerful, loving, generous in spirit.'' Packer seems
to lose sight of how steeply we will discount Eric's passion as
mere flight from the responsibilities of fatherhood. At times, the
novel turns you into a bad therapist, impatient with Eric's
self-deceptions; the narrative voice occasionally resembles that of
a colluding enabler.
</P>
<P>
   But the weakest part of ``Central Square'' is the plot Packer
weaves around his third character, an enigmatic African-American
named Joe. Returning from a stay as a volunteer in Africa, Joe
decides, obscurely, to pass himself off as Amouzou, a village
shaman. Soon he wins a reputation in Central Square. (``They say he
gets inside you,'' a man tells Eric, ``changes your shape or
something, fixes your problems.'') He joins a shadowy organization,
known as the Community, that has been papering the streets with
cryptic exhortations on blue fliers. Part encounter group, part
populist uprising, it is led by Paula's sleazy boss, Peter Fine, a
would-be ``therapeutic rock star'' with a talent for stoking the
resentments of the underclass. Packer seems to be making a point
about therapy's potential as a language of demagoguery. But Fine's
rabble-rousing is so banal (``You and I need to have the courage to
heal on the next level'') that you don't believe anyone could be
``mesmerized,'' or that Paula, watching a crowd of listeners, would
feel ``a shiver'' of fear. Such scenes seem contrived.
</P>
<P>
   The same holds for the portrayal of Joe himself. Though Packer
supplies him with distant memories of a childhood with foster
parents killed in a car accident, Joe seems almost entirely
metaphorical, deployed to play ironically against the other two
main characters. Is he the true healer? Or is he the true writer,
who can shape-shift into any new identity? Or perhaps he's a
sacrificial sufferer, bearing the burden of everyone else's
inauthenticity and pain? When Eric, having discovered the truth
about Joe, recognizes ``something of himself'' in the man's
masquerade and exhorts him to ``let them know who you are,'' the
encounter seems stage-managed in order to deliver the realization;
its meaning hasn't been earned on the ground but imposed from
above. The magic of fiction, William Gass once wrote, is that when
we read it, ``thought seems to grow a body.'' But as ``Central
Square'' boils away toward its overheated denouement, the
characters get thinner and thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Packer's novel can be read as a running argument with the
therapeutic culture -- its personalizing of the political, its
rejection of tragic and comic perspectives in favor of
``irony-free'' personal-growth platitudes. And yet as ``Central
Square'' proceeds, its own irony leaks away; the narrative voice
loses its edge. Eric finally comes before the Community to be
cross-examined about his shortcomings. ``He was glad they had made
him name his issues. He felt hopeful, he didn't know why or for
what.'' It's as if Packer has capitulated, lost the argument, been
swallowed by the monster he set out to slay. Fair warning, perhaps,
for irony in the age of therapy: novelist, heal thyself.

 CZAR VASILY? 
 BY ORLANDO FIGES 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day in the summer 1983 Oleg Filatov, the son of a
schoolteacher in Orenburg, a town in the steppes of Russia, thought
he learned he was the grandson of Nicholas II, the last Czar of
Russia. He had been out fishing with his father, Vasily, when he
first noticed scars on the older man and began to question him.
``There was a revolution,'' the czarevich began.
</P>
<P>
   Vasily was then in his 70's -- he died five years later -- and
over the next several months he disclosed his secret history to his
family. On the night of July 17, 1918, when, according to the
historical record, the Czar and the Czarina, their five children
and four servants were shot dead by the Bolsheviks in
Yekaterinburg, the 14-year-old boy somehow managed to survive and
escape with the help of two friendly Bolshevik executioners.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to Shadrinsk, 100 miles away, where he was adopted
by a peasant family named Filatov. The czarevich was famously a
hemophiliac, and several times had nearly bled to death after minor
falls he had taken while playing. Yet his gunshot wounds
miraculously healed, thanks to herbal remedies and a diet of raw
meat prescribed by the tribal peoples of the north. For the next
few years he roamed as an orphan across the country, settling in
1930 in the Tyumen region of Siberia, where he trained as a
teacher. In 1967 Filatov and his wife moved to Orenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Filatov is not the only person who thinks he should be
czar. Recently ``Blood Relative,'' by Michael Gray, was published
in London. That book, like ``The Escape of Alexei,'' which gives
Filatov's account, claims to be ``the true story'' of the czarevich
and ``written by his son.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new. Ever since the execution of the Romanovs
there have been pretenders to their nonexistent throne. Aleksei has
popped up in Siberia, Australia, New Zealand, Miami and Vancouver.
Today Moscow is home to several of his sons. And that's not to
mention the Anastasiyas. None of the claimants has not turned out
to be a crank. All their stories have broken on hard facts. First
there are the testimonies of the execution squad: that Aleksei was
shot several times and then bayoneted in the heart; that the
corpses of Aleksei and Mariya, his sister, were burned in a pit;
and that all the others, including Anastasiya, were buried in the
woods near Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the forensic tests that were carried out on their
skeletons after they were exhumed in 1991. By comparing their DNA
with that of relatives of Czar Nicholas II and the Czarina,
Aleksandra, scientists are as sure as they can be that the bones
reburied in St. Petersburg this summer are the bones of the
Romanovs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Escape of Alexei'' is fronted (to say written would be
flattery) by three Russian ``scientists,'' its publisher is at
pains to point out. But their scientific credentials are rather
dubious. Igor Lysenko (not to be confused with Trofim Lysenko,
Stalin's fraudulent biologist) is a nuclear physicist and graduate
of the Theological Academy who advised the Commission of the Holy
Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church on the canonization of the
Czar. Georgi Egorov is an engineer and a ``prize-winning skier,''
the preface tells us, so he ``is well qualified to answer the
question of how the czarevich, an adolescent suffering from
hemophilia, may have survived the execution to live another 70
years.'' And Vadim Petrov is called ``a candidate of medical
sciences'' who wrote his dissertation on identifying dead bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The science in their book does not amount to much. First, in
fact, they parade as historians, giving us, they claim, a ``fresh
perspective'' on the events, ``free from prejudice.'' But what
follows in their historical chapters is the familiar account of the
Czar's abdication, his family's imprisonment and execution -- which
has been recounted better many times before. Their only new idea is
patently absurd: that the deposed Czar was no threat to the
Bolsheviks, who therefore had a motive to let his poor son go. Much
of the book is then taken up with tedious homely reminiscences by
Oleg and his sisters about their father, illustrated with family
snaps from the Filatov album.
</P>
<P>
   The ``scientific evidence,'' when it finally appears, is
risible. First the authors claim to ``prove'' that it would have
been ``impossible'' to burn the corpses of Aleksei and Mariya --
largely on the grounds that it was wet that night and it takes a
long time to burn a human body. Then they wheel on two specialists
who testify that both the handwriting and the photograph images of
Vasily and Aleksei belong (``with a high degree of certainty'') to
the same man.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone can see that they are chalk and cheese. Filatov's
handwriting is obviously different, even though the writing style
of the class to which he claims to belong was extremely
standardized. Then there is the minor problem (which the authors
don't discuss) that, according to his birth certificate, Filatov
was born in December 1907 and the czarevich in July 1904.
</P>
<P>
   On this basis virtually anybody with a Russian grandpa could
make a claim to the Romanov throne. But there is one way for Oleg
Filatov to prove his genealogy -- a DNA test. Why has he not taken
one? More important, why did his publisher not insist on one before
agreeing to sell his story?
</P>
<P>
   When Filatov first told his tale in 1988 he was a worker at
Leningrad airport. Since then he has risen to become a bank
employee. But all the same, one can't help thinking that the lure
of money has played some part here. He may not win the Romanov
fortune, but if the publicity his publisher has lavished on this
book is anything to go by, he will make a fortune from book clubs.
</P>
<P>
   What makes myths more salable than history? Why do we persist in
believing fantasies in the face of all the facts? It is simply
inconceivable that anyone survived that brutal execution. Fifty
shots were fired at 11 people and all their bodies subsequently
bayoneted. Yet legends are retold of miraculous escapes -- first of
Anastasiya and then, when she was dug up along with the others, of
the Czarevich. Oleg Filatov or Michael Gray -- neither is
believable and neither is the last adventurer.

 &UR; INSIDE THE THIRD REICH &QL; 
 &UR; BY PETER GAY &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Aufbau-Verlag, a Berlin publisher once best known for
the cheap editions of the German classics it threw on the East
German market, brought out a two-volume diary covering the Nazi
years, 1933 to 1945, by Victor Klemperer, a professor of Romance
languages at Dresden Technical University. Despite its formidable
bulk (almost 1,700 pages) and steep price (well over $60), the book
became an astonishing best seller and has remained one -- hardcover
sales exceed 160,000 -- and has created a Klemperer industry, which
so far has produced an abridged edition designed for schools and a
prize-winning radio adaptation. An ambitious 13-part television
series is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   This extraordinary appeal to Germans is not hard to understand.
The Nazi tyranny has been thoroughly explored in general histories,
monographs, memoirs, lectures, films, exhibitions, television
programs. But even the reader familiar with Holocaust material must
be gripped by these pages. They offer a report from the interior
that tells the horrifying story of the evolving Nazi persecution of
Germany's Jews, and (though of course to a far lesser extent) of
Germany's gentiles, with a concrete, vivid power that is, and I
think will remain, unsurpassed. What is more, Klemperer's frequent
encounters with ``good Germans'' may serve to relieve part of the
guilt that responsible Germans continue to feel for the Nazis'
crimes. ``I Will Bear Witness'' is an intensely German document;
with Martin Chalmers's fluent, trustworthy translation, delicate
abridgment and informative notes, English-speaking readers now have
the first installment of a fascinating self-portrait and an equally
fascinating portrait of a regime whose consequences haunt the world
to this day. To read Klemperer's almost day-by-day account is a
hypnotic experience; the whole, hard to put down, is a true murder
mystery -- from the perspective of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, 1933, Victor Klemperer summed up the traumatic
events of the past few weeks in the diary he had been keeping
faithfully for years: ``January 30. Hitler Chancellor. What, up to
election Sunday on March 5, I called terror, was a mild prelude.''
The day before that election, rigged by the Nazis with giant
propaganda and intimidation, Klemperer had heard Hitler speak and
wondered at his delivery: ``But the tone! The unctuous bawling,
truly bawling, of a priest.'' And he anxiously asked himself: ``How
long will I keep my post?''
</P>
<P>
   Klemperer had every right to be worried; the political shocks he
so tersely reported were a catastrophe for him. He was a liberal
citizen who voted for the small, ever waning party of
intellectuals, the Democrats; he was a sworn critic of doctrinaire
political systems, among which he included Nazism, Communism and,
rather perversely, Zionism; he was a cultural aristocrat offended
by Hitlerite vulgarity. He was also a Jew, if only by the
``racial'' reckoning the Nazis employed, for he had converted to
Protestantism as a young man. And his wife, Eva, was, in Nazi
jargon, a ``full-blooded Aryan.'' Indeed, a Nazi regulation, and,
later, the much criticized Allied bombing of Dresden, were to save
Klemperer's life: his wife's ``racial purity'' exempted her husband
from deportation to the east and almost certain death until early
1945, and amid the destruction and the chaos in Dresden, Eva
removed the yellow star on Klemperer's coat, allowing him to pose
as a German gentile who had lost all his papers. Who can deny that
history is full of unexpected, even tasteless ironies?
</P>
<P>
   Victor Klemperer was what the Germans call a problematische
Personlichkeit, a problematic personality. He was the youngest of
nine children, his father a modern Reform rabbi, his mother a
housewife whom he virtually ignores in his diary. Unlike his three
older brothers, especially his eldest, Georg, who became an eminent
surgeon, he long vacillated about what profession to adopt. He
tentatively explored several options: a commercial, a literary and,
in the end, an academic career. The first was an abject failure;
the second a surprising half success as he poured out articles,
fiction and anthologies and traveled across the country giving
lectures on literary topics; the third an incongruous mixture of
gratifying haven and grating disappointment. In 1920, at 39, he was
appointed to his chair at Dresden Technical University, recently
created and lacking the prestige of more time-honored institutions.
</P>
<P>
   One can see why he did not do better, quite apart from being a
Jew, or an ex-Jew, which was still a handicap in the academy during
the Weimar Republic: he wrote indefatigably, making voluminous
contributions to collective histories of French literature,
distinguishing himself mainly as a lucid writer and an opinionated
guide -- hardly the kind of serious, convoluted scholarship that
brought a German professor fame and promotion. And he lacked
originality; his most striking view was an insistent, quite
unhistorical, contempt for Rousseau, whom, as his diary testifies,
he dismissed as a proto-Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   Klemperer was a hypochondriac, certain that he was doomed to die
young. This made him greet the death of colleagues, preferably
younger ones, with a certain satisfaction. His frequent ``heart
troubles'' must have been innocuous palpitations: certainly the
doctors he consulted firmly assured him that he was perfectly
healthy. But he enjoyed his psychosomatic symptoms in the company
of his wife, who suffered from crippling depressions and often woke
up with screaming fits. Her impassioned insistence on building a
house outside Dresden, a project she pursued as though her life
literally depended on it, documents an almost demented
obsessiveness. Forcibly retired in 1935, robbed of most of his
pension, her husband thought the venture unaffordable but dared not
stop it. And so, under nerve-racking financial and emotional
difficulties, they built their castle for two. Eva Klemperer's
ailments condemned her husband to do most of the housework --
shopping, cooking, cleaning; if with his meticulousness he was the
image of the German professor lampooned in humor weeklies, as a
househusband Klemperer was certainly untypical. He frequently
complained how much time these domestic chores cost him, but
without resentment. He had just two loves to which he remained
utterly faithful: his wife and their cats.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-WITNESS-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: their cats.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of Klemperer's foibles make for involuntary, savage comedy.
In 1935, already in his 50's, he learned how to drive. The lessons
began as a nightmare. After he received his license, he noted
solemnly, ``This business is really two things for me, a victory
over my own nature, achieved with great difficulty, and a matter of
the utmost importance.'' That was not hyperbole: for a Jew trying
to navigate through the Nazi jungle, the most mundane matters
assumed critical weight. At first he was haunted by the ``worry
that I as a driver must not cause any mischief,'' and for some time
drove no faster than 30 miles an hour. Gradually, as he became more
competent behind the wheel, he started to enjoy himself -- and
wrote it down. The main mischief he caused was to the fenders of
his undependable second-hand car, as he could never manage to avoid
hitting his narrow garden gate. Learning how to type would be only
marginally less upsetting and, after a while, almost as rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   Klemperer's maddening patriotism, an element in his refusal to
emigrate even when opportunities offered themselves, seems to lend
some plausibility to the indictment of German Jews for
overidentifying themselves with a country prepared to kill them and
blindly failing to anticipate their fate. But Klemperer, as the
diary amply documents, was a special case. Members of his family,
and his friends, left Nazi Germany as quickly as they could. Like
other cultivated German Jews, Klemperer despised his country's new
masters as barbarian invaders. In addition, he could not visualize
making a living abroad. Though a professor of French literature, he
did not speak French. His English was abysmal and he made only
halfhearted attempts to improve it. Add a private neurotic impulse:
he would not be dependent on his brother Georg, who had prospered
in the United States. In short, his conflicts paralyzed him. One
does not read his diary to enter the life of a representative
German Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all discomfort fades before the cumulative power of the
record that Klemperer has left for posterity. His observations,
including pitiless self-examinations, are unblinking; his
reflections are remarkable for their precision and their
penetration. Even though one may balk at one or another of his
positions, his personal history of how the Third Reich month by
month, sometimes week by week, accelerated its crusade against the
Jews gives as accurate a picture of Nazi trickery and brutality as
we are likely to have. Nothing is too casual or too portentous to
escape him, including the increasing likelihood of a violent death.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Klemperer's entries report the minutiae of living. He
also has some breathtaking set pieces. In June 1941, after spending
eight days in prison, in isolation, for having failed to black out
a window at night, Klemperer celebrates his release by recalling
his imprisonment in chilling detail. ``I continue to write,'' he
was to note in May 1942. ``This is my heroics. I want to bear
witness, precise witness, to the very end.'' He exploited his flaws
-- his pedantry, obstinacy, self-involvement -- to make a
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Nazi nightmare deprived Klemperer of his
illusions about human nature. ``Man is bad,'' he observes early on
(April 1933). Yet important passages in his diary undermine this
verdict. For -- and this is the true surprise of this diary -- the
number of ``good Germans'' to whom he gives an honorable place is
astonishingly large. Some of his acquaintances, including
colleagues, became enthusiastic, or opportunistic, supporters of
Hitler's Thousand Year Reich. But, at least in Klemperer's
experience, episodes of meanness and cowardice are far outweighed
by moments of decency. The ludicrous Nuremberg Laws of September
1935, which deprived Germany's Jews of their citizenship and
prohibited gentiles under 45 from working as household help for
Jewish families, evoked a touching protest from the Klemperers'
invaluable Frau Lehmann, who was in her late 40's. She told them in
1938 that ``she had been summoned to an official: It was known that
she was a cleaner for a Jewish professor and a Jewish lawyer.'' But
did not the law allow this? The bureaucrat's response was ominous:
``Certainly, but your son will not get his promotion in the Labor
Service, and your daughter . . . will lose her post, if you do not
give up this work.'' In helpless rage, Frau Lehmann quit, but
continued to visit the Klemperers at night under cover of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Klemperer knew and met many such decent Germans,
even after the regime had make the risks of showing sympathy for
Jews painfully obvious. In late November 1938, shortly after the
officially sanctioned national pogrom known as Kristallnacht had
burned synagogues, smashed store windows and taken thousands of
Jews to contentration camps, Klemperer visited the Public
Information Office for Emigrants -- one of his halfhearted attempts
to get away from Nazi Germany -- and spoke to an elderly police
major: ``The old major said to me: Within these four walls you can
speak your mind. In recent days I have heard a great deal that is
very distressing, in my free moments I walk in the Great Garden in
order to calm myself down. -- I set out my situation. I said, a
regime that espouses banditry with such openness, must be in a
desperate plight. -- He: That is what every decent German thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Klemperer's diary records literally dozens of gems like these,
cumulatively refuting (as Chalmers notes in his preface) Daniel
Goldhagen's thesis that Germans, as a people, were infected with
``eliminationist anti-Semitism.'' As the Klemperers are expelled
from their dearly bought house, confined to two miserable rooms in
a ``Jews' house,'' their movements restricted and their rations
reduced to near-starvation level, local butchers, bakers and
fishmongers illegally supply them with food. One of his former
students brings them a Christmas gift: ``two big scallops of veal,
an egg, a tin of ersatz honey, a bar of chocolate, two
gingerbreads, a pair of socks, two tins of milk and half a liter of
opened skimmed milk,'' and a book on Klemperer's cherished
Corneille. Even after the obscenity inaugurated in late 1941,
compelling Jews to wear the yellow star on their clothes, some
Germans continue to demonstrate, quietly, their ``criminal''
decency. In November, Klemperer records an acquaintance telling him
that ``a gentleman had greeted her in a shop doorway. Had he not
mistaken her for someone else? -- 'No, I do not know you, but you
will now be greeted frequently. We are a group 'who greet the Jew's
star.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet we know that, brave as ``good Germans'' might be, the lot of
Germany's Jews, bad as it was, only grew worse. The deportations
were beginning. Volume 2 of the diaries, which takes the Klemperers
from January 1942 to the end of the war, takes up this part of the
tale; as moving, as brilliant, as Volume 1, it is scheduled to
appear in English next year. Together, they make Klemperer into one
of the greatest diarists -- perhaps the greatest -- in the German
language.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The old Hollywood folk tale of the pretty girl ``discovered'' at
a drugstore and turned into a star conjures up an image deeply
comforting to traditional notions of sexual behavior: a sleeping
beauty plucked from obscurity by a male power broker and catapulted
to fame. The myth buttresses the ideal of feminine passivity and
male agency at the expense of a more subversive truth: the hustle,
the drive, the shrewdness of those women, who among thousands of
wannabes rose to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, no one has slid more smoothly into the myth of
female dependency than Marilyn Monroe. By tying her fate to a
string of male rescuers and by dying young and alone, she left
behind an open-ended scenario of victimization, whose architect
could be supplied according to the onlooker's politics and
proclivities. (Fill in the blanks with your favorite malefactor:
the patriarchy, the studio system, male concupiscence, the
Kennedys.) Yet as we learn from ``Marilyn Monroe,'' Barbara
Leaming's engrossing new biography, no one worked the drugstore
scene (not to mention the prescription counter) more shrewdly than
Monroe, and no one displayed such a furious desire to live and
succeed in the face of greater, more overwhelming odds. The chief
virtue of this retelling of the oft-told tale is that the author
restores Marilyn's humanity, gives flesh and blood, intelligence
and initiative, to the archetypal dumb blonde.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she wasn't used and abused, manipulated and exploited.
But she was an intuitive strategist: she found willing champions,
ingeniously playing an ally like Spyros Skouras, the president of
20th Century Fox, against his enemy and colleague, Darryl Zanuck,
the studio's production chief. She also made brilliant use of
publicity and her own photogeneity -- she was inspired in her
handling of the nude photo episode -- to boost her career with Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Major revelations aren't the point here, and other biographies
have been more comprehensive, but Leaming, whose most recent book
was a biography of Katharine Hepburn, has a sure dramatic instinct
for illuminating overlooked material and re-examining the most
interesting episodes. I was initially skeptical: could there really
be anything new to say about this endlessly reproduced pop icon?
But following Leaming's lead, I soon found myself devouring other
material, particularly the autobiographies of Elia Kazan and Arthur
Miller, to see where Kazan, Miller and Monroe agree and (more
fascinatingly) when and how they differ. It's this three-way
relationship, with its political and artistic, hetero- and
homoerotic components, that Leaming explores in the book's richest
leitmotif.
</P>
<P>
   We begin in 1951, at a perilous moment in the young starlet's
career -- her contract with Fox is up, Zanuck loathes her and
Johnny Hyde, her agent and staunchest ally (as well as her ardent
pursuer), has just died. She is finishing ``As Young as You Feel,''
with Monty Woolley and Constance Bennett, weeping between takes,
when Elia Kazan, with Arthur Miller in tow, arrives on the set to
ask her out. Kazan has recently directed Miller's ``Death of a
Salesman'' on Broadway, and they are in Hollywood peddling a Miller
script.
</P>
<P>
   At first Monroe refuses Kazan's invitation, then, shrewdly
reconsidering (he is ``hot,'' having just finished shooting ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' and now casting for ``Viva Zapata!''), she
goes after him and they become an item. By day, Kazan, Monroe and
Miller are high-spirited pals; by night, Kazan and Monroe occupy
one of the guest rooms at the agent Charles Feldman's, while Miller
sleeps fitfully down the hall. The playwright, whose marriage is
wobbly but still on its feet, is so taken with Marilyn that he soon
flees Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe, however, has been smitten with this man, who treats her
respectfully and represents everything that Hollywood is not. After
his departure, she continues to sleep with Kaza, but on the shelf
above her bed, watching their every move, are photographs of her
two idols, Arthur Miller and Abraham Lincoln. Miller -- the vital
absentee in a weird triangle -- is the major subject of Kazan and
Monroe's postcoital conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Thus does Monroe find herself partitioned, virgin and whore,
between two men: one, Kazan, an admitted philanderer, who
(according to his own autobiography) sees her as fun, a mistress,
not the type anyone would want to marry, and the other, Miller, the
repressed but honorable puritan, who takes her as seriously as he
takes himself, thus providing her with a reflection more to her
liking. It's a split that finally tore her apart, while both of the
men survived to work and flourish, and to tell their sides of the
story -- not only of the Hollywood days but of their early
association with the Group Theater and Communism, the split between
them over Kazan's friendly testimony before the House Un-American
Activities Committee and their reunion for the Monroe-inspired
play, ``After the Fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Monroe needed Miller to accept the Marilyn who
wasn't just a ``happy girl,'' but the demands of that darker, more
complex personality were more than he could handle. (Joe DiMaggio,
her husband before Miller, found himself enmeshed in a similar
paradox when, after marrying the blond sensation, he wanted her to
give up her career and live like a normal woman.) The line between
sexiness and parody was gossamer thin, and impossible to maintain.
Her most successful films -- ``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,'' ``How to
Marry a Millionaire,'' ``The Seven Year Itch,'' ``Some Like It
Hot'' -- capture the innocence of her pose and its satirical savvy.
But it was all as fragile as a bubble, and for her, as the pills
and insecurity mounted, there was no second act.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-MONROE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: second act.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of her career, Monroe, with the help of Ben
Hecht, had advanced the idea that she was an orphan. It was a
cunning bid for the sympathy of women, who might be put off by her
sexual display (and who indeed would later turn against her).
Though the story was exposed as a hoax, the truth was worse: she
had been abandoned by her mother, Gladys, left with foster families
(who also abandoned her) and never knew who her father was. It was
one of her foster parents, ``Aunt Grace,'' who convinced her that
she could be another Harlow, and who encouraged her to use her sex
appeal, but who then turned on her when those charms attracted
Grace's own husband. Thus was enacted in microcosm the social
double bind into which all women are born but whose contradictions
the love goddess acts out on a high wire over the abyss: be
beautiful but not too beautiful; use your sex appeal, but forfeit
the right to be taken seriously; be childlike, but expect a
seriously reduced shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   Leaming underlines the importance of a moment when, while making
``How to Marry a Millionaire'' with Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable,
Monroe sees the handwriting on the wall: Grable, the leggy blond
oomph girl, is about to become a has-been at 36 and is gallantly
handing the torch to the new bombshell on the block. It was
Monroe's desire not to get caught in the same trap that fed her
often misguided ambition to play serious roles, to downgrade her
own enchanting comic temptress.
</P>
<P>
   She needed a grotesque parody of a woman's support group --
female monsters like her coach, Natasha Lytess, and the acting guru
Paula Strasberg -- to be present on the set running interference
for her. Reading the description of Strasberg, clad in black,
standing behind the director and waving hand signals like a catcher
at home plate, one can't help thinking of the tortured relationship
between Monroe and her mother -- who would suddenly surface from
time to time to express outrage over some flouting of propriety
perpetrated by her daughter. In response, Monroe would up the ante,
dressing even more seductively, provoking public outrage and
sabotaging her own success.
</P>
<P>
   If she has now become more famous as a photographic icon, in
black and white, than as a movie performer, there's a good reason.
She was as exhilaratingly at ease before the still camera as she
was paralyzingly insecure before the motion picture camera. Without
minimizing Monroe's hugely irritating and destructive behavior
toward the end, Leaming suggests heartbreaking moments when things
might have taken a different turn: if one of her numerous
pregnancies had come to term; if she and Laurence Olivier hadn't
got off to a bad start while filming ``The Prince and the
Showgirl''; if just one of the moguls in Hollywood had understood
that she was a woman who wanted, more than fame and money, credit
for her part in the creation of ``Marilyn Monroe.'' At least that
battle has been won in this gripping and corrective book.

 BILLY DEAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Lisa Reardon.
</P>
<P>
   260 pp. New York:
</P>
<P>
   Viking. $22.95.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; UNPLEASANTVILLE &QL; 
 &UR; BY LAURA JAMISON &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Reardon's first novel, ``Billy Dead,'' instantly brings to
mind Dorothy Allison's ``Bastard Out of Carolina.'' Both depict
poor, rural white families in which innocent lives are ravaged by
brutality and incest. But ``Billy Dead,'' if you can believe it, is
even more harrowing, and while Reardon possesses enough skill to
render any awful act believable, she does so at the expense of the
book's frail beauty. When you finish reading it, you're left with a
crowd of horrific images that overwhelm what the story is finally
about: the redemptive power of love, no matter how unconventional.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Allison's child narrator, the speaker in ``Billy Dead,''
Ray, is an adult who has the language and sexual knowledge to
describe the family's heinous history in graphic detail. Of the
three Johnson children, who grew up in Michigan, Ray was clearly
the least equipped to shoulder abuse; as a man, he is helpless and
dazed, given to hallucinations and physical self-torture. He lives
in a perpetual cringe, shrinking from memories that constantly
threaten to unravel him. But when he learns that his beastly older
brother, Billy, has been sadistically murdered, Ray can't help
flashing back to his freakish family life, a three-ring circus of
savagery in which the siblings all take turns in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Billy have a little sister, Jean, who not only suffers
her father's beatings as they do but also endures sexual abuse at
the hands of all her menfolk. But she is a mean, tough kid --
qualities that meek, sensitive Ray admires. When Jean is only 7,
Billy and Ray force her to perform fellatio on them, an act that
belies Ray's affection for Jean and underscores his fear of Billy.
A few years later, she pounces on her opportunity for revenge: as
Ray, now 14, lies weak in bed with chickenpox, she burns his sores
with a cigarette while bringing him to orgasm with her other hand.
``Do you love me?'' she asks, grinding the hot cigarette into his
wounds. ``Are you sorry?'' He appears relieved to submit to Jean's
punishment; he is also in awe of her spitefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Jean remain allies in their house of horrors. After his
senior year, Ray spends the summer working in another town; Jean,
now 16, joins him. Away from their tormentors, they become lovers,
and, impossibly, you find yourself actually rooting for them. It's
a credit to Reardon's writing that their romance seems right and
tender. But everything goes wrong when they return home to find
that the whole town knows about them. In a flash of possessiveness,
Ray turns on Jean, and the two remain estranged until Billy's death
years later -- an event that prompts Ray to seek her out again.
Whoever got Billy ``must have been even meaner than him. Only one
person I know like that,'' Ray says as he begins a delirious search
for the love of his life, his baby sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Dead'' is quite well written, but its literary merits
are diminished by the relentlessness and intensity of its
atrocities. Billy throws a cat against a wall for fun, breaking its
neck, and his father then chops the dying pet's head off with a
shovel; after Billy molests her, Jean hangs his dog from a tree and
beats it to death with a baseball bat; during one particularly
violent episode of rape, Jean nearly bites her father's penis off.
Still, all this excess isn't just sensationalism, and most of these
scenes seem warranted by the larger story. Indeed, this is an
extremely powerful novel, but whether you want to read it depends
on your stomach for human -- or, better said, subhuman -- ugliness.

 THE END OF A FAMILY STORY
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Peter Nadas. Translated by Imre Goldstein.

 &UR; RATIONED INDENTS &QL; 
 &UR; By KEN KALFUS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   THIS is some tough book. It consists of 10 chapters, each of
which is a single very long paragraph. Within the paragraphs, there
is no unity of theme, mood or narrative. Stories or anecdotes are
begun but left uncompleted, to be replaced by other fragments. The
narrative, such as it is, shifts from the first person to the third
and then back again. (That's 3-5-3, if you're scoring at home.)
Speech is indicated by quotation marks that open in one chapter and
close pages and pages later in another. Parts of conversations are
paraphrased, often without reference to who's speaking. The novel's
tediousness is as profound as the themes it seeks to engage.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nadas's first novel to be published in the United States
was ``A Book of Memories,'' which received much admiring attention
last year. It too is a challenging work, in part about a bisexual
Hungarian writer living in East Germany. But ``A Book of Memories''
is more accessible than ``The End of a Family Story,'' the first
novel Nadas wrote, which was originally published in Hungarian in
1977 -- at a time when the authorities in Budapest seem to have
been severely rationing paragraph breaks.
</P>
<P>
   As best I can make out, the central figure in ``The End of a
Family Story'' is a young Hungarian boy, Peter Simon, who is being
brought up by his grandparents sometime in the 1950's, during the
advent of the Communist era. His father, who is in the army, is
convicted eventually as a traitor. Peter's mother is absent, and
her memory uninvoked. In the course of the novel, his grandfather
tells the boy the mythic histories that, he says, he was told by
his grandfather. Most of the stories are about their family,
converted Jews who trace their ancestry back to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The comings and goings of the other people in Peter's life are
mixed up within his grandfather's stories. These characters include
a friend's mother, whom Peter once unforgettably saw naked; his
grandfather's friend, called Uncle Frigyes; and Peter's friends
Csider, Gabor and Eva. Creating their own mythic histories, the
children play at mama, papa and child
</P>
<P>
   in the neighborhood's secret spaces. Call me an American
philistine, but whenever the names Gabor and Eva collide in one of
Nadas's sentences, I hear the theme song from ``Green Acres.''
</P>
<P>
   The central motif of the Simon family myth concerns two brothers
who become separated or estranged and then find their way back to
each other. As Peter's grandfather tells these stories, we sense
his struggle to reconcile a mysterious division in his own life.
Perhaps it has to do with his rebellion against the passage of time
and his fear that the family history is at an end. When Frigyes
tells his friend about a community of Portuguese Jews that, after
converting to Christianity 500 years ago, has reconverted back to
Judaism, Peter's grandfather explodes: ``And in another 500 years,
what will happen 500 years from now, do you know? Five hundred
years! There is no such thing as time! that's the mistake, there is
no time! only me, me! Only I exist, the one actually present! Me!''
It's an interesting rant, but Nadas doesn't take the idea much
farther than that.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty -- no, impenetrability -- of this novel probably
cannot be laid to the translator, Imre Goldstein, who collaborated
on the more lucid translation of ``A Book of Memories.'' Here
Nadas's method of telling -- or not telling -- a story does not
seem to be dependent on the translator's choice of words.
Regardless of whose words they are, the structure that encloses
them fails to intensify their emotional charge -- as is
accomplished, say, by the American master of the long paragraph,
Stephen Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   By international convention, reviews of serious novels from
central Europe are required to employ the words ``tragedy,''
``truth,'' ``obsession,'' ``memory,'' ``identity'' and, of course,
``history.'' Having thus discharged my duty, I feel safe in hurling
this book across the room. Good luck to him who picks it up!

 &UR; THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCIS I. KANE &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yi-Fu Tuan, you've just capped a long and eminent career with
the publication of your latest work, 'Escapism.' Where are you
headed to now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To Disneyland, of course!''
</P>
<P>
   Yi-Fu Tuan is no Joe Montana with three most valuable player
awards in the Super Bowl and as many trips to Disneyland, but the
facetious scenario is not so far off the mark; for it was an
invitation to Disney's fantasy world that prompted Tuan, a
distinguished cultural geographer at the University of Wisconsin,
to write his latest work. Much to his surprise, he was charmed by
the place for the same reason that his academic colleagues loathed
it: it was unadulterated escape. That flight from the bleak
Wisconsin winter to sunny California led him to reflect on the
underestimated role that escapes play in our public and personal
lives.
</P>
<P>
   In his eyes, escape is everywhere -- whether we move from the
jangling chords of civilization back to a serenely pastoral nature,
or from that same nature now experienced as hostile and forbidding
to the covers of our warm beds in our well-constructed homes. In
fact, so pervasive is flight that Tuan proffers a rather startling
definition of culture: ``the totality of means by which I escape
from my animal state of being.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are we continually in flight? Well, we flee our bodies
because of their embarrassing demands -- for food, elimination,
sex. And we flee from our very selves into the social crowd,
because, as the author notes, uniqueness, however cherished, can at
times be quite intolerable. Once we have fled, however, we grow
disenchanted and escape in the other direction -- away from wispy
thought back to the ponderous body; away from the suffocating crowd
back to solitude. So inescapable are these flights that Tuan offers
one more definition of the human species: ``an animal who is
congenitally indisposed to accept reality as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Innovative as such claims seem to be, the reader might be
reminded of that groundbreaking book of a half-century ago, ``Homo
Ludens,'' in which Johan Huizinga argued similarly that play was
the central element in human culture. Both books persuade us to
adopt different angles of vision on culture and let us see such
familiar, mundane realities as play and escape in a more promising
light. For Yi-Fu Tuan, it is a case of getting us to see escapes
not as insubstantial diversions but rather as the very condition of
all that is good, and bad, in human culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Escapism,'' though, is not so much an argument as a tour --
sometimes a tour de force -- of cultural escapes with exotic stops
and unexpected twists and turns. And such a convivial tour guide!
Tuan is chatty, engaging, unpretentious and charming. The
atmosphere he creates is that of your friendly pub, where you are
regaled with captivating stories by a wise old man whose eyes still
betray a childlike wonder. This is decidedly not your old grade
school geography lesson. You indulge his sometimes professorial
locutions and even the occasional but maddening lack of conceptual
clarity (if everything is escape, then what distinctive meaning can
the word have?) because here is a geographer unafraid to bump up
against the ultimate human questions.
</P>
<P>
   His thesis, however, is clear. Escapes, those imaginative
reconstructions of reality, are indispensable. While flights from
our animal selves can be silly, preposterous, even cruel and
dangerous, they can also create new and more expressive ways for
humans to flourish. While romantic love, for example, may have
originated in a flight from our more bestial selves, it has become
over time just as real and decidedly more human than mere animal
couplings.
</P>
<P>
   For Tuan, it is the power of imagination that serves as the
mechanism of escape, and he pursues it down its labyrinthine ways,
noting both its destructive and creative impulses. Because of its
enormous power, imagination must be checked by the moral weight of
the good, and that, finally, is where his study culminates, on
moral grounds that are provided for by his Western (Greek) and
Eastern (Confucian) heritages. He is most at home in the proverbial
``middle way''; in fact, his favorite metaphor for an ethical
escape is ``landscape,'' both as nature and artifice. More
particularly, ``middle landscapes'' -- Chinese gardens and
cultivated fields -- serve as the geographical analogue for our
moral center; for Tuan they open up a world that is both at home
and in tension with nature. In these middle landscapes, we are
neither angels nor beasts, neither Icarus nor Caliban, but mortals
anchored in the earth yet borne aloft on the wings of imagination.
</P>
<P>
   I only wish that Tuan had argued more strenuously for these last
moral considerations, so sound and yet in such disrepute today.
Perhaps he does not because his method is not to argue the point
but to point long and hard enough until you see it. In the last
line of the book, he tells us that it doesn't take talent or status
to go off on flights that are truly good, just a ``willingness to
look in the right direction.'' But how do you know when you are
looking in the right direction? Indeed, what is the right
direction?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I confess that even after all that looking, I was
not persuaded that all culture is escape. The very same moral
considerations the author points to would, I think, require that we
discriminate between mere escape and authentic liberation. Two
older books responded to these questions rather more directly: a
scholarly work, ``Leisure: The Basis of Culture,'' by the
philosopher Josef Pieper, and a more popular book, ``The Decline of
Pleasure,'' by Walter Kerr, theater critic for The New York Herald
Tribune and later for The Times. Both authors admirably distinguish
between escapes that afford authentic leisure and genuine pleasure
-- reading a good book, for example -- and those mere diversions
that simply distract us from our workaday world, like building a
garage on our day off. Both of these books generously employ
another defining human characteristic, not developed nearly enough
in Tuan's otherwise praiseworthy book: the capacity to judge. If we
are going to look in the right direction, we will have to do more
than look. We will have to assess, evaluate and discriminate. There
is no escaping that.

 MIND OVER WATER: LESSONS FROM THE ART OF ROWING.

 &UR; ROW, ROW, ROW &QL; 
 &UR; By CAROLINE KNAPP &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years ago, I spent an autumn on the Charles River in
Cambridge, Mass., learning to scull. This is no small feat:
maneuvering a single shell is like trying to stay upright on a
giant knitting needle -- a typical boat is 26 feet long and less
than a foot wide; balance is either assisted or impeded by the
oars, which measure about nine feet each. As sports go, it's like
aquatic tightrope walking, requiring both enormous precision and
guts, and I was terrible at it for years -- flailing, teetering,
nearly flipping the boat on every outing. But from the start, I was
also determined to master the craft. The esthetic beauty of rowing
-- the symmetry, the steady whoosh of water against hull, the
marriage of power and grace -- had captured me utterly, and I
wandered around that first season like a teen-ager giddy with love,
aware that I'd stumbled on something that would transform me,
change the way I looked at life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life From the Art of Rowing'' is
Craig Lambert's thoughtful, lovingly drawn meditation on precisely
that brand of transformation: rowing on the Charles River, his
passion for the last decade, has become a path to self-definition,
a way to balance his brainy, straight-A boyhood with some
longed-for brawn, a vehicle for growth. ``We are out here . . . to
reveal ourselves,'' he writes, ``to discover who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowing attracts a certain personality type -- precise, intense,
a tad obsessive -- and Lambert writes like an oarsman. This is no
simple ode to the beauty of river and shell; nor, like David
Halberstam's book about elite competitors, ``The Amateurs,'' is it
a chronicle of the sport's physical rigors. Lambert covers both
those bases -- there are elegant descriptions of boats
(``fantastically long and narrow, a pterodactyl afloat''), and
there are nods to the rower's daily expenditure of blood and sweat
-- but his reach is broader. ``Lessons learned afloat,'' he writes,
``carry over onto dry land,'' and his book elucidates that point,
each aspect of the sport presenting fodder for reflection. An
account of learning to balance an eight-oared shell becomes a
meditation on intimacy (``As in other intimate relations, while
responding to each other, we need to maintain our own center of
gravity''); a reminiscence about coxing an eight becomes a
rumination on personal agency (``At every moment we have a choice:
to drift or to steer''); descriptions of racing and training become
explorations of everything from self-definition to the nature of
competition and success.
</P>

   Lambert, a staff writer and editor for Harvard Magazine who has
written for Sports Illustrated and other publications, is a
thinking man's jock -- along with profiles of world-class rowers
and coaches, you'll find quotations from Wittgenstein and
Kierkegaard, Einstein and Michelangelo -- and nonintrospective
athletes might find some of his parallels (balance in the boat as a
metaphor for balance in the ecosystem; an efficient crew as
analogous to the human immune system) either overly cerebral or
beside the point. But even the heaviest moments are offset by
light: there's the vicarious thrill that accompanies good
sportswriting (here and there, you can feel the speed of a single
gliding across water, the rapture of balancing atop a shell); there
are dashes of bemused self-depreciation (an early experience in an
eight is like ``thrashing around in a washtub full of bozos'');
above all, there's Lambert's unequivocal joy in rowing, its
provocative, sensual power. In his hands, the river becomes a
character in its own right, something to dip into for a time,
something transporting. ``Rowing,'' he writes, ``is such a
beautifully small, obscure sport.'' Perhaps, but viewed through his
lens, it becomes larger and more universal.

 &UR; By VICTOR NAVASKY &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This book reads as if Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, the black actors
and activists, talked it, in alternating chapters, paragraphs and
sometimes sentences. A conversation studded with anecdotes about
themselves, their families and people they knew, and also some
inspiration, wisdom and gossip. Take the turn-of-the century
exchange related by Davis's father, Kince, who has just been
released from the chain gang and goes to the little town of Argyle,
Ga., where he runs into an old friend:
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Good God Amighty, Kince, ain't seen you in a coon's age. How
you been doing, fellow? What you got to say for yourself?'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'White man still on top,' Daddy replied and laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``White man still on top'' -- the sad humor, wisdom, history,
sense of resignation-but-not-quite and total absence of bitterness
in that line encapsulates the spirit that pervades this quirky dual
memoir.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here are four interwoven stories. First, there are
Davis's experience of growing up in rural Georgia and Dee's in
Harlem; second, their love story -- starting with how they found
each other on Christmas Eve, 1946, dancing to Nat (King) Cole's new
release of Mel Torme's ``Christmas Song,'' while touring with the
comedy ``Anna Lucasta'' (Ruby played Anna, the prostitute lead).
Then there is the social history of the black experience in the
American theater and, to a lesser extent, Hollywood and television
in the last quarter of the 20th century. And finally there is the
story of what they call ``the Struggle,'' which has defined,
motivated, shaped their lives, their family, their art. All four
stories, as might be expected, have much to teach us about what
Gunnar Myrdal called ``An American Dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was only 6 or 7 years old when two white policemen picked
him up, took him down to the station house and poured a jar of cane
syrup over his head. They laughed ``as if it was the funniest thing
in the world,'' and Davis laughed too, but he never told his mother
or father about it. More than 40 years later, when his 16-year-old
son noisily summoned a white waitress in a Deep South restaurant to
take back his grits because they weren't hot enough, nothing made
him prouder. Only now is he able to philosophize about ``the
process of niggerization'' and what it does to all concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Right from the start, Dee, whose father was a waiter on the
Pennsylvania Railroad and who was 11 years old before she found out
that her mother was not her birth mother, wondered why the stores
on 125th Street did not hire any black people. She entered the
theater by way of the basement of the public library on 135th
Street -- now well known as the Schomberg Center for Research in
Black Culture, but then the birthplace of the American Negro
Theater. In 1950, when she and Davis arrived in Hollywood to film
``No Way Out'' and saw no black technicians, grips, electricians,
props or make-up people, she asked for (and got) a black
hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   Dee's identification with the underdog was not limited to race.
Davis tells of the time Dee had a part in Lorraine Hansberry's
``Raisin in the Sun.'' There is a scene in which the mother, played
by Claudia McNeil, who was built like a female Mike Tyson, slaps
her rebellious daughter, Beneatha, in the face. One matinee, after
McNeill had nearly knocked a hapless understudy into the second
row, the diminutive Dee said, sotto voce, ``You hit that girl one
more time like that, and I'll knock you flat.'' McNeill brought Dee
up on charges before Actors Equity for ``unprofessional behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dee and Davis were invited to speak at a rally on behalf of
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and were warned that it might cost them
their jobs, it was Dee who said, ``Hmmm, what jobs?'' They spoke.
If there was a ``committee to defend'' (be it the Rosenbergs, the
Black Panthers or Angela Davis), they were on the letterhead; if
there was a rally to oppose (the Vietnam War, nuclear testing,
apartheid in South Africa), they were on the podium; if there was a
Congressional subpoena (from a Congressional investigating
committee) to avoid, they were out the back door.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-OSSIE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: back door.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was all part of the Struggle. But for them the Struggle had
less to do with boring speeches and petitions than private (and
sometimes inspired) behind-the-scenes insurrections. As a drama
student at Columbia University, where he went after graduating from
Howard University, Davis objected to Marc Connelly's play ``Green
Pastures,'' whose version of heaven was simple, childlike black
people happily singing at a ``vast fish-fry celebration, presided
over by De Lawd.'' Yet in 1951, when a revival of ``Green
Pastures'' meant a job on Broadway, he took it. The part of De Lawd
was played by his friend William Marshall, whose booming voice was
matched only by his private political militancy, but since he
shared Davis's objections to the role he was playing, he had some
difficulty orating with conviction. So every night, just before De
Lawd castigates the world for its sins, Davis, who played Gabriel,
his right-hand angel, would whisper in his ear the name of the
latest brother who had dared to attack Paul Robeson (a roster that
included names like Jackie Robinson, Josh White and Canada Lee),
and, ``Bill would rise to such ear-shattering heights that nobody
sitting in the audience -- which was usually white -- could help
but feel the lash of his vocal venom.''
</P>
<P>
   As they approach the end of their unique journey, Davis, having
been married to Dee for 50 years, makes the mistake of dispensing
some advice: ``I say to my fellow husbands -- whose eyeballs may be
covered with lust -- the way to know all women is to know one woman
well.'' Which is O.K. but probably no more helpful as a guide to
the perplexed than were Dee's early ruminations on the matter of
black men like Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte and Walter White, a
former head of the N.A.A.C.P., all of whom left their wives and
married white women: ``How dare you white women raid the black
woman's nest, flaunt your perfumed, ivory skin, fling your flaxen
and raven hair in the eyes and noses and mouths of our beautiful
ebony men, assaulting all their senses?'' (Later she came to admire
several white women who ``literally and figuratively rescued from
the gutter men rejected everywhere.'')
</P>
<P>
   Memo to the F.B.I.: Despite their politically adventurous
activities, Dee and Davis never did join the Communist Party. As he
puts it, ``I was 'red' only when I thought it was a smarter way of
being black.'' The F.B.I. did, however, set one thing right. When
Dee and Davis retrieved their files under the Freedom of
Information Act, they discovered that the bureau had designated
Ossie a ``fellow traveler.'' His crime was that he ``was known to
associate with Ruby Dee.''

 A LIKELY STORY
<TEXT>
<P>
   One Summer With Lillian Hellman.
</P>
<P>
   By Rosemary Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   275 pp. New York: Doubleday. $23.95.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; OPPRESSED BY AN IDOL &QL; 
 &UR; By SHARON O'BRIEN &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Blame is boring,'' I tell the students in my memoir-writing
classes when parents or siblings appear as one-sidedly nasty, child
narrators as long-sufferingly virtuous. And yes, shaping anger and
resentment into a text that, as Toni Morrison puts it, the reader
can enter, is hard -- and painful -- work. But we simply don't
trust narrators who project unresolved anger onto their characters.
Our instinctive response is to pull away.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what happened when I read Rosemary Mahoney's account of
the summer she spent working as a maid and cook for Lillian
Hellman, the employer from hell. The 17-year-old Mahoney, a
prep-school scholarship girl, had written Hellman, her literary
idol, asking for work; amazingly, Hellman responded with an offer
of a summer job at her home on Martha's Vineyard. Mahoney had read
``An Unfinished Woman,'' ``Pentimento'' and ``Scoundrel Time'' and
fallen in love. ``Imagining the Lillian Hellman I had read about,''
contrasting Hellman's bravery to her own timidity (``I never
trusted my own puny voice''), the narrator travels to the Vineyard
and meets not the young, fiery Hellman of the writing but the
aging, temperamental Hellman of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Unlikely Story'' records her disillusionment. Not only is
Hellman a demanding, irksome employer, expecting Mahoney to be at
her beck and call, brooking no back talk, criticizing her driving;
she also turns out to be a flawed human being. The Hellman of
``Scoundrel Time'' stood up to the House Un-American Activities
Committee and refused to cut her conscience to the fashion of
McCarthy's 1950's; this Hellman cheats at Scrabble, pours cheap
wine into expensive bottles and requires her maid to lie when she
doesn't want to talk on the phone. The Hellman of ``An Unfinished
Woman'' stuck up for her friends; this Hellman satirizes them
behind their backs. The Hellman of ``Pentimento'' stood up for the
oppressed and the downtrodden; this Hellman ``was always saying
Chink and Jap and nigger, which in 'Pentimento' she denied she
would ever say.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney wants a spiritual mentor: Hellman needs a servant.
Mahoney wants to talk about books and writing and ideas; Hellman
wants the kitchen floor washed, the dishes dried, the bathmat put
away, The New York Times picked up at the drugstore. Mahoney wants
intimacy; Hellman wants privacy, even as her physical limitations
make her dependent on live-in help. More than anything, the
narrator wants to be seen, but this is something the half-blind
Hellman, then in her 70's, is emotionally as well as physically
unable to do. ``Each day I woke thinking maybe this will be the day
that she talks to me, or asks me who I am, or tells me something
about myself,'' she tells us, and each day Hellman greets her with
a list of her duties and, from time to time, of her failings as a
housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Hellman's greatest sin is her failure to recognize the
narrator's specialness. It is natural for the 17-year-old to have
wanted this. What makes ``A Likely Story'' problematic is the adult
writer's continuing resentment. That Hellman could be a
self-absorbed prima donna and a tantrum-throwing hostess is no
surprise. What I found troubling is the malice underlying Mahoney's
portrait. The writing is saturated with comparisons to animals:
Hellman's hand is a ``paw''; her face is ``fishlike''; she has the
``big beaky face of a sea turtle.'' We are asked to regard the
decay of her flesh: her ``pruny arms and legs,'' her breasts like
``bladdery bags'' beyond repair by the usual feminine devices, for
Hellman's bras are like ``quahog shells.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Mahoney played the roles of voyeur and eavesdropper
as well as maidservant -- hovering behind doors when Hellman had
visitors, snooping in wastebaskets and leafing through discarded
manuscripts. Seeing the names of Woody Allen, Richard Avedon and
Warren Beatty in Hellman's address book was like ``peeping through
a golden keyhole.'' Although she felt silenced by Hellman's
autocratic manner -- ``she always had the final word'' -- the young
Mahoney had many opportunities to ``watch Hellman talking'' and
observe her unawares (``she was as fascinating to watch as a small
nocturnal animal'').
</P>
<P>
   The climax of the summer, and the memoir, is reached when the
narrator goes upstairs at the end of a dinner party to find
Hellman, naked and drunk, asleep on her bed with the door open.
None of the weekend guests have come up yet, and for a few
delicious moments, Mahoney ponders revenge: should she leave the
door open so that Mike Nichols and Hellman's close friend Peter
Feibleman can see their hostess in all her pathetic vulnerability?
Finally she closes the door, but this mark of decency is undercut
by our glimpses of the old woman's body, ``so skinny and old it was
like a scientific event looking at it this way, like finding . . .
the mummified remains of a 3,000-year-old man preserved in a bog.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for the memoir boom, but the most
important impetus has been the political and social movements of
the last 30 years that have given voice to marginalized or silenced
individuals and groups. On the face of it, ``A Likely Story,'' by a
once silenced young woman who is now herself a well-reviewed
writer, would seem to belong in the same category with Susanna
Kaysen's ``Girl, Interrupted'' or Toi Derricotte's ``Black
Notebooks.'' But it does not, because it never transcends the
personal sources of its writing. Too much of the writer still seems
to be 17, still trapped in that claustrophobic summer, demanding
that the reader witness the injustices and humiliations she
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The memoir's title calls attention to a larger issue, the
distinction between ``fact'' and ``truth'' in a genre that draws on
memory, a subjective and incomplete source, as well as imagination.
Recording the emotional truth of the past often means memoir
writers must use fiction writers' tools: inventing dialogue,
shifting chronology, constructing scenes. But memoirists have a
different contract with their readers than fiction writers do: we
trust them to be faithful to the historical realities of the past.
Mahoney herself raises the issue of the reliability of memoir:
hunting through a wastebasket she finds some discarded manuscript
pages, one of them titled ``Lillian Hellman, Notes to Follow
'Scoundrel Time,' '' Here Hellman is defending herself against
charges that she misrepresented herself in her HUAC testimony. ``As
far as I was concerned,'' Mahoney writes, ``despite all the books
and plays and committees for public justice, she was no more honest
than the rest of us. . . . What people stood for wasn't necessarily
who they were.'' Fair enough. And many readers will know that
Hellman has been accused of fabrication -- most famously by Mary
McCarthy, who called her a liar on ``The Dick Cavett Show,'' as
well as by critics who charged that her famous memoir piece
``Julia'' was wholly invented.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-HELLMAN-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: wholly invented.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Mahoney wants us to distrust Hellman as a writer and person,
all the while using literary techniques that suggest her own
methods and memory are objective. Her book is written in the mode
of realism, very particular as to weather, time, setting, action,
dress, dialogue and detail, positing an omniscient rather than a
limited narrator. (``A sheet of white sunlight fell across the
round wooden table between the two armchairs, and The Vineyard
Gazette lay rumpled and skewed on the footstool in front of
Hellman.'')
</P>
<P>
   An author of memoir must decide two crucial points, Annie
Dillard says: ``what to put in and what to leave out.'' What
Mahoney puts in is the 17-year-old girl's experience and
perspective; what she leaves out is the larger context of Hellman's
work and life. Hellman is dreading the approach of total blindness.
``You can't know what it's like not to be able to see properly,''
she confides to the narrator. Hellman also tells friends she is
``going through a depression,'' and we learn that she is afraid of
being alone in the house. A sympathetic look at this Hellman comes,
briefly, from the narrator's mother, herself physically limited by
polio. Her advice to her daughter provides a needed moment of
compassion and wisdom: ``Let Lillian play great lady,'' she
advises, ``she doesn't have much time left to preserve that
image.''
</P>
<P>
   The most complex portrait in the memoir, in fact, is that of
Mahoney's widowed mother, whose struggle to raise seven children is
partly glimpsed here. At times I wondered if the story of her own
mother, painful and loving, triumphant and sad, is the one Mahoney
needed to write but was not yet ready to attempt. Perhaps now that
her animus toward Hellman is cleared away, she can turn her sharp
descriptive eye and writerly gifts to a potentially more personal
and more universal family story.

<P>
   The recent, brutal civil wars in Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda and
the Congo make plain the need to prosecute amoral leaders who show
no care for civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
   At least, this seemed to be America's position for the last four
years as Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright touted the
establishment of the International Criminal Court as a key
foreign-policy aim.
</P>
<P>
   And yet in July 1998, when the draft treaty to create the ICC
was approved in Rome, the United States found itself in a nasty
minority, siding with Libya, Iraq, Yemen and Qatar against the
court. (The final vote was 120 in favor, 7 opposed and 21
abstentions.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of Washington's concerns were serious and legitimate.
American troops are deployed across the globe, and should not be
put in a position of having to face the added danger of politically
motivated prosecutions. But more broadly, the administration failed
to think through or effectively articulate its position.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the negotiations, wary of a skeptical Congress, the
White House dithered. Though international meetings on the ICC
began in 1994, the United States failed to decide key issues _
would it back the court? under what terms? _ until the president's
return from China in early July.
</P>
<P>
   Only then, four weeks into the five-week U.N. final conference,
were cabinet debates resolved and instructions issued to the
American negotiating team. But by then it was too late to convince
frustrated allies to accommodate new U.S. demands _ a case study in
how not to conduct multilateral diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   True, the evaluation of the court's ultimate potential (and
whether America should join), as well as the court's future, will
hinge on the sound choice of a prosecutor and judges, and the
enunciation of prosecutorial priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an historic opportunity to shape the court in America's
image was lost. What we got instead was a court America cannot
agree to _ at least not until its good faith has been tested over
years.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the Rome conference was inauspicious for the
United States. After triumph at the Ottawa land-mines conference _
where they brushed aside U.S. military needs in Korea _ a caucus of
so-called like-minded states, under Canadian and Norwegian
leadership, demanded an unfettered court. Thus the unity of
traditional NATO allies was pried apart.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the European Union had also hailed an independent
court as the hallmark of its post-Bosnia try for a unified foreign
and security policy. The Germans, French and even the British
(citing the ``ethical dimension'' of Tony Blair's foreign policy)
went to Rome ready to abandon America in their race for European
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In its fateful decision to vote against the treaty, the United
States complained of having been rebuffed on two issues. Yet these
issues were, in fact, red herrings, since they added little to the
risks the Americans were already willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. negotiators made no objection to the complaint system that
allows any state party, friend or foe, to refer investigations to
the court without Security Council approval. Yet Washington
vehemently opposed an independent prosecutor out of fear he might
start investigations on his own motion, subject only to court
approval.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the American team pushed to broaden the treaty's
probationary period. The Rome conference established that for the
first seven years, states need only accept the court's power over
genocide and crimes against humanity (though at the end, countries
must accept war-crimes coverage as well or quit the treaty). The
United States argued for a 10-year probationary period and to
exclude coverage of crimes against humanity during that time.
</P>
<P>
   But this would not have eliminated the risks to American troops.
A rogue state bent on harrying Americans will use any available
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the treaty's protections, it is possible that hostile
states will file complaints against American troops and civilian
leaders to settle political scores. U.S. military decisions _ in
peacekeeping, antiterrorist enforcement, freedom-of-navigation
exercises and strategic deterrence _ will be scrutinized by those
hoping to show that an American use of force was disproportionate
or improper (and thus criminal).
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the ICC treaty bars formal amendments for the
first seven years and forbids individual reservations (opt-outs by
countries). And the prospect of early alterations is unlikely,
given the hostility that lingers toward the United States, in
countries that made hard concessions at Rome only then to see
America reject the entire treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, has declared war on the ICC for not giving ``100 percent
protection'' from prosecution to American GIs. Indeed, exposure of
U.S. troops and commanders to judgment by an international court
free to decide for itself what is a ``disproportionate'' use of
force (and hence a war crime) should concern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Helms must be persuaded that flaws in Rome can be
constructively addressed, protecting American interests without
abandoning America's leadership role. The power and prestige of the
United States would be enhanced if it helped improve the ICC,
rather than retreating in dismay. A preparatory session, already
scheduled for next year to hammer out rules of evidence and
procedure, might be a good place to start addressing American
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Effective authority in international politics requires power as
well as legitimacy. The international tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia has found that its orders are paid little heed unless
the United States and its allies lend their diplomatic, economic
and military muscle.
</P>
<P>
   In order to secure defendants, evidence and funding, the new
court must rely on the goodwill of many states _ but foremost among
them, the world's one remaining superpower. Unless it acts
scrupulously, the court will never win financial backing. The ad
hoc tribunal for the former Yugoslavia runs an annual budget of $70
million, while its counterpart for Rwanda struggles by with $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   Many states hope that the United Nations will fund the new court
in its first years of operation. But this again devolves to the
United States, as the deep pocket that supplies a quarter of the
world body's budget (if and when it pays its dues). While other
states will resist explicit American conditions on tribunal funding
(thanks to the ongoing U.N. dues battle), they must recognize that
the United States will never bankroll an abusive court.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military role in international security will not be
altered by the evangelism of an international court. After all, the
court was set up to address the horrors of contemporary civil wars,
not cut down America's preeminence in the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the United States should learn some long-range
lessons from its missteps at Rome. For one, Americans must realize
that their allies no longer view them as indispensable, and that if
America stonewalls, it may get left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating vital matters should not be left to the last minute,
to the chaos of open conferences and the mystery of working groups
from which Americans may be excluded. This includes raising issues
well in advance through NATO and other alliance channels, and
through quiet contacts in national capitals at a political level
where flexibility remains possible.
</P>
<P>
   And Rome should teach American diplomats not to start listening
to Capitol Hill so late in the game, once thoughts turn to
ratification, but to take Congress seriously and heed its warnings
early on, at the start of the negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
   America will get other chances to lead the battle against war
crimes. But foresighted diplomacy, not always shown in preparation
for Rome, will be required.
</P>
<P>
   When the opportunity for action arises, the United States should
have its mind already made up, so it may lead future negotiations
and not just lamely follow them.

_STUDIES COULD ADVANCE HEPATITIS C TREATMENT

 Studies could advance hepatitis C treatment
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until now, there has been no truly effective treatment for
hepatitis C, a blood-borne virus that is spread in the same ways as
AIDS, and that is believed to infect about 4 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A drug called interferon helps in 40 percent of cases, but the
benefits are short-lived. Only 10 to 15 percent of patients remain
in remission, six months after treatment is stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But two studies published in the current New England Journal of
Medicine offer new hope. One, led by researchers at the Scripps
Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., found that six
months after treatment, a combination of interferon and a drug
called ribavirin was 31 to 38 percent effective among patients
being treated for the first time. That's 3 to 5 times the response
rate for people getting interferon alone.
</P>
<P>
   The other study, led by researchers at the University of Florida
College of Medicine in Gainesville, found that six months after
treatment, the same combination was 49 percent effective in
patients who had relapsed after previous treatment. This is 10
times higher than treatment with interferon alone.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the studies represent an ``important advance,'' says
Dr. T. Jake Liang, chief of the liver diseases section at the
National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases,
part of the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not clear how long treatment should last. In the
California study, there was little difference in outcome whether
people were treated for six months or 12. But the studies are ``a
big step forward,'' Liang said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Study shows Prozac fights panic disorder
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's official: Prozac, like the antidepressants Zoloft and
Paxil, has now been shown to work against panic disorder, a
debilitating illness that affects 3 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In a study led by Dr. David Michelson of Eli Lilly, the maker of
Prozac, the popular antidepressant proved safe and effective in
reducing panic attacks and symptoms of phobia, anxiety, and
depression in people with panic disorder, a syndrome in which a
person suffers repeated attacks of panic. The study is in this
month's American Journal of Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate study published in the current Journal of the
American Medical Association, Brown University researchers showed
that Zoloft, already used for acute depression, is also effective
as an ongoing treatment for chronic depression.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Major lung surgery is small operation
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Minimally invasive surgery _ in which doctors operate through
one or more small incisions, often aided by tiny TV cameras in
fiber optic cables _ is clearly an idea whose time has come.
</P>
<P>
   But is it really possible to remove an entire, intact lung this
way and send the patient home the same day?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, says Dr. Eduardo R. Tovar, a thoracic surgeon at St. Jude
Medical Center in Fullerton, Calif., who describes his technique in
this month's issue of Chest, a journal of the American College of
Chest Physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, surgeons have used one long incision _ from the
shoulder blade, under the arm, around to the front _ to remove a
cancerous lung. In the last five years, they've also used minimally
invasive surgery, which involves four or five small incisions
between the ribs for viewing plus a 4-inch incision under the arm
through which the lung is removed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tovaro says he can remove a lung using only one small _
3-inch _ incision on the patient's side.
</P>
<P>
   In the five patients reported on _ he has also done four others
_ Tovar occasionally uses a miniature TV camera inserted through
the same incision to see ligaments that he needs to cut. He
anesthetizes nerves in the area by freezing.
</P>
<P>
   One patient went home the same day. Four others went home the
next morning. With standard minimally invasive surgery, patients

TOBACCO FOES CITE US CLAIM IN SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With much of the focus on the $4 billion that
Massachusetts could receive by joining the national tobacco
settlement, some antismoking advocates who oppose the deal
Wednesday raised an issue few have considered: The federal
government has a 50 percent claim on those funds.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement worked out with eight attorneys general,
tobacco companies would reimburse Massachusetts and the other
states for payments it made under the Medicaid program for
smoking-related illnesses. Half the funds for that program come
from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $4 billion figure is a lot but people don't understand
that half of the money belongs to the feds,'' said state Senator
Lois Pines, the Newton Democrat who engineered the change in state
law that opened up the state's suit against the tobacco industry.
``They paid half our bills, but nobody is mentioning that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, earlier this week
indicated that the federal government is under some obligation to
claim some of this money as its share of the state's Medicaid
costs. He told reporters, however, the Clinton administration may
be open to negotiating to make sure the money is used to battle
smoking among teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pines, a longtime Beacon Hill leader in the
antismoking movement, joined with the state's tobacco-control
coalition Wednesday in calling on Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger to reject the settlement because its public health
provisions are too weak.
</P>
<P>
   The antismoking leaders argue that Harshbarger's current case
against the tobacco industry, scheduled for trial in Middlesex
Superior Court in February, is one of the strongest in the nation
and the state should pursue it rather than settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Massachusetts, we have a special law that gives us an
upper hand in court,'' Pines said. ``If we join this weak
settlement, our hands will be tied and our legal advantage will go
up in smoke. ... Let's not be bribed by cold, hard cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed national agreement worked out in New York last week
would provide $206 billion over the next 25 years to all the states
and would create some marketing restrictions on the industry.
Massachusetts would get $4 billion, or $7.6 billion when inflation
is factored in, over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The deal provides less money than the $368 billion national
tobacco settlement worked out last year, but killed by Congress
last June. The current agreement does not need congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, contending the industry was refusing to agree to
strict public health regulations and marketing restrictions, walked
out of the talks last August, saying he wanted to focus on the
state's court suit.
</P>
<P>
   But Harshbarger and all the 40 other states not at the
bargaining table have until Friday to decide whether to join the
settlement. Nationally and in Massachusetts, antismoking leaders
are calling on Harshbarger to reject it, arguing the Massachusetts
court case is the strongest one of the many that have been filed
against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources familar with the internal debate at the
attorney general's office, Harshbarger was Wednesday leaning
strongly toward accepting the settlement. He is also getting strong
advice from his top advisers to sign on to the settlement. A public
statement could come as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 90 percent there to accepting it,'' said an individual
familar with the discussions. ``He just wants to make sure the
money is going to go for anti-smoking programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Cafasso, Harshbarger's press secretary, said the issue of
whether the state would lose half of its reimbursement is not
clear. He said President Clinton has indicated he will support any
efforts to protect the states from any seizure of the funds that
are reimbursed by cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this is a battle that the states have clearly
won and won on their own and both Congress and the federal
government will recognize it is the fruit of state labor and state
labor only and should be allowed to stay with the states,'' Cafasso
said.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's decision on the settlement has far reaching
implications for the state. If he rejects the settlement but loses
in the courts, Massachusetts will lose billions of dollars,
including a $98 million upfront payment.

KRAFTS PURCHASE SAN JOSE CLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Kraft family believes in investing in professional
soccer. The Krafts Wednesday announced the purchase of the San Jose
Clash, their second Major League Soccer franchise, for more than
$25 million, five times the amount they invested in the Revolution
three years ago. The Miami Fusion expansion team had a $20 million
price last year, and Anschutz Sports Enterprises paid $26 million
for the Los Angeles Galaxy last month.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose operated under the direction of the MLS office in New
York in its first three years. An agreement to purchase the team
had been announced by former US Soccer Federation president Alan I.
Rothenberg and Dentsu Inc. of Japan, but the deal was called off
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The Clash, like the Revolution, has qualified for the MLS
playoffs only once. Its home field, Spartan Stadium, is owned by
San Jose State University and has a listed capacity of 19,166, but
was expanded to 31,683 for the MLS inaugural game April 6, 1996.
and has played host to US national team games. Average attendance
was 13,800 during the regular season, about the crowd expected for
last night's exhibition between the Clash and Toluca of Mexico's
first division. The field at Spartan Stadium, which also was home
to the Earthquakes of the North American Soccer League in the
1970s, had been smaller than accepted standards before being
expanded to 70 by 110 yards this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were under the assumption that Alan Rothenberg would be in
here pretty quickly, but that changed in the last week or so,'' a
Clash spokesman said. ``The Krafts saw a good opportunity and they
grabbed it. We have a solid organization, even though we haven't
done well on the field, and a great little stadium.''

SEXY COD RENDER NORWAY'S NAVY IMPOTENT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Who says technology is king? In the stinging
cold sea waters that surround Norway, millions of codfish have
rendered some highly sophisticated sonar tracking equipment
essentially impotent.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by the Norwegian Defense Institute, the cod
constitute a bona-fide threat to the safety and security of
Norway's military because they emit ``grunt-like sounds'' every 80
seconds or so. The purpose of the grunts? For the same reason many
people put on a Frank Sinatra record, mix martinis and turn the
lights down low: They're in the mood for love.
</P>
<P>
   February and March in Norway are prime cod mating months. You
get enough horny fish emitting enough grunts, and you wreak havoc
on the Norwegian navy's underwater surveillance and navigation
systems. Nobody can tell the difference between a foreign submarine
and a pack of hormone-seething male codfish.
</P>
<P>
   Until they can figure out a way to distinguish the cod grunts
from the other noise, the scientists can only advise navy subs to
stay out of known spawning areas during peak mating season.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what John McCosker of the California Academy of
Sciences shared with me, the Norwegian navy might as well build
regular February and March furloughs into its long-range plans.
Male codfish don't just grunt at 80-second intervals, they dance,
growl and make ``escape sounds'' with their internal gas bladders.
</P>
<P>
   They may run deep, but they don't run silent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only person in America who has read ``Cod, A
Biography of the Fish That Changed the World,'' McCosker gleaned
most of his cod-audio info from a 1961 treatise by British
researcher Vivien M. Brawn. Under the tutelage of Dr. H.O. Bull
(honest), Brawn studied cod mating habits at the Dove Marine
Laboratory of King's College at the University of Durham.
</P>
<P>
   The paper comes complete with an illustrated mating cycle that
depicts the male from his first raised median fin, through his
``courtship flaunting display,'' right into the climactic ventral
mount. But it is Brawn's prose that comes closer to explaining how
mating codfish could mess up sonar equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As McCosker noted in his fax, ``This is pretty racy stuff. I
looked through the literature and discovered that Brawn was never
seen or heard from again. She (or he) may have crossed the line
with this one.''
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt: ``Once the male had mounted dorsally, he immediately
slipped down one side of the female, still with his ventral surface
closely pressed against her body and clasping her with the pelvic
fins. The male came to lie in an inverted position below the female
with the ventral surfaces of both fish and their genital apertures
closely pressed together ... The combined movements of the tails
drove the pair round in a horizontal circle at the surface and
doubtless served to mix the eggs and sperm.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless.
</P>
<P>
   Brawn also observes that, while the male grunted during his
pre-spawn fin raise, tail wag and snout prod, ``No grunts were made
during the dorsal or ventral mounts or while the fish spawned.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Post-spawning ``the female swam down to the bottom and joined
the group of fish outside the male's territory. The male sometimes
became extremely aggressive ... and rushed at the group of
individual fish with many grunts.''
</P>
<P>
   Male humans have long been accused of going back to the locker
room to brag of their sexual exploits. Could the post-spawn cod
grunts be a variation on the same macho theme? If so, the Norwegian
navy might as well take the whole winter off.

CANNON'S EXPANSION COULD MEAN A RETURN TO ITS GLORY DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANCONIA, N.H. _ Fifty years ago, it was the standard by which
real skiing mettle was measured. Some of the most prestigious ski
races in the country took place there, and its very name struck a
rather stately, stoic image.
</P>
<P>
   Today, despite being well back in the high-stakes game of fast
detatchable lifts, snowmaking and grooming, on-slope restaurants
and condos, Cannon Mountain is still a standard for serious skiers.
</P>
<P>
   But the area where the first aerial tram for skiers was built in
1938 hangs in the balance this season. Today at the Franconia Town
Hall, there will be a public hearing on a plan to completely
modernize Cannon and open up nearby Mittersill as another
state-owned area.
</P>
<P>
   The big change would come in capacity _ from 2,500 skiers to
about 6,000. That would mean increased revenues, which Cannon badly
needs if it is to remain viable.
</P>
<P>
   Sno-Engineering of Littleton, N.H., one of the premier
developers of ski areas and ski systems, has been hired to develop
a master plan at a cost of $24 million over 10 years, according to
Sno-Engineering consultant Walter Erlander.
</P>
<P>
   The first two years of the plan would focus on replacing ski
lifts and improving trails at Cannon, which would cost
approximately $6 million. Most of that work could be accomplished
in a single off-season, Erlanger told the Cannon Mountain Advisory
Committee in October.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago the state bought Mittersill, which had been out
of operation for several years. Expanding the lodge already on site
and upgrading the parking lots would cost another $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The final phase _ about $12 million, according to Erlander _
would involve installation of lifts and an expanded trail system at
Mittersill.
</P>
<P>
   The improvements to Cannon and Mittersill would be funded
largely from lease money coming in from Sunapee _ the other
state-owned area _ and from higher lift-ticket prices at Cannon as
the area improves.
</P>
<P>
   Through the last few decades Cannon has slipped from its glory
days when it introduced the aerial tram to US skiing. In the 1930s,
such tramways were used in nonskiing ways, such as during the
construction project on Mt. Rushmore by sculptor Gutzon Borglum.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1938 Alex Bright and Roland Peabody developed the first
skiers' tram, which, at 2,000 vertical feet, was the longest ski
lift in the country. In 1980 the original tram was replaced by the
present one, but not before it had hauled some seven million skiers
to the top of Cannon.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, as nearby Loon and Waterville Valley
developed, along with several Vermont areas not far away, Cannon
did not keep up and _ except for its unalterably wonderful terrain
_ slipped into the second tier of ski areas.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, snow grooming on this mountain was done by a few
workers with shovels. Snowmaking was nonexistent, and the northwest
wind barreled through the valley, scouring the snow to a crusty
surface or as ice hard as porcelain.
</P>
<P>
   In legend, the trials were narrow, twisty, with natural fall
lines that pitched all over the place. The steeps were so tough
that only the expert skiers could survive the rigors.
</P>
<P>
   But, even before the proposed renovations, that mythology had
been widely exaggerated. A full 95 percent of its 150 skiable acres
is covered with snowmaking that is groomed, pulverized, and
regroomed when it turns icy. Perhaps retrofitting of the terrain
through the years has widened many of the trails, or perhaps they
were never as narrow as legend had them. Whatever, Cannon is as
perfectly accommodating to intermediates as it is to advanced
skiers _ albeit intermedates willing to ski attentively. This is
still no mountain for relaxed, back-seat cruising.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the summit is served by a fixed-grip quad that
is, when the weather is benign, a pleasant and quite beautiful lift
up over the vistas of the national forest, with views of Jefferson
and the other Presidentials. The tram handles 80 riders and takes
about six minutes to arrive at the top.
</P>
<P>
   If the area is not as brutal as some legend has it, there
certainly is plenty of challenging terrain. Upper Cannon is steep
and often firm because of the wind and altitude (4,100 feet). Upper
Hardscrabble has many of the same properties. But even casual auto
travelers coming along Route 3 have seen the famous lineup of
trails known affectionately as the ``front five.''
</P>
<P>
   They all look tough, but Zoomer, Polly's Folly, and Avalanche
are the expert-rated trails, and Zoomer has VW-sized moguls most of
the time. Rocket is rightly named, because it is a straight open
shot top to botom _ usually without bumps, as is its sidekick,
Gary's.
</P>
<P>
   The best cruising on Cannon is on long runs from the top,
including Upper Cannon, Vistaway, and Tramway. The very best is the
Profile Trail, a groomed fast cruiser that always has plenty of
snow.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed master plan would bring more lodging closer to the
mountain; but at this point, visitors to Cannon have about 5 miles
to drive to the nearest lodging. However, there is plenty _ more
than 12,000 beds _ both in the direction of Twin Mountain and
Bretton Woods, and the other way, south of Franconia Notch.
</P>
<P>
   Before the big changes, Cannon has one of the lowest ticket
prices for an area with such terrain _ $39 adult weekend, $28
midweek. Tuesdays and Thursdays are two-fer days _ two tickets for
$28. For information, call 603-823-5563.

half over and the worst yet to come, Abraham Lincoln delivered a
speech now universally regarded as both the most important oration
in U.S. history and the best explanation _ ``government of the
people, by the people, for the people'' _ of why this nation
exists.
</P>
<P>
   We would expect the history of an event so monumental as the
Gettysburg Address to be well-established. The truth is just the
opposite. The only thing scholars agree on is that the speech is
short _ only ten sentences _ and that it took Lincoln under five
minutes to stand up, deliver it, and sit back down.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else _ when Lincoln wrote it, where he wrote it, how
quickly he wrote it, how he was invited, how the audience reacted _
has been open to debate since the moment the words left his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular recounting of Lincoln at Gettysburg is the
Lincoln-as-loser version. In this ``history'' _ which has dozens of
variations _ the letter requesting Lincoln's presence at
Gettysburg, received on Nov. 2, is halfhearted in its tone and
insultingly late in its arrival.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a rather discourteous letter. It reminds Lincoln this
will be an ``imposing and solemnly impressive'' affair, as if he's
too stupid to appreciate the seriousness of dedicating a cemetery.
Furthermore, the invitation comes with specific instructions for
Lincoln to keep it short, pointing out that he's not the main
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   This account has Lincoln accepting the invitation without much
thought. Later, on the train to Gettysburg, he writes the address
on the back of an envelope, dashing off the now-immortal words like
a student rushing to finish an overdue term paper, with no true
sense of what the words mean.
</P>
<P>
   At the dedication itself, this version continues, Lincoln's
speech is preceded by a two-hour oration by Edward Everett, a
much-admired ex-statesman and diplomat. Everett's speech is
extremely well-received; Lincoln's is hardly received at all. In
fact, most people think, as he reaches his now-so-admired
conclusion, that he's still on the introduction. He sits down to
lukewarm applause, certain the speech is a failure.
</P>
<P>
   That's Version One. Version Two, and its numerous variations,
has Lincoln informally _ but respectfully _ asked to speak weeks
before he's officially invited. What's more, the issuance of a
formal invitation on Nov. 2 is considered quite timely. Lincoln is
indeed asked to keep it short, but only because this is an
interstate _ as opposed to federal _ cemetery and, in the 19th
century, the chief executive isn't expected to hog the stage at
state-sponsored functions.
</P>
<P>
   In this Lincoln-as-winner look at Gettysburg, Lincoln does write
the address shortly before delivering it. However, he's been
reflecting on it since mid-October. Also, since he hates speaking
extemporaneously, and he hates being rushed, he writes the speech
in Washington, not on the train (and not on the back of an
envelope). As for the speech itself, it is interrupted five times
by applause, with ``long continued applause'' at the end; Lincoln
believes it went well.
</P>
<P>
   What's most interesting about the Lincoln-as-loser and
Lincoln-as-winner versions is how they marshal the same facts to
prove different points. The invitation asks Lincoln to deliver ``a
few appropriate remarks.'' Whether this is a putdown or a
reflection of the protocol of the time depends on the ``spin'' _ an
expression the highly-politicized Lincoln would have readily
understood _ which the scholar places on it.
</P>
<P>
   These diverse histories should not in any way diminish the power
or beauty of Lincoln's words. However, they should remind us that
history, even the history of something as deeply respected as the
Gettysburg Address, is seldom simple or clear. This reminder is
especially useful today as we watch expert witnesses, in an effort
to divine what the founders meant by ``high crimes and
misdemeanors,'' club one another with conflicting interpretations
of the same events, the same words, the same precedents, and the
same laws.

CLINTON ON CLINTON: THE REEL THING, PLEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The public says it is sick of the presidential
sex scandal. They're sick of Monica and Linda. They're sick of
Kenneth Starr. They're sick of Bill Clinton being bashed by the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Let the president get on with the real business of government,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   You know, like sending bombers toward Iraq, but stopping short
of the legal definition of war _ the one about cruise missiles
having inappropriate relations with civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Now wait a minute. If war is one of our other choices, how can
anyone say they're sick of this scandal?
</P>
<P>
   For a while I thought Clinton's reckless sexual acts and lying
would open the way to a right-wing takeover of government. Instead
the Republicans lost the last election big-time, and Newt Gingrich
was the one who had to leave office in shame.
</P>
<P>
   How can you hate a scenario like that?
</P>
<P>
   One or two more reports on Clinton's sex life, and liberal San
Francisco will be the new capital of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is the country that invented both the scarlet
letter and blue movies. It's only natural that Starr's harshly
high-minded testimony before the House Judiciary Committee should
follow the release of tawdry tapes secretly made by his informant,
bad-trip Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard Monica Lewinsky call her lover, our
commander-in-chief, ``Butthead.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't beat that, either for accuracy or entertainment. We
should revel in this.
</P>
<P>
   So you think this doesn't leave anything to the imagination? It
leaves lots to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The only voices we've heard on tape talking about sex are the
two women, the Wicked Witch of Washington and Buffy of Beverly
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The men, Starr and Clinton, the guys responsible for all this,
haven't been secretly taped. Or at least the tapes haven't been
released.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't fair. They get to talk about sex in rehearsed
presentations, fully aware they are being taped, so they don't talk
with their mouths full or say, ``So, it's like, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Clinton talked about sex, he said he wasn't. He said
he was just talking about inappropriate relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used language to mislead. Starr has used language to
lead us to his psyche.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who censored expletives like ``crap'' from his
report, but left in four-letter words for the male sexual organ. I
don't know what Freud would say about that, but I'm sure the
phrases ``anal-retentive'' and ``fixated'' would come up.
</P>
<P>
   Starr deserves the Tripp tape treatment. What do his phone
conversations with his assistant prosecutors sound like? Just
looking at Starr's Mr. Toad smile, I imagine it isn't typical boy
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that poopy-head,'' we can imagine Starr saying
after the election. ``We had all the doo-doo on him, and yet he
beats the pucky out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he'd probably sound like a tricky prig.
</P>
<P>
   The big question about Clinton, of course, is what he sounds
like when he's doing the Alexander Graham Bell boogie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet his phone sex is pretty cursory,'' my wife said. ``He
probably doesn't do any of the talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he put Monica on hold when a big contributor called? Did he
put her on speaker phone so he could eat a Big Mac at the same
time? Linda Tripp managed to slurp dinner on her own tape, while
Monica wailed and wept.
</P>
<P>
   Did Bill say ``Thank you'' or ``Goodbye''? Did he say ``Was it
good for you?'' Maybe he said, ``I'll get back to you on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is a complex and verbally adept man. He adjusts his
message to his audience. He can talk like a sensitive guy to women,
and talk locker-room talk with Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   That's another tape I want to hear. What do those guys talk
about when they're out in that golf cart on Martha's Vineyard?
</P>
<P>
   Bill: ``I think I'm beginning to get a crush on Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon: ``Well, she's very crushable.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   That's girl talk. That's the kind of thing Monica and Linda
said. When guys talk about their affairs with women, they tend to
use shallow physical adjectives rather than deep emotional
adjectives like ``crushable.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, though, I imagine Vernon said, ``Man, we've got to
get you out of this (bleep).''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's wife probably said that at one point, too.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants to hear tapes of Bill's and Hillary's
conversations. However, if the bug had been put in a lamp, it would
have been broken. Over his head.
</P>
<P>
   All I can think of is what Marine Corps language might sound
like in Wellesley diction. Or the hot and lathered forgiveness that
follows.
</P>
<P>
   David Mamet probably could invent that. But I want to hear it
for real.
</P>
<P>
   The public needs to know. We know too much now not to know it
all. My president, right or wrong, and right out loud.

SIR EDMUND HILLARY'S VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He rep-re-sents the last, if not lost, generation of world-class
explorers, 20th-century adventurers for whom the ends of the earth
were mere departure points for measuring what the human body _ and
human spirit _ is capable of enduring.
</P>
<P>
   With his 80th birthday comfortably in sight, Sir Edmund Hillary,
the first Westerner to reach the summit of Mount Everest, is a
living deity on two continents and a towering presence wherever he
roams _ in the shadow of the approaching millennium, the closest
approximation we have, arguably, to Winston Churchill, Charles
Lindbergh, and Jimmy Stewart all rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hillary, who passed through Boston on a fund-raising mission
earlier this week, seems oddly uninterested in resting on his
considerable laurels. The man who conquered Everest in 1953 (along
with legendary Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay) and was knighted by
Britain's Queen Elizabeth for his efforts, who braved Antarctica in
the late '50s and the remotest reaches of the Ganges two decades
later, continues his lifelong quest to expand the horizons of all
humankind _ while insisting that he never set out to become a hero,
the renewed interest in all things Everest today notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media automatically turned us into heroic figures,''
remarked Hillary, speaking on Tuesday to an audience at Grand
Circle Travel in Boston. ``I think Tenzing may well have been one,
because he came from extremely modest beginnings and had great
courage and determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, never regarded myself as a hero, though,'' Hillary
said, untainted by a tone of false modesty. ``I was just an
enthusiastic mountaineer who wanted to be the first, if possible,
to reach the summit of great mountains. And perhaps take a few
risks in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Having failed to ``destroy my public persona,'' Hillary added
with a chuckle, ``in the end I came to accept it. Because if I
didn't, I could not move on.''
</P>
<P>
   And move on he has. Hillary _ a small mountain of a man with
bushy eyebrows, ruddy red cheeks, and vestiges of the boyish grin
that once flashed around the world from the very top of the planet
_ maintains a punishing travel schedule, accompanied by his second
wife, June. (Hillary's first wife and daughter died in a plane
crash in Nepal in 1977.)
</P>
<P>
   Based in New Zealand, where Hillary was born in 1919 to an
Auckland beekeeper, the couple spends eight months a year on the
road, with April penciled in for Nepal. From 1985 to 1990, Hillary
served as New Zealand's ambassador to India, Bangladesh, and Nepal.
No diplomat who ever landed in New Delhi was more beloved than
Hillary was during his 4 1/2 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Hillarys' time these days is spent raising funds and
awareness for his Himalayan Trust foundation. Established more than
30 years ago, the trust has built 26 schools, 13 health centers,
and two hospitals for the Sherpa people of the Himalayas, one of 50
ethnic groups native to Nepal; famous for their adaptation to high
altitudes, the Sherpas are Tibetan by origin and Buddhist by
religious preference. The trust's current focus is a
teacher-training program designed to help staff the Nepalese
schools built by Hillary's indefatigable philanthropy, one facet of
a post-mountaineering career that has also embraced
environmentalism, conservation, and diplomacy. In Washington this
week, the Smithsonian Institution awarded Hillary its James
Smithson Bicentennial Medal for his humanitarian efforts in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the more remote schools, the level of education is nowhere
near what it could be,'' Hillary explained in a private interview
prior to his slide show for employees of Grand Circle, a major
benefactor of the teacher-training program. ``We expected to have
30 to 40 teachers our first year. We had 180 instead, so already it
has been a great success.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he considers his work in Nepal some form of repayment
for a lifelong debt, Hillary nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel not only a great friendship with the Sherpa people,''
he said, ``but also a deep appreciation for what they've done for
all mountaineers and trekkers. If you ask them what they want, they
mention health care and education facilities. So we try to help
them. Rarely do we go into an area and tell them what they should
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the interview turned in the direction of Everest,
which, owing to Jon Krakauer's best-selling book (``Into Thin
Air'') and David Breashears's breathtaking IMAX film is back in the
public consciousness to a degree rivaling any period since
Hillary's ascent. In both cases, book and film, Everest's capacity
to claim lives, not just elevate them, serves as the dramatic
centerpiece. Eight people died on the mountain during the
calamitous May 1996 storm witnessed by both author and filmmaker.
Hillary, never one to downplay the danger involved, has been
critical of what he sees as the overcommerialization of
high-altitude mountaineering. And when an authority like Hillary
speaks, the professional climbing community listens.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the current fascination has to do with the disasters
that have occurred,'' Hillary said, seated alongside his wife.
``The fact that everything coincided _ the film team, Krakauer, the
storm _ brought Everest to the forefront of public interest. To me,
the Everest film was quite exciting, particularly the helicopter
shots. It was not quite like I remember it _ '' he laughed heartily
``because Tenzing and I were at ground level, naturally. Navigating
ice fields offers a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really the lucky ones,'' Hillary continued. ``We had
to do everything ourselves: establish the route, battle our way up
the ice cliffs and across the crevasses, make our way high up the
mountain. It was up to us to do it all. Nowadays a lot of these
commercial expeditions are really conducted tours. The people who
go up Everest never set foot on snow that doesn't already have a
footprint on it. They climb up fixed ropes and on aluminum ladders.
There are still dangers, of course, but it's not quite like solving
a monumental problem on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Hillary's historic climb, approximately 700 people have
reached the top of Everest. Another 150 have died making the
attempt. To join a modern Everest expedition, a climber who meets
the basic physical requirements needs little high-mountaineering
experience _ but plenty of cash. Paying $65,000 or more to be
escorted up Everest strikes Hillary as a formula for disaster, and
he has been unafraid to say so. Among the targets of his criticism
was his friend Rob Hall, the famed New Zealand climber who led
Krakauer's 1996 expedition and perished in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had argued with Hall about the overcommercialization issue,
and obviously we disagreed about this,'' said Hillary. ``But when
you take along people with very little mountaineering experience
who have paid all that money, there's a great determination for
them to get their money's worth. So Rob may have pushed things when
he knew all too well not to. I'd been forecasting some sort of
disaster under these circumstances, so it did not altogether
surprise me when it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   For a year or so afterward, Hillary observed, the number of
expeditions permitted on Everest was cut back. That trend has
reversed itself, however, despite Hillary lobbying the Nepalese
government to restrict access. Now instead of two or three climbing
groups per season there are as many as 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nepalese collect $10,000 per climber,'' Hillary noted.
``At seven climbers per expedition, that's a lot of US dollars. I'm
afraid the money is more important to them than the welfare of the
climbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he ever truly afraid for his own life during his many
expeditions into the wild?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I've been scared to death hundreds of times,'' replied
Hillary. ``I've fallen down crevasses and been in avalanches, seen
some filthy weather and exposed places. But I happen to believe
that fear can be quite stimulating too. It helps you take a
disadvantage and turn it into an advantage. When I hear someone
says he's setting off on an adventure with great confidence he'll
be successful, I ask, why on earth is he going at all? Why not try
something he's not so confident about? That's certainly been my own
philosophy over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return from Everest, Hillary later told his audience,
British physiologist Dr. Roger Bannister _ the man who broke the
four-minute-mile barrier as a runner _ invited the mountaineer to
his clinic for a series of tests. Hillary had been feasting on
smoked salmon and champagne for a week, he recalled. When Bannister
was finished doing the tests, he looked at Hillary and said,
``Well, I don't know how you did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary still finds Bannister's pronouncement most amusing. The
man who stands and applauds a new chapter in Himalayan
mountaineering history pride _ symbolized by the record-setting
Everest climb this year by Kaji Sherpa, Tenzing Norgay's spiritual
heir _ remains circumspect about his own accomplishments. If John
Glenn can return to space, it was suggested to Hillary, might he
not yet have mountains to climb?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at my stage of life, no,'' he said, shaking his head.
``But if I thought I was fit enough, and the opportunity presented
itself, I would go up into space, no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He winked at Lady Hillary, who smiled back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a rocket,'' she said with a sigh. ``Like a rocket.''

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ When President Lazaro Cardenas seized control of
Mexico's oil supply from greedy American and European companies in
1938, he was considered a hero by his proud but downtrodden
countrymen. From that one decree to nationalize the petroleum
industry, oil became Mexico's lifeblood, and a state-controlled
organization called Petroleos Mexicanos, better known as Pemex,
became its sole legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years later, Pemex's image is anything but heroic.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the company's political and economic ties to the
government have made it a haven for patronage and inefficiency that
has caused significantly higher prices for consumers. Many citizens
who once supported the idea of a nationally controlled oil industry
now say they are growing weary of subsidizing an increasingly
costly bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, we have been told that our political sovereignty
depends on petroleum, but that's not true anymore,'' said Miguel
Garcia Reyes, a professor at Colegio de Mexico who specializes in
energy and oil studies.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the Mexican government announced last
Friday that it would raise gasoline prices 15 percent to about
$1.60 a gallon to cover budget shortfalls and lower revenues earned
this year by Pemex. Over the last four years, the price of gasoline
in Mexico has increased more than 300 percent _ at a time when
world prices are near their lowest in a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   The gas hike was the last straw for Mario de la Rosa Vega, a
Mexico City taxi driver who must fill up his boxy sedan every other
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are one of the biggest oil countries in the world, but we
pay so much money for gasoline,'' said de la Rosa. ``This is the
price that ordinary Mexicans pay for being prisoners to Pemex.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pemex has outlasted other monopolies in Mexico.
Telephones, railroads, and electricity, all once considered vital
to the country's survival, have been privatized or opened to the
free market. Even Cardenas's own Institutional Ruling Party, or
PRI, which has won every presidential election since 1920, now
shares power with an opposition-led Congress and with several
governors and mayors who belong to other parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many things have changed in technology, economics, and
society,'' Garcia added. ``I'm not saying we just sell off all of
Pemex, but it's time for a new model.''
</P>
<P>
   The current model allows Pemex to act and look much like a
Fortune 500 corporation. It has a director and board of directors.
The company's headquarters is in a modern, 48-story skyscraper. The
behemoth is carved into four main areas: exploration and
production, natural gas, petrochemicals, and refineries. All of the
nation's gas stations bear the Pemex name and sell its fuel.
</P>
<P>
   But Pemex functions more like a public agency. The director
reports to the federal energy secretary and often answers directly
to the president. Jobs and contracts are often doled out to those
most connected to the ruling party. And much of the company's
yearly revenues are funneled into the central treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The government has benefited most from this arrangement. More
than one-third of its roughly $100 billion in yearly revenues comes
from Pemex oil fields, royalties, taxes, and fuel sales. With so
much dependence on Pemex funds, experts say, the government has
done little to diversify its tax base despite the growth of
manufacturing and service jobs in the country over the last twenty
years.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Pemex relies heavily on government budget
allocations for much of its investment in maintenance, refineries,
and new drilling _ capital projects that for years have lagged
behind the United States, Venezuela and other oil-exporting
countries.
</P>
<P>
   This year, because of falling oil prices and weaker demand
around the world, Pemex has been forced to cut exports to about 1.3
million barrels per day and slash about $1 billion out of its $11.5
billion budget. At a press conference last Thursday, Adrian Lajous,
the company's director, announced that Pemex had lost $460 million
in the third quarter and that net profits were 36 percent lower
than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the administration of President Ernesto Zedillo
released its 1999 budget, in which it called for the 15 percent
gasoline price hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 10 years, Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil have
changed their petroleum industry to a more open system and they've
benefited through lower prices,'' said George Baker, director of
Mexico Energy Intelligence, a Houston-based consulting group. ``If
Mexico had an open market there are plenty of companies who could
sell their gas for less'' than what they're paying now, he added.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the costs stemming from Pemex's inefficiency and
the country's refusal to open up its oil market, critics point to a
1995 decision by the Zedillo administration to sell more heavy
crude oil to the United States and import gasoline for domestic
use. Using current prices, Mexico sells each barrel to the United
States for about $11, while each barrel of imported gasoline is
sold back to Mexico for $60.
</P>
<P>
   For now, neither government officials nor Pemex directors are
willing to consider privatizing the monopoly, mostly because of its
financial importance to the budget and for fear of angering the
company's powerful, 114,000-member labor union with crucial
presidential elections less than two years away.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials do, however, pledge to make Pemex leaner and
more competitive by seeking more foreign investors and selling
non-core pieces of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, it began a $400 million project with Shell to
increase heavy crude oil processing at a plant in Texas. Also in
1995, the Mexican Congress opened up the national gas distribution
market to private competition. Last year, Pemex awarded a $1.6
billion contract to Korean and German firms to renovate a refinery
in the northern city of Monterrey. And two weeks ago, officials
said the company would sell off much its aging fleet of marine
tankers.
</P>
<P>
   But Pemex directors aknowledge they will have to raise more than
$7 billion in additional foreign capital to finance much-needed
programs over the next two years, especially to modernize its
refineries.
</P>
<P>
   And if Pemex is to preserve its standing with ordinary Mexicans,
it will also likely have to clean up its environmental act in areas
where it has been accused of ruining fields and polluting
neighborhoods where it has refineries and pipelines, such as the
states of Tabasco and Veracruz and in parts of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are those who believe that despite the pain of
higher prices and the costs associated with maintaining a
less-competitive oil company, Pemex's monopoly won't end until the
PRI monopoly on the presidency is broken, which could happen in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading candidates, Vicente Fox, of the pro-business
National Action Party, has said that if he wins he'll dismantle
Pemex.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible candidate is Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the son of
Pemex's creator, who now belongs to the center-left Party of the
Democratic Revolution and is Mexico City's mayor. He hasn't said
what, if anything, he would do about Pemex.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a ironic, wouldn't it?'' said one American oil
company executive based in Mexico. ``If he were smart, he would see
that Pemex isn't helping the poor anymore. It's hurting them. His
father wouldn't stand for that.''

CATHOLIC BISHOPS AFFIRM `NEW MILLENIUM' COMMITMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Commentary)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (Mike McManus is a syndicated columnist whose ``Ethics &AMP;
Religion'' appears in almost 100 newspapers)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WASHINGTON -- The National Conference of Catholic Bishops has
elected to its top posts a Spanish-speaking bishop from the
Southwest and an African-American bishop, both of whom have been
strongly committed to the cause of the poor and the marginalized.
 &HT;    Bishop Joseph Fiorenza of Galveston-Houston was elected
president for three years. He is the first NCCB president from the
South or Southwest.
 &HT;    As vice president, the conference elected Bishop Wilton Gregory,
the first African-American bishop to reach that position, making it
likely he will be elected president at the end of Fiorenza's term.
 &HT;    Both are deeply committed to fighting injustice and poverty and
have plans to get millions of middle-class Catholics involved in a
''Jubilee Pledge'' for the New Millennium, to help fulfill Jesus'
pledge ''to bring glad tidings to the poor ... to proclaim liberty
to captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the
oppressed go free.''
 &HT;    As the son of an immigrant barber from Sicily, Fiorenza, 67, has
''a heart for those who came to this country to make a better life
for their families,'' said Father Troy Gately, vice chancellor of
the new president's diocese. ''He has a rock-solid devotion to
those who are marginalized: the poor and immigrants.''
 &HT;    For example, as a young priest he joined Martin Luther King Jr.
in his 1965 Selma civil rights march. Shortly after becoming bishop
of Galveston-Houston in 1984, he launched a city-wide campaign for
the homeless. He got leaders of other denominations to join him in
creating a nonprofit housing corporation that has built many
housing units for the poor. He has fought for a higher minimum wage
and raised millions for the disadvantaged to attend Catholic
schools.
 &HT;    When Father Wilton Gregory was named an auxiliary bishop in
Chicago, he was only 35 years old and America's youngest Catholic
bishop. Father Bob Byrne, a friend for 20 years, says Gregory is
''very personable, extremely bright, with a fantastic memory of
anything he has ever read or seen, a person is as comfortable with
a cardinal as he was with my parents, who were farmers.''
 &HT;    As bishop of the largely rural diocese of Belleville in southern
Illinois since 1994, Gregory, now 50, created a largely lay
Diocesan Pastoral Council, and gave it substantial responsibility.
It created a Poverty Services Committee that has developed plans to
help the poor ''move from welfare to work.'' Volunteers are being
recruited and trained as mentors and tutors.
 &HT;    The Council identified ways that lay people could help pastor
and spearheaded a $12 million campaign to strengthen parish
councils and leadership development of youth.
 &HT;    In 1979 Catholic bishops published a paper on racism and vowed
to help eradicate discrimination in American society. ''Twenty
years later, hope in the possibility of achieving that great goal
has diminished, not only in the Church but also throughout
society,'' said a new NCCB report. ''Sadly, many people of color
see the Church as a white racist institution.''
 &HT;    The election of Bishop Gregory is one indication the Catholic
hierarchy is committed to change.
 &HT;    More important, Catholic bishops adopted a pastoral letter,
''Everyday Christianity: To Hunger and Thirst for Justice.'' It
states that ''Every believer is called to serve `the least of
these,' to `hunger and thirst for justice,' to be a `peacemaker.'
It outlines how to do so by encouraging every Catholic to sign a
''Jubilee Pledge for Charity, Justice and Peace, a Catholic
Commitment for the New Millennium.'' As disciples of Jesus,
individuals will pledge to:
 &HT;    --Pray regularly for greater justice and peace.
 &HT;    --Learn more about Catholic social teaching and its call to
protect human life, stand with the poor, and care for creation.
 &HT;    --Reach across boundaries of religion, race, ethnicity, gender
and disabling conditions.
 &HT;    --Live justly in family life, school, work, the marketplace and
the political arena.
 &HT;    --Serve those who are poor and vulnerable, sharing more time and
talent.
 &HT;    --Give more generously to those in need at home and abroad.
 &HT;    --Advocate for public policies that protect human life, promote
human dignity, preserve God's creation and build peace.
 &HT;    --Encourage others to work for greater charity, justice and
peace.
 &HT;    The Jubilee Pledge, which will be distributed in every parish,
is meant to motivate 61 million Catholics, who are mostly middle
class to prosperous, to consider how they are now serving the poor
and working for justice, and find specific ways to take new steps
to ''ACT on the pledge.''
 &HT;    In electing Bishops Fiorenza and Gregory, Catholic bishops could
not have chosen better men to lead this noble cause, a new drive to
help Catholics live the faith they profess.

 &HT;    U.S. could use history lesson to remind them of oil crisis
 &HT;    By Ana Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In these days when we're drowning in cheap oil, it's startling
to think that 25 years ago we were being told we would be out of
the stuff by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Arab oil embargo?
</P>
<P>
   Those were the times of odd/even days when the numbers on your
license plate determined whether or not you got a fill-up, or
whatever gasoline was available.
</P>
<P>
   People were hesitant to travel for fear they would find no fuel
for a return trip. And no one paid attention to the pleas to not
top off our tanks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange and new sight to see service stations with
``closed'' and ``out of gas'' signs posted. Strange and
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   When you did see a station open, you stopped regardless of what
your fuel gauge said because you didn't know when your next chance
would come. You stopped if you could afford it, that is.
</P>
<P>
   David Fuller, an attorney for R Lacy, a family-owned oil
exploration company, said he was a ``poor, struggling law student
living in a $70 a month apartment'' near Baylor University in 1973.
Finances and the oil shortage caused him and his friends to choose
activities within walking distance of campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worse in other parts of the country,'' he said,
recalling news accounts of violence in the long gas lines,
especially on the East and West coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a couple of slumps and one war later, the United States has
slid into an even greater dependence on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been lulled into a false sense of security that it will
always be that way,'' he said, referring to plentiful, and cheap,
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   And we are much more vulnerable than we were 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Exploration is almost exclusively off U.S. shores and in foreign
countries. Oil was what the Gulf War was about and the other areas
on which we depend for oil are not exactly bastions of political
stability: Russia, South America, Mexico, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, who returned to his hometown of Longview, Texas, 10
years ago, said he really hopes that oil-supplied energy will
always be plentiful, but that is by no means a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do forget what it was like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of comical to think about it now. The government
actually thought we were truly running out of oil. Now, 25 years
later, the world is literally awash in oil. ... Go back and look at
what the Department of Energy was saying in 1973. Reports published
by credible people said we would be out of oil by the year 2000,
(others said) we would be using it for only 10 percent of our
energy needs. But no one predicted that we would be as heavily
dependent as we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are some folks who don't have to learn a lesson more
than once.
</P>
<P>
   My dad, who operated a gas station for some 40 years, supplied
me with a 1959 Buick when I turned 16 in 1972. All my friends and
their friends could fit in that car.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime shortly after 1973, I was driving a Volkswagen Beetle.

A WOMAN'S DEATH HAUNTS SHERIFF IN TEXAS OIL COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 22)   (EDs: With MYSTERY-DEATH-SIDE)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKELLYTOWN, Texas _ Three years ago, the everyday existence of
the conservative Texas Panhandle was peeled back to expose an
unlikely secret.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Born Howell's body was found slumped forward, face
first, against the base of a twisted oak tree in a Panhandle oil
patch ravine.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old mother of three boys was found fully clothed,
resting on her elbows and knees. She had not been robbed. There
were two gunshot wounds to her chest and a 9mm semi-automatic
pistol was lying on the ground by her side. There were no
footprints leading to or from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 16, 1995, death of Cynthia Howell had the unmistakable
signs of a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   But to Loren Brand, an author, former rock musician and the
sheriff of Carson County, something didn't seem right.
</P>
<P>
   Two gunshot wounds, but no pool of blood. No footprints, not
even Howell's. Shell casings in the wrong places.
</P>
<P>
   As Brand, a veteran lawman who has held a badge in two states,
studied the evidence, it was obvious to him that Howell had been
slain. He may have found the motive hours after Howell's body was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of making his routine checks to put the case to
rest, Brand stumbled upon a subplot: Cynthia Howell and her
husband, Danny Howell, it seemed, had a secret, one they shared
with other couples scattered throughout the quiet burgs and farming
communities of the Northwest Texas Bible Belt.
</P>
<P>
   They were swingers _ couples who swap sexual partners.
</P>
<P>
   A spouse typically is considered a major suspect when a mate is
slain. But a polygraph examination cleared Danny Howell, witnesses
can pinpoint his whereabouts the day of his wife's death, and
there's not a shred of evidence that links him to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Brand and Howell, 42, differ on what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Howell, who co-owned a nursery business in nearby Spearman with
his wife, is adamant that her death was a suicide, but said he felt
responsible for it nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   She took the ultimate way out, Howell said, because he didn't
leave her any choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something that got out of hand,'' he said. ``We were
playing with fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand said there were too many inconsistencies to call Cynthia
Howell's death a case of suicide. But he has no leads, no suspects
and no new ideas. The official ruling in the death is ``suspicious
and undetermined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be easy to rule this as a suicide and drop it,'' Brand
said. ``But that wouldn't be right. I don't want to hurt Danny
Howell or his family. But I've got to find out what happened to
that woman. That's my job. And I'm going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre saga began at about 2 p.m. on Nov. 16, 1995, when a
rancher called the Carson County Sheriff's Office in nearby
Panhandle to report seeing an abandoned car, a 1989 rose and mauve
Olds 98, parked on his land.
</P>
<P>
   Rugged and ugly, the ranch typifies the terrain on this end of
the five-county Panhandle Oil Field. It's a nightmarish landscape
of scorched hills covered with a spotty patchwork of creosote and
noxious weeds. The hills are cut by a jagged network of dusty
ravines and crisscrossed by a serpentine string of dirt roads that
connect the weathered oil well pump jacks.
</P>
<P>
   Brand's deputies traced the car to Spearman, a town of 3,200
located 40 miles north near the Oklahoma border, and ultimately to
Danny Howell.
</P>
<P>
   Howell, who rushed to the Sheriff's Office as soon as he was
called, told deputies that the couple had argued earlier that day
and that his wife had left angry. He also said his wife was
diabetic and might be in some medical danger if she didn't get her
insulin shot.
</P>
<P>
   By 2:45 p.m., Brand's deputies and rescue crews had begun a land
and aerial search. It took nearly three hours for a helicopter crew
to find Howell's body.
</P>
<P>
   When Brand arrived at the scene, he noticed a few things
immediately. Women tend to dress up before they take their life,
Brand said. They rarely use guns, preferring to take a drug
overdose.
</P>
<P>
   And women who leave behind small children tend to leave notes
with very detailed instructions about how to care for their
children, the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Howell left no note. She was dressed plainly _ jeans,
shirt, Windbreaker, sneakers _ and without makeup. When she was
found, she was still wearing her square-framed glasses.
</P>
<P>
   And she used a gun, which her husband had purchased years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   If Howell had turned the gun on herself, the shell casings would
have ejected to her left, Brand said. Instead, they were found to
her right.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the wounds. One bullet just wounded her,
entering her left breast and exiting through her back. The fatal
shot, fired through her chest, severed her pulmonary aorta,
according to the autopsy by Lubbock coroner Sparks Veasey.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of person shoots themselves in the chest, then has
the presence of mind to say `Oh, I didn't kill myself. I need to
shoot myself again?''' Brand said. ``She was either very dedicated
to the idea of killing herself or she had some help.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy showed some blood had collected in her chest, but
the ground underneath her was clean.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said investigators dug 7 inches down and tested the soil
but could find no trace of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the absence of footprints, Howell's shoes, socks and the
bottom of her jeans were clean _ no dust, grass burrs, or cactus
needles _ even though she was found nearly two miles from where her
car was parked. The terrain between the two points would have left
some trace on her shoes or socks, Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more puzzling: There were no prints anywhere on the weapon,
the bullet or the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Howell wasn't wearing gloves, nor were there any gloves
found anywhere in the field.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest surprise came when Brand and deputies went to
the locked Oldsmobile and found Howell's purse.
</P>
<P>
   First, he found a brochure bearing typed text and two
photocopied pictures. The text was a personal ad, written
ostensibly by a New Mexico couple, both in their 30s or 40s, eager
to meet like-minded couples in the Eastern New Mexico-West Texas
area. One picture showed a smiling woman wearing an unbuttoned
shirt. The other photo was a full frontal nude shot of a man.
</P>
<P>
   Next Brand found a half-dozen unopened condom packages.
</P>
<P>
   Then came handwritten notes bearing the first names of couples
and phone numbers. Brand reached a man in Fort Worth who
reluctantly spoke to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very evasive, but he finally says they were involved in
a `swing' group,'' Brand said. ``As worldly as I am, I thought it
was a square-dance group or a clogging deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the guy told me it was a sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand sat back in his chair and ran it through his mind: Danny
and Cynthia Howell. Small-town business owners. Parents. Happily
married 18 years. Swingers.
</P>
<P>
   But no answers on the death of Cynthia Howell.

`INHERITORS' DARK START FALLS APART IN THE END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In theory, the meek may inherit the earth. But in Stefan
Ruzowitzky's abrasive dark comedy, the rich and greedy will
certainly try to keep them from getting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Inheritors'' is a morality tale about seven Austrian
peasants who inherit a farm _ and the curse that has been cast over
it _ from a bachelor landowner who is mysteriously murdered by a
mute woman in black named Rosalind (Elisabeth Orth).
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy neighboring farmer, Danninger (Ulrich Wildgruber),
believes the land should be incorporated into his own vast expanse,
but Hillinger, the dead farmer, has left a last will and testament
whose contents will humiliate and shock the entire
backwards-thinking town.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves the property to his serf workers, including Lukas
(Simon Schwarz) and the proud, formidable Emmy (Sophie Rois), an
unheard of bequest. He sneeringly tells them he hopes they'll fight
over it amongst themselves, and indeed, they do.
</P>
<P>
   The old caste system no longer applies once the peasants become
landowners and a struggle for dignity and freedom ensues. Soon
other peasants on other farms begin to revolt, and the rich
Danninger and his henchmen converge and scheme to bring the
``one-seventh farmers'' to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Dutch masters as a visual point of departure,
Ruzowitzky creates a lush, surface serenity that is boiling just
below with hate, envy, ignorance and avarice. ``The Inheritors''
looks ravishing in its timelessness; indeed, we're hard pressed to
figure out just when the story takes place. It's earthy conflict
between class and religion forms its own mythology, one that is
often reminiscent of films by Ingmar Bergman and Bille August.
</P>
<P>
   But what begins as a strict morality tale soon loses its
original voice and winds up a carbon copy of Terrence Malick's 1977
classic, ``Days Of Heaven.'' It's obvious Ruzowitzky has been
influenced heavily by Malick's biblical story of two lovers who
hire on as itinerant fieldhands to a rich, dying Texas farmer, even
borrowing the narration. In this case, Severin (Lars Rudolph), one
of the inheritors, provides the voiceover.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the film falls apart in its second half, shifting
tone so quickly between its dark humor, villainous revenge tale and
mythic fable that, by the end, becomes something else entirely.
</P>
<P>

SOME WORRY ABOUT GOVERNMENT'S POLICY-MAKING ROLE IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An altogether perplexing mix technologists, business folk,
engineers, lobbyists, and lawyers gathered Saturday in Cambridge,
Mass. to discuss the future of the Internet. The occasion was the
first public meeting of the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and
Numbers, or ICANN _ the new nonprofit California corporation that
will probably be granted ultimate authority by the US government
over all technical aspects of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ICANN was created last month by Jon Postel. The research
scientist at University of California's Information Sciences
Institute is regarded by many as one of the inventors of the 'Net.
For more than 20 years Postel had presided over the Internet's most
technical decisions, recording decisions that were made by rough
consensus and helping to resolve conflicts when they arose.
</P>
<P>
   Postel also decided who would run the Internet's
``nameservers,'' which connect users to the sites they are looking
for, and how 'Net addresses would be apportioned to governments,
companies, universities, organizations, and even individuals.
Postel walked into this job, friends say, because he was better at
recording facts and figures than the other Internet pioneers of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   But with the rapid commercialization of the Internet in recent
years, many people felt that it was inappropriate for the
Internet's ultimate arbiter to be a single individual. Some people
wanted to see this function performed by some kind of elected body.
Others, reasoning that governments can't be trusted, thought the
Internet's ultimate authority should rest in the hands of private
industry.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year the federal National Telecommunications and
Information Administration has wrestled with this question. NTIA
put out two papers requesting proposals. Over the summer it
received three responses, one from Postel, one from an organization
called the Boston Working Group, and one from the Open Root Server
Confederation. There was a lot of conflict among the proposals, and
many of the participants were looking forward to a hashing out the
details in a public form.
</P>
<P>
   Then the unthinkable happened: Jon Postel died on Oct. 16 from a
burst aorta.
</P>
<P>
   Since Postel's death things have moved quickly. On Oct. 20, the
Commerce Department wrote a letter to ISI, Postel's home
institution, saying the United States intends to move carefully but
expeditiously to private management of the Internet address system
and essentially gave ISI the green light to set up ICANN. Shortly
thereafter a Washington attorney named Jon Sims telephoned 10
individuals, telling them that they had been chosen by Postel to be
ICANN's interim board. Nine agreed. On Oct. 26, the board met in
secret and appointed Esther Dyson, a former journalist who now runs
Edventure Holdings, an venture capital firm, as its interim
chairman. Postel's stature all but guarants his proposal would
ultimately be approved by the government, and his untimely death
has done much to silence public criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 14 meeting was supposed to be ICANN's first public
meeting, but no business of any substance was conducted. Instead,
the meeting became a forum in which many people attacked ICANN's
proposed procedures, its mandate, and its very legitimacy.
Attendees demanded to know how ICANN's interim board had been
chosen. Others demanded to know how ICANN would raise money to
conduct business. Still others demanded to know how the
organization would be held accountable for its decisions. And then
there was the question that was on everybody's minds: what gave the
government the power to decide the Internet's future. Shouldn't
that be done democratically by the Internet's users?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had created an electorate to elect us, the question
would have been by what authority are you creating that
electorate?'' said Dyson, shortly after the meeting was called to
order.
</P>
<P>
   It was somewhat frightening to see Dyson brush aside the
democratic desires of the people attending her meeting. Many people
attending thought that the Internet created the possibility for a
new kind of world-wide direct democracy. But instead, the board's
initial actions made it look like it would just be a reformation of
20th century power structures.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, government of the United States, reportedly the
greatest democracy on earth, seems to think that policy decisions
in cyberspace are best decided by private corporations that are
appointed by government regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board's bylaws prohibit the public from attending
meetings, permit secret votes, and provide no way for the public to
appeal ICANN's decisions,'' wrote commentator Declan McCullagh in
an article that appeared in Wired News.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people who didn't bother to attend the meeting largely
regard the controversy surrounding ICANN's creation as a tempest in
a teapot. After all, they say, the real control of the Internet is
already in the hands of companies like MCI, Sprint, and AT&AMP;T _ the
companies that actually operate the Internet's long-distance links.
</P>
<P>
   But control over directories and protocols is real power, as the
world is just beginning to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys will have a choke-hold on the economy of the US and
the world,'' said Dan Parisi, who runs the pornographic Web site
Whitehouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   Parisi has learned first-hand just how much control an
organization like ICANN will potentially wield. His Web site,
easily mistaken for a site operated by the US government, has long
been a thorn in the side of anti-pornography advocates and the feds
alike. And indeed, Whitehouse.coms makes frequent reference to the
first couple, going so far as to put their faces on the
pornographic photographs of sex models. But the US government has
never been able to shut down the site, largely because it does not
have a trademark on the word Whitehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Parisi noticed something odd: the number of
visitors coming to his site dropped by 90 percent. Parisi's
technical staff said that something was wrong with the Internet's
nameservers --- a new problem that was only affecting his
particular Web site. But the Internet's operators at Network
Solutions blamed Parisi's crew. The problem kept up for two weeks,
costing Parasi more than $50,000. Then, just as quietly as it had
started, the problem ended and the situation returned to normal.
Was this truly a technical glitch, or a warning? There is no way to
tell for sure.

SCARS REMAIN FROM A TRAGIC MARITAL DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 22)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROY BRAGG  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANHANDLE, Texas _ Police scanner traffic crackled in the
background as Danny Howell and his teen-aged son sat silently in
the Carson County sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   It was near dusk on a Nov. 16, 1995, and there had been no sign
of his wife, Cynthia Howell, for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Her abandoned car was found parked on a roadside in a isolated
oil field 16 miles away. Deputies and rescue workers had combed the
field all afternoon looking for clues.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours, a solemn Howell said nothing and knew nothing.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:48 p.m., there was a flurry of radio chatter. Howell
couldn't make out what they were saying, but it was obvious
something had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew,'' he said in a recent interview. ``By then, I already
knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, deputies pulled Howell to the side with
the news that his wife's body had been found at the bottom of a
ravine in a far corner of the oil field where the car was parked.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Howell, 36, died from two gunshot wounds to the chest.
Though her husband said the death was a suicide, the official
ruling is that the death was ``suspicious and undetermined.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell, now 42, broke down where he stood. His sister had to
help him of the sheriff's office and into her car.
</P>
<P>
   That night, at the family's home in Spearman, a distraught
Howell stood in the middle of the kitchen and wept. Suddenly, with
his family looking on, he pulled a carving knife out of a drawer
and plunged it into his own gut.
</P>
<P>
   He was flown to an Amarillo hospital. The knife didn't penetrate
very far and missed important arteries and organs. Howell was
released after two days to attend his wife's funeral at the Baptist
church.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after that day, the stomach gash has long since
healed, but another wound remains open.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Loren Brand says discrepancies in the evidence _ no
footprints at the scene, no blood on the ground, no fingerprints on
the gun, and the presence of two wounds _ make suicide an unlikely
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Howell chafed at the suggestion that his wife was
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad enough that I lost my wife,'' he said. ``The sheriff
doesn't want to turn it loose. There's not enough blood. Or the gun
laid down wrong. It doesn't matter to me. I know what I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as the thought pains Danny Howell, he said his wife
probably killed herself after a weekend trip to a Dallas swinging
venue where couples swap sexual partners. That trip ended in a
vicious argument that morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that I don't think
about it, because I still do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Howell was uncomfortable talking about the couple's sexual
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were country hicks going to try something different,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He would not discuss exactly what happened in Dallas that
started the fight between them, saying that she crossed an
emotional line at some point while they were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hurt me,'' he said. ``I saw her with another man. It
killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   They argued on the drive back to Spearman.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 16, the morning after the trip to Dallas where their
lives apparently unraveled, Danny Howell said he woke up mad.
</P>
<P>
   He went into the kitchen and there was a cup of coffee, as there
was every morning, by his chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to make it up to me,'' he said of the gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his temper blinded him. He looked up and saw Cynthia Howell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said ... I never, ever will forgive you for what you did,'''
he said. ``She said, `You don't mean that, do you?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say nothing,'' he recalled in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   She got up and left the room, then the house.
</P>
<P>
   It was 9 a.m. Two hours later, she called Howell at the couple's
nursery business. He recounted this conversation with his wife:
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you?'' Howell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late for that,'' she said calmly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I guess it is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke with a sense of finality, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to cremate me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Howell said nothing. There was a pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny,'' she said. ``Take care of the boys. I'll miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell said that was the last he ever heard from his wife.

`GODS AND MONSTERS' HAS MUCH TO RECOMMEND IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are so many remarkable moments in the unforgettable ``Gods
and Monsters'' that it's difficult to know where to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Director and writer Bill Condon bases his film on a
fictionalized account (Christopher Bram's novel, ``The Father of
Frankenstein'') of the months before movie director James Whale was
found dead, floating in his swimming pool, in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Through flashbacks, Condon touches upon complex psychological
themes, painting stirring contrasts and parallels between the
personal demons Whale (Ian McKellen) could never exorcise in life _
and the monster he immortalized on celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hot Los Angeles summer and Whale has long retired from
making movies. Though he gave the world such notable classics as
``Hell's Angels,'' ``Waterloo Bridge,'' ``The Invisible Man,''
``The Man In The Iron Mask'' and ``Show Boat,'' he is only
remembered for his 1931 horror classic, ``Frankenstein,'' and its
sequel, ``Bride of Frankenstein'' (``The others were done by
hacks,'' sniffs Whale).
</P>
<P>
   Into his idle existence, for he lives alone with his German
housekeeper, Hanna (Lynn Redgrave), comes a young gardener, Clayton
Boone (Brendan Fraser), who befriends the old man and poses for him
as a sketch model.
</P>
<P>
   Boone doesn't know at first that Whale supposedly was drummed
out of Hollywood because of a sex scandal: he was openly gay. But
Whale later tells him he was a pariah because ``The Road Back,''
his quintessential film statement about war, was taken away from
him and recut by the studio and, when it failed at the box office,
Whale took the fall instead of the director who replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   A strange, compelling relationship develops between the erudite
bon vivant Englishman, and the young, hunky and heterosexual Boone,
who is barely schooled.
</P>
<P>
   They find a common ground in war. Whale was an officer in ``the
great war,'' losing his first love to it, and Boone enlisted in the
Marines to escape his abusive childhood. They're both running away
from their pasts and that initially bonds them. But Whale, haunted
by frail health and too much spare time, discovers the pain of his
early years (``it runs all over me,'' he complains) cannot be
ignored for long.
</P>
<P>
   Condon's extraordinary look at the last chapter in a forgotten
film artist's life is filled with great beauty and sadness. It's a
tinged, fading portrait of a man and his legacy, handed down to a
new friend _ because the old ones are all dead or have gone away.
</P>
<P>
   Condon shoots with great style and a wonderful eye for texture _
the camera sways and swoons over Whale, creating an eerie parallel
to scenes in his own films. Like Billy Wilder's great expose of
Hollywood, ``Sunset Boulevard,'' Condon's film captures the
difficult emotional void of how it feels to be forgotten after once
being on top of the world; Whale's house is an echo of empty
footsteps and shadows.
</P>
<P>
   McKellen, Redgrave and Fraser are all extraordinary. McKellen,
with his expressive face and fluttery hands, perfectly conveys the
agony that ultimately overtakes Whale. The movie belongs to him _
and it may be the part for which he's remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Though Whale could never escape the trauma brought by war, he
continually tried to expurgate the monsters lurking in his soul,
mind and heart by melding them into his art. In the end, they
destroyed him.
</P>

BRANAGH IS IRRITATING AS ALLEN IMITATOR IN `CELEBRITY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What will Woody Allen's place in our cultural history be? He's
taught us about relationships (``Annie Hall''), morality and ethics
(``Crimes and Misdemeanors'') and murder (``Manhattan Murder
Mystery''). He's made us laugh over family and infidelity (``Hannah
and Her Sisters'') and cry at a mother's desperate suicide
(``Interiors'').
</P>
<P>
   The comedy ``Celebrity,'' as one characters tidily sums it up,
``says a lot about a society by examining who they choose to
celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Woody, the view isn't very becoming. We exalt super
models and delinquent actors; we follow them through rehab and
relationships. If a woman shoots her husband's underage lover, we
eat up the details. And when a hostage comes home, we give him a
medal and the key to the city (``But why?'' asks one old woman in
the film. ``Any idiot can get captured.'')
</P>
<P>
   Allen follows a couple, Lee (Kenneth Branagh) and Robin (Judy
Davis), as they acrimoniously split up, move apart and try to begin
anew. Lee is a ``celebrity'' journalist and he's neurotically
intent on ruining his own life. He searches continually for the
perfect experience and chance to find fame.
</P>
<P>
   He sleeps around with troubled and vacuous models and actresses
(Melanie Griffith, Charlize Theron, Gretchen Mol, Winona Ryder and,
weirdly, Leonardo DiCaprio, among them). He humiliates one very
decent woman (Famke Janssen) who tries to love and help him. He
abuses and uses everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, he's unable to write his ``great novel'' and he
can't stay faithful to anyone. He's a lost soul who won't grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Robin tries religious retreats and consults over plastic
surgery, thinking she'll find self acceptance. One day she meets a
TV producer, Tony Gardella (Joe Mantegna), who pursues her and
invites her to quit teaching and come onboard as an assistant with
his TV show. She obliges and finally overcomes her lifelong belief
that hadn't the right to be happy or in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity'' takes place over the course of a year. And while
Allen has lots to say about the burden of fame and how everyone
pursues it _ even the most untalented _ he's picked an annoying
vessel to bear his message. Branagh does a ``Woody Allen''
impersonation through most of the film and, by the end, he's a
tiresome irritant.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness Davis is on hand to liven things up. Initially,
it's a little tough to watch her playing the same shrill shrew that
Woody always casts her as. But she's the one character who makes a
true journey toward self-knowledge. By the end, she lights up the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Allen has endured his own share of scandal and public
scrutiny. And while ``Celebrity'' is hit-and-miss as a movie and is
partly an acid bath purging of his own personal pain under the
public eye, he's also made some astute observances about our
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the end, as in his last film, ``Deconstructing
Harry,'' the character he's the roughest on and least sympathetic
to is the one who most resembles, well, Woody Allen himself.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity. Directed and written by Woody Allen. Cast: Kenneth
Branagh, Judy Davis, Winona Ryder, Melanie Griffith, Joe Mantegna,
Charlize Theron, Famke Janssen, Lenonardo DiCaprio, Gretchen Mol.

FRENCH DIRECTOR KEEPS RECORD IN TACT WITH `SEVENTH HEAVEN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Benoit Jacquot is one of France's best kept secrets. He's made
10 films and worked with Marguerite Duras and Jacques Rivette
during the course of his career, but we've seen precious few of his
movies in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Single Girl'' graced screens last year and its hypnotic,
shot in real-time look at a day in the life of a young woman who is
unhappily pregnant was a rare find.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Jacquot's reputation is beginning to build. He has a
special gift for writing complex roles for women and is a keen
observer of modern urban life. ``Seventh Heaven,'' which was made
in 1997, is no exception on either count.
</P>
<P>
   Starring real-life couple Sandrine Kiberlain and Vincent Lindon,
the film explores the mystery, mystique _ and power _ of women and
the effect sudden change has upon a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Mathilde (Kiberlain) should he happy. Her husband, Nico
(Lindon), is a successful orthopedic surgeon and the pair live in
elegant simplicity in Paris with their precocious son. But Mathilde
has taken to stealing toys from shops, after which she swoons into
a dead faint.
</P>
<P>
   Nico prescribes western medicine but either it has no effect or
Mathilde absent-mindedly forgets to take it.
</P>
<P>
   One evening at a party, Mathilde spots a man staring intently at
her. His gaze signals a connection. ``I know all about you,'' he
implores and the next day, after another of her forays into
kleptomania, the man is again there. He takes her to lunch and
intensely grills her about the layout of her apartment, her
father's death 15 years ago, and whether she's ever had an orgasm
with her husband (she hasn't). He explains that he's a doctor of
hypnotism and feng shui, the eastern art of harmony with nature
through the balance of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Under his care, Mathilde begins to come out of her malaise. She
rearranges the flat and returns to work, making Nico suspicious.
Suddenly he seems less able to control his wife's doings and the
balance in the marriage is thrown off. Nico begins to fray while
Mathilde strengthens and revives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventh Heaven'' is a finely crafted and tuned work that
demands a detective's awareness to grasp its intricacies.
Kiberlain's face initially seems impassive but it's a study in pain
and confusion until she quietly becomes a radiant force. It's a
performance that is full of nuance, sly knowing and deft humor.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Jacquot films are like Flaubert novels. They're full
of subtlety and strong women characters _ and they engage the
imagination. His casting of Lindon and Kiberlain is ingenious
because the pair are so familiar with each other that their every
move feels like everyday life. The ordinary becomes extraordinary
and that's high praise considering the current state of movies,
where every plot development is predictable within the first 15
minutes of the opening credits.
</P>

   Seventh Heaven. Directed by Benoit Jacquot. Written by Jacquot,
Jerome Beaujour. Cast: Sandrine Kiberlain, Vincent Lindon.

`CUBE' IS HAMMY, TERRIBLY WRITTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was just a matter of time before someone had the idea of
making a movie based on Jean Paul Sartre's existential one-act
play, ``No Exit,'' the computer game ``Doom,'' and a Rubik cube.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's surprising that no one thought it up before. But
that could be because, at least with ``Cube,'' it's an idea that
has a very limited appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Six people, ordinary citizens who have regular jobs, wake to
find themselves in a prison. Upon further inspection, they learn
it's a maze of square rooms, each identical except in color and
lethal impact. Some rooms are killers, some are clean. And the six
must figure out why they have been placed within such a maze, and
more importantly, how to get out?
</P>
<P>
   A cop, a thief, a student of math, a doctor and an architect _
even an autistic youth _ are the players. Some will make it, some
won't. And death isn't pretty. It may be slice-and-dice by
invisible wires or acid blown in the face, eating out both brains
and eyes. Confinement will cause insanity, fury, fear and truth
among these embattled, exhausted contestants.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what the filmmakers would like you to believe.
``Cube'' is full of hammy acting, terrible writing and a
conveniently violent theme that might work for a 10-year-old boy
and his Nintendo or Playstation, but will infuriate and alienate
any viewer with a modicum of adult sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cube'' plays like a bad ``Twilight Zone'' episode and there
isn't a moment of redemption or real payoff. The filmmakers stretch
the story into an hour and a half of relentless sadism and futility
and the ending doesn't compensate for the agony that has come
before.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, there's no humanity at the core of this ugly lesson in
inhumanity. So what's the point? Sure, the essential components of
a compelling story are there, but as in the recent, equally distant
movie, ``Pi,'' cinema, in the hands of the ``new'' young filmmaking
generation, struggles to have a heart. It's just plain crueler and
colder and offers no escape from the negativism or stress of
everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Cube. Directed by Derek Rogers. Written by Andre Bijelic,
Vincenzo Natali, Graeme Manson. Cast: Nicole de Boer, Nicky
Guadagni, David Hewlett, Andrew Miller, Maurice Dean Wint. Trimark.

`ENEMY OF THE STATE' DOESN'T QUITE MEASURE UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first hour of ``Enemy of the State'' rates right up there
with the best of the ``paranoia'' thriller genre, including ``The
Parallax View,'' ``Three Days of the Condor,'' ``The Firm'' and the
recent ``Conspiracy Theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly all the components are in place: a single soul is
pitted against something (or someone) far greater and vast in
resources and malicious intent; he has no idea why or how he was
singled out, and he's ultimately aided by a mysterious stranger
whose shadowy presence is his only hope for solving the riddle _
and saving his life.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Will Smith plays Robert Clayton Dean, a young
hotshot lawyer who lives with his wife (Regina King from ``Jerry
Maguire'') and son in Washington, D.C. Dean is working on a
high-profile case involving the mob when he suddenly and
unintentionally becomes embroiled in an intrigue that endangers his
family, friends and everyone around him.
</P>
<P>
   While Christmas shopping, Dean collides with a college buddy who
is being chased. In desperation, the old pal discreetly slides a
computer disk that shows the murder of a congressman into the
lawyer's shopping bag. Two minutes later, the friend is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Dean is stunned by what's happened but thinks no more about it
until his house is ransacked and his credit cards and bank account
are no longer accessible. Soon he's framed for another murder and
he's pursued by people who can predict his every move and thought:
the National Security Agency (or as they're nicknamed, No Such
Agency).
</P>
<P>
   Only one man can help him now; a man he's never met named Brill
(Gene Hackman), who is an ex-intelligence operative living an
anonymous, underground existence. But Brill is fully clued into the
activities of the renegade group intent upon making Dean a
scapegoat for a political crime they've committed, and the fact
that as soon as they have the implicating disk, they'll kill Dean
as easily as one might swat a fly.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, early in its second hour, ``Enemy of the State''
turns to drivel. An intelligent, complicated setup twists into an
incredulous buddy movie and slow motion faceoff that's straight out
of director Tony Scott's violent 1992 cult movie, ``True Romance.''
The script erodes from a tense, taut cautionary tale about
intrusive high-tech surveillance of our private lives into
formulaic plotting that falls apart under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a shame, because Will Smith makes a terrific everyman
caught in a web of deceit, corruption and ambition. Hackman doesn't
have a lot to do but, as always, he even does nothing well, and Jon
Voight seems to be making a lucrative second career out of playing
villains.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Scott has cast many ``new breed'' actors, including
Tom Sizemore and Barry Pepper from ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Jason
Lee, Jamie Kennedy, Scott Caan and Jake Busey in supporting roles.
</P>
<P>
   As with any of the director's films, the visuals and style are
cool and inventive and he conjures a creepy world where information
is power and human beings can change from flesh and blood into
electronic identities that are easy to manipulate _ or eradicate.
It's a scary concept that makes for great movie material. It's too
bad the script turns into tepid, unbelievable mush.
</P>
<P>
   Enemy of the State. Directed by Tony Scott. Written by David
Marconi. Cast: Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Lisa Bonet,
Regina King. Touchstone Pictures. 130 minutes. Rated R for
violence, language, sexual content.

OUSTING THE KING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now, even the most arrogant executive at Microsoft Corp.
realizes the Redmond, Wash., firm is in serious legal trouble. But
that's only the half of it.
</P>
<P>
   At first it was easy to scoff at the ongoing federal antitrust
suit. It began as an absurd attempt to stop Microsoft from mixing
Web browsing software into the Windows 95 operating system.
Luckily, a federal appeals court gutted the government's case by
declaring that the company can add whatever it wants to Windows, if
it benefits consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A chastened Justice Department broadened its inquiry, and while
it has yet to find a bloody glove, the feds have made an impressive
circumstantial case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the bitter Microsoft rivals on the witness stand are
releasing years of pent-up fury. But that doesn't mean they're
lying about Microsoft demands that they kill off promising products
or divvy up markets. Besides, their claims are often supported by
internal Microsoft documents that read like the collected works of
Vito Corleone.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's chief executive Bill Gates's Clintonian testimony,
so evasive that it provoked laughter. Get it straight, Bill. You're
master of the universe, not president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the case remains a he-said, she-said affair, with no
proof that Microsoft deserves anything more than a wrist slap.
</P>
<P>
   But on the left coast, Microsoft just got slapped upside the
head. A federal judge in California has ruled that Microsoft
attempted to strangle a promising new technology in its cradle.
</P>
<P>
   Java, you'll recall, is a software technology invented by Sun
Microsystems Inc. that allows many different kinds of computers _
Unix machines, Windows machines, Macintoshes _ to run the same
programs. Java hasn't yet lived up to Sun's press releases. For
instance, it tends to run very slowly.
</P>
<P>
   But major firms like IBM Corp. are spending millions to make
Java work better. If it all comes together, Microsoft's control of
the operating system market becomes irrelevant, and Bill Gates goes
from king of the world to just another rich guy with a big house. I
could live with that, but not Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives got busy looking for honest ways to compete
with Java. They failed utterly. So they tried the next best thing _
sabotage. In late 1995, Microsoft agreed to license Java from Sun
Microsystems, and include the software in Microsoft products like
its Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft also began making ``improvements'' in Java, which
would ensure that the software would work better _ or at least
differently _ when it was run on Windows machines. The idea was to
fragment the Java market by creating two different versions _
Microsoft's and Sun's. And since most people use Microsoft-based
computers, guess who would win that fight?
</P>
<P>
   But Sun sued Microsoft, saying the company had no right to alter
Java. Tuesday's court ruling, though not final, suggests that Sun
will probably win its case in the end. To prevent Microsoft from
destroying Java in the meantime, the judge has ordered Microsoft to
comply with Sun's Java standard.
</P>
<P>
   This surely hurts Microsoft's prestige, and also gives the
federal prosecutors a few extra rounds of ammo. But the Java case
also underscores a deeper woe.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind its press agentry: Microsoft has never been an
innovative company. Instead, Microsoft has excelled at skillfully
polishing and repackaging the best ideas of others. There's nothing
wrong with that when you're a tiny upstart going up against giants.
But when you dominate the industry, people expect more of you. And
Microsoft isn't delivering. Instead, it serves up overpriced
enhancements of its old products.
</P>
<P>
   Then consider the Java case, or the recently leaked memos in
which Microsoft mulls plans to sabotage the upstart Linux operating
system. Combined with the antitrust case, they paint a picture of a
company eternally on the defensive, more interested in destroying
competitors than in creating excellent products.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a picture of a firm that has no choice but to change.
Never mind how powerful Microsoft is. General Motors was far
stronger when Toyota came knocking. GM learned the hard way that
all the cash ever printed can't forever suppress rivals with better
products.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Microsoft wins all of its legal battles, the firm still
faces a hard choice. Either it learns to embrace innovation rather
than subvert it, or Redmond, Wash., will become the software
industry's version of Flint, Mich.

MEDIOCIRTY TAKING TOLL ON SILENT MAJORIY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If you were at Husky Stadium last Saturday, you were
an earwitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead as I've ever heard,'' said Bob Rondeau, KOMO radio's
longtime Husky play-by-play broadcaster. ``Some of it had to do
with the flow of the game, but there wasn't much noise from the
crowd at any time for a game against a second-ranked team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor have crowds been different in the Kingdome, despite three
straight Seahawk sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sense it's nearly as loud as it used to be,'' said
Steve Raible, KIRO radio's veteran color man and former Seahawk.
``You talk to former players who tell stories about it being so
loud that they couldn't hear themselves think. It was almost
painful at times on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that way anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of disappointing 5-5 teams is the easy explanation for
the deadness that prevails in the local football citadels. But is
that the full explanation?
</P>
<P>
   And is that enough of an explanation in a town that was regarded
as arguably the nation's best college/pro football town?
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers here have little idea how passionate fans once were
about football.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Seahawks retire the No. 12 jersey as a salute
to their 12th-man homefield advantage, the NFL adopted anti-noise
rules as a direct response to the Kingdome's audio muggings.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies always had a massive, loyal fan base that not only
failed to dissipate with arrival of the NFL in the 1970s, it
actually grew. A second deck was added to Husky Stadium's north
side and was filled easily as the team went to three straight Rose
Bowls in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Even in lean years, fans here cranked it up so steadily that the
stadiums were always listed at the top of the toughest-to-play
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   But now ... deadness. Even with full houses.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, this year's teams are mediocre. But they're not 2-8
either. Neither are they bereft of talented or exciting players.
</P>
<P>
   Something's happening here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans are a little different now,'' Raible said. ``I don't know
if there's excitement in the city about anything. We all are jaded
to a certain extent. We've had high expectations, as we should, but
I think we've been a little spoiled. We have every right to hope
for and demand a winner, but a couple of games for each team could
have gone the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the players ever responded like the fans do, they'd be in
real trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet a lack of realism is a standard feature of a fan's life.
That's part of the appeal _ even if things are turning to mud at
home or work, there's always the team to carry on one's
unachievable expectations.
</P>
<P>
   While slumps and losing seasons are an understood part of sports
cycles, what seems to have changed in recent times is fan
tolerance. When the primary talk of sports is salary caps,
free-agent contracts, NCAA violations and municipal extortions for
taxpayer-subsidized stadiums, a grimness and contempt sets in that
is corrosive.
</P>
<P>
   Sports become a chore, not a joy. And the emphasis on money
makes sports . . . well, like most of the rest of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was playing and making $25,000 a year, people could
relate to a football player,'' Raible said. ``Now, with these
salaries, they really can't. People figure that with
multimillion-dollar players, they must be the best ever. So when
Warren Moon doesn't complete every pass, or Darrin Smith doesn't
get a sack every time, or Ken Griffey Jr. doesn't hit a home run,
people are disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how many times players do charity work and community
events, a lot of fans just can't identify.''
</P>
<P>
   I have always dismissed the doomsday sports talk that emerges
after news of a new contract benchmark, or strike, or enormous TV
rights fee, ticket price hike or taxpayer ripoff. Evidence is
strong that fans always come back, no matter the fraud, indignity
or disgrace perpetrated upon them. The owners and bosses of sports
know that, and continue to abuse with impunity (see NBA).
</P>
<P>
   I am not ready to change that opinion. I am, however, becoming
increasingly less convinced.
</P>
<P>
   What's apparent is that if mediocrity is sustained _ the Huskies
have won one bowl game, a minor one, in five years and the Seahawks
have been out of the playoffs for 10 years _ the growing absence of
fan tolerance can make for a permanent case of disaffection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans will say, `I was there for so many years and they broke
my heart too many times,''' Raible said. ``Fans invest so much and
then get disappointed so often. They want to jump up and cheer so
badly, but they've had to sit right back down after the next
mistake. They're afraid to get excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Raible drew upon his Southern upbringing for the trenchant
adage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can beat a dog only so many times,'' he said, ``before it
doesn't come home to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Apathy in one sport in one town is not necessarily indicative of
a national trend. A couple more wins, and maybe the nation's best
football town revives.
</P>
<P>
   But the teams, and by association all sports leagues and
university jock factories, might want to think hard whether one or
two wins will do it as usual.
</P>
<P>
   For some dogs, the woods are looking better.

GILL'S CHOICE HAS PAID OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Northeastern football coach Barry Gallup remembers well
the skinny quarterback out of the small Massachusetts high school.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup got the word that the kid at Nashoba Regional was
something special on the football field. It was Veterans Day and
his Huskies practiced in the morning, and that afternoon, Gallup
took the whole staff out to Bolton to check out the kid.
</P>
<P>
   They fell in love with the tall talent with the strong arm who
was at the helm of the run-and-shoot offense, the same system the
Huskies employed. That night, Gallup called and offered a full
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   It was a short courtship.
</P>
<P>
   Within a couple of weeks, Hal Gill had made up his mind. He
chose hockey over football and was headed to Providence College.
Not a bad choice.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Gill, after four years at Providence, was the surprise
of Bruins camp and spent almost the entire year with the big team.
This year Gill is back in business on the blue line, again paired
with Ray Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   One of the tallest players in the National Hockey League at 6
feet 7 inches, the 240-pound Gill had a couple of goals and four
assists last year. He has a goal and two assists this year going
into Thursday's game against the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Any offense is just a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays defense; that's his main thing,'' said coach Pat
Burns. ``It's tough to find good defensemen who want to play
defense. Now they all want to go score goals and get points and
make all these millions and millions of dollars. They don't
understand that not everyone can be a Ray Bourque and not everyone
can be a Brian Leetch. Some guys have to play defense and play
within their limits, and he plays within his limits. He'll never be
a rushing defenseman. He doesn't have those skills. But he has a
great skill for playing defense, and that's a big asset that could
make him play a long, long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, Gill enjoys defense. Not that he dislikes
scoring a goal now and then, mind you. And not that he wouldn't
mind developing the offensive part of his game. But defense is his
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge for me,'' Gill said after practice Wednesday.
``I like being the eliminator, I guess. Eliminating the offense and
going out there and taking away guys' space and getting them
frustrated and taking them in the corner and pinning them. That's
my role and that's the way I like to play.''
</P>
<P>
   He's drawn praise from Burns in recent weeks for his work down
low with Bourque killing penalties. And he drew raves for the job
he did in helping shut down Jaromir Jagr in a 0-0 tie at Pittsburgh
two weekends ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, it goes unnoticed, what a defensive defenseman
does,'' Gill said. ``It's nice when you get recognized and people
say, `Nice job playing against Jagr.' It's exciting when people
notice what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   At quarterback, they're noticing all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a quarterback and everything clicks, you're on top
of the world,'' Gill said. ``When you roll out and throw a 10-yard
pass and then another 10-yard pass and everything kind of pops like
that, you're on top of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a dilemma. Football or hockey? Hockey or football?
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have been an outstanding college quarterback,''
Gallup said. ``Who knows after that? He was one of those sleepers
who was falling through the cracks. We thought we had a steal, a
great one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill was torn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one of those pro-con lists going,'' he said. ``I did it
up one night and decided on hockey. I wanted to play the best level
I could and I thought my chances were better at hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   On to Hockey East. The Bruins. And Jagr. Taking on the Jagrs of
the NHL is his answer to a two-minute drill in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you shut someone down and at the end of the game, you can
look back on it and every play you see is successful and everything
you do is right and you feel like you can't make a mistake, you're
in the zone,'' Gill said. ``That's why you play. That's the best
feeling you can have.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Burns said forward Ken Belanger, acquired from the New York
Islanders in the trade for Ted Donato, was to make his debut for
the Bruins Thursday night. Belanger missed the Bruins' two games
last weekend after taking a puck to the face in practice. A nasty
cut to the nose required 18 stitches. Belanger was due to get the
stitches removed Wednesday and planned to play with no shield or
extra protecton. He was on a line with Ken Baumgartner and Peter
Ferraro in practice ... Burns said Tim Taylor (ankle) is not ready
to return.

`JAY' OF THE CIA MAY TAKE STAND IN TWISTY TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE MILETICH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ During the time when Morris Messinger Jr. is accused
of bilking hundreds of people out of millions of dollars, he also
was doing business with a surprising customer: the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Messinger, who has a record of fraudulent dealings dating to the
late 1980s, went on trial in federal court in Seattle this week,
charged with cheating 1,300 investors out of $3.2 million with
wildly exaggerated promises to build exotic aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The case also has produced the startling disclosure that
Messinger struck a deal with the Central Intelligence Agency to pay
him $190,000 to design a pilotless aerial vehicle that crashed into
an airport hangar when a prototype was tested.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Messinger, 53, of Issaquah, Wash.is using his contract
with the spy agency as part of his defense. He maintains the CIA's
willingness to deal with him shows he was a legitimate businessman
trying to develop viable aerospace products.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, federal prosecutors have tentatively listed an
undercover CIA operative as a witness in the case, although
original plans to allow the agent to shield his face were set aside
in favor of having him testify under the simple pseudonym of
``Jay.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Westinghouse, who is prosecuting
the case, hasn't decided whether to call the agent to the stand.
But if he does, the agent will be summoned sometime next week,
Westinghouse said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's contract with Messinger is described in court
documents as an agreement to design but not actually build an
``Unmanned Aerial Vehicle'' capable of delivering a payload to a
specified location. Such craft are commonly referred to as UAV's or
drones.
</P>
<P>
   The records say the ``nature of the payload and the means by
which the UAV would be transported to the target area'' are
classified.
</P>
<P>
   The contract was signed Sept. 3, 1997, but came to an abrupt
halt eight days later when federal agents raided Messinger's
offices in Snohomish County and the CIA learned of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that the CIA was aware of the criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Messinger's attorney, James Vonasch, said Wednesday that his
client had completed the first stage of a three-part arrangement
with the CIA when the contract was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   But Vonasch said he couldn't comment further about the deal,
which isn't included in the multicount mail fraud and money
laundering indictment brought against Messinger in March.
</P>
<P>
   Although the $190,000 figure represents a fraction of the CIA's
budget, the transaction raises questions about what steps the
agency takes to examine the background and qualifications of its
prospective contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Harlow, a spokesman at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va.,
declined to answer any questions about the matter Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But records show the CIA wouldn't have had to look hard to find
out about Messinger's past troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Messinger first ran afoul of regulators in 1989, when Oregon
officials ordered him to stop selling unregistered securities in a
now-dormant corporation that supposedly was going to produce drone
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   A court judgment filed in Marion County, Ore., Feb. 5, 1991,
permanently enjoined Messinger from offering and selling securities
in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   It also ordered him to pay more than $50,000 to his investors,
but none of them received a dime, according to court documents
filed in the Seattle case.
</P>
<P>
   After a hiatus of two or three years in the electronics and
radio fields, prosecutors say, Messinger hatched what they describe
as an ``even bolder scheme to obtain money from investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Without filing registration papers, Messinger began selling
stocks in Washington in 1994, in a company called Omega Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   Listing himself as chairman of the company, Messinger registered
the company in Nevada but set up offices in Arlington, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Messinger, a former Navy pilot described by witnesses as a
charming and smooth-talking salesman, induced investors with
``wildly false claims'' about various purported products and
potential monetary returns, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   His plans included development of a pilotless aircraft, a jet
fighter and amphibious aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   In an initial stock offering, Messinger promised that the value
of the shares would grow from 10 cents to as much as $18.
</P>
<P>
   Most investors learned of the company through friends and
relatives and a church Messinger and his wife attended.
</P>
<P>
   Messinger made ``outlandish claims'' about his ability to
manufacture and sell amphibious aircraft and unmanned aerial
vehicles, including one named the Paradactyl, even though he lacked
the manpower, means and skills to carry out his plans, prosecutors
say.
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled investors sometimes got their money back, but only
at the expense of later investors, whose payments were quickly used
to pay about $500,000 to those seeking refunds, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those lucky enough to receive refunds, the lesson learned
from their victimization was much less painful than for the
remaining 1,100 investors who lost all they entrusted to
Messinger,'' prosecutors say in a brief outlining their case.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the brief says, investors lost all or significant
portions of their retirement savings, college tuition money for
their children and funds to cover necessary expenses.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, securities regulators in Washington served a
cease-and-desist order on Messinger in May 1996, but he kept on
selling stock, telling his employees there would only be a slap on
the wrist if he got caught, according to charging papers.
</P>
<P>
   His trial began Monday, with U.S. District Judge Barbara Jacobs
Rothstein presiding.
</P>
<P>
   Messinger, currently free on bond, faces more than five years in
prison if convicted, subject to complex federal sentencing
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Wednesday, former Omega Marketing Director Jennifer
Fullwiler tearfully told jurors that she grew increasingly
uncomfortable with having to make excuses when people asked for
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   But right up to the moment she quit, she said, she took money
from two little old ladies ``because they were so excited'' about
investing in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Fullwiler also recalled a visit to Messinger's former home in
Edmonds, which she described as large, lavish and full of expensive
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that Messinger and his wife, Holly, used
more than $730,000, or one-quarter of the invested funds, for their
personal benefit between October 1994 and March of this year.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his sales pitch, prosecutors say, Messinger told
investors he planned to demonstrate the aircraft Paradactyl to a
host of government agencies, including the Army, Navy, Marines and
the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Those claims were misrepresentations, but Messinger did engage
in direct dealings with the CIA over a drone design, prosecutors
say.
</P>
<P>
   But court records shed no light on how Messinger came to the
attention of the spy agency.
</P>
<P>
   Westinghouse, the lead prosecutor, said the CIA operative who
might be called to testify was shown a video of the proposed drone
in flight.
</P>
<P>
   A witness in the case, Steve Fawcett, who built models for
Messinger, said the video shows a parachute-like device taking off
and briefly flying.
</P>
<P>
   The flight continued beyond what is on the video, he said, with
the drone sputtering and crashing into the roof of a hangar at the
Arlington airport.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials came running to the scene, taking down names,
Fawcett said.
</P>
<P>
   Westinghouse said Messinger's device simply didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   More information about his dealings with the CIA might be
learned when and if the undercover operative who dealt with him
takes the stand.
</P>
<P>
   Or the full story might remain forever buried in CIA files.

HERE'S HOW TRENDS ARE SHAPING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something old, something new.
</P>
<P>
   For my money, ski season has not yet started, and will not until
snow is respectably deep on piste and in the woods. Yet, by many
standards _ ski show, first tracks lain down on Killington, the
blizzard of faxed press releases from North country balyhooing the
new season _ it is here and under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it a better idea to market the later season, when
there's plenty of leftover snow but no skiers, rather than the
pre-Thanksgiving skiing in the boneyards?'' asks the faint voice of
reason.
</P>
<P>
   But when was such a sport as this any more reasonable than love
or youth itself?
</P>
<P>
   So as planet ski rotates into the season of 1998-99, here are
some of the trends, megatrends, minitrends, and negatrends of the
new season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _We are not by a long shot finished hearing about shaped skis.
The debate is over, of course, about whether parabolics
(interesting that this term has faded) are superior to classic
straight shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Shapes were not really a new concept back in the winter of '96,
but talk about an idea whose time suddenly came in a big hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Now the argument moves to whether shaped skis can be modified
for mogul bashing and straight speed skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the fact remains that for many skiers, much about shaped
skies is counterintuitive, making them feel for the first few runs
that their shoes are on the wrong feet.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're buying someone shaped skis for Christmas, be sure
to spend $50 for a shaped ski clinic and an hour's work with an
instructor who can spare new shapesters some of the entry
awkwardness.
</P>
<P>
   All this aside, the real question of shaped skis is whether the
quest for ultimate no-brainer, no-skill skiing is really good for
the sport. Does instant mastery via technology really feel that
good next to the reward for good lessons and long practice?
</P>
<P>
   Would a golfer feel good about dropping his handicap 10 strokes
because of a new club that magically directed the ball on an exact
trajectory to the green regardless of his swing?
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. I'll still take my shapes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _There is an argument or two to be made against helmets, but
after last season few are listening.
</P>
<P>
   With the much-publicized deaths of Michael Kennedy and Sonny
Bono, regardless of all the circumstances surrounding their skiing
accidents and regardless of the overall safety statistics, the
momentum toward helments is now relentless.
</P>
<P>
   But that means the competition to perfect headgear has heated
up, and helmets will only advance through refinement into lighter
weights, greater comfort, and warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Helmets seem an especially good idea for children, though
parents should choose and fit them without professional help.
</P>
<P>
   And the antihelmet argument? Well, when did skiing become some
rocketship ride or Derelict Derby stockcar crash race?
</P>
<P>
   Downhill racers have always worn crash helmets because they push
the very limits of survivability. If they did not do this, law
school would be a better option than ski racing.
</P>
<P>
   But recreational skiing is a far different matter. The sport is
not about pushing those mortal limits, any more than a drive in the
country is the same as racing 160 m.p.h. in the Goober 500.
</P>
<P>
   But ... oh, never mind. Helmets are coming. Let's just please
not have a law mandating them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _At one time the trek west for a year or two of ski bumming in
the Rockies was a rite of passage. OK, John Denver was de rigeur
then, and ``Rocky Mountain High'' was a siren song with many a
message.
</P>
<P>
   Aspen, Steamboat, Vail, Park City _ so new and exciting in those
days. But the simple-hearted life of ski bumming is long past now,
not the least of the reason being that resort town life is so
outrageously unaffordable that the option of taking a year or two
after college to work the ski patrol, or the lifts at a Western
resort, has become nearly out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   With rents pushing well over $500 a month for a single room,
kids in resort towns have to work so hard for sustenance that they
don't have the money, time, or energy to hit the slopes _ the very
reason they're out there.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: Given the current employment situation, even the lofty
Aspens and Vails must consider ... no, not busing kids to outback
shacks at the end of the day, but building ski dorms, as was done
in the East from North Conway to Sugarloaf a few decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _More than ever, the generations are moving in opposite
directions. Boomers are aging, enjoying the smooth cruising more
these days. Those football knees are finally kicking up _ not to
mention the bursitis in the shoulder. Bumps are over. Trees? Thanks
but no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the trend toward vast glades, tree skiing, outback
bushwhacking, and bashing the zipper line though the moguls, the
largest block of skiers, the baby boomers, likes it fast, smooth,
and stylish.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely, generations going in two directions. The better ski
areas seem to be keeping up with both.
</P>

EXPORTS ARE GOOD. IMPORTS ARE BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore used the economic summit in Malaysia to
focus attention on the host country's lack of democracy and poor
human-rights record. Good for Gore for doing it, even if it did put
the nose of Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's authoritarian prime
minister, out of joint. Gore articulated an important principle:
``Democracy confers a stamp of legitimacy that reforms must have in
order to be effective.'' Pro-democracy activists everywhere will be
heartened by his words.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad he wasn't equally principled when it came to the
summit's primary focus _ trade. Gore and the US should have
vigorously promoted free trade across borders as the best way to
expand worldwide prosperity, employment, and consumer choice.
Instead they mumbled the tired old refrain of protectionism,
tariffs, and import quotas.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal summarized the Clinton administration's
message to the Asia forum: ``Boost your ailing economies through
trade liberalization, but don't export so much that it hurts US
companies and their workers.'' In other words, invest, produce, and
sell _ but don't be too successful, because US firms don't want
foreign competition. Of course US firms would gladly be rid of
domestic competition, too. Would the president tell an American
entrepreneur _ the head of a new computer company, say _ not to
attract too many customers lest Compaq and IBM suffer? Of course
not. By what right, then, does he say it to entrepreneurs who are
Korean or Filipino?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we expect the American people to support expanded trade,''
the president declared last week, ``free trade must also be fair
trade.'' That is a familiar soundbite _ Pat Buchanan says the same
thing _ but it is self-contradicting. What Clinton and Buchanan
mean by ``fair trade'' is rules that limit imports from abroad,
impose tariffs to drive up their price, or block foreign
competition altogether. That is neither free nor fair.
</P>
<P>
   The great protectionist myth is that exports are good and
imports are bad, that the more we sell to other countries, the
better off we are, while the more they sell to us, the more we need
to worry, and that if imports are bad, cheap imports are terrible.
Here, for example, is Commerce Secretary William Daley, berating
European business leaders: ``We alone cannot absorb all of Asia's
imports. We will not be the dumping ground for troubled economies.
... This is a major source of instability. And such instability _
caused by boatloads of cheap imports _ can lead to political
unrest.''
</P>
<P>
   And here is how The New York Times, reporting on the same
meeting, led its Page 1 story on Nov. 11:
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton said for the first time today that the
United States would not tolerate the `flooding of our markets' with
low-cost goods from Asia and Russia, particularly steel, that are
threatening the jobs of American workers.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia'' is not ``dumping'' anything on us. Asian vendors are
selling their products to willing American customers. Neither
seller nor buyer is acting against his will; both believe
themselves better off for the transaction. This isn't aggression,
it's commerce. What Daley derides as ``boatloads of cheap
imports,'' American consumers welcome as bargains. That low-cost
steel ``flooding'' the US may cost some jobs in the domestic steel
industry, but it will create more new jobs in the scores of
industries _ from construction to cars to cookware _ that use
steel.
</P>
<P>
   Imports, not exports, are the reason we trade across borders in
the first place. Imports are what any nation wants; the only reason
we export is to get money to pay for those imports. At the same
time, the more others sell to us, the more they are then able to
buy from us.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and journalists speak of trade as if it is a
struggle that countries either win or lose. For the past
half-century, the planted axiom of trade negotiations has been that
nations should relax their import barriers only in exchange for
``reciprocity'' from other nations. Hey, trading partner, we'll
open up our market a little if you open up yours. Conversely, we'll
retaliate with an array of trade penalties if you do something that
our protectionist lobby _ i.e., exporters _ deem unfair. (Such as
offering us a great price on steel.)
</P>
<P>
   It is time to start thinking of trade not as a battle but as a
human right. People should be as free to choose where to buy the
products they desire as they are to choose the faith they profess.
We do not forbid our citizens to become Muslims just because Muslim
countries may forbid their citizens to become Christians. Neither
should we prevent Americans from importing Japanese goods on the
grounds that the Japanese do not import enough from America.
</P>
<P>
   If tomorrow Congress repealed every trade barrier on our books _
every quota, every tariff, every ``antidumping'' regulation _ we
would experience a surge of new business, new products, and new
wealth. American consumers would have access to better products, at
lower prices, than ever. Productivity would zoom upward as
competition pushed producers to meet the world's highest standards.
The example set by the United States would resonate around the
globe. As other nations observed America's new prosperity, they
would look for ways to open their markets.
</P>
<P>
   Exports are good, imports are better, and unilateral repeal of
trade barriers would be best of all. A pity they didn't hear that
from the US delegates in Malaysia.

BIG TOBACCO'S CHUMP CHANGE

 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Attorney General Scott Harshbarger takes the quick tobacco
money, Massachusetts will become just another spent butt, ground
into shards under the heel of Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem an exaggeration on the surface. Under the terms of
the settlement, Massachusetts would collect $7.6 billion over 25
years, or $1,245 per person. Massachusetts would collect nearly the
same money per capita as the two biggest winners in out-of-court
settlements against Big Tobacco, Minnesota ($6.1 billion, $1,326
per person) and Mississippi ($3.4 billion, $1,259).
</P>

   That sounds like big money, but under the microscope of public
health, it is chump change. The offer to the states of $206 billion
over 25 years is a crude bribe, made all the more incredible by the
fact that so many state attorneys general have bowed so meekly to
Big Tobacco's one-week, take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   The $206 billion amounts to only 8 percent of the $2.5 trillion
that the federal government estimates we stand to lose over the
next 25 years to cigarettes in health care costs and lost work
productivity. In Massachusetts, we may get $7.6 billion from
cigarette makers over 25 years, but cigarettes, based on our
population, will have cost us $58.75 billion in that same time
span, 7.7 times more in health care and lost productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Big Tobacco, outside of some minor advertising restrictions that
it has been phasing out anyway, is essentially free to do business
as usual. Big outdoor billboards might disappear, but corner stores
will become even more plastered with eye-level window and checkout
counter advertising. Certain cartoonish icons, such as Joe Camel,
might be history, but magazines will continue to tell women
``You've come a long way, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Tobacco will also be able to continue brand-name sponsorship
at one event a year. But Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco, Brown and
Williamson, and Loews have many brand names to use to cultivate
goodwill. You will never know there was a settlement as they become
more crafty than ever to keep their name behind ``events'' that go
all around the country, such as stock car races, music festivals,
dance troupes, and art exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   They will also be able to continue to use their corporate name
to fund political groups, sports, the arts, and other cultural
events. Thus, for whatever noise public health officials raise
about the dangers of smoking, expect the voice of civic leaders
will remain as muted as today.
</P>
<P>
   If we knew that the public health message was getting through,
if we could accurately predict that the number of smokers in the
United States would decline dramatically to the point where our
health care costs would also fall, then there might be a reason to
take this money. The opposite is occurring. Despite the national
drive toward smoke-free workplaces, airplanes, and restaurants, the
percentage of young people who are smoking is on the increase.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published this week in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, smoking by college students is up 28 percent.
That mirrors findings that smoking by high school students is up 32
percent. Smoking has gone up regardless of color, gender, size of
college, or area of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings are a reminder of Big Tobacco's reach. Low-income
children are assaulted at the corner store. Civic leaders become
slaves to funding. The media still tell youth that smoking is cool.
Harvard researchers found tobacco use in over half of the top
movies. The back of yesterday's Globe Living/Arts page featured a
full-page ad for Kool, with water dropping off a mint leaf toward
the lush greenery and waterfall on the cigarette box.
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely short-sighted for the attorneys general to sign
a deal that would prevent them from suing again 20 and 30 years
from now when today's rise in smoking becomes tomorrow's increase
in cancer. It is hard to believe that Harshbarger, who has fought
the tobacco wars longer than most AGs, would give up now when
Massachusetts has one of the strongest cases pending against Big
Tobacco. Minnesota did the nation an immense favor with its suit,
forcing Big Tobacco to cough up a motherlode of lies and deceit in
court before getting its settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that Big Tobacco can put a gun to the head of the
people via the attorneys general is sickening, especially since the
state is supposed to protect the average citizen who can never hope
to fight the legal artillery of the tobacco companies. When Big
Tobacco holds the gun and when Wall Street is already signaling
that this deal will be good for tobacco stocks, that can mean only
one thing. Unless Harshbarger stands up and says no to this deal,
the mass murder of thousands of people will continue, with the
state as an official party to the slaughter.

SNAKES MAKE FAST WORK OF SLOW DRAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My tub drains very slowly _ five to 10 minutes. No other
drains in the house are slow. I've tried baking soda and vinegar,
and hot water, without success. I even took off the stopper lever
at the end of the tub and cleaned it thoroughly. I am stumped.
</P>
<P>
   SUSAN BARRETT, North Attleborough
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Slow drains are usually caused by a buildup of grease, oil,
hair, and other detritus that reduces the diameter of the drain.
The cure is to use a plumber's snake to break up the gunk so it
will flow away. The snake will also remove any other kind of
obstruction. The baking soda and vinegar might help some, but it is
a long, slow process. Better to use is straight bleach; put a cup
of it down the drain and let it sit in the trap for an hour or so,
then turn on the water to get the bleach farther down the drain. An
enzyme-based drain cleaner may be more effective than bleach.
</P>
<P>
   A plumber's snake, by the way, is a long, flexible rod of flat
wire with a hook on one end and a crank handle on the other; turn
the crank as you thread the snake down the drain so it will do
maximum good in breaking up and removing the detritus. You can put
the snake in the drain opening (remove the strainer cover first).
Or, it might be easier to remove the stopper mechanism and put the
snake in that opening.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   When a caller asked what kind of a tenant she should rent an
apartment to _ a smoker or a cat owner _ the handyman suggested the
smoker because smoke is easier to remove from a house and deodorize
than cat urine that can get into just about anything and stay there
forever. Of course, that depends on the cat owner and who's in
charge: tenant or cat.
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Elizabeth Hoffman (an ex-smoker) of Putney, Vt.: ``I'd
just like to point out that a tenant who falls asleep holding a cat
is not a fire hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   You just made the handyman's day, Elizabeth Hoffman. Thanks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My interior woodwork is very wide and very handsome, a dark
mahogany-walnut look, shellacked or varnished. There are some
scratches and paint spots. How can I cover them or otherwise
improve the woodwork's good looks?
</P>
<P>
   NEIL SCANNELL, Auburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For the paint spots, dab a little oil (any kind will do) on
each spot, wait 15 to 20 mintues, then rub with a coarse cloth or
even fine steel wool, but if you use the steel wool, go very easy
on the finish. The oil will soften the paint enough so it can be
wiped off. If the paint is latex, you can use Goof-Off, sold in
hardware stores, to remove the spots without affecting the original
finish.
</P>
<P>
   For the scratches, you can buy a sort of stain pen, loaded with
stain with a felt tip for staining the scratches. Minwax pioneered
these stain pens. Use a stain slightly darker than the finish; a
dark scratch is less obvious than a light one. This will disguise
the scratches; they cannot be removed without refinishing the
woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   If this does not work or does not appeal to you, you can instead
paint the woodwork with Polyshade, a Minwax varnish with the stain
built into it. Before you use the Polyshade, check to see if the
finish is shellac. Wipe a small section with rubbing or denatured
alcohol; if the finish softens, it is shellac and you may not be
able to use the Polyshade, because many clear finishes such as
polyurethane are not compatible with shellac.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My roof has a 12/12 pitch on one side, with a gutter 35 feet
long and at each end a downspout, one of which discharges on the
sidewalk. The city ordered me to remove that downspout. Can I
relocate it to the middle of the gutter and rework the gutter so it
drains from one end into that middle downspout? What is a good
pitch for a gutter?
</P>
<P>
   PAT PALAZZOLO, Revere, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You certainly can put a downspout in the middle, eliminating
the guilty one. And, it does not have to be in the exact center,
give or take a few feet. You really should do it anyway, because a
cardinal rule on gutters is that you need a downspout for each 30
feet of gutter. As for pitch, a standard pitch is 1/16-inch per
foot. That would pitch the gutter a little over 2 inches. But a
level gutter will drain, and you can make that pitch perhaps as
little as 1 1/2 inches. All this is necessary, I think, because
that 12/12 roof pitch is 45 degrees, very steep, and therefore will
cascade a lot of water quickly into the gutter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is urea formaldehyde insulation against the law? My son wants
to buy a house in Michigan and the owners disclosed that they think
U-F is in the house. What should he do?
</P>
<P>
   ANXIOUS CALLER
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It is not exactly against the law, but installation of U-F
is; and it is no longer installed. Houses that already have it are
not breaking the law, but some states require that it be removed
before the house is sold, even if it is not causing problems. The
reason for the controversy dates back nearly 20 years, when some
U-F was defectively installed, causing allergic reactions to people
who were sensitive to it. So, it was banned.
</P>
<P>
   Your first priority is to have the insulation checked; if it is
not U-F, there's no problem. If it is U-F, it should be removed and
safe insulation installed, but at great cost; if your son can
reduce the house price by the amount needed to remove the U-F and
put in new insulation, that might be a good idea. Short of that I
suggest he look elsewhere.

THE FED ISN'T DONE CUTTING 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fed's decision Tuesday to cut the fed funds rate by a
quarter point had been expected on Wall Street, and had that been
the Fed's only move it's unlikely that the stock market would have
responded to the decision as positively as it did.
</P>
<P>
   What investors may have seized upon was the Fed's decision to
also trim the discount rate--the rate banks charge each other for
overnight lending--by a quarter point, to 4.50 percent. That's the
second straight discount-rate cut for the Fed, and although the
rate itself is not of dramatic importance in the actual functioning
of the economy, it has real weight as a symbol of the Fed's ideas
about where the economy is going.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, what the discount rate cut suggests is that the
Fed may not be done trimming interest rates, and that it believes
the economy will slow substantially in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The cut is therefore a double-edged sword for the market, since
it suggests both that corporate profits will come under continued
pressure next year and that the Fed is on the case to keep that
pressure from becoming too great. The three successive fed-funds
cuts are pumping liquidity into the economy, and Alan Greenspan is
doing his best to avoid presiding over another recession. Trimming
the discount rate, then, was a way of signaling the Fed's resolve,
which itself should help consumer and business confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the Fed's general attitude is, as we've remarked
before, genuinely striking. For most of his career, Greenspan was
an inflation hawk, and the old-school Greenspan would hardly have
looked at an economy growing at 3.3 percent, with an unemployment
rate of 4.6 percent, and imagined that anything other than a rate
increase was in order.
</P>
<P>
   But the combination of Greenspan's conviction that productivity
is rising faster than the statistics measure, that turmoil abroad
will have a material effect on the United States, and that
investors have become unnecessarily risk-tolerant have all shifted
the Fed's bias toward easing at seemingly every opportunity. Bond
yields of close to 3 percent now seem completely within the realm
of possibility, and if interest rates do drop that low, stocks will
look more attractive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who have been looking for any reason to buy just found
another one.

EXPLAINER: WHAT'S THE NAME OF SADDAM HUSSEIN? 
</HEADLINE>
  By BRUCE GOTTLIEB 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is some confusion over whom the U.S. didn't bomb last
weekend. We spared ``Mr. Hussein'' says the New York Times;
actually, it was ``Saddam Hussein'' says the Washington Post; no,
it was just ``Saddam'' say USA Today and the Times' William Safire.
Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   The name ``Saddam Hussein'' isn't like ``Bill Clinton'' or
``Jiang Zemin,'' which are both composed of a given name and a
family name (``Bill'' and ``Zemin'' are the given names).
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein has no family name. Rather ``Hussein'' is the
name his parents gave the nascent dictator, and ``Saddam'' is an
epithet he adopted before he grabbed power, and is derived from the
Persian word meaning ``crush.'' ``Saddam Hussein'' is best
translated as Hussein-Who-Crushes-Obstacles or
Hussein-the-Destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Washington Post gets it right by
consistently using ``Saddam Hussein''. References to ``Mr.
Hussein'' or ``Saddam'' are as syntactically absurd as referring to
a certain late wrestler by ``Mr. Andre'' or ``the Giant''.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it uncommon for Near Easterners to have only a given name
and no family name. In this century, regional governments have
encouraged citizens to adopt place names as surnames--by this
system, the Iraqi dictator would be ``Hussein Tikriti'', because he
comes from an area known as Tikrit.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah. It's pronounced ``Sad-DAHM''.

THE LOST VIRTUES OF HEADGEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  By ANNE HOLLANDER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hats arouse fully as much feeling as hairstyles--or they would
if enough of them were being worn. For 30 years we have been living
in the Bareheaded Age, worrying intensely about our hair. Many of
us don't even remember the time when people would no more go
outdoors without a hat than they would without shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The exact character of your hat mattered a lot then, much as the
look of your hair does now. Your hat confirmed your outfit, putting
the final seal on whatever else you wore, crowning your image and
arming your ego for social and professional life--or just for
itself. During the summer in the country, my grandfather would put
on his hat to go down to the end of the driveway and get the
letters out of the mailbox. I would laugh at him, free of the
requirement myself; but in his youth, even kids wore hats whenever
they went outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Hair rose up and drove out hats in the 1960s--rose up, spread
out, and flowed down in merciless torrents, sweeping away
conventional hats as if they represented all that was loathsome in
civilized life. A few cute hats, most of them faintly satirical,
costumey, and historical, were worn by a few cute people for
momentary effect. But the old hat rule was swiftly abolished. Off
came the top hat at the opera and the elegant homburg or fedora for
street wear, along with the whole range of casual hats and caps for
men.
</P>
<P>
   Swept away, too, were all the charming, infinitely various
feminine hats that once made women feel charming and infinitely
various themselves. Common usage once allowed hat makers to find
markets for many heterogeneous styles, for much discreetly
suggestive fantasy in shape and trim. Absurdity was the obvious
risk then, given the vast scope of hat design for women. Danny Kaye
once sang of ``The little ones, the big ones, the sat-on-by-a-pig
ones,/ The foolish ones that perch, and the ghoulish ones that
lurch.''
</P>
<P>
   But a man might still be seduced by an irresistible feminine
brim, curving and dipping to offset a meaningful glance. The
desired effect appeared in the movies on the heads of Greta Garbo
and Marlene Dietrich and their glamorous colleagues, such as Gene
Tierney in Laura in her scene at the Algonquin with Clifton Webb.
</P>
<P>
   Along with much else, women's hats are no longer a normal part
of the mating game. Women's hats are out there, but they're all
optional, and the range has shrunk. They come in very few basic
shapes (like dresses), and nobody gets any basic training in hat
choice or hat management, since real allure is felt to reside in
hair, not in hats. Real absurdity, too, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But winter is coming. The Hair Revolution was no help in bitter
weather, and for a while everybody but Floridians and Californians
simply froze above the neck. Lately healthy, utilitarian hats have
returned in force, along with athletic footgear and down jackets,
and there's even a certain limited stylishness in recent examples.
Fur is back, too, as are delicious pile fabrics, so that luxury can
be combined with utility. Meanwhile thousands of watch caps,
ear-flap caps, and wool berets are available from street vendors to
provide instant warmth for passers-by without much regard for
expressive charm. In this day of virtual uniformity, it's curious
that whenever a woman wears any hat at all, somebody is bound to
say, ``I love your hat!''--as if out of subliminal nostalgia for
the truly great days.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says this to men about their baseball caps, the ubiquity
of which has reduced choices for men just as general hatlessness
has diminished the possibilities for women. What are old-fashioned
hat-loving men to do? Classic hats appear pretentious and
dandified. But such men could never wear--can barely
stomach--headgear with the inelegance, the laddishness, the
rakishness, the nerve of a baseball cap, especially one worn
backward.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, let us hope that the Return of the Hat is at hand,
inaugurated by men in their baseball caps, just as the strongest
and longest-lasting fashion changes always have been inspired by
men. The hat itself was a male invention and a male privilege until
women got tired of coifs, veils and wimples in the Renaissance.
Then they daringly adopted hats to profit from the erotic charge
male elements always add to feminine modes. Many women have done
this again in the last decade or so, usually sticking to masculine
sports hat shapes, baseball caps among them, or east European
rabbinical effects to combat the cold blast.
</P>
<P>
   I bought a fine example of that kind of winter hat. It surrounds
my head in a warm nimbus of fake fur, my brow, ears, and nape
encompassed by golden foxy fleece, my pate upholstered with plushy
leopard pelt, my beardless face mitigating the rabbinical flavor.
I've also acquired a neat hat that makes a black, furry sphere out
of my whole skull, leaving some wisps of my hair to curl up my
cheeks and down my forehead, Russian heroine style. More risky,
since I'm not tall, is my cavalier hat in silvery, streaked brown
and black velvet, with a biggish mobile brim for folding up and
down at will, fore and aft or amidships.
</P>
<P>
   Short, small women have to remember that they can quickly
resemble a mushroom in anything too big or a child in anything too
cute. Medium-sized or large and tall women have no such problem and
tend to look good in any kind of hat. They only have to remember to
let enough of their face show and not to let the hat flatten them
on top, so that their full-sized, shapely head and speaking eyes
will support the hat's dashing impact, and the hat itself won't
appear to jam a lid on the body's expressive means.
</P>
<P>
   Advice to all: Study the older royals for the way they manage
good proportions, especially the British Queen Mum, and don't
forget to study your own full-length hatted reflection--front,
back, and profile--before hitting the street. Absurdity forever
lurks.

GATES AND MICROSOFT DESERVE TO LOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On one level, the case of the People of the United States of
America vs. Microsoft Corp. grinds on. But on a more important
level, the case is over and the People of the United States of
America, as represented by the Department of Justice, have won.
Anyone who ever thought, as I did, that the antitrust action
against Microsoft was ill-considered must now agree it was anything
but.
</P>
<P>
   There were a number of reasons to be skeptical of Justice's
legal intervention. First, government intrusion into highly
functional markets are, generally speaking, dubious undertakings.
The head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Joel
Klein, may well be the most able lawyer in Washington, but that
hardly qualifies him to set the rules for the digital economy of
the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Second, this suit was brought by the Clinton administration,
which has raised millions of dollars from Microsoft's fiercest
detractors. There is a lingering suspicion that the case was
brought to trial as payback for those contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Third, many of the allegedly injured parties (Sun Micro-systems,
Apple Computer, Netscape, IBM, Motorola) are hugely profitable
corporations. The CEOs of these companies are among the most highly
compensated people on the planet. Shareholders in these companies
have realized extraordinary capital gains since the early 1980s,
when the Microsoft monopoly commenced. We should all be so injured.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, it is almost impossible to argue that consumers and
businesses have not benefited from the Microsoft monopoly and the
so-called Wintel (Microsoft's Windows operating systems and Intel
microprocessors) duopoly. Computers have never been cheaper.
Software is inexpensive. Access to the Internet and the World Wide
Web is astonishingly cheap. And it all works; not as well as it
might, but well enough to enable a productivity revolution that has
fueled substantial economic growth in the United States and around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth, the case against Microsoft is necessary if one thinks
that the personal computer will remain at the center of the
computing universe. There are any number of computer experts who
think the PC will soon be overtaken by ``pervasive computing.'' In
the world of pervasive computing, every appliance and electronic
device becomes, in effect, a super computer. Pervasive computing
doesn't run on Microsoft Windows. It thrives on high (and higher)
speed chips and Internet technology. All of which is in the
development pipeline and coming soon enough to a web site near you.
</P>
<P>
   What the government has done, however, is prove beyond
reasonable doubt that Microsoft's behavior has been injurious to
consumers and detrimental to the advancement of the computing
industry as a whole. As financial columnist and publisher Jim
Cramer wrote in a recent column for -TheStreet.com: ``Who stopped
the next generation of fast graphics chips, which would have bought
a challenge to TV, in its tracks. Microsoft. Who tried to keep
Intel from moving forward with the latest in chips (technology)
that can enhance the power of the PC to harness the Net?
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, through the patient and careful questioning of Justice
Department lawyer David Boies, the government has established that
over and over Microsoft used its operating system leverage to
thwart competition and stifle innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of Intel Vice President Steven McGeady was
especially telling. ``(Bill Gates) was very upset at the fact we
(Intel) were making investments in software of any sort,'' McGeady
said. ``He became quite enraged at one point'' that Intel had 600
to 700 software engineers ``who were, in his view, competing with
Microsoft. Bill made it very clear that Microsoft would not support
our next processor if we did not get alignment on the issues.'' Any
company that can dictate product development policy to Intel, the
world's most profitable corporation, is, almost by definition, too
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing the government has done is reveal Gates's
incredible arrogance and utter contempt for the American system of
justice. His videotaped deposition was a classic of Clintonian
evasion, and every bit as dishonest. He couldn't remember important
meetings. Words he himself had typed out in e-mails didn't
necessarily mean what they so obviously meant. He had no idea what
Microsoft's strategy was in the Internet browser wars (the whole
company rode on it). Gates's testimony was so preposterous and
disingenuous that at two points, Federal Judge Thomas Jackson burst
out laughing.
</P>
<P>
   This case will eventually wend its way to the Supreme Court, and
it is not clear how it will be resolved. But in the court of
informed public opinion, the case is closed. Microsoft, long the
nation's most admired corporation, has almost overnight become its
most reviled. Justice Department attorneys Boies and Joel Klein
have done their country an enormous service. They brought the truth
to light.

BROWSER: A HUNDRED YEARS OF LASSITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACOB WEISBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1963, Edmund Wilson published an ``interview'' with himself
in the second issue of the New York Review of Books. The subject
was why a new intellectual journal was needed and how it came to
be. ``The disappearance of the Times Sunday book section at the
time of the printers' strike only make us realize it had never
existed,'' Wilson explained.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what it means that this remark is quoted without
comment in the new anthology that commemorates 100 years of the New
York Times Book Review. Wilson was saying the Times book section
was relentlessly dull. Does the Times agree? The 650 page
greatest-hits collection, I'm afraid, supports the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   For all the effect it has had on the country's literature, the
Times Sunday book section might as well never have existed. Today,
35 years after Wilson's jibe, it remains the drab wallpaper of the
book world. If it vanished in another strike, it is hard to think
many people would miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the NYTBR so dreary? Michael Wolff, the media columnist
of New York magazine, wrote an article a few weeks ago complaining
that the section fails to capitalize on the new commercial
environment in which books are marketed and sold. He thinks the
NYTBR could make more money by being less independent. I kept
waiting for Wolff to say he was joking, but apparently he wasn't.
The Times deserves to be congratulated, not scolded, for its
determination to avoid pandering to the trade by reviewing
self-help manuals or boosting Oprah's book club.
</P>
<P>
   But high-mindedness only gets you so far. The real problem with
the NYTBR, for the 15 years or so that I have been reading it
without much pleasure, is its aversion to argument and controversy.
Charles (Chip) McGrath, the editor since 1995, has elevated the
tone somewhat. More distinguished authors contribute longer reviews
about weightier books. But somehow, the section still feels
dutiful. It reads as if the people writing for it and editing it
aren't having any fun and don't think readers should either.
</P>
<P>
   People who write for the NYTBR all have stories about how the
section resists strong criticism and colorful writing.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a newspaper section avoid conflict, the mother's milk
of journalism? I think the instinct stems from the paper's not
unrealistic sense of its own power and responsibility. Though the
NYTBR can't hurt Tom Clancy and probably can't help most academic
specialists, for a lot of writers in between, not getting reviewed
in the Times or receiving a harsh review can nail the coffin shut.
Other publications can be cavalier without worrying about squashing
an author's budding career. The giant Times can't.
</P>
<P>
   It's instructive to contrast this with the approach of the
leading British papers. The book review sections of the Sunday
Times, Sunday Telegraph, and Observer, as well as the Times
Literary Supplement and the delightful London Review of Books, look
to conflicts to generate interest.
</P>
<P>
   The famous letter to the Times--''Sirs, of all the people who
might have reviewed my book, could you not find one who was not my
former wife?''--may be apocryphal. But it gets at the spirit of
British reviewing, which is that the sometimes petty clash of
literary opinion is good sport. Regular Sunday reviewers, on the
model of Cyril Connolly, the longtime critic for the Sunday Times,
become trusted guides. And the British book reviews are more like
publications revolving around literary life than mere reviews. They
contain diaries, poems, puzzles, and interviews. The best book
review section in an American paper at the moment--the Los Angeles
Times Book Review--is much closer to this variety model.
</P>
<P>
   The NYTBR could make itself more interesting by going halfway
British. Break the monotony of 25 sequential reviews with
full-length author interviews (which the Times used to have),
letters from abroad, debates, and a gossip column. Encourage a
feisty letters page. Blow off the brief reviews. Take chances.
Crusade. Quit being so damned responsible.

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let begin with a disclaimer. My husband was perfectly happy
having two daughters. If Jack wanted a son, it was in the same way
that he hoped to see certain exotic locations in his lifetime.
Sure, it might be nice to sail down the Yangtze River before he
dies, but he's not losing sleep because the opportunity has never
arisen. He was always enthusiastically involved in our daughters'
upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   We both tried to help our daughters feel free to explore in
every direction, encouraging them to play sports, excel in school,
and speak up for themselves, but when Jack came home one afternoon
with a crystal radio kit and tried to entice them into doing
something he'd loved as a youngster, they weren't interested. Even
though he and his daughters shared common interests as the girls
grew older, especially a fascination with human psychology, our
daughters were indifferent to model airplanes, golf courses, and
building stone walls, Jack's boyhood hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   There was a small part of Jack _ let's call it the inner boy _
who had no one to play with, especially when our dog Buckwheat
turned out to be less than a perfect buddy. Tragically, Jack was
forced to give up his attempt to bond with the only other male in
our house after Bucky mistook a growling match as an invitation to
grab Jack by the throat. It looked as if my husband would never
hand down whatever wisdom older men pass on to the next generation
of males. Who ever dreamed that eventually our two daughters would
provide him with sons?
</P>
<P>
   In-law, of course.
</P>
<P>
   I've been watching Jack with Chris and Brian, trying to figure
out what men do together that a man and a woman cannot. I haven't
been able to observe Chris and Jack rising early on our weekends in
Vermont, the better to scour the woods for dry branches and stomp
them into kindling for the fire, because I sleep until summoned to
breakfast. I have, however, watched them each stretch out on a
hammock after their great labors of the morning. On both their
faces is the same expression God must have worn on the seventh day
when ``He saw everything that He had made and behold, it was very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   I do the dishes with water I haul from a stream 200 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   I've never even come close to that expression.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't until Brian decided to double the size of a
shed on his property that I actually got a chance to spy on the men
in my life. They huddled together over plans. They carefully
calculated lengths and estimated quantities. Then they set out
together in search of lumber, joist hangers, and galvanized nails.
Armed to the teeth with hammers and saws, they began to erect a
building.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that the carpenters got hungry and needed
sustenance and the children got wild and needed supervision, Laura
and I did our share of the construction work. I was nailing
shingles on the front of the building while the men put on roll
roofing. As I lined up wooden rectangles, I eavesdropped on the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think this fits?'' ``Is that level?'' ``Hand that over,
would you?'' ``Lift your side a little.'' ``I think we've got it.''
``Is that OK?''
</P>
<P>
   I waited for something resembling conversation, some revelation
that would bring them together in sympathetic understanding. What I
heard was: ``How much overlap do we want?'' ``Put a little more tar
over there.'' ``Do we need longer nails?'' Can you imagine women at
a quilting bee spending their precious time together asking, ``How
many stitches should I use?'' ``Pass the scissors.'' ``Is there
enough contrast?''
</P>
<P>
   Though Brian tried to explain _ ``Men focus,'' is what he said _
as a woman, I needed help making sense of what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   I turned to Martin Buber's aptly titled ``Between Man and Man.''
In a section called ``Silence which is Communication,'' I read:
``Imagine two men sitting beside one another ... They do not speak
... In this moment neither is thinking of the other ... Yet (one
man) does something ... Unreservedly communication streams from
him, and the silence bears it to his neighbor ... (who) receives it
unreservedly ... No more knowing is needed. For where unreserve has
ruled, even wordlessly, between men, the word of dialogue has
happened sacramentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the light dawned. Show me someone who has the slightest
idea what Buber is talking about _ and I'll show you a man _
</P>
<P>
   Bonding.

INVESTMENT FIRM STRUGGLES TO REVIVE LAGGING BOND UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Only baseball teams believe in silly things like the
``hometown discount.'' Money managers offer no hometown break on
fees, and expect none on performance. They know it is ``perform or
be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's exhibit: Putnam Investments, which takes a backseat in
this town of money managers to only you-know-who.
</P>
<P>
   This week the state's pension fund served notice that it will
find a new manager for a $1.3 billion fixed-income fund that Putnam
had overseen for more than a decade. The state said it would retain
Putnam as manager of two other equity portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident the pension fund is keeping Putnam as an
equity manager and dumping it as a bond manager. Put simply,
Putnam, once known best for its bond department, is now known as a
bond shop that isn't keeping pace.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of faceless money managers where the difference
between mediocrity and stellar performance is often measured in
hundredths of a percentage point, Putnam has managed to stand out
as a laggard on the fixed-income side. The $71 billion fixed-income
department has been turned upside down by reorganization _ some
people leaving on their own, others being shown the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are clearly not what we intend them to be,'' says
Stephen Oristaglio, a managing director who joined Putnam in July
from Swiss Bank Corp., where we was co-head of fixed income.
</P>
<P>
   For instance:
</P>
<P>
   _High yield (aka junk bonds), where Putnam is one of the biggest
players in country, is a disaster. Putnam High Yield Advantage and
Putnam High Yield, two of its biggest funds, are both near the
bottom of their category. The $3.8 billion High Yield, for example,
is down 8.37 percent this year compared with an average decline of
1.47 percent for its peer group, ranking it 216 of 232 such funds,
according to Lipper Analytical Services.
</P>
<P>
   _Its multisector funds, the kind of go-anywhere bond funds
Putnam now wants to emphasize over the more generic products, are
also struggling. Its $5.1 billion Putnam Diversified Income ranks
60th of 78 similiar funds this year, Lipper says.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's fixed-income performance has been mediocre, at best,
for awhile _ something that Putnam boss Larry Lasser, not known for
his patience, was going to tolerate only so long.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Lasser extended the purview of Putnam's equity
chief, Tim Ferguson, to include global bond investing. In March
Putnam, saying it wanted to change the product mix, fired eight of
its 30 bond managers. A few months later Putnam hired Oristaglio.
</P>
<P>
   All the while William Curtin, head of the bond department, was
getting squeezed. In October, Putnam revamped the research
department, putting fixed-income research under Carol McMullen,
head of equity research. Curtin exited not long after that.
</P>
<P>
   Big institutional clients can live with short-term performance
problems, but they hate this kind of turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Henderson, director of the $22 billion Massachusetts
Pension Reserve Investment Management system, said Wednesday the
state had been unimpressed with Putnam's bond performance, but had
been willing to give the company a chance to fix the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said Putnam had initially billed Curtin, who joined
Putnam with a big reputation from Lehman Bros. two years ago, as
the centerpiece of its plan. When Curtin left, the pension board
decided it was time to leave, too, Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround just seemed too far away. ``We think it is going
to be awhile before they are up to speed with their competitors,''
Henderson says.
</P>
<P>
   Oristaglio, the Putnam executive, says the problems are fixable,
but are taking longer than expected. He said the trauma of the
third quarter, which crushed the high-yield market, did not make
things any easier. ``That explains why our performance has not
immediately improved,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Putnam took what Orsitaglio calls a ``silo
approach'' on the fixed-income side, with differing investment
styles and technologies. The goal is now to rationalize the system,
bringing consistency to both the equity and fixed-income sides of
the business.
</P>
<P>
   Oristaglio promises results starting next year. ``I don't expect
this will take another year,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It better not. Another year of revolving doors at Putnam and the
state pension fund will not be the only client hitting the exits,
says Jeff McConnell, a Morningstar analyst. ``I wouldn't be
surprised to see more of that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the state pension fund, the board has voted to
instruct its money managers to trade with firms other than Bear
Stearns &AMP; Co. when possible.
</P>
<P>
   The board is unhappy that Bear Stearns has been unwilling to
settle a dispute involving an investment gone bad in a bunch of
grade-B movies back in the mid-'80s. Last summer, a California jury
awarded the pension fund $6.5 million, but Bear Stearns has been
talking appeal, not settlement. Henderson, the pension fund
director, says the brokerage house makes as much as $1 million a
year making its trades.
</P>
<P>
   Says a Bear Stearns spokeswoman: ``We feel we will be vindicated
on appeal. We disagree with the jury's verdict, and we are sorry
they have decided to take this action.''

GORDON BROTHERS ACTS AS LIQUIDATOR, HEALER TO RETAILERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Ala., N.J.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gordon Brothers Group may be the largest retailer that
nobody has ever heard of. Last year, it sold $1 billion worth of
merchandise, nearly twice as much as Filene's Basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the Green Berets of retailing,'' Gordon Brothers chief
executive Michael Frieze likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   That's one way of putting it.
</P>
<P>
   For much of its history, a company founded 95 years ago by
Frieze's grandfather has been a liquidator.
</P>
<P>
   In that role, it's accustomed to dispatching a SWAT team of 200
retail specialists, often at a moment's notice, to organize
going-out-of-business sales for stores about to go belly up.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, the Green Berets have evolved into a
sort of MASH unit. As often as not, Gordon Brothers gives retailers
medical treatment rather than last rites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're classified as morticians,'' Frieze says. ``But quite
often we're the doctors'' who help keep the patient healthy.
</P>
<P>
   With Gordon Brothers earning both doctor's and mortician's fees,
sales have nearly tripled since 1993, says Gary M. Kulp, a Gordon
Brothers principal and managing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over half our business is dealing with healthy retailers,''
Frieze says. ``Ten years ago, it was not even 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of this growth is driven by consolidation in the retail
industry as big-box superstore chains look to move into new
markets. When one chain buys another, it can turn to someone like
Gordon Brothers for help.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case of Just For Feet Inc., an Alabama company whose
Southeastern superstores sell sneakers and athletic gear.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Just For Feet bought Sneaker Stadium, a New
Jersey-based chain of 39 somewhat similar stores.
</P>
<P>
   Just For Feet wasn't interested in Sneaker Stadium's format or
inventory. For the Alabama company, the transaction was essentially
a real estate deal, a chance to establish a beachhead in the
Northeast and to acquire choice real estate sites.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for all Sneaker Stadium merchandise and fixtures to
be sold off. Once emptied of all goods, the stores will be shut
down for two months of remodeling. Then they will reopen as Just
For Feet stores.
</P>
<P>
   Just For Feet's purchase of Sneaker Stadium is typical of many
retail acquistions, Kulp says. In most cases, the buyer is
interested in only &UR;  &LR; 60 or 70 percent of the company purchased. The
rest, he says, is ``baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   After an acquisition, it's frequently Gordon Brothers that's
hired to quickly dispose of that baggage and get the acquiring
retailer the most value for it.
</P>
<P>
   Why wouldn't a retailer dispose of this baggage on its own? Why
not put up a sign that says, ``Everything 40 percent off''?
</P>
<P>
   Often retailers do, but Gordon Brothers claims a special
expertise in the narrow art of the clearance sale, which is
designed to transform a store filled with slow moving merchandise
into an empty building within eight to 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running a clearance sale, you can see sales volumes running at
1 1/2 to 4 times your normal levels,'' says Eric L. Tyra, Just For
Feet's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   For a retailer more interested in expanding into a new market
than in unloading sneakers in last year's color, a clearance sale
can be a sideshow and a distraction _ and a bit overwhelming
compared to what the retailer is accustomed to seeing.
</P>
<P>
   For the consumer, it's just a big sale. There's no indication of
Gordon Brothers' involvement.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to clearance sales, Frieze says, ``We consider
ourselves experts not because we're smarter than everybody else but
because we do it over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of doing it over and over again, Gordon Brothers has
an extensive data base for putting the right price on a
discontinued line of toaster ovens, say, or for figuring out how
much people will pay for rollerblades in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Discount an item by too much and a retailer will recover less
than the item's value. Offer too stingy a discount, and few
shoppers will want to buy anything.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Marshall, the Gordon Brothers specialist on shoe retail,
explains why a company is better off hiring Gordon Brothers than
getting rid of unwanted merchandise itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get them a buck and a quarter where they'd only get a
buck,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sneaker Stadium store in Natick, Gordon Brothers
personnel arrived on the scene Oct. 28 to help advise the staff on
the fine points of a clearance sale.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to have the store completely empty by Jan. 10 so a
remodeled Just For Feet can open in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   At Sneaker Stadium, shoes were grouped by brand _ a Nike section
here, a Reebok section over there _ and the format often required
customers to seek help from the store staff.
</P>
<P>
   Now the agenda has changed. The aim is to get as much product
out of the store room and onto the selling floor as possible and to
display it in a way so that shoppers can serve themselves.
</P>
<P>
   By Frieze's estimate, Sneaker Stadium in Natick will be one of
2,000 stores that Gordon Brothers closes this year.
</P>
<P>
   As the mission of Gordon Brothers evolves, so too does the
company. Two years ago, it sold its asset-based lending division to
BankBoston Corp. And last month, it acquired a real estate company
to help dispose of retail clients' unwanted leases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a new mission, the stigma of the liquidator is not easy
to shake. Although Gordon Brothers claims that it has advised some
of the country's most successful retailers, Frieze says he is not
at liberty to name names.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even healthy retailers have unprofitable stores or a
division that doesn't meet sales targets. In many cases,
such &UR;  &LR; retailers hire Gordon Brothers to take care of their problems
with ``obsolescence,'' as Kulp delicately puts it.
</P>
<P>
   When the likes of a Wal-Mart or a Home Depot aggressively invade
a market, ``they bring in a ton of obsolescence,'' he says.
``That's where Gordon Brothers fits in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to use us, or at least let anyone know
they're using us,'' Frieze acknowledges. ``The initial response?
`Oh, Gordon Brothers, the liquidator. People are going to think
we're in trouble.' Instead of being regarded like a professional
firm, like accountants or lawyers, people think we're dressed in
black.''

CSM PINS HOPES ON FACELIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   How does a paper that eschews sensationalism, searches for
solutions, and struggles with a distribution system that precludes
reporting on breaking news, sell itself in this frantic media
environment? As the antidote to the all-Monica-all-the-time
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, The Christian Science Monitor -- whose circulation
has slipped to about 80,000 and which is projected to lose $18
million this fiscal year -- rolled out a $500,000 redesign and a $3
million marketing strategy. Among other things, readers will notice
a different logo; new ``streamlined'' looks for the five rotating
daily sections like Work &AMP; Money and Arts &AMP; Leisure; a reconfigured
editorial page; and a paper that will increase by eight pages a
week.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of all this is to change the Monitor's status -- in the
candid words of managing publisher Stephen T. Gray -- as ``the best
respected, least subscribed-to national newspaper.'' Noting that
the news industry is ``struggling...to hold off a tide of sleaze,''
editor David Cook said ``we're convinced that decency does not have
to be dull.`` One of the the Monitor's direct mail ads now features
the slogan: ``Expect more from your news source -- expect the
truth.'' And Gray went so far as to exhort the rest of the media
``to make principled journalism more universal and more relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in serious journalism has to root for the
Monitor. But in lieu of a media reformation, its fate may hinge on
efforts to end its reliance on the U.S. mails and to pursue plans
-- currently being tested in the Boston market -- to arrive at
subscribers' doorsteps first thing in the morning.

   If the Iraqi people ever get to elect a leader, they could be
forgiven for choosing CNN boss Ted Turner. He, more than Saddam
Hussein, may have saved them from two punishing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The latest instance was a November 14 CNN dispatch that proved
the catalyst for a last-second postponement of a major attack on
Iraq that was at least temporarily obviated by Hussein's agreement
to re-admit UN weapons inspectors. (Last February, CNN televised a
``town meeting'' ostensibly designed to prepare the country for a
military strike against Iraq. But the program turned into a public
relations debacle for the White House when vocal anti-war
protestors hijacked much of the event.)
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday's report, filed from Baghdad by CNN's Brent Sadler
at 7:39 on Saturday morning, stated that Iraq was prepared to
``respond positively'' to a UN call for the resumption of weapons
inspections. Until Tuesday's New York Times reported that CNN's
story generated a White House reassessment of an attack planned for
9 am, even CNN officials where unaware of their role in resolving
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge that the CNNs...of the world present is that
(they) can accelerate the course of events very rapidly,'' says
National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley, adding that
decision makers are adapting to this ``age of instantaneous
communications.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you pause when some reporting you did may have saved
(thousands of) lives,'' says CNN International Networks President
Eason Jordan, sounding dutifully somber.. ``And it all seems to
revolve around basically one word (``positively'') in a CNN
report...Just imagine that our report had come an hour later.''
</P>
<P>
   With the so-called ``CNN factor'' in geopolitics the subject of
much debate, Marvin Kalb, director of the Harvard's Shorenstein
Center, thinks the episode reflects well on the network and bodes
ill for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   CNN has ``everything to be proud about,'' he says. ``The unhappy
part of this is that a top official had to wait for CNN...to report
a development of this magnitude. This is nothing journalism has to
be concerned about. I think it's something the American people have
to be concerned about.''

   Almost two months after a jury awarded $163,000 to a former
Boston University Daily Free Press employee who said she'd been
fired because she was suffering from cancer, the two sides can't
agree on how close they are to the legal end game. Clearly stunned
by the verdict, the student-operated Free Press -- which has openly
fretted about its ability to continue publishing in light of the
judgment -- has changed lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Free Press' new attorney, Shepard Davidson has filing a
motion to dismiss the case or to order a new trial and submitted a
notice of appeal. By his reckoning, all these options could remain
in limbo until a trial transcript is prepared, a process that can
take time. ``I don't foresee anything (final) happening unless we
can work something out with (the plaintiff),'' says Davidson.
``Appeals can take years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Homsey, attorney for the plaintiff Karen Miranda, says that
aside from the $163,000 judgment, tens of thousands of dollars in
interest payments and about $85,000 in legal fees could be added to
the award. Homsey also says he's anticipating a ruling on
Davidson's motions ``within a week or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to editor Gene Johnson, a chastened Free
Press is amending its bylaws and creating a human resources
position in order to shore up a lax business operation that is
blamed, at least in part, for the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the public believes people in glass houses shouldn't
practice journalism. Forty five percent of the respondents to a New
York magazine poll say journalists who pass judgement on the
president's infidelity should have their own sex lives scrutinized.
(That might not be as interesting as people suspect.)

HGTV WHETS APPETITES WITH MENU OF HOME SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI DOTEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a rainy Saturday and Gary Riegel is puttering around his
apartment in a large Victorian house in Boston. His two televisions
are on _ one in the kitchen, the other in the den.
</P>
<P>
   He vacuums. He waters his plants. He talks to friends on the
phone. But he always keeps a close eye on his televisions, which
are both tuned to the same cable channel _ Home &AMP; Garden
Television, or HGTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not embarrassed about my love for this channel,'' says
Riegel, who works in marketing at the Boston Design Center. ``If I
had a third TV, I'd have it on in the living room. There's just so
much information being given on that channel. On weekends I'm glued
to it. And I know I'm not alone. When my neighbors and I get
together at 7 in the morning to walk our dogs, it's always, `did
you see this, did you see that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Home &AMP; Garden Television may only be five years old, but it can
claim to be one of the fastest-growing cable channels in the
nation. Why?
</P>
<P>
   It offers no-stress programming for viewers beleaguered by
information overload, assaulted by MTV-style imagery, and subjected
to ringside seating at Jerry Springer-created family contretemps.
And it's an insomniac's dream, filling one channel 24 hours a day
with 18 decorating and interior design programs, 11 building and
remodeling shows, 13 gardening and landscaping segments, four on
crafts and hobbies, and 17 other special-interest shows in the HGTV
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   And no one is shouting at you. No guns are fired. No bodies are
flying through the air. And there's nary a mention of Monica.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Mister Rogers Neighborhood for adults. And it now reaches
the homes of 44 million Americans, many of whom _ like Gary Riegel
_ have become addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The variety of the shows, the hosts, and the half-hour
segments keep my constant attention,'' says Riegel.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Jackson, 39, of Newton, is an administrative assistant
for a data storage company in Boston. ``HGTV is such a treat
because there's nothing offensive on these shows,'' she says.
``It's a very user-friendly channel. The shows are really very
helpful and cater to every taste and pocketbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says she watches the channel at least every other
weekday night and on weekends. Her sister, whom she lives with,
often joins her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shows give you the information and the tools to accomplish
what you might want to do in your home,'' says Jackson. ``There are
so many shows to choose from and not just Martha Stewart doing
Martha Stewart. The shows tell you what's out there, they educate
you, and give you the vocabulary and terminology so you don't feel
so stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay-at-home mothers with young children who want a passive way
to relax when their infants are napping or nursing also find HGTV
addictive. For these women, the content of the show doesn't much
matter _ they'll watch quilting and sewing shows even though they
can barely thread a needle.
</P>
<P>
   Others enjoy being voyeurs _ watching people spend gobs of money
on building and renovating their homes or lavishly decorating and
entertaining in their houses.
</P>
<P>
   Still others use it as background noise while doing housework,
reading, or talking on the phone. It's a quiet, uncomplicated
relationships with a ``friend'' that doesn't make demands on one's
emotional or intellectual inner life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is good and people are still spending money on
their homes _ the whole cocooning phenomenon just doesn't seem to
be abating,'' says Burton Jablin, senior vice president of
programming and production at HGTV. ``All our hosts are experts in
what they do, and this gives the shows a lot of credibility. Plus
we commission production companies in different parts of the
country to produce our shows and this gives a variety in style and
geographic location. We want to reflect all of America.''
</P>
<P>
   He says all the shows are consistent with the channel's mantra _
information, ideas, inspiration. With these three ``I's,'' anyone
can make the best of their homes _ regardless of income, says
Jablin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sea of mediocrity on TV and news shows that assault
people's senses, HGTV has become a refuge,'' says Jablin. ``There's
very little on TV that you can watch with any member of the family.
People know HGTV is not offensive, that it provides a refuge, and
viewers have responded to this in droves.''
</P>
<P>
   The channel is also enhanced by a consumer response line that
viewers can call for information about programming or specific
questions about a program's content. There is also a Web site where
thousands of pages of information are posted. The channel is owned
by Knoxville-based E.W. Scripps and was the brainchild of Ken Lowe,
who created the channel in response to the $587 billion home and
garden market. According to published figures, HGTV was started
with $100 million and now has an asset value of between $900
million and $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Talbot of Westfield is resting at home these days with a
bad back, so she is catching up on her crocheting and watching more
HGTV than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``This channel is so down-to-earth and easy,'' says Talbot, 50,
who is a mother of five and grandmother of seven. ``(A project) may
not look easy at first but they explain everything step by step. I
started watching several years ago for the gardening shows, but
then I started watching the crafts shows, and now I watch
everything including ``Awesome Interiors.'' That show makes you
dream. But it also gives you ideas even if you can't afford what is
being shown in these very wealthy homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbot has one son, 16, still at home. He's taking carpentry in
school, so he'll flip through the channels and watch a woodworking
or building show.
</P>
<P>
   Christy May Powley of Westwood, Mass., owner of DM
Communications, likes everything on HGTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most TV is mindless but the Home &AMP; Garden channel, well, I can
apply it to my life,'' says Powley. ``There are such helpful hints
that I can apply to my daily life. When I'm watching the channel it
doesn't feel like a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   She watches HGTV at least three times a week. Sometimes she'll
be watching a movie and switch to HGTV during a commercial and
``get hooked.'' Her husband also enjoys the channel and flips there
to avoid watching the beer commercials during football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can learn so much,'' says Powley. ``We have this sycamore
tree out front, and it was losing its leaves. We called a tree
service, and they didn't know what was wrong. We found the solution
to the problem on HGTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also like the stenciling and organization shows, and I'll
certainly watch the holiday shows'' which begin Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the shows are so much easier to take than Martha
(Stewart). They are more accessible. I don't feel like these people
are lecturing me or making me feel like a loser. Martha is so
serious. HGTV shows are, well, they seem to be saying, hey, let's
have some fun here.''

ORIENTAL RUGS EMBODY A UNIVERSE OF ASIAN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1741, the Isaac Royall family of Medford, Mass. posed to have
their portrait painted by Robert Feke. Only one of their household
treasures is included in the painting _ their Oriental carpet. Such
a valuable textile was the pride of many an Early American clan;
there was no better way to proclaim prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was this attitude new to the New World. In European
paintings from Holland to Spain, Oriental carpets figure
prominently _ and not just on the floor. They're also table
coverings of choice. They're in so many paintings that there are
whole categories of carpets named for artists: Hence the terms
``Holbein Rug'' and ``Bellini Rug.'' And because carpets aren't
often well-documented, their appearance in paintings helps
historians to date them.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing popularity of Oriental carpets accounts for the
popularity of a recent course Museum of Fine Arts curator Julia
Bailey gave on the subject: It was sold out as soon as it was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Oriental carpet show ``Ambassadors from the East,'' which
Bailey has organized for the MFA, is equally well-liked: On one
recent morning, as soon as the museum opened, people started
streaming into the textile gallery where the show is on view.
Although the carpets are from the museum's own collection of about
125 rugs, their sensitivity to light means they're not often on
view.
</P>
<P>
   The very term ``Oriental carpet'' is misleading, Bailey says:
These textiles were made across a vast Rug Belt that stretched from
China to Spain. As for the terms ``rug'' and ``carpet,'' both are
acceptable, she says, although ``carpet'' is more accurate because
by definition it means a textile with pile, which gives color,
pattern, and texture to the finished piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be unlikely to find carpets like these on Boston floors
today _ but some certainly were there a century ago,'' Bailey says,
mentioning the Boston Brahmin who once chided her for wearing white
gloves to handle a valuable rug. To him, carpets were for floors
and feet, and for kids and dogs to roll around on.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a century ago when carpets began to be collected as
art objects rather than bought merely as furnishings. London's
Victoria and Albert Museum led the way, as part of its mission to
promote good industrial design. Astute Americans, including Denman
Waldo Ross, soon followed. A lecturer on design at Harvard, Ross
was willing to buy fragments of important rugs: He was using them
as teaching tools, not as decor, so a piece would suffice. He even
managed to snare a fragment from the identical twin of the most
famous rug in the world, the 16th-century Persian ``Ardabil
Carpet.'' Parts of one twin were sacrificed to repair the other;
leftover scraps appeared on the market, and Ross scooped one up.
It's in the MFA show, along with other fragments he gave to the
museum, plus a whole rug, the ``Polonaise Carpet,'' which he bought
for $7,500, the most he ever paid. It's now worth more than 10
times as much.
</P>
<P>
   Carpets offer clues to their past. One huge rug in the MFA show
has a line straight across its center, as if someone had used it to
practice tightrope-walking. Actually, says Bailey, the line
indicates it has spent considerable periods folded in storage.
Fading means the carpet has spent too much time in the light, and
uneven fading may mean that both synthetic and natural dyes were
used: They fade at different rates, throwing the color balance off.
A carpet in the shape of an arch probably surrounded a throne: The
flowers are arranged so the seated ruler would see them the right
way up.
</P>
<P>
   A 16th-century carpet from northern India has a one-way
pictorial design that ``begs to be put in a vertical position, the
way it's hung now,'' Bailey says, the better to see its rollicking
elephants, pink and cream striped lions, and beautiful maidens
sniffing flowers, all protected by a border of glowering monster
masks. This carpet's pristine condition suggests that it was never
used underfoot. It was also the first major example of the art form
that the MFA acquired, an 1893 gift from Boston's Ames family. It
was the illustrious architect H.H. Richardson, designer of
Frederick Ames's house, who chose the carpet; his recommendation
was enthusiastically endorsed by William Morris, leader of
England's Arts and Crafts movement.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most opulent textile in this show is also the
smallest, a fragment of a 17th-century niche carpet with more than
1,750 knots per square inch producing the lushest of textures, and
an equally lush pattern of twining lilies against a ruby-red
ground. Bailey says a carpet connoisseur told her that in the event
of a fire, this would be the piece to rescue. But there are other
contenders, including a majestic 16th-century Persian silk carpet
alive with hunting scenes, another world-class example. And for
sheer mesmerizing beauty, there's a 16th-century Mamluk carpet from
Egypt with a symmetrical pattern of peridot, azure, and rosy red
glowing like stained glass.
</P>
<P>
   For ``ruggies'' in search of more information on the subject,
Bailey recommends two books: Jon Thompson's ``Oriental Carpets from
the Tents, Cottages and Workshops of Asia''; and Joyce Ware's ``The
Official Price Guide to Oriental Rugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The peregrinations of these peripatetic textiles have come full
circle, she adds. Many were made in the Middle East, bought by
Europeans, and then, when Europe's aristocrats fell on hard times,
acquired by affluent Americans. Now, says Bailey, they're being
bought by the wealthy in places like Kuwait and Qatar and loaded
onto planes bound for the region where they originated. They've
literally become ``flying carpets.''

<P>
   How many leaves must one man rake before he invests in a
machine? The answer, friends, is blowing in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Or into the woods in back of your house. Or into your driveway
or shrubbery, should you happen to be an unlucky suburbanite whose
neighbors care more about aesthetics than ethics when it comes to
leaf removal.
</P>
<P>
   Love 'em or leave 'em alone, praise their efficiency or curse
their nuisance potential, the power leaf blower has arrived _ and
noisily so _ to take its place beside the snow blower and ride-on
lawn mower as a tool of modern suburban living. Cruise through the
cul de sacs beyond Boston these days and you'll see more of these
appliances in use than Cuisinarts and minivans.
</P>
<P>
   In more upscale neighborhoods, yard workers wearing hooded
sweatshirts and backpack blowers scuttle across the landscape like
``Star Wars'' Stormtroopers on patrol. In zip codes where the house
lots tend to be smaller, and household incomes (if not leaf piles)
correspondingly less disposable, homeowners are more apt to strap
on air-spewing power packs and tackle the job themselves. Virtually
everywhere there are trees, though, the lowly rake has become
rather retro.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning in Wellesley, two residents named Rich and
Phil (both declined to give their last names, fearful perhaps that
a reporter was working undercover for the local Disposal Police)
were busily blowing up a storm of crinkly maple leaves in their
respective front yards. Rich was using a $50 electric blower,
although he said they ``stink'' compared to more powerful
gas-powered blowers, which are also costlier ($80 to $130) and more
polluting, not to mention cordless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought this one for my mother, but I borrowed it back
permanently, you might say,'' Rich confessed. ``It saves time,
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil, a retired engineer, stopped blowing leaves around his
10,000-square-foot lot long enough to show off his new toy, a
12-amp Toro combination leaf blower and vacuum unit. He happily
sucked up a small pile into the bag on his back, like a Hoover
salesman hoping to close a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to rake, but it got too hard on my hands and knees,''
Phil said, laboring to be heard above the whine of the Toro. ``This
is better,'' he added. ``This is progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, though not everyone agrees. Since hitting the market in
the 1970s, leaf blowers have created a Luddite-like backlash in
scores of communities across the nation. Sales of blowers have
grown steadily over the past few years, from 75,000 units in 1985
to 464,000 in '87, 800,000 in '89 and more than a million units
today.
</P>
<P>
   In this area, where leaves abound and must be removed before
winter's first snow and ice freezes them to the ground for the
season, the contraptions cause relatively few complaints. But in
upscale communities, where pools and patios abound, it's a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Carmel, Calif., was the first city to institute a ban on
blowers, in 1974. To date more than 300 municipalities have
followed suit, from Santa Monica to Greenwich, Conn. A California
public relations executive posted a treatise on ``leaf-blower
terrorism'' on the Internet, likening the machines to ghetto
blasters and off-road motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent improvements in noise reduction _ older-model gas
blowers roared at upwards of 110 decibels _ power blowers make
their presence felt wherever and however they are used. In at least
one case, the noise was a plus. During practice last year, New
England Patriots coach Pete Carroll revved up a pair of leaf
blowers to simulate crowd noise in Denver's Mile High Stadium. (The
Pats lost anyway, but that's another story.) Newton and Brookline,
Mass. are among the Massachusetts towns that ban the use of blowers
before 8 a.m. And in Newton, it's 9:30 a.m. on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Peter Scott of the Brookline Police Department says his
officers field few complaints about power leaf blowers, typically a
handful each season. ``Landscapers around here know the rules, and
those that don't know them learn in a hurry,'' says Scott. Usually
a first-time complaint draws a squad car and a warning. After that,
it's a $50 fine and a few choice words from the police.
</P>
<P>
   While it's against the law to blow leaves into the street, Scott
notes, Brookline, which bans overnight parking, sweeps its streets
with regularity, so delinquent leaf piles have little chance of
blowing back onto bordering lawns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are reasonable,'' Scott says. ``They want to get
along with their neighbors. Although my personal opinion is, they
should rake leaves. By hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Chet Herget, a professional landscaper in Westford, gets few
complaints about noise. ``Years ago,'' says Herget, ``owners put up
fences to keep out leaves from neighbors' yards. People are more
yard sensitive now. They keep up with their own cleanup because of
property values.''
</P>
<P>
   But yes, says Herget, squabbles arise from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some guy has been partying too late Saturday night, his
neighbor might go out early Sunday morning and try a little
payback.''
</P>
<P>
   For that job, Herget recommends a gas-powered blower.

ACCEPTING A COLLEGE FRESHMAN'S NEW IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before your college freshman graces your doorstep next week,
only to deposit a kiss on your cheek and dirty clothes in the
laundry before disappearing with friends, consider this: Not only
is this particular Thanksgiving vacation the pits for parents, but
we should be thankful it is. That your child eschews your company
for friends is a sure sign she's making appropriate developmental
leaps.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the vacations in the four-year college period, a
freshman's Thanksgiving break is the most difficult, say family
therapists and college officials. Christmas break is not far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   The more prepared parents are for this, the better. ``Your child
is not the same person who left last August,'' says Karen Levin
Coburn, associate dean of students at Washington University in St.
Louis and coauthor of ``Letting Go: A Parents' Guide to
Understanding the College Years'' (Harper Collins, 3d edition).
</P>
<P>
   She tells parents to try not to get stuck on the obvious
changes, like a new hair color or facial piercings; that only
obscures more important psychological changes. ``Every student has
a new identity the parent isn't even part of,'' says Coburn.
</P>
<P>
   Even as you're experiencing shock at the way she looks (or talks
or eats or sleeps), she's going through a shock of her own. ``Each
child recreates himself at college and experiences massive change.
But strangely enough, she expects everything at home to stay the
same,'' says psychologist Linda Budd of the University of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Any change _ siblings who are more grown up, rooms that have
been painted or rearranged, even a new bookshelf _ can be jolting.
``Life has gone on without them. They feel left out,'' says Budd.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest of all are the changes in relationships with friends.
Once they step in the door, anxiety starts to build: Will friends
be the same? Since the friends have had similar awakenings of their
own, the answer is: probably not.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are losses for a child,'' says Budd. ``They need to
grieve.'' She says irritability or anger we see at Thanksgiving, or
more likely during the longer Christmas vacation, is grief over
friendships that are lost or changes at home. Ironically, the more
adjusted and/or invested a student has become in college, the more
likely there is to be a disconnect with friends at home at the very
time he is trying to reconnect.
</P>
<P>
   ``A high school friend doesn't know what he's talking about when
he says, `I live on the 40,' or `We hang at the Rat,''' says
Coburn. ``It's dawning on him that he lives in two separate worlds
and he's wondering, `Which one do I really belong in?''' This can
be confusing, even scary.
</P>
<P>
   Budd learned the truth of that from her daughter when she picked
her up at college to bring her home for the first time. ``She got
in the car and asked, a little tearfully, `Is my home still my home
or is this my home?' I took a deep breath and told her, `Your home
will always be with us, but from now on you will have more than one
home.'''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Budd was wise not to answer her daughter in a dismissive
or defensive way _ ``Of course home is your home, what a silly
question!'' _ parents also shouldn't take it personally when a
child prefers to be with friends.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing a freshman knows he can count on to not have
changed is your love. ``When they run off with friends, they are
not rejecting you,'' says Budd. ``If anything, it's a tribute to
you, a sign they feel secure enough in your relationship to put
energy into other ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, parents who overreact can inadvertently make things
worse, says Michael J. Cunningham, director of New Student and
Parent Programs at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   He says the natural consequence of the hurt is to withdraw
emotionally _ ``Fine, if that's what you want''; put up a fuss _
``How can you just walk out the door?''; or exert control _ ``You
have to be home by 1.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of lashing out,'' says Cunningham, ``a way to
bring the kid back into the fold.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't really children, and they aren't really adults,
but they feel to themselves like adults, so if you treat them as
children, arbitrarily setting rules, their response is to stay
away, be angry, and pull back,'' says Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   You were looking forward to a warm time together and what you've
got is conflict and hostility. Believe it or not, that isn't what
your child wants, either. ``They're as excited to come home as you
are to have them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to focus on respect rather than rules and to have a
conversation about it before she comes home, over the phone this
weekend if necessary. Coburn suggests saying something like this:
``I know at college you come and go as you please, but at home,
we're still your parents. We need to figure out a way for you to
know that we respect you as a grown-up and for you to respect us as
parents, so we aren't worried all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Head off a conflict by asking, ``Will you be comfortable with
the same rules we've always had?'' Negotiate if you need to. In
other words, says Coburn, ``Let go of the idea that your child
needs your permission to do things, and negotiate out of
respectfulness for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham says that the more you own your emotions _ ``It's not
that I want to control what you do, it's that I feel better
knowing'' _ the less it will feel like you don't trust her and the
more she'll cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   There's another important distinction Cunninham urges parents to
make: ``What wasn't acceptable behavior before because a child was
too young or immature may be acceptable now, and you should say so.
But what wasn't acceptable before because it goes against family
values still isn't acceptable now.'' For instance, just because
your son's girlfriend sleeps in his room at college, doesn't mean
you have to allow it under your roof if it makes you uncomfortable.
But don't wait until he walks in with the girlfriend to talk about
it, cautions Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Talk in advance about household responsibilities, too. It may
feel OK to treat your returning student as a guest for a four-day
weekend, but it will wear thin over a four-week winter break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to give them a few days of sleeping late and
watching reruns, which all kids need, by the way,'' says Coburn.
Beyond that, however, they need structure. Talk about these issues
before the Christmas break: ``Do you want to volunteer or get a
job?'' Or, ``When you come in late, it wakes everybody. After the
holidays, your sisters and mom and I are back on schedules, waking
up early. How can we work this out?''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn promises that no other Thanksgiving vacation will be this
complicated. ``They get more competent at handling change and you
get better at them coming and going,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Johnson, the mother of three college graduates and one
current sophomore, is a veteran of comings and goings. She learned
to take in stride well-dressed daughters wearing ragged jeans and
kempt sons with hair down their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only time she can remember her husband being thrown
for a loop was during daughter Samantha's first vacation home. ``We
got into a very hot political debate at the table and he got me
alone in the kitchen and whispered in a panic, `I think she's
become a Communist!'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SUGGESTIONS FOR PARENTS &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Giving your child literal permission to see her friends _ ``I
understand how important it is to you to be with your friends, I
can wait until the next break for us to have real time together'' _
will remove pressure she feels to be all things to all people, not
to mention how grateful she'll feel.
</P>
<P>
   _Negotiate in advance what family obligations there will be.
</P>
<P>
   _Younger siblings can be very hurt by the lack of time a
freshman spends with them. Prepare them in advance: ``Christmas
will be a longer vacation; she'll have time to do things with you
then. At Thanksgiving, she may want to spend a lot of time with her
friends.'' Be alert to a sibling who feels left out by the
attention you lavish on the returning collegian.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't expect to engage your freshman intellectually over
Thanksgiving, but suggest it for Christmas break: ``I'm looking
forward to hearing more about that anthropology course.'' ``Maybe
there are some books you've read that I'd like.''
</P>
<P>
   _Don't spring major changes at home on him as a surprise or as a
way to cushion their impact, the dog dying, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   _At Thanksgiving, many freshman talk about transferring. Avoid
``I-told-you-so'' or dismissive comments. Ask instead: ``In what
ways does/doesn't it fit your expectations?'' If she comes home
unhappy, don't feel you have to rush in to solve problems; being a
good listener can be the best help you give.
</P>
<P>
   _Avoid reacting angrily to statements like, ``How can you go to
church? You're a hypocrite.'' It's part of her developmental growth
to question things she never did before. If she's open to it,
engage her in a discussion; otherwise, let it go.

HOUSE SPEAKER CREATES A STATE OF DESPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If it's true that the denouement for the New England
(nee Boston) Patriots has finally come, and that the 38-year
struggle to find a viable everlasting home in Greater Boston has
ended in defeat, then we have a problem on our hands which far
transcends the fate of this professional football team.
</P>
<P>
   The question is this: What kind of a political system do we have
if one locally elected official is allowed to become the unofficial
state dictator?
</P>
<P>
   We are now in the second decade of a peculiar political
circumstance. First it was State Senate President William Bulger
whose power mattered above all in this commonwealth. Now it is
Speaker of the House Thomas Finneran who controls our lives. Why
even bother to have a governor if some legislative czar is going to
wield all the power?
</P>
<P>
   So let's say it all comes to pass. Bob Kraft signs an
irrevocable deal to relocate his football team to a new complex in
Hartford, thus removing one of the primary professional sports
teams from both the largest metropolitan area and the entire
commonwealth. How could this happen?
</P>
<P>
   First, start with this comment from the current Senate
president: ``It never should have come to this,'' maintains Thomas
Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Senate president, Bob Kraft accepted a deal
approved by the Senate that was so antithetical to the new norm in
these matters that the senator is amazed the Patriots owner went
for it. In other words, they made Kraft a deal he could easily
refuse, and he surprised them by accepting it.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Finneran, Bob Kraft is trying to take advantage
of the unsuspecting taxpayers. They both can't be right.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham says it's a simple matter of finance. The difference
between the Senate deal, which would have the commonwealth buying
back land from Kraft after infrastructure improvements were made,
and the House deal, which would include no such proposal, is
$100,000 a year for the life of the deal ($2.3 million annually to
$2.2 million). If and when the Patriots go to Connecticut,
Massachusetts will lose $10 million a year in payroll taxes and
other income. If the good senator isn't fudging, I ask you, does
this make sense?
</P>
<P>
   Those aren't my numbers. Those are Senator Birmingham's.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is clear, at least to me. The Speaker is
offended by the drift of pro sports. Under the guise of fiscal
sanity, he is going to allow the Patriots to walk because, among
other things, ``Mike Piazza is getting $91 million to catch a
baseball.'' Quite aside from the fact that the Mets catcher is
being paid that sum to hit the baseball rather than catch it, what
does that have to do with the New England Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   In the Finneran world view, the answer is just about everything.
He is hardly sports-ignorant. He obviously yearns for the day when
5 bucks would get you into BU Field to see the Sweet Kentucky Babe
hook up with Gino for 6. Who wouldn't? Well, guess what, Mr.
Speaker. At the same time we were fortunate enough to have Parilli
to Cappelletti, a ticket to a movie at the (now-defunct) Gary
Theater cost a buck. The world has changed. Oh, and if you only
heard the sarcasm dripping from Mr. Speaker's voice, you'd
understand what the real problem is.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Finneran wants to teach the sports world a lesson. No
``whiny millionaire'' is going to push him around. If all the other
cities and states want to jump off a fiscal cliff, that doesn't
mean he has to. Most of all, he knows what's good for us, Tom
Finneran does. All by himself. And by extension, Tom Birmingham and
the 35 other state senators who made their deal for Kraft a 36-1
vote in their branch of the Legislature are either crazy or lying
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Tom Finneran and you'd think it was no big deal if the
Patriots go skipping off to Connecticut. It's only sports, right?
It just so happens that sports are a part of our fabric, as are the
arts. Imagine the outrage if the Museum of Fine Arts or Symphony
Hall needed reasonable _ and I stress the word reasonable _
financial help from the commonwealth, without which one or both
would be forced to set up shop in Portland or Providence. There is
no difference here. A sports franchise is a major asset, defensible
on many levels, be they financial or psychic.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots are indeed gone, that may not be the end of the
story. Sooner or later, the Red Sox will find it necessary to deal
with our legislative leaders when they make the inevitable move
from Fenway Park. If he is still the unelected czar of
Massachusetts, will Tom Finneran decide that he won't be helping
them in any way because ``They paid Jose Offerman $26 million to
catch a baseball''?
</P>
<P>
   When arrogant, shortsighted politicians are in power, anything
can happen. Don't assume you'll always have the Boston Red Sox.
There once was an entity known as the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the
reason they left Brooklyn was a stadium issue. If Tom Finneran is
willing to kill one franchise, he'd have no qualms about killing
another. If you've seen one whiny millionaire, you've seen 'em all.
Right, Mr. Speaker?

KEVIN SPACEY LEAPED AT CHANCE TO PLAY ANIMATED GRASSHOPPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHY CANO-MURILLO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Terrorizing young children, berating the elderly and
flaunting a scathing personality.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the behavior one would expect from an Oscar-winning
actor, especially in a Disney film.
</P>
<P>
   But please, rub your hind legs together for Kevin Spacey in ``A
Bug's Life,'' and his portrayal of Hopper, the baddest grasshopper
this side of the cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had met John Lasseter (the director), and I loved ``Toy
Story,'' so we got to talking,'' he says while on the phone from
Dublin, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   I dropped him a hint that I would love to star in an animated
film. Luckily, he picked up on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, my primary reason for doing ``A Bug's Life'' was
for kids. It didn't matter to me what part I got, just as long as
the story had morality and a good tale to tell, then it would be
worth it.``
</P>
<P>
   Lasseter didn't need a hint to offer Spacey the hairy-legged
role of Hopper. He knew Spacey and his growling voice would be
perfect as the scaly leader of a rowdy gang of grasshoppers,
bug-eyed insects who thrive on making life miserable for a colony
of hard-working and cheerful ants. Even with his character's
dangling antennae, Spacey made sure the words ``touchy-feely''
didn't exist in Hopper's personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the way my character is portrayed,'' he says. ``I hope
that kids stand up and scream and yell after seeing what Hopper
goes through. I want this to be something they remember for a long
time.``
</P>
<P>
   Along with co-stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Dave Foley and David
Hyde Pierce, Spacey spent almost two years perfecting his lines so
they would leap off the screen and into the thoughts of moviegoers.
Because computer animation is more complex than an underground ant
colony, his part, as well as those of the other characters, was
reworked multiple times over.
</P>
<P>
   The process begins with the actors watching line drawings of
their characters, then gradually adding dialogue and more
inflection. The actors are then videotaped, and with constant fine
tuning, the film is redrawn again and again to combine the actors
facial expressions, gestures and lip movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so awesome, but it's a very long process,'' he says. The
recording sessions last anywhere from 5-7 hours, then we would redo
them, sometimes 16 times. It's really quite miraculous once it's
all finished, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed up by his experience in heavy films such as ``L.A.
Confidential,'' ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evi'' and the
``Usual Suspects'' (for which he won an Academy Award), the
animation scene came as light as a fallen leaf for Spacey. Even
though recording the movie was grueling, his effort on the film was
not. Armed with lozenges and plenty of liquids, the only battle to
conquer in this case was straining those raspy vocal cords _ and
keeping a straight face while recording his parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the easiest job in the world; it was just like being
on a picnic,'' he quips. Especially with all that comical talent in
one room, everyone turned into kids. We had an endless amount of
goofy stuff happening. It was so hard to be serious a lot of
times.``
</P>
<P>
   Spacey is currently on location working on an Irish gangster
film, ``Ordinary Decent Criminal.'' Because of his distance, he
won't be able to see the completed version of`` A Bug's Life''
until Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But he does know one thing: As much as he loved portraying the
monster mandible, he wants nothing to do with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing in common with Hopper,'' he says very
adamantly. ``I don't have wings, I don't have four hands _ although
sometimes I wish I did, and I don't have a wandering eye like
Hopper.'' &QL;

BRINGING THE PRAIRIE BACK HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In early September, circumstances placed me in Chicago, and when
I had some spare time, I placed myself amid the reconstructed
prairie at nearby Morton Arboretum.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the power of grasses, waving in the wind, stretching
endlessly (at least historically, and still in the mind's eye),
defining a region and, in part, even a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Morton's 100-acre Schulenberg Prairie is a mature, 35-year-old
planting whose stretch is not endless, only to the suburban houses
along one edge, a highway along another, and savannah and woods
bounding the interior arboretum sides.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it evoked in me strong feelings of how the landscape
appeared 150 years ago, of the lonesome and frightening awe it must
have drawn from early European arrivals as ``civilization'' began
the trickle that became a torrent that swept away almost all of the
prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Prairies are not all grasses, they just look that way. What I
saw was big and little bluestem and switch grasses mixed with
prairie and yellow gentians and purple prairie clovers. There were
sunflowers and butterfly weed and mints and asters. Black-eyed
Susans and coneflowers and coreopsis dotted the mix, and on the
list went.
</P>
<P>
   And while many of these plants would prefer Illinois to the
wetter life of the Boston suburbs, you can tell from the ones I've
named that if you were so inclined, it would be possible to
construct a reasonable facsimile of a prairie here.
</P>
<P>
   I am not so inclined, though I am growing a bunch of those
plants, including big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), perhaps the
grass most associated with prairies, and sideoats grama (Bouteloua
curtipendula), another prairie grass.
</P>
<P>
   So-called ornamental grasses have attracted me for years. I
began by leaving some natives (never did identify them) in a yellow
cactus garden I planted. They looked nice, stiff vertical brushes
of green and brown, though I have been reducing their numbers, or
attempting to, for the last few years in an effort to bring order
to the chaos of this self-indulgent bed, where sedums and my fancy
have run amok.
</P>
<P>
   I edged the bed in blue fescue (Festuca ovina `glauca'), which
grows in clumps and sends up a bluish haze of fruiting heads. I
like this veiling effect. I grew these from seed, and they were as
easy as anything I have ever grown.
</P>
<P>
   My next venture into ornamentals had a practical side. I wanted
to block the northwest wind on the front corner of our property,
partly to protect other plantings by breaking wintry blasts, but
mainly because each fall the wind swept everybody else's leaves
onto my lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Bigelow Nurseries in Northborough had a nice selection of maiden
grass (Miscanthis sinensis `gracillimus'), which right now has
seven-foot-tall plumes, and ravenna grass (Erianthus ravennae),
10-footers.
</P>
<P>
   The towering, golden brown stalks block the leaves, break the
wind, and look incredible all winter, especially when there is
snow. In early spring, I whack them down and tie them in sheaves,
which I lean against a fence for decorative effect.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks. Although they are clumping plants, they
still expand, and the roots are thick and woody. It takes a hatchet
and saw and sharp spade to divide them, and they do like to be
divided every few years. The ravenna grass is looking sparse this
year, and I am going to have to dig and hack and swear at it until
it bends to my will (or I am taken away).
</P>
<P>
   I have divided the miscanthis and stuck two chunks at one end of
the new roadside border. Substantial, they define that end of the
border, and the cyber goddess with whom I dwell tells me to plant
more (though I do not believe she plans to be home the day I next
divide these guys).
</P>
<P>
   The other end of this bed widens and is anchored by a red maple
where it juts into the lawn and a bed of day lilies by the road.
Now, day lilies are not grasses, but they do have a grasslike look
to them, and I decided to play off that and establish a large area
of similar foliage types. I hoped to exaggerate the depth of the
bed and draw the eye into it, veiling but not blocking the view out
from our front yard.
</P>
<P>
   I again turned to ornamental grasses, this time mail order from
Tripple Brook Farm in Southampton. Along the front edge I planted a
line of sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), which bunches
and is fragrant when dried. Mine is about a foot high. That fronts
-sideoats grama, which sends up two- to three-foot-tall seed stalks
with the seeds all lined up along one side.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese pennisetum (Pennisetum alopecuroides) is next, graceful
fountains with feathery plumes. Finally, there is the big bluestem,
four-foot stands with bluish nodes on the stems and purplish flower
heads in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   I also grow some bamboos, which are members of the grass family,
but, for no good reason, I don't think of them that way.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other grasses (family Poaceae) and grasslike
plants. Sedges (family Cyperaceae) and rushes (family Juncaceae)
are often thought of as grasses, and you will find them lumped
together at nurseries, which increasingly carry them. (Just
remember, to tell the difference, sedges have edges, rushes are
round, and grasses are hollow with knees to the ground.)
</P>
<P>
   They perform many functions, tying gardens together, giving a
good late summer and fall show, blending well with other autumn
perennials. They can be specimens or groundcovers and anything in
between. In the 1980s, the great landscape architects James van
Sweden and Wolfgang Oehme carried their use to new heights, in
public gardens and corporate plantings.
</P>
<P>
   Grasses don't require a lot. Some like damp soil, and very few
will stand any real shade. Grasses, which do fine in poor soil,
provide nearly year-round interest in exchange for occasional
division and cutting down in late &UR;  &LR; winter or early spring (unless
you can talk your way into having an annual burn, like they do in
the reconstructed prairies of Illinois).

MONICA AND LINDA -- DIRECT FROM THE LADIES' ROOM
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   The Monica Lewinsky-Linda Tripp tapes are significant not just
because of their connection to President Clinton but because they
reveal at last the answer to a question that has baffled men for
eons: What do women talk about when they go off together to the
ladies' room?
</P>
<P>
   This is it, guys. It's on the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Monica: ``I hate him. I hate him. I hate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda: ``Well, if you really hated him, you'd pack your bags and
scoot out.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course this kind of girl-talk isn't confined to ladies'
rooms. It can happen anywhere. The ladies' room, though, is a
classic arena. You know how it goes: You're in a restaurant, having
what you think is a perfectly good time when suddenly the women in
the group rise as one and go off to the ladies' room. You wait and
you wait. They don't come back. What are they doing in there? What
are they talking about? You start feeling paranoid, and you should,
because they're in the ladies' room talking about you, dissecting
the relationship, revealing all your secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Monica: ``I never even came close to sleeping with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda: ``Why? Because you were standing up?''
</P>
<P>
   They talk about you a lot of the time, anyway. Sometimes they
talk about more important matters.
</P>
<P>
   Monica: ``I got _ oh, oh _ and I bought a beautiful, beautiful
red very thin silk sweater top.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda: ``Ooh.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica: ``That's for my next visit. If I ever have one.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda: ``You in red. Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   This is fascinating stuff, no? In fairness, though, I have to
note that most ladies' room conversations aren't quite as riveting
as the tape talk because most don't have somebody like Linda Tripp
to draw out the other participants.
</P>
<P>
   Monica: ``I did see the cutest boy in the elevator yesterday.'
</P>
<P>
   Linda: ``Oh, where?''
</P>
<P>
   Monica: ``At Bloomingdale's. He was so cute.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there nothing Linda Tripp won't do for her country? Is no
sacrifice too great? Somebody should pin a medal on her. Or maybe
drive a stake through her heart.
</P>
<P>
   Her performance on these tapes is Oscar-worthy. The way she
feigns compassion for a clearly distraught Lewinsky. The convincing
way she flat-out lies (Monica: ``You know what's really weird? I
keep hearing these double clicks.'' Linda: ``That's my gum''). The
way she elicits information that otherwise might have passed
unnoted. Barbara Walters, eat your heart out.
</P>
<P>
   Monica: ``I just wish I could do something, I wish I could do
something that would make him go, `Gee, I was stupid,' you know?
`Boy, I was really dumb to let her go,' or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda: ``Mm-hmmm.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica: ``You know what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Linda: ``Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.''
</P>
<P>
   If they weren't talking about the president of the United
States, the conversation would be numbingly boring. Even taking
that into consideration, it's boring.
</P>
<P>
   Monica: ``I think he talked himself out of even being attracted
to me. I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda: ``Really?''
</P>
<P>
   Really. Some women will tell you they don't ever have
conversations like this in the ladies' room, or anyplace else for
that matter. Don't believe it. We revert to adolescence when the
talk turns to boys, clothes, makeup, shoes, hair. If somebody taped
our conversations and replayed them on MSNBC for the world to hear
we'd be as embarrassed as Monica must be today.

FORD SUPER DUTY IS SUPER LATIVE  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Macho truck guys adore the mighty Ford F-250 Super
Duty. Its hulking appearance, its brawny V-10 engine, its broad
interior: This is a big rig among pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I set out in the Super Duty, I sneered at the common
run of pickups. To paraphrase Crocodile Dundee: ``You call that a
truck? That's not a truck. Now, (begin ital) this (end ital) is a
truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting things back into perspective for a moment, the Super
Duty is a truck for the job site. For personal use, it could be
used for carrying big loads, towing heavy objects or lugging a
camper.
</P>
<P>
   But the Super Duty is not exactly the kind of pickup you'd
choose for your hip urban vehicle, as you might an F-150
flare-side. No, this tough guy is big and heavy and drives like a
truck. A big, heavy truck.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, some people (mostly guys) will dig tooling around in this
big unit. On the freeway, you feel as if you're piloting a semi,
partly due to the interior's expansive glass, high ceiling and wide
shoulder room.
</P>
<P>
   This thing doesn't come cheap, either, though considering its
sturdiness, capabilities and high level of creature comforts, the
Super Duty probably is priced pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   The only really trucklike thing I did was take a load of
furniture and other stuff to St. Vincent's thrift store. That
wouldn't tax the F-250's abilities very much, though.
</P>
<P>
   The guys at the thrift-store loading dock were mighty impressed
with the rig.
</P>
<P>
   Take note that this is the least heavy-duty of the Super Duty
contingent, a rear-wheel-drive Super Cab model rated at 8,800
pounds gross vehicle weight (the truck plus its maximum payload).
In other words, you can carry about 3,000 pounds in this boy.
</P>
<P>
   Super Duty trucks also come in four-wheel-drive and include a
heavier-duty F-350 in various configurations and payload
capacities, including stake-body trucks and the like. The
granddaddy is the F-550, with a gross vehicle weight of 17,500
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The three-quarter-ton F-250, and its 1-ton stablemate, the
F-350, are new for '99. They ride on a different chassis than the
standard F-series trucks, and will help to continue Ford's reign as
bestselling pickup truck in America.
</P>
<P>
   If you see a resemblance between the Super Duty and the big
Dodge Ram, especially the semitruck styling of the front end,
that's no accident. The Ram was a revolutionary design, boosting
Dodge truck sales, a stylistic coup that redefined the muscular
image of pickups. Ford has followed suit, making the Super Duty
look as hunky as it is.
</P>
<P>
   The test truck also came with another fixation of the '90s: a
four-door stretch cab. This big cab potentially could seat six,
including three across the front bench seat, though the rear seat
has less comfort than most would desire for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   The longer four-door Crew Cab model has a full-size rear seat,
sort of like a huge sport-utility vehicle with a pickup bed.
</P>
<P>
   The front seats in the test truck, equipped with the high-end,
$2,500 Lariat trim package, are very comfortable, helping to take
the edge out of the rugged road manners. But leather seating in
what is essentially a tough work truck seems a bit much.
</P>
<P>
   Those who enjoy a high seating position, well, come and get it.
</P>
<P>
   Our tester came with the optional Triton V-10, a mill that makes
this huge vehicle jump off the line like a jack rabbit and roar up
to highway speed. Passing power is a bit lax, typical of a truck
engine with more grunt than cruising finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Why a V-10? Well, for one thing, there's lots of pulling power.
A V-10 delivers the torque with hardly any harshness or vibration.
The standard Super Duty engine is a beefy V-8, or one can go up to
the massive pulling power of a 7.3-liter diesel with 235 horsepower
and 500 pound-feet of torque. That's a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge Ram also offers a V-10 engine, one that shares basic
architecture with the awesome powerhouse in the Dodge Viper
roadster. Hmmm. Maybe Ford could use its V-10 to power a superhot
sports car, too. A new generation Thunderbird, perhaps? Hint, hint.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a price to pay for all this size and heft and
power. And that's gas mileage. According to the computer reading in
the cab, we got only an average of 10 miles per gallon in mostly
city driving.
</P>
<P>
   Pumping up the price is the optional equipment, including the
$2,500 Lariat package, $970 for an automatic transmission, $310 for
limited-slip differential, a $190 paint job, $150 trailer hitch,
$150 chrome bumper and a whopping $500 for anti-lock brakes, which
should come as standard equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Handling is limited by size and bulk, and the ride is bouncy at
best. A good bump in the road will rattle your fillings. But for
what it is, the Super Duty is quite driveable, with good steering,
effective brakes and that awesome power.
</P>
<P>
   And compared with big, lumbering trucks of the past, the Super
Duty is downright sporty. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ford F-250 Super Duty &QL; 
Vehicle type: Six-passenger, four-door stretch-cab pickup,
rear-wheel drive. &QL; 
Base price: $23,305. &QL;

Engine: 6.8-liter V-10, 275 horsepower at 4,250 rpm, 410 pound-feet
of torque at 2,650 rpm. &QL; 
Gross vehicle weight: 8,800 pounds. &QL; 
Wheelbase: 141.8 inches. &QL; 
EPA fuel economy: 10 mpg overall (observed). &QL; 
Highs: Brawny power. Rugged good looks. Comfortable cab. &QL; 
Lows: Pricey options. Mediocre gas mileage. Rugged ride. &QL;

GADGETS GALORE AT THE COMDEX COMPUTER SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ There was enough high-powered gear to outfit a NASA
launch facility at the Comdex computer trade show this week. But it
was the consumer equipment that was making headlines, especially
the flat-panel displays and hand-held computers that the major
vendors believe will produce a surge in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the eye-catchers for the home computer user
featured at the Las Vegas event:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Cyrix WebPAD: This a carry-around, three-pound tablet that
provides a direct connection to the World Wide Web. Input is by
stylus. The device measures 8 1/2 by 11 inches, the same as a piece
of office paper. It is due on store shelves next summer. Although
the price has yet to be determined, a Cyrix source says it will
cost under $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ daVinci: The Palm Pilot has taken the personal digital
assistant market by storm. But if you're going to be using your
organizer to track phone numbers and dates and jot the occasional
short note, do you really need to spend $400? Royal, the typewriter
people, are betting that the Pilot's price tag will make people
take a look at the daVinci palm-sized organizer.
</P>
<P>
   For $100, the daVinci offers almost all the functions of the
Pilot, though the on-board memory is a bit stingy (256 K vs. 4 megs
and up for the Pilots). But if you don't have thousands of friends
to keep track of, this hand-held organizer does the job. It
features a snazzy black case with a functional fold-back protective
lid. The optional folding keyboard ($30) is pretty cute, but the
tiny buttons are a bit tough to use. Available now.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ GoType! Keyboard: Frustrated with the pen-based input system
of the Palm Pilot? Then consider the GoType! It's a smallish, but
very usable keyboard that the Pilot fits into. No power connection
is needed for it draws a trickle from the Pilot's batteries. About
$70. Shipments began last week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Sharp Mobilon Pro 5000: The Sharp Mobilon Pro 5000 looks like
a slightly smaller version of a standard laptop. But the LCD screen
is brilliant, the lithium ion battery is a real workhorse, and the
keyboard is very functional. The side flip-out modem connector is a
dream to use.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Xircom RealPort PC cards: If you're a regular laptop user, you
probably know the hassles of using a PC card-based modem: They
usually have some special connector or fragile pop-out phone jack.
All of which can very easily be lost or broken. Xircom has come up
with a modem card with the jacks built in.
</P>
<P>
   No fancy connectors. No flimsy pop-outs. The downside is that
the device takes up both PC card bays, but most people only use one
bay at a time anyway. Prices start at $199 retail for the plain
vanilla 56 K card.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ PC-Unite: Casio's PC-Unite watch has a lot of beef inside.
There's a scrolling display across the face. The watch holds
schedule, contacts, to-dos and all that crucial information. And it
links to a desktop by way of an optional infrared device, or with
the included cabling. It also includes synch software for the
Microsoft Outlook personal information software. $299, due out in
January.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ SynchMaster LCD Monitor: Comdex featured a sea of flat-panel
displays. Prices swung wildly and so did quality. Samsung's new 330
TFT seems to be the best of the low ends. It's only 13.3 inches on
the diagonal, but that's actual viewing size (its screen has as
much real estate as a 15-inch tube monitor). It has a maximum
resolution of 1024-by-75, and looks bright and sharp. Retailing for
$799, it is available now.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Digital Voice Recorder: This Olympus hand-held voice recorder
stores thoughts on a memory chip (33 minutes maximum) and then
plays them back into a computer, where voice recognition software
converts the information into text. It also plays back in regular
audio through an on-board speaker. Nifty _ for $299. Out now.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Clik: This is Iomega's portable addition to its Zip/Jaz
lineup. Weighing 4 ounces, it comes with its own miniature disks
and recharging stand and it hooks to digital cameras and computers.
Disks top out at 40 MB. The device costs $199 for the basic setup
and is available now.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Memory Stick: Sony's Memory Sticks are chewing gum-sized
memory storage devices that can be shoved into a PC card and then
into a laptop. The sticks can store up to 8 MB of data. $99.95 for
the 4MB with the PC adapter thrown in. Available now.

FELICIANO REMAINS TRUE TO HIS LATIN ROOTS

By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Decades before Chayanne steamed up the big screen, or
Selena shimmied her way into the hearts of the world, or Gloria
Estefan commanded U.S. audiences to shake their body and do the
conga, Jose Feliciano was successfully breaking down language
barriers to establish himself as an international superstar.
</P>
<P>
   His sound _ a soothing hybrid of jazz, folk, soul and Latin
rhythms _ earned the Puerto Rican singer a number of hits, most
notably a Grammy-winning cover of the Doors' ``Light My Fire'' and
the holiday chestnut ``Feliz Navidad.'' That song is still a
perennial favorite, most recently popping up on Celine Dion's new
collection of Christmas tunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never imagined that Feliz Navidad would be such a hit,''
Feliciano said over the phone from a tour stop in Florida. ``I
wrote it because at the time I was lonesome for my family in Puerto
Rico _ my brothers, my mother. I wanted to feel close to them, and
so I wrote Feliz Navidad.''
</P>
<P>
   Three decades, six Grammys and dozens of platinum albums later,
Feliciano, who was born blind, is still going strong. His latest
album, ``Senor Bolero,'' is a smoldering collection of romantic
tunes that harkens back to the singer's humble beginnings recording
boleros in South America.
</P>
<P>
   Feliciano will be showcasing both new and old material during
his concert Saturday night in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing with `Senor Bolero' was that I used to sing boleros
back in 1966, and then I left it for a while in 1971, and I started
singing ballads,'' Feliciano said. ``I wanted to come to the public
with the bolero, and of course, when I started, it was me, guitar
and percussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard this program on the radio about a year ago, and the
name of the program was `Senor Bolero,' and I thought to myself,
`Boy what a great title to come back with a bolero album.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Feliciano's return to his roots has proved successful.
The album's first single, `Me Has Echado Al Olvido,' is topping
radio airplay charts in New York, Miami and Puerto Rico, and it is
No. 17 with a bullet on Billboard's Hot Latin Tracks. Feliciano has
high hopes for his fans in Texas, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really hoping that the Mexican community in Houston also
gets behind it, because I like Texas. I like San Antonio, I like
Houston, I like El Paso. I'm really hoping for big things from
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The bolero is just one in the long list of sounds and styles
Feliciano has mastered. The 53-year-old guitarist and singer has
recorded songs in four languages; he wrote the music for Ray
Bradbury's play ``The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit''; and he composed
and performed the theme for the 1970s TV show ``Chico and the
Man.'' Feliciano said that diversity has kept him inspired over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's what's kept me up, kept me going for 31 years. I
think that when a performer isn't versatile, he then fades into
oblivion, and with me, I've always been a versatile performer,''
Feliciano said. ``I can play rock 'n' roll, I can play jazz, I can
play Spanish, I can play Tex-Mex if I want to. I mean, I can do
anything, and I owe that to God because to have those kind of
abilities is a rare thing. I don't say it to be conceited or
anything. I'm a very blessed person with having all these
abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Feliciano was one of the first Latin artists to win a Grammy. He
took two statues home in 1968, for best new artist and best male
vocalist. Since that time, Feliciano has taken note of the changing
face of Latin music and its current leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my career, there weren't artists like Gloria Estefan or
Jon Secada. There were none of those people during the time that I
was in music, and so I think that the doors have opened up more for
Latin music. Carlos Santana, who's my dear friend, has opened a lot
of doors. And then, of course, the Tex-Mex groups like Little Joe y
la Familia and, of course, Selena.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Feliciano's list of listenables is surprisingly
bubble-gum friendly, thanks to his 7-year-old son Jonathan Jose.
Feliciano has been married since 1971 and has two other children,
Melissa Anne and Michael Julian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like groups like Savage Garden. My little boy has made me
aware of 'N Sync. I do like the Backstreet Boys; I think they're
good. The Spice Girls you can keep,'' he said with a slight laugh.
``They're OK, but musically I just enjoy the real musician groups,
like Boyz II Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Balancing career and family is an admitted challenge for the
singer, whose end-of-the-year plate also includes attending the
White House tree-lighting ceremony in December and more touring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I love my family, when the kids grow up, they have
their own lives, and I still want to keep my career. My career is
very important,'' Feliciano said. ``They all tell me, `Oh Dad, you
have to go again. I miss you,' but that's natural. They know that I
love them and that I'm going out to work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Feliciano's ultimate goal, though, is something he continues to
strive for even after achieving it so many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show the American contingency that just because
you were Latin didn't mean that you couldn't happen in their
music,'' Feliciano said. ``I followed kind of like in the steps of
Ritchie Valens, in a sense, although I didn't change my name like
he did. (Valens changed his name from Valenzuela.) I stuck to my
guns when the record company wanted to change my name to Joe
Phillips. I said, `No. My name is Jose Feliciano, and that's what
it will be.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is that I've always been proud of the fact that I'm
Latin, and I'm proud of the fact that I'm a Latin who lives in a
great country like America. I enjoy both.'' &QL;

 &UR; c. Templeton Foundation Press &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Distributed by N.Y. Times Special Features &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your reputation is mostly the result of how others see you. A
good reputation is slowly built on a firm foundation of humility,
integrity, love, and charity.
</P>
<P>
   Building a good reputation can be similar to building a house.
You begin with a basic firm foundation and build from that point.
The finished house is a product of the choices you made during the
construction -- from plan to completion.
</P>
<P>
   If your house is carelessly constructed of thin walls, then the
slightest wind may destroy it. If you have chosen your building
materials with attention to strength, quality, and durability, your
house can withstand the strong winds that may blow.
</P>
<P>
   Reputation is the perception by others of what they feel is your
character. Again, building character may be likened to building a
house. As you respond to life's experiences, the choices you make
become the building blocks that create and construct your
character.
</P>
<P>
   What you are at this point in your life is the product of those
choices. The responsibility of making right choices is yours.
Advice from others may be helpful; learning from experiences can
bring greater understanding and wisdom; and studying the laws of
life can open new doors for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But you are the one who decides how to use the knowledge you
acquire. No one else can act for you.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at an example. By the time he was 18, John was
saddled with a very poor reputation. He often lied. He would make
promises to his friends and fail to keep them, no matter how
important those promises were to the other person. He had even been
arrested for shoplifting.
</P>
<P>
   Because John's father was very well off financially, John
thought he had everything. He lived in a fine house, wore the
latest fashions, had his own car, and plenty of spending money.
</P>
<P>
   But John did not have everything. Far from it. He did not have a
good reputation.
</P>
<P>
   One summer, between his high school graduation and the start of
college in September, John tried for a summer job in the field of
his planned future career. But he didn't get the job. His poor
reputation cost him the position.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for the first time, he fell in love. But because of his
well-known reputation, the girl refused to date him.
</P>
<P>
   Behavior often speaks as plainly as words, and sometimes even
more plainly. Many of us listen to words, and many people listen to
the sometimes more harsh language of behavior. If we do not pay
attention to both, we can be blundering in our human relations.
Alexander Pope commented, ``At every word a reputation dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, John came to realize that money is not so important
in life if it's joined to a poor reputation. Your reputation, not
your money, is the most valuable currency of all. John began to
make changes in his life, but many years passed before people
completely accepted the ``new'' John.
</P>
<P>
   Again, what you do in everyday life affects your reputation. It
is up to you, and you alone, to make appropriate decisions.
Friends, parents, co-workers, clergy, and teachers can help you,
advise you, stand by you, but they cannot act for you.
</P>
<P>
   If you take the time to think about what effects any action can
have on your life and make your decisions based upon that
awareness, you can earn a good reputation. It doesn't matter if
you're rich or poor, a good reputation increases your chances of
leading a life rich in meaning and happiness.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean you may not make a mistake. Everyone makes
mistakes. It is important, however, to admit your mistakes when you
make them and take what steps you can to correct them. This can
keep your reputation intact.
</P>
<P>
   When you have a good reputation, you feel in touch with
yourself. And remember, every moment of your life is spent with
yourself. If you don't like and respect who you are, it can be
extremely difficult for you to like or respect others. Work to
build that good reputation. Money cannot buy it, but hard work can
earn it.
</P>
<P>
   What would you like to be able to say about yourself and to have
others say about you? Create a fantasy in your mind and imagine
exactly how you would most like to be.
</P>
<P>
   Would you like to feel from within yourself that what you say is
honest and true? Would you like for your friends and associates to
know the integrity of your intents? What level of confidence would
you like to exhibit as you interrelate with people in your everyday
world?
</P>
<P>
   Would you like to be more loving and gentle? Create in your mind
a living picture of the kind of personality and attributes that
would serve you best. For a moment, know that those inner
imaginings can be translated into physical behavior. That is
precisely what you have been doing all along, ever since you showed
up in your present physical body.
</P>
<P>
   Your vision of the way you wish to be and what you wish to
express in your life may require giving up old habits and ways of
doing things, if those ways did not present the image of yourself
you desire.
</P>
<P>
   Write down the attributes of a good reputation -- as you desire
it. Then, look at ways you can begin living the desire.

   TORONTO _ The first thing Cameron Diaz does when she gets to the
table is drop her lipstick and dive unselfconsciously down between
the chair legs to fish it out.
</P>
<P>
   Nice icebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   She comes up giggling, but that turns out not to be of
particular note because she giggles after half the things she says.
</P>
<P>
   Why she has lipstick is not clear. She doesn't seem to be
wearing any _ or much else in the way of makeup. Not that most
people figure she needs a lot of makeup: big mouth, pale blue eyes,
strong facial features.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz also has no earrings, and there is a Band-aid wrapped
unceremoniously around the end of the ring finger of the right
hand, which she often runs through her short, dark blond hair,
pulling it back behind her ears.
</P>
<P>
   She's wearing a long-sleeved purple blouse over a black body
stocking top, with a purple stone necklace and dark gray slacks.
She looks casual, but somehow seems not completely relaxed. Her
body posture, often pulling her head down and shoulders in as
though hiding, battles with a natural effervescent quality. You
quickly realize she is gun-shy, or downright suspicious, of
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she easily holds her own. Asked a question about her
personal life, she feigns deafness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? I'm sorry, what did you say?'' (Giggle.)
</P>
<P>
   Well, there goes any chance of inside information about what
happened in her now-defunct relationship with ``There's Something
About Mary'' co-star Matt Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, 26, was born in Long Beach, Calif., to parents of
Cuban-American (her dad) and European-American Indian (her mom)
heritage. Athletic, thin and 5-foot-9, she was a catalog model
before getting into movies in 1994's ``The Mask ''opposite Jim
Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   Until last summer, Diaz was recognized more for her looks and a
zillion magazine photos than for her acting talents.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``There's Something About Mary,'' and she became known
as the woman in ``that'' movie. When we talked at the Toronto Film
Festival, the movie had already become a long-run surprise. Here it
is November, and it continues playing.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz still isn't known for her acting talent, but she is quite
well-known as Mary, the character who had that ... that ... well,
stuff in her hair. (Sorry, if you are one of the eight people in
North America who did not see the movie; you'll have to ask someone
else what we're talking about here.)
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters now that ``There's Something About Mary'' is
a blockbuster and that scene has acquired semi-legendary status.
But just for the record, Diaz did have reservations about acting
with that unmentionable gel in her hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually did talk to those guys (the movie's director-writer
team of brothers Bobby and Peter Farrelly) about it a couple of
times,'' Diaz said. She goes into a comically pretentious voice:
``Being the actor, my responsibility is to make sure the character
is valid throughout the entire thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in her normal voice: ``I felt that particular scene might
take away any sort of validity, make Mary look like an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I said: `You know, guys, you want Mary to be a
babe, right? She has to look good. I don't care who you are, any
girl who looks like that has to glance in the mirror once in a
while to check the lipstick.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think even Mary, who is the coolest girl, might take a
glance in a window reflection or something and realize her hair is
standing straight up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for movie history, the Farrellys did not agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like, `What are you talking about? This is going to
be the funniest thing anybody's ever seen. Just do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So you're, like, (a resigned voice) `OK, all right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz shot the scene the way the Farrellys wanted, she did get
them to try something else first.
</P>
<P>
   ``They humored me and let me do it another way with the hair
just in a glob, kind of down,'' Diaz said. ``We looked at it and
said `No.' So we put it up, and it worked. They were right.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the impact of ``There's Something About Mary,'' it's
amazing that Diaz's next role and film are even further out there.
Diaz is just one of many characters in the ensemble cast of ``Very
Bad Things,'' which opens Wednesday, but her role is quite
outrageous, even in a film filled with outrageousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very Bad Things,'' written and directed at breakneck pace and
mind-numbing volume by Peter Berg (Dr. Kronk on TV's ``Chicago
Hope'') tells what happens when a Las Vegas bachelor party goes
abysmally wrong. Like, one of the guys at the party accidentally
kills the guest prostitute. And they decide to bury her in the
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz plays Laura, the bride-to-be, whose obsessed wedding
planning is threatened when her groom might be arrested for a tiny
murder _ or two or three. Diaz's role is relatively small until
near the end of the film, when her determination to have her
wedding go just as she's dreamed leads her to do some things as
extreme as those that the bachelor-party bachelors have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure at one time Laura was a really great girl (giggle),
ya know, BW _ Before the Wedding,'' Diaz said. ``She probably had a
pretty strong moral base, but then the wedding came in and she lost
herself in it.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be fair to tell what Laura does in the scene, but it
is definitely severe and illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't ever see Laura as really cruel,'' Diaz said. ``She's
just a little delusional. She loses sight of what (marriage) is
really about. I don't think she was justified in her actions, but
certainly something had to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz may not be getting married in real life for a while, but
she has had plenty of practice in the movies. Just last year she
played a character whose movie wedding was disrupted by Julia
Roberts in ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' Previously, she was a
bride in ``Feeling Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot about weddings over the last few years. I've
had a few different types, so (she turns on a melodramatic voice)
I'm just jaded now. It's over for me.''
</P>
<P>
   What has she learned from her movie weddings?
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I could never ever plan a wedding,'' she said. ``I
am just not that girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very Bad Things'' may be the darkest comedy since ``Pulp
Fiction.'' As in ``There's Something About Mary,'' the humor is
often gross, but unlike Mary, there is a mean, sometimes gory edge
to it. If ``There's Something About Mary'' surprised some viewers,
``Very Bad Things'' is likely to shock them.
</P>
<P>
   She admits being disturbed when she found herself laughing at
something that could be considered horrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laughed at a couple of things that I didn't laugh at the
first time I saw it,'' Diaz admitted. ``The first time I was kind
of like going, why are people laughing at that? People were really
bellowing at a couple of scenes that were disturbing to me. I was
like, what is going on?
</P>
<P>
   ``This time I found myself laughing at the absurdity of it.''
</P>
<P>
   From her first film role in ``The Mask,'' Diaz has been
associated with subversive humor. Or, as they say in the reviews,
``not for all tastes.'' Does that kind of humor reflect her own
style?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say, yeah,'' she said. ``I definitely think you can't
play those things if you don't understand or you don't get it. I'm
not doing Shakespeare. I haven't yet grasped the whole, you know _
whatchamacallit _ come on, help me out, uh, we're back in time ...
''
</P>
<P>
   Period piece?
</P>
<P>
   ``Period piece! My brain is not working. I haven't really done
anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies for me, it's always the movies I liked when I was a
kid. `Raiders of the Lost Ark' _ I saw that movie a million times.
That was an escape _ something you would love to be able to do.
It's like fantasy _ something you never would really get to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``My idea of films is being able to go into a theater and forget
about the reality of where you live and where you're at. All the
films I've done are slightly on the edge: They're borderline;
there's not a reality base to it. You play it straight, but the
situations are sort of absurd and fantastical.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Mary'' has ensured Diaz of getting more and
better script offers. Her next film will be ``The League,''
directed by Oliver Stone, in which she plays the general manager of
a football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really nice to have options,'' Diaz said, ``to have the
opportunity to work with Oliver and Al Pacino and James Woods and
Dennis Quaid (all in the film).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terrified at that. I'm sure I'm going to apologize all the
way through and possibly be handing back cash they handed over to
me before I started. (But) I trust Oliver, and he says he thinks I
can do it,'' she said with another giggle.
</P>
<P>
   Since Diaz does such bad things in ``Very Bad Things,'' it's
easy to wonder if she's ever done any bad things she's ashamed of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chopped up a journalist once and put him in a suitcase and
dug a hole in the desert,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Time to go.

first American Thanksgiving Festival, complete such exotic-sounding
dishes as succotash and pumpkin pie to complement a dinner of
turkey with cranberry sauce. By some counts, as many as 250,000
Americans live in the United Kingdom, and many feel somewhat
dislocated during periods of traditional U.S. holidays such as
Independence Day, Halloween and Thanksgiving. And despite a full

McDonald's, shopping malls and Homer Simpson, there is only a vague

   ANATOMY OF A CRASH
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529 was only a little
propeller-driven plane that fell in an obscure hayfield in west
Georgia: 10 people died, 19 survived. In terms of lives lost,
certainly it was not on scale with TWA Flight 800 and Swissair
Flight 111. More than 200 people died in each of those crashes. Yet
the ASA crash is writ large across many lives. Nearly two-thirds of
the people aboard survived _ a miracle gift _ and so this crash is
not
</P>
<P>
   only about death, but life.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reporter Gary M. Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from
Georgia to Maine to Texas to Alaska _ to track down and interview
survivors of ASA Flight 529. He also canvassed investigative files
of the National Transportation Safety Board and testimony taken
during the ensuing litigation. Pomerantz vivdly describes the 9
minutes and 20 seconds of horror aboard that doomed aircraft as it
fell to earth, the fire that consumed the broken fuselage, as well
as how the tragedy has reshaped lives.
</P>
<P>
   This is the final part of the series. WITH PHOTOS and
ILLUSTRATIONS.
</P>
<P>
   DAY 6 _ Nov. 20
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-BLADEMAN _ TYLER, Texas _ The broken propeller stub showed
signs typical of fatigue cracking. It also yielded the most
important clue: serial number 861398. The paper chase now was on:
Maintenance records revealed blade 861398 had been repaired 11
months earlier after failing an ultrasonic inspection. Following
the paper trail, investigators discovered the repair _ a sanding
job _ had been made by a mechanic who signed himself in small,
tight handwriting: ``CSB.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Scott Bender, young, blond and earnest, is a
mechanic no more. He's 27, a Bible student now. Although the crash
is never far from his thoughts, he still knows few details of what
happened. But he knows that it was his blade that broke, and he's
often wondered: Was it my fault? (Pomerantz, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

 &HT;    FOOD SAFETY A TOP PRIORITY AT THANKSGIVING, GROUP WARNS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (d) food categories.
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thanksgiving is no time to be lax about food
safety, a consumer group warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent reports showing that contamination of poultry
with salmonella bacteria has decreased, the Center for Science in
the Public Interest urged all consumers to practice smart food
handling techniques when preparing meals this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is imperative that the industry and the government
work to ensure safer turkeys, consumers remain the last line of
defense against food poisoning,'' said Caroline Smith DeWaal, food
safety director for the consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government started a new federal food safety system in
January, salmonella contamination in chicken has been reduced by
half _ from 20 to 10 percent, DeWaal said. Turkey and red meat also
showed improvement.
</P>
<P>
   However, DeWaal said there is no evidence to suggest that levels
of campylobacter bacteria in poultry have decreased. The No. 1
cause of bacterial food poisoning, campylobacter can cause serious
neurological disease which can lead to temporary paralysis similar
to polio.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996-97 survey taken before the new program began showed that
nine out of 10 turkeys contained the campylobacter bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   To help fight against food poisoning, the consumer group offered
the following advice for cooks:
</P>
<P>
   _ To prevent the spread of bacteria, keep your turkey
double-wrapped in plastic bags in your refrigerator or freezer
until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use a meat thermometer even if your turkey has a pop-up timer.
Turkey is done once the thermometer reads 180 degrees. Stuffing
much reach 165 degrees, especially if it is cooked inside the
turkey or contains raw eggs or oysters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use pasteurized egg products in recipes that call for raw or
partially cooked eggs. Also avoid unpasteurized juices or heat them
to a low boil.
</P>
<P>
   For more tips on safe cooking, call the U.S. Department of
Agriculture Meat and Poultry Hotline at 800-535-4555 or visit its
Internet site (http://www.fsis.usda.gov).

 &HT;    FOOD SAFETY A TOP PRIORITY AT THANKSGIVING, GROUP WARNS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (d) food categories.
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thanksgiving is no time to be lax about food
safety, a consumer group warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent reports showing that contamination of poultry
with salmonella bacteria has decreased, the Center for Science in
the Public Interest urged all consumers to practice smart food
handling techniques when preparing meals this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is imperative that the industry and the government
work to ensure safer turkeys, consumers remain the last line of
defense against food poisoning,'' said Caroline Smith DeWaal, food
safety director for the consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government started a new federal food safety system in
January, salmonella contamination in chicken has been reduced by
half _ from 20 to 10 percent, DeWaal said. Turkey and red meat also
showed improvement.
</P>
<P>
   However, DeWaal said there is no evidence to suggest that levels
of campylobacter bacteria in poultry have decreased. The No. 1
cause of bacterial food poisoning, campylobacter can cause serious
neurological disease which can lead to temporary paralysis similar
to polio.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996-97 survey taken before the new program began showed that
nine out of 10 turkeys contained the campylobacter bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   To help fight against food poisoning, the consumer group offered
the following advice for cooks:
</P>
<P>
   _ To prevent the spread of bacteria, keep your turkey
double-wrapped in plastic bags in your refrigerator or freezer
until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use a meat thermometer even if your turkey has a pop-up timer.
Turkey is done once the thermometer reads 180 degrees. Stuffing
much reach 165 degrees, especially if it is cooked inside the
turkey or contains raw eggs or oysters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use pasteurized egg products in recipes that call for raw or
partially cooked eggs. Also avoid unpasteurized juices or heat them
to a low boil.
</P>
<P>
   For more tips on safe cooking, call the U.S. Department of
Agriculture Meat and Poultry Hotline at 800-535-4555 or visit its
Internet site (http://www.fsis.usda.gov).

Chicago several million people ago. By R.W. Apple Jr. (Story will

 &HT;    A DAY IN THE LIFE OF THE WHITE HOUSE
 &HT;    For release Thursday, Nov. 26.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day in the life of the White House begins an hour
before midnight when Susanna McGuire rubs her coded photo ID across
the electronic scanner at a wrought-iron gate, punches in a
personal number, then enters under the gaze of a uniformed Secret
Service agent.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious young press aide who will spend the night clipping
papers for President Clinton's morning news summary, McGuire is one
of hundreds of human cogs who make the White House a perpetual
motion machine _ running day after day, decade after decade,
president after president.
</P>
<P>
   Unique in the world, the building where the president lives and
works is among the most recognizable symbols of American democracy.
It is a home and a museum, a fortress and a bureaucracy, a
playground and a monument and a backdrop for TV newscasts. It is a
place permeated with the temptations of power, of course, but also
blessed with the virtues of community and continuity.
</P>
<P>
   During the depths of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, White House
correspondents sometimes described a paralysis in the building
looming dramatically behind them. Images of inactivity could not
have been more misleading, however, in portraying the legions of
employees who every day continued to shepherd through 6,000
tourists, open 10,000 letters, answer 1,600 phone calls, entertain
foreign dignitaries, cook meals, plan parties, prune shrubbery and
oversee operation of the federal government _ accomplishing the
mundane as well as the miraculous.
</P>
<P>
   Until he recently fell ill, for instance, 78-year-old John
Muffler continued to wind the 85 or so clocks in the White House
every Friday _ a routine he had followed for half a century. Now
semi-retired, the courtly electrician's tasks have ranged from
changing light bulbs for Harry Truman to programming a VCR for
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Head florist Nancy Clarke continues to keep fresh flowers in
practically every room _ ever mindful not to aggravate President's
Clinton's allergies with pollen and not to provide tourists with
tales of bugs crawling out of blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing a staff of four full-time designers in the basement
flower shop below the North Portico, Clarke has accommodated floral
tastes of first ladies since Nancy Reagan hired her in 1981.
Regardless of the time of year, for example, Mrs. Reagan wanted
peonies in arrangements. When the Reagans left, Clarke made a
needlepoint pillow for the departing first lady _ decorated with a
bright peony and the inscription ``Peonies Bloom in May.''
</P>
<P>
   Muffler and Clarke are among 1,500 people employed in the
Executive Office of the President _ posts that range from seven
speech writers to four physicians. About 400 work in the White
House, including about 90 on the executive residence staff.
</P>
<P>
   The full-time force is augmented by 1,010 volunteers who work at
least 16 hours a month _ mostly in the correspondence office. The
Clinton administration says these volunteers save taxpayers about
$1.2 million in wages per year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, about $8.5 million is budgeted for care, heating and
lighting of the historic residence and for official entertainment
expenses of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential mansion, with its familiar columns and
porticos, was designed by James Hoban, an Irish-born architect
selected by George Washington. The cornerstone was laid on Oct. 13,
1792. Eight years later, John Adams moved in to became the first
president to live there.
</P>
<P>
   Built of Virginia sandstone, the central mansion has six floors,
including a basement and sub-basement, about 67,200 square feet of
floor space, 132 rooms including 34 bathrooms, three mezzanines,
147 windows, 412 doors, 12 chimneys, three elevators, two
dumbwaiters and seven staircases. Teddy Roosevelt dubbed this
building the ``White House'' in 1901. Before that, it was known as
the ``President's House'' and the ``Executive Mansion.''
</P>
<P>
   The first President Roosevelt also added the West Wing and its
famed Oval Office in 1909 to handle the increasing need for
presidential staff offices. The mansion and West Wing are connected
by the press area, built over what was a swimming pool from 1933 to
1969. The president walks from home to office through an open-sided
colonnade between the Rose Garden and windowless press rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Franklin Delano Roosevelt added the East Wing where the
first lady has her office. The Old Executive Office Building, a
massive gray structure that once housed all Cabinet offices next
door, is now part of the White House complex enclosed by a
protective and decorative wrought iron fence. Also inside the fence
are 19 acres of lawns, gardens and trees that make up the White
House grounds.
</P>
<P>
   It is a setting where there are no typical days.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   At 8 a.m., chief of staff John Podesta convenes the daily
meeting of senior presidential staffers in the Roosevelt Room of
the West Wing. The photocopied news summary begun by Susanna
McGuire already has been distributed to their desks. All are
stapled except the one bound for the Oval Office. A senior adviser
shuffles that summary to prioritize presidential reading.
</P>
<P>
   Small tables are fit together in the middle of the room to make
a large conference center. Top presidential advisers on domestic,
foreign and political issues fill the leather chairs around the
tables and the overstuffed armchairs and sofas along the walls. The
Roosevelt Room's namesake presidents look down from portraits _
Teddy on horseback and FDR signing legislation at a desk. The Nobel
Peace Prize won by Theodore Roosevelt sits on a mantelpiece over a
fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   A 49-year-old fitness buff who likes to jog shirtless, Podesta
is regarded as an unpretentious boss _ known for cooking elaborate
Italian meals and a passion for riding roller coasters. However,
the chief of staff can be demanding and has a dark side nicknamed
``Skippy'' by underlings. Nobody wants to provoke ``Skippy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the workaholic West Wing, where days routinely stretch from 7
a.m. to 9 p.m. or later, Podesta sets the standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we say here every Friday, only two more working days till
Monday,'' he has observed. Indeed, before the 8 a.m. session,
Podesta already has completed a smaller meeting in his nearby
office.
</P>
<P>
   The day's agenda is set at the senior staff meeting, which
usually lasts less than an hour. Afterward, attendees scatter to
preside over daily meetings of their various departments. Press
Secretary Joe Lockhart, for instance, holds a communications staff
meeting at 8:45 or so.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the president is usually in the Oval Office. Awakened
by a call from a steward, Clinton has breakfast _ often coffee and
fruit _ in an upstairs family kitchen decorated with cheerful
fruit-patterned wallpaper. The Clintons converted a butler's pantry
into this ``ordinary'' room shortly after they arrived in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Most mornings, a national security briefing is an early order of
presidential business. The data comes from the top-secret,
high-tech Situation Room located on the floor below the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   The West Wing has three levels, with staffers' offices on floors
both above and below with the Oval Office. The Situation Room is
staffed 24 hours a day by experts monitoring trouble spots around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, 52, is in
charge of the security briefing. A longtime friend, he met Clinton
when both worked on George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The briefing takes place beneath the embossed presidential seal
on the white ceiling of the Oval Office. Behind Clinton's desk, a
table displays pictures of his wife and his daughter, Chelsea, and
his collection of political campaign buttons. On his desk are busts
of FDR and Harry Truman. On the floor nearby are an African drum
and a drum made by Native Americans to commemorate the North
American Free Trade Agreement _ showing the shared American Indian
heritage of Mexico, the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   A rocking chair sits in the adjoining private study. The
president's computer is there, too, connected to the Internet _
though aides won't say whether Clinton ever surfs through
cyberspace. There is no TV.
</P>
<P>
   From her adjoining office, Nancy Hernreich helps keep Clinton on
schedule. As director of Oval Office operations, Hernreich, 52, is
one of the ``meanies'' whom Monica Lewinsky complained was trying
to keep her away from the president. A longtime loyalist, she was
Clinton's scheduler in the Arkansas governor's office. Divorced and
a diligent runner, Hernreich dotes on her daughter, Ashley, a
student at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Hernreich is the gatekeeper _ regulating who gets in to see the
president and, to some extent, when they leave. However, it is up
to the president to decide when a meeting ends.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   By midmorning, White House kitchens are bustling. The holiday
season is approaching, and 120,000 cookies and pieces of cake will
be baked for a panoply of parties.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Walter Scheib, an imposing figure nearly 7 feet tall from
the top of his traditional toque to the toes of his shined shoes,
is responsible for all meals served in the White House. A graduate
of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., Scheib was
chef at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia when hired by
Hillary Clinton in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady was looking for an American cuisine chef with a
light touch, and Scheib has worked hard at reducing the fat in the
White House fare without sacrificing flavor, texture or appearance.
Cooking oil is kept in spray bottles, for instance, and misted onto
pans rather than being poured or brushed.
</P>
<P>
   Now 43, Scheib grew up in the nearby suburb of Bethesda, Md.,
and remembers watching his mother cook the dishes Julia Child
demonstrated on TV. His wife, Jean, also is a chef, and the two
cooked together at the Boca Raton Resort and Club in Florida before
moving on to the Greenbrier.
</P>
<P>
   The first family pays for its own food _ which Scheib orders
from nearby wholesalers and from suppliers all around the nation.
He searches for the best ingredients _ buffalo milk mozzarella from
upstate New York, Michigan blueberries, Virginia ham _ and the
nation's food merchants eagerly solicit his business.
</P>
<P>
   Food bound for the White House is detoured to another facility
where it is checked by the Secret Service before being sent in
secure trucks to Scheib's pantries, refrigerators and freezers.
Scheib's staff includes two assistant chefs, a kitchen steward and
two assistant stewards. For state dinners and other major events,
this culinary force is augmented by chefs from local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking separately in a tiny kitchen jammed between the state
floor and the family quarters is pastry chef Roland Mesnier and his
longtime assistant, Franette McCulloch.
</P>
<P>
   Mesnier was born in a French village in 1944 on the very day
American soldiers liberated the community from Nazi occupation. At
the age of 14, he left school and began an apprenticeship at a
village bakery. He created pastries in kitchens in Paris, London
and Bermuda and was cooking at the Greenbrier in 1980 when Rosalynn
Carter hired him for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Mesnier's themed desserts have become the sweet stuff of legend.
At a luncheon for Egyptian officials, he created a pistachio mousse
pyramid flanked by two edible palm trees and a marzipan camel. One
Christmas, he made gingerbread and chocolate reproductions of the
president's boyhood home in Hot Springs, Ark., and the suburban
house where Hillary Rodham grew up in Park Ridge, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   For Chelsea Clinton's 16th birthday, Mesnier decorated her cake
with a replica of her new driver's license, complete with color
photo, and a car with a license tag reading ``Sweet 16.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, after 18 years, it's hard to come up with ideas,''
said Mesnier. ``Two days before the birthday I was driving to work
listening to the radio and the announcer said, 'Chelsea will soon
be getting her driver's license.' Then, Boom! It hit me. Chocolate
car and license.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, the last of this day's 6,000 or so tourists
_ more than a million visit the White House each year _ stops for a
final photo of the North Portico before leaving the compound and
stepping onto the sidewalk along Pennsylvania Avenue. The mansion's
ground floor and second story are part museum, open to visitors
from 10 a.m. to noon Tuesdays through Saturdays. The busiest times
are the summer months and December; the slowest are January and
February.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists enter on the east side and proceed through the library,
the Vermeil Room with its portraits of recent first ladies, the
China Room, the East Room where presidential press conferences are
held, the Green Room, the Blue Room where the White House Christmas
tree will be placed, the Red Room and the State Dining Room.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Bates, 52, director of the Office of Tourism, is a
longtime friend of President Clinton. She took him to his first
Judy Collins concert in 1964. When Collins visited the White House
three decades later, Clinton returned the favor by introducing the
singer to Bates.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is a treasure trove of antiques, art and
oddities. Original Norman Rockwell drawings adorn the walls of an
out-of-the-way West Wing waiting area, for instance. In another
reception area, a handsome clock made of wood, inside and out,
keeps visitors aware of the time. Historic portraits are
everywhere. A photo on an end table shows Calvin Coolidge with the
original Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Curator Betty Monkman, who has worked at the White House for
three decades, is responsible for displaying and maintaining the
artifacts, furnishings and art.
</P>
<P>
   A job whose title belies its importance is the social secretary
_ responsible for every event inside the White House and on the
grounds. From state dinners to the annual Easter Egg Roll, Social
Secretary Capricia Marshall juggles VIPs and RSVPs and a myriad of
details of protocol and logistics.
</P>
<P>
   Three to 10 events take place every week at the White House.
More than 60,000 people are entertained annually at official
functions.
</P>
<P>
   A Cleveland native and law school graduate, Marshall joined the
Clinton presidential campaign in Ohio in 1991 and came to the White
House as a special assistant to the first lady after Clinton's
initial election. In 1997, at 33, she was appointed social
secretary. Marshall made an immediate impact in her new post by
posing in Vogue magazine wearing a backless Donna Karan gown.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   It's midafternoon, and President Clinton is standing in a sunny
Rose Garden promoting his proposals for health-care reform. Irv
Williams is concerned about reporters stomping on the grass.
</P>
<P>
   For more than four decades, chief horticulturist Williams has
tended the 19 acres of trees, grass and shrubbery that compose the
White House grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The groundskeepers work for the National Park Service. Williams
helped Jacqueline Kennedy redesign the First Lady's Garden, next to
the formal Rose Garden where speeches are staged and treaties
signed.
</P>
<P>
   Every first lady leaves her own special bloom in the garden _ a
peach-colored rose for Rosalynn Carter, a yellow rose for Betty
Ford, red for Nancy Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Every president plants a tree on the grounds before leaving. The
oldest surviving presidential trees are three magnolias given root
by Andrew Jackson. Clinton has planted several trees, including an
American elm, a willow oak and a linden.
</P>
<P>
   The gently rolling South Lawn, brightened by flower beds and
partly shielded by trees, is the first family's back yard.
</P>
<P>
   In the southwest corner are a tennis court and an outdoor pool.
A short chip shot from the Oval Office is a putting green laid out
by President Eisenhower in 1954. It was removed in 1971 by the
non-golfing Richard Nixon, who built a bowling alley in the White
House basement. The green was reinstalled in 1995 by Clinton, who
also added a padded jogging track around the South Lawn driveway
and subtracted the horseshoe pits dug by George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While the president is speaking in the sunshine, Dan Burkhardt
is managing messages deep inside the Old Executive Office Building
_ a massive, foreboding gray building across West Executive Avenue
from the West Wing. The prime parking spaces for key staffers are
located between the ``OEOB'' and the West Wing.
</P>
<P>
   A political appointee from California, Burkhardt is director of
correspondence and presidential messages. The White House receives
about 10,000 letters a day at the 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. mailing
address.
</P>
<P>
   These are sorted by subject and assigned to volunteers for
replies. On any given weekday, 100 to 250 volunteers are handling
mail. The replies are checked by one of Burkhardt's 70 full-time
staffers _ who oversee everything from the processing of
presidential gifts to responding to the 2,000 or so e-mails the
president receives every day to handling incoming calls on 20 phone
lines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the OEOB operation, an auxiliary White House mail
room is located at the U.S. Soldiers and Airmen's Home near Capitol
Hill where military retirees process letters addressed to
presidential pets _ currently Socks the cat and Buddy the dog.
</P>
<P>
   Many offices in the Old EOB are spacious, with high ceilings and
working fireplaces. They are not as eagerly sought as the cramped
quarters in the West Wing, however, for proximity to the president
is prized above all other perquisites in the White House complex.
</P>
<P>
   Aide Sidney Blumenthal's office, for instance, is a converted
barbershop _ but still coveted by many because it is downstairs
from the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The Old EOB houses the staffs of many top advisers whose own
offices are in the West Wing. It also has a bank, a post office, a
cafeteria and a medical unit for staffers. In the main White House
is another medical unit for the first family. And on the bottom
floor of the West Wing, senior staffers can dine in or carry out
from the White House Mess, which is operated by Navy cooks.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Around 7 p.m., President Clinton walks down the colonnade,
headed to the top two floors of the White House that are the home
of the first family.
</P>
<P>
   He has likened this lifestyle to the way average Americans lived
in bygone decades _ residing above their stores or on their family
farms, with their jobs and homes practically melded. Here, though,
White House staffers zealously guard the upstairs private lives of
presidential families.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Walters, an aggressively discreet former Secret Service
agent with the unimposing title of chief usher, is the supervisor
of all who serve the first family in their home. With a staff of
about 90 to direct and the ultimate responsibility for everything
from state dinners to overflowing toilets, Walters has filled this
historically powerful post since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Eight chief ushers have served in the nearly 200-year history of
the White House. The improbably named Ike Hoover served the longest
_ 42 years beginning in 1891 _ and managed the care and comfort of
10 presidents and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are movie fans and regularly invite friends over
for films in the 51-seat movie theater off the East Wing portico.
Facing the screen are rows of four to six beige overstuffed
armchairs _ the rows rising on tiers toward the rear of the room.
When the Clintons show movies, tables stocked with popcorn, soft
drinks and other snacks are set up outside the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Many nights, though, Clinton takes memos upstairs to read late
into the night, aides say, working even as Susanna McGuire arrives
to start another day in the life of the White House.

 &HT;    ENGLAND'S PLYMOUTH WANTS TO GIVE AMERICANS THAN KS
 &HT;    EDs: Contains optional trim.

categories.

<P>
   LONDON _ While the turkey will be British and the football
round, the city from which the Mayflower embarked for the New World
wants Americans to come and feel at home for Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The port city of Plymouth is making plans for its first American
Thanksgiving Festival, complete with such exotic-sounding dishes as
succotash and pumpkin pie to complement a dinner of turkey with
cranberry sauce.
</P>
<P>
   By some counts, as many as 250,000 Americans live in the United
Kingdom, and many feel somewhat dislocated during periods of
traditional U.S. holidays such as Independence Day, Halloween and
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a full embrace by many Britons of such American
cultural icons as McDonald's, shopping malls and Homer Simpson,
there is only a vague awareness that there is any significance to
the last Thursday of November.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, part of the job for Plymouth organizers is to
explain to locals what it's all about. ``Plymouth has been slow to
recognize this part of our heritage, but we're learning and want to
be recognized as being a very American-friendly place,'' said Neill
Mitchell, chief executive of the Plymouth Chamber of Commerce.
``Local people are starting to get the hang of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The city of 257,000 has a number of historic, cultural and
business connections to the United States and Thanksgiving seemed
the perfect time to take note of these, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the departure point for 102 men, women and
children aboard the Mayflower, the port also has seen ships
embarking with such noted explorers as Francis Drake, Walter
Raleigh, Capt. William Bligh and Charles Darwin. The Mayflower
Stone and Steps, the place from which the Mayflower set sail, has
been preserved as a monument to the Pilgrims who left England to
establish a colony in Massachusetts. Many died over the winter, and
a feast of thanksgiving was held the following autumn.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   The old part of Plymouth city clusters around the Hoe, the
famous patch of turf on which Drake is said to have finished a calm
game of bowls before heading off to defeat the invading Spanish
Armada in 1588. Plymouth also was an embarkation point for U.S.
troops heading for the Normandy invasion in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1813 during one of the
unpleasant spells when Britain and its former colonies were at war.
``That's when the fleet from Plymouth was being molested in
Newfoundland by your fleet,'' Mitchell told an American reporter.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put that whole jigsaw puzzle together you begin to
see that there's quite a lot of American heritage represented
here,'' he said .
</P>
<P>
   This year's festival will be from Nov. 26-29, with a 1940s-style
big band dinner held the Friday after Thanksgiving and the arrival
at Plymouth docks of a group of NATO ships led by the American
warship the U.S.S. Stark.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the event has been given scarce attention in
Britain, it has been received warmly by Americans -- including
those back in the States -- because of a six-month old posting on
the World Wide Web, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   The American community in England, a fairly affluent bunch of
corporate executives and such, relies heavily on the Internet to
keep in touch. ``Were it not for the Internet, I'm not sure what we
would have done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   True to its American style, the celebration, much as its
namesake in the United States, will have commercial undertones.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to boosting tourism and providing exposure to
American business people in Britain, the event could help lure a
few Yankee dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``When President (Franklin) Roosevelt fixed it on the calendar,
it was clearly an effort to help extend the Christmas shopping
season,'' Mitchell said. ``Americans could start the season in
Plymouth and then head on to London or Paris for Christmas
shopping.''

 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Recently, at a fund-raiser for a national organization dedicated
to overcoming racial and religious bigotry, the speaker linked
anti-Semitism to intolerance against homosexuals.
 &HT;    Afterward, a friend noted sadly, ``I'm worried he brought up the
gay issue. It might offend some contributors.''
 &HT;    ``Let it offend them,'' I responded, ``maybe they need to be
offended.''
 &HT;    In the weeks since Matthew Shepard died -- apparently the victim
of a brutal gay-bashing -- liberal pundits have blamed his murder
on ``the climate of hate'' created by the religious right.
 &HT;    This analysis is wrong. The religious right did not create the
current ``climate of hate.'' If you want to blame religion for
antigay violence, blame Christianity. Liberal, conservative,
Protestant, Catholic -- it does not matter.
 &HT;    Although Jesus never mentioned homosexuality, his followers
developed an anti-homosexual ethic. Beginning with Paul, who
condemned either homosexuality in general or homosexual
prostitution specifically, homophobia contaminated Christianity
from almost its inception.
 &HT;    Throughout much of history, the church proclaimed homosexuality
inimical to faith. Often it ignored or silenced -- and only rarely
affirmed -- its gay and lesbian children. From Augustine through
Aquinas to Protestant reformers, homosexuality was seen as
``unnatural'' and the source of idolatry, deception, and
corruption.
 &HT;    When antigay picketers held up ``God Hates Fags'' signs at
Shepard's funeral they did not represent only the contemporary
religious right. Rather, they embodied a history of horror directed
against homosexuals by the church -- part of a western society's
collective inheritance.
 &HT;    Not every Christian, of course, is homophobic. Rather, all
Christians -- and nearly all Americans -- are influenced by antigay
biblical interpretations. As one professor noted regarding a course
she taught, ``Almost every student described feeling fearful and
uncomfortable about talking to gays and lesbians.''
 &HT;    Students far from the religious right -- such as those in her
liberal classroom -- still snicker about ``the sin that knows no
name.''
 &HT;    Some of my gay and lesbian friends struggle with this heritage.
As Christians, they honor the Bible, trying to live as God would
have them. As homosexual people, they feel the weight of tradition
against them.
 &HT;    The struggle? To believe in a God whose people reviled and
persecuted them.
 &HT;    Of course, others have suffered similar biblical fates.
African-Americans were told the Bible cursed them to be slaves;
women were taught their intrinsic inferiority and wifely
submission; Jews became demonic ``Christ- killers.''
 &HT;    In each case, Christianity developed elaborate theological
systems based on a few biblical texts to keep people subject to the
cultural status quo and male authority.
 &HT;    Powerful though they were, these interpretations are just that:
interpretations. Gay Christians know they have been oppressed by
what people have said about the Bible -- not the Bible. It presents
a different message -- that of a loving God.
 &HT;    The straight community often fails to recognize the difference
between the text and interpretation. Instead, heterosexual
Christians enshrined their prejudices as ``biblical'' and reading
into the Bible ideas not contained therein.
 &HT;    For example, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah is not -- as
commonly believed -- about homosexuality. It is about inhospitality
and violence. English mistranslations aside, the Bible never
actually uses the word ``homosexual.''
 &HT;    The Bible does not condemn what we know as homosexuality --
especially if a monogamous partnership. Tradition does, but most
Christians do not believe tradition infallible. Thus, rejecting bad
tradition in favor of biblical fidelity should be a compelling task
for believers.
 &HT;    Since the 19th century, many Christians have used biblical
criticism to keep the church from misinterpreting its scripture. As
a result, biblical arguments no longer justify slavery. Sermons no
longer identify Jews as the cursed children of Cain. Churches admit
women to full participation in ministry, not some second-class
status.
 &HT;    At some point in history, however, Christians believed these
offensive things -- as many still believe that homosexuality is an
``abomination'' against the Lord.
 &HT;    Homophobia is so pervasive that even those victimized by similar
biblical interpretations fail to recognize it. Only in the last two
decades have churches seriously engaged these issues. This has been
a slow, painful process -- not unlike the arguments surrounding
slavery and women's rights.
 &HT;    One day, as did abolitionism and feminism, the argument for full
inclusion of homosexuals in church and society will win. We will
look back and wonder why it was so hard to see gays and lesbians as
people -- not sinners.
 &HT;    For Matthew Shepard, however, the day did not come soon enough.
His broken body, hung as Jesus on the cross, gives the rest of us
courage to bear the pain of change.

 &HT;    ``Let it offend them,'' I responded, ``maybe they need to be
offended.''
 &HT;    In the weeks since Matthew Shepard died -- apparently the victim
of a brutal gay-bashing -- liberal pundits have blamed his murder
on ``the climate of hate'' created by the religious right.
 &HT;    This analysis is wrong. The religious right did not create the
current ``climate of hate.'' If you want to blame religion for
antigay violence, blame Christianity. Liberal, conservative,
Protestant, Catholic -- it does not matter.
 &HT;    Although Jesus never mentioned homosexuality, his followers
developed an anti-homosexual ethic. Beginning with Paul, who
condemned either homosexuality in general or homosexual
prostitution specifically, homophobia contaminated Christianity
from almost its inception.
 &HT;    Throughout much of history, the church proclaimed homosexuality
inimical to faith. Often it ignored or silenced -- and only rarely
affirmed -- its gay and lesbian children. From Augustine through
Aquinas to Protestant reformers, homosexuality was seen as
``unnatural'' and the source of idolatry, deception, and
corruption.
 &HT;    When antigay picketers held up ``God Hates Fags'' signs at
Shepard's funeral they did not represent only the contemporary
religious right. Rather, they embodied a history of horror directed
against homosexuals by the church -- part of a western society's
collective inheritance.
 &HT;    Not every Christian, of course, is homophobic. Rather, all
Christians -- and nearly all Americans -- are influenced by antigay
biblical interpretations. As one professor noted regarding a course
she taught, ``Almost every student described feeling fearful and
uncomfortable about talking to gays and lesbians.''
 &HT;    Students far from the religious right -- such as those in her
liberal classroom -- still snicker about ``the sin that knows no
name.''
 &HT;    Some of my gay and lesbian friends struggle with this heritage.
As Christians, they honor the Bible, trying to live as God would
have them. As homosexual people, they feel the weight of tradition
against them.
 &HT;    The struggle? To believe in a God whose people reviled and
persecuted them.
 &HT;    Of course, others have suffered similar biblical fates.
African-Americans were told the Bible cursed them to be slaves;
women were taught their intrinsic inferiority and wifely
submission; Jews became demonic ``Christ- killers.''
 &HT;    In each case, Christianity developed elaborate theological
systems based on a few biblical texts to keep people subject to the
cultural status quo and male authority.
 &HT;    Powerful though they were, these interpretations are just that:
interpretations. Gay Christians know they have been oppressed by
what people have said about the Bible -- not the Bible. It presents
a different message -- that of a loving God.
 &HT;    The straight community often fails to recognize the difference
between the text and interpretation. Instead, heterosexual
Christians enshrined their prejudices as ``biblical'' and reading
into the Bible ideas not contained therein.
 &HT;    For example, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah is not -- as
commonly believed -- about homosexuality. It is about inhospitality
and violence. English mistranslations aside, the Bible never
actually uses the word ``homosexual.''
 &HT;    The Bible does not condemn what we know as homosexuality --
especially if a monogamous partnership. Tradition does, but most
Christians do not believe tradition infallible. Thus, rejecting bad
tradition in favor of biblical fidelity should be a compelling task
for believers.
 &HT;    Since the 19th century, many Christians have used biblical
criticism to keep the church from misinterpreting its scripture. As
a result, biblical arguments no longer justify slavery. Sermons no
longer identify Jews as the cursed children of Cain. Churches admit
women to full participation in ministry, not some second-class
status.
 &HT;    At some point in history, however, Christians believed these
offensive things -- as many still believe that homosexuality is an
``abomination'' against the Lord.
 &HT;    Homophobia is so pervasive that even those victimized by similar
biblical interpretations fail to recognize it. Only in the last two
decades have churches seriously engaged these issues. This has been
a slow, painful process -- not unlike the arguments surrounding
slavery and women's rights.
 &HT;    One day, as did abolitionism and feminism, the argument for full
inclusion of homosexuals in church and society will win. We will
look back and wonder why it was so hard to see gays and lesbians as
people -- not sinners.
 &HT;    For Matthew Shepard, however, the day did not come soon enough.
His broken body, hung as Jesus on the cross, gives the rest of us
courage to bear the pain of change.

LOOKING FOR REDEMPTION ON BOSNIA'S KILLING FIELDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 { Stars

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Guy (Dennis Quaid) is a dead-to-the-world
mercenary soldier, fighting for the Serbs in Bosnia, killing
whoever moves into the scope of his rifle. It's a long, hard fall
for a man who was once a devoted husband and father, but then, Guy
no longer enjoys those family ties. His wife (Nastassja Kinski) and
son were killed when terrorists bombed a Parisian cafe, a place he
had left only moments before.
</P>
<P>
   That's the setup of ``Savior,'' a straightforward telling of one
man's redemption in the face of the horrors of war. The film, while
often gripping and emotionally involving, suffers somewhat from
blurry plot distinctions and an unwillingness to probe more deeply
into the psyche of its protagonist. While ``Savior'' certainly
works on a rudimentary level, it could have been a better movie,
especially considering it was made by acclaimed Serbian director
Peter Antonijevic.
</P>
<P>
   Following his family's senseless murder and his own brutal
response of vengeance, Guy joins the Foreign Legion and spends six
years drifting from one battlefield to the next. He's spiritually
dead and emotionally numb, a condition that only worsens when he
arrives in Bosnia and is able to satisfy his hatred for Muslims by
killing as part of a day's work.
</P>
<P>
   One day, during a prisoner exchange, Guy and his mercenary
partner pick up a pregnant woman, Vera (Natasa Ninkovic), about to
give birth. The other soldier stands over Vera, ready to shoot the
baby once it leaves the womb. Guy, who has seen and inflicted a lot
of brutality in his time, simply cannot watch this and kills his
partner. This act of humanity has its consequences though, as Guy
must now deal with the mother and child, not to mention his
reawakened feelings of compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Quaid delivers his best performance in years as a man reclaiming
his life after years of emotional devastation. Yugoslavian newcomer
Ninkovic also shines in a moving portrayal of the suicidal mother
who finds in her child a reason to live. Stellan Skarsgard is also
on hand as Guy's best friend in the Foreign Legion.
</P>
<P>
   Director Antonijevic filmed ``Savior'' entirely in Serbia, and
he manages to capture an eerie beauty in the war-torn landscape.
But Antonijevic, working from a script by Robert Orr (who traveled
throughout Bosnia and Croatia during the Yugoslavian conflict
working as a photographer's assistant), wants to transcend his
locales and give some universal meaning to his movie. But in doing
so, he loses the kind of specific details that would have made
``Savior'' more interesting and involving.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers also confuse things by not adequately explaining
allegiances or giving any kind of context to the country or the
conflicts. While this is not fatal to one's enjoyment of
``Savior,'' it does dilute the impact of the film's story and the
lessons it means to impart, lessons, sad to say, factions in the
former Yugoslavian region continue to ignore to this day.

`RUGRATS' OFFERS BIG-SCREEN FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by SLANG partners -- Attn: Liz Smilor) 
OUR RATING: 2 { Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you're old enough to read this review or have
no abiding interest in talking babies and their bodily functions,
``The Rugrats Movie'' probably doesn't have much to offer you. Fans
of the Nickelodeon television series, though, undoubtedly will
enjoy this quick-paced, brightly colored big-screen romp that takes
the Rugrats out of their everyday world and plops them into a vast
forest for some scary adventures and fun.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's story (written by ``Rugrats'' TV series head writers
David N. Weiss and J. David Stem) has a few clever touches,
including spoofs of wacky birthing techniques and hospital
bureaucracy. There's even a nifty homage to the opening,
boulder-rolling sequence in ``Raiders of the Lost Ark.'' But
mostly, ``The Rugrats Movie'' exists to give extended time to the
familiar faces of Tommy, Chuckie and Angelica, the talking babies
who see life from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   The big news among the babies is that they're going to have a
new playmate soon. Tommy's mother, Didi Pickles, is pregnant and
due to go to the ``hop-sickle'' any day now. When the baby arrives
(he's named Dil, as in Dil Pickles, an example of the film's
cutesy-pie tone), he gives Tommy more grief than gladness with his
constant crying and cravings for attention. Maybe having a brother
isn't all it's cracked up to be, Tommy thinks.
</P>
<P>
   That leads Tommy and his fearful friend Chuckie and babies Phil
and Lil to conclude that they need to return Baby Dil to the
``hop-sickle'' because he's too much bother, even for a brother.
They put Dil in one of his father's goofball inventions, the Reptar
Wagon (sort of a souped-up baby carriage), but lose their way and
ultimately end up in a dark and spooky forest where they must
contend with waterfalls, escaped circus monkeys and a ferocious
wolf.
</P>
<P>
   The bratty Angelica, with Tommy's faithful dog Spike in tow (or
is it the other way around?), goes in search of the gang _ not out
of a sense of altruism, but because Dil took her favorite doll and
she wants it back.
</P>
<P>
   Kids will love all the adventure, although, at the screening I
attended, a few younger tots cried during intense scenes involving
the wolf. Adults, however, might find themselves checking their
watches. The movie doesn't have the sophistication or smarts of a
typical Disney animated film, and no attempt is made to broaden the
Rugrats' appeal to the uninitiated.
</P>
<P>
   All of which won't matter a whit to the youngsters who will have
this movie memorized line for line once it arrives on video in a
few months. For this set, there are no sour ``pickles,'' just the
sweet and delicious knowledge that somebody has made a movie that
they can claim as their own.

SMITH, HACKMAN SHINE IN `ENEMY OF THE STATE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 { Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Coming as it does from director Tony Scott
(``Crimson Tide,'' ``The Last Boy Scout'') and producer Jerry
Bruckheimer (``Armageddon,'' ``Con Air,'' ``The Rock,'' etc.,
etc.), you know ``Enemy of the State'' is going to move fast and
have lots of bells and whistles clanging in your ear.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasant surprise here is that the movie also has a modicum
of intelligence, not to mention great star turns from Will Smith
and Gene Hackman and an array of wonderful performances from a
perfectly chosen supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences put off by Bruckheimer's recent deafening forays into
testosterone-fueled worlds will be pleasantly surprised by how much
he and cohort Scott (the two previously have made four
brain-rattling movies together, including ``Top Gun,'' ``Days of
Thunder'' and ``Beverly Hills Cop II'') have toned down their macho
posing to create an engaging and timely thrill ride into high-tech
surveillance and government paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' opens with an arresting montage of shots
showing how surveillance cameras have thoroughly blanketed our
land. They (whoever they are) watch us while we drive our cars on
the freeways, take our money out of the bank and buy a six-pack at
the local convenience store. All of this vigilant scrutiny is
supposed to be for our good; however, as this movie so ably
demonstrates, Big Brother isn't always content to simply peek
through the window. Sometimes, he wants to bust down the door, too.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Robert Clayton Dean (Smith) learns this the hard way
when he accidentally comes into possession of a videotape that
shows National Security Agency administrator Thomas Reynolds (Jon
Voight) doing a very bad thing. Reynolds employs a band of NSA
renegade geeks (Jamie Kennedy, Jack Black and Barry Pepper among
them) to ruin Dean's life and discredit him before he can take the
tape to the proper authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Faster than you can say ``your credit card has been canceled,''
Dean endures a string of catastrophes that would make even Job's
head spin. He loses his job at the law firm and then his wife
(Regina King) after she sees incriminating photos taken of Dean
with his old girlfriend (and now professional confidante) Rachel
(Lisa Bonet).
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers print scandalous stories, and his clothes are
implanted with electronic tracking devices. Every sound he utters
is overheard, and every movement he makes is followed by government
spy satellites _ and Dean is not even sure why because he doesn't
know he has the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel eventually leads Dean to a surly former NSA agent, Brill
(Gene Hackman), who reluctantly helps the beleaguered lawyer fight
fire with fire. At this point, the film turns into a fairly
conventional thriller, but Scott's lightning-quick direction keeps
things moving briskly, and David Marconi's smart script saves the
best surprise for the crowd-pleasing finale.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, asked to carry a film for the first time, delivers a
stirring performance as the put-upon Everyman, effortlessly
radiating charisma and strength throughout the picture. Hackman,
who doesn't appear until the film's one-hour mark, makes a strong
impression, too. His bickering repartee with Smith recalls the best
moments of the Smith-Tommy Lee Jones teaming of ``Men in Black.''
</P>
<P>
   With its emphasis on government conspiracies and societal
paranoia, ``Enemy of the State'' summons memories of '70s suspense
thrillers such as ``Three Days of the Condor,'' ``The Parallax
View'' and, noting the Hackman presence, Francis Ford Coppola's
classic, ``The Conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   This movie isn't as concerned with making any grand, sweeping
statements about the nature of privacy, though. It's a popcorn
picture, pure and simple, albeit one with a kernel of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a wonderful thing, given that ``Enemy of the State''
might just be the most flat-out entertaining movie of the year.
Filled to the brim with exciting action (Watch Will hang from a
building! See Will run through a tunnel in his underwear!) and
eye-catching supporting turns (Tom Sizemore, Gabriel Byrne and an
unbilled Jason Robards among them), this is a movie that aims to
please, and does so again and again and again.

LIKABLE BUGS FIGHT UPHILL BATTLE

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``A Bug's Life,'' Disney and Pixar's
computer-animated follow-up to ``Toy Story,'' has a lot going for
it. The movie bursts with eye-popping colors, dazzling animation,
uproarious action and an array of funny, fast-talking insect
characters.
</P>
<P>
   So why does it feel like something of a disappointment? Two
reasons: First, it's not nearly as good as ``Toy Story,'' which had
a much better story, not to mention a couple of winning musical set
pieces from composer Randy Newman. Second, coming on the heels of
DreamWorks' enjoyable ``Antz,'' ``A Bug's Life'' has a certain
been-there, done-that quality to it. That's not to say it isn't a
fine movie. It simply fails to live up to some pretty high
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas ``Antz'' was basically a neurotic Woody Allen movie set
inside an ant hill, ``A Bug's Life'' keeps its story firmly rooted
in the Disney family tradition. A hero who believes he's never
going to make a difference joins forces with a princess (with her
own set of self-doubts) to combat evil forces intent on limiting
them from being all that they can be. Only, since this is a Disney
cartoon (by way of Aesop), the heroes are ants (lavender ones, at
that) and the bad guys are grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Flik is the hero ant, an original thinker whose creative ideas
often put him at odds with the rest of the conformers in his
colony. The queen ant (voiced by Phyllis Diller) and her princess
daughter (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) run the colony the best they can,
but are handicapped by the extortionist tactics of a marauding
group of grasshoppers who demand a hefty portion of the ants'
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   When Flik messes up the agreement, the head grasshopper (voiced
by a fiendishly menacing Kevin Spacey) demands even more food _ or
else there's going to be a pile of eight-legged arachnids pushing
up dirt in the colony's graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   The hapless Flik, hoping to find some warrior bugs for
protection, mistakenly enlists a rag-tag group of flea circus
performers, who turn out to be the most interesting characters in
the movie. There's a walking-stick clown, a praying-mantis
magician, a male ladybug trying to get in touch with his feminine
side, a couple of Hungarian sow bugs and a roly-poly German
caterpillar. They're all delighted to go to the colony with Flik
until they learn the real reason he brought them there. These bugs
are lovers, not fighters. Somehow, though, you know they'll find a
way to help.
</P>
<P>
   Pixar's John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton direct ``A Bug's Life''
and, along with their talented group of artists, they have
effectively imagined the insects' surroundings and how things like
wind, sun and rain affect their precarious existence. But while the
look of the film and the quality of the animation are
state-of-the-art, ``A Bug's Life'' lacks the cinematic set pieces
that made ``Antz'' such a visual treat. It's like everybody was so
swept up in envisioning this small world that nobody bothered to
think big.
</P>
<P>
   The film's story is never fully realized, either. Scenes inside
the colony aren't very interesting and the ants themselves become
tedious after awhile. Flik, annoying to his own species, doesn't
rate high on my list, either. A more endearing hero would have
helped.
</P>
<P>
   When the circus ants are on the screen, though, the movie's pace
turns fast and furious _ almost too fast. (Stick around for the end
credits for some of the best bits, which come in the form of the
kind of outtakes usually reserved for a Burt Reynolds movie.)
</P>
<P>
   I feel like I need to see some scenes a second time to fully
absorb all the action and one-liners. I'm sure that's part of the
design. Repeat viewings of these films are encouraged; that's why
videos (specially priced to take home) exist, after all.
Unfortunately (and this certainly wasn't the case with ``Toy
Story''), once was enough for this film.

BLOCKBUSTERS AND BABIES

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Getting people to buy millions of records,
millions more movie tickets and watch a middling network sitcom for
six years was relatively easy.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time for Will Smith to tackle the hard stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about when you have two kids: That's when
you're really a parent,'' says the 30-year-old superstar, who
welcomed his second son in July. ``There's a whole other dynamic, a
whole other interaction, a whole other level of democratic
dexterity that you have to have to deal with more than when you
have one child.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Smith is finessing the increased fatherhood challenge
with the same deceptively effortless aplomb that has made him a
multimedia phenomenon. The new baby, Jaden _ his first with
actress-wife Jada Pinkett Smith _ has so far won the indulgence of
Willard III (called Trey), the 5-year-old from Smith's first
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves being a big brother more than he loves having a
little brother; he loves the title of big brother,'' Smith
observes. ``The thing that concerns me now, having two boys, is not
turning into that crazy father who's always on the sidelines
yelling, `Don't listen to that coach! Do what I told you'!''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is joking on the square about the overachiever's drive
that's as big a factor in his success as his megawatt smile and
disarmingly big, goofy ears. That competitive urge has impelled
Smith to expand his screen image _ after comic/heroic turns in
consecutive blockbusters ``Bad Boys,'' ``Independence Day'' and
``Men in Black'' _ with his new movie, ``Enemy of the State.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows that, theoretically, this could be a hard sell. But
like everything Will Smith attempts, he approached it with more
confidence than doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no superhero activity going on in this film,'' he says
of ``Enemy,'' which is nonetheless a paranoid chase thriller.
``This is more along the lines of `Six Degrees of Separation,' with
a couple of mainstream explosions to make the trailer look good.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 ``Six Degrees,'' based on John Guare's acclaimed play,
showcased Smith's acting range and depth years before his
movie-star power was established. Playing a facile con man who
charmed and swindled gullible, wealthy New Yorkers, Smith proved he
could be a lot more than the Fresh Prince.
</P>
<P>
   But that film was not widely seen, and the vast majority of
people only know Smith as the bubble-gum rapper and personable star
of TV's ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air,'' and as his later, wisecracking
movie-hero incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State's'' Robert Clayton Dean character retains
some of Smith's funny/formidable characteristics, but he's overall
a more sober, troubled character. You would be, too, if a rogue
operation within the ultra-secret National Security Agency had
targeted you for destruction and was employing every modern,
high-tech surveillance system at its disposal to hunt you down and
ruin your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a real, regular guy,'' Smith insists. ``He's not
standing in the face of danger with his chest poked out. There's
definitely a wider emotional range than people are used to seeing
from me.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers had no doubts that Smith could pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will and Gene (Hackman, who co-stars in ``Enemy'') were always
my first choices for this film,'' says director Tony Scott (``Top
Gun,'' ``Crimson Tide''). ``Will, I thought, was perfect for this
role because he is what you see here. He is the sweetest, most
affable being on two legs, and the role was this sweet guy who gets
his life destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will has never done a picture like this before,'' adds
producer Jerry Bruckheimer (``Bad Boys,'' ``Armageddon''). `` `Six
Degrees of Separation' was a much more serious movie, but in this
picture he has to play a real character. He doesn't have the
comfort of falling back on jokes and one-liners _ he's got to be
real. It sheds a whole new light on his career, which is great.''
</P>
<P>
   By design _ and a little luck _ Smith's career has long been an
exercise in finding a flattering new light to shine on it. The
rapping made him a high school star back home in Philadelphia years
before the multiplatinum, Grammy-winning recordings with his friend
Jeff Townes (a k a DJ Jazzy Jeff).
</P>
<P>
   Like many rap acts, though, Fresh and Jazzy went out of style
almost as quickly as they became national sensations. But Quincy
Jones had caught Smith's act _ and, just in time to rescue him from
bankrupt obscurity, gave the charismatic but untrained actor a
tryout on the ``Bel Air'' sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Smith proved a natural. Yet even in the wake of
massive film stardom _ ``Independence Day'' is one of the
top-grossing films of all time, and ``Men in Black'' made an
eye-popping $572 million worldwide _ Smith felt it was important to
return to his musical beginnings. The result, his first solo album,
``Big Willie Style,'' released a year ago, generated such hits as
the touching father/son sampling of ``Just the Two of Us,'' and the
cultural touchstone ``Gettin' Jiggy Wit It.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eclecticism is a virtue,'' Smith says in exaggerated, dulcet
tones. ``But I get a little concerned about people's expectations
from me _ and if I don't live up to them, then being disappointed.
But I just want to do the best work that I can, keep my head clear
and not worry about how much money it makes.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, there is noticeable pride in claiming the two
highest-grossing summer movies of the last three years. Indeed,
Smith's next release, a Western-espionage-action-effects-comedy
based on the '60s TV series ``The Wild, Wild West,'' has already
been scheduled for a July 4, 1999, holiday release _ the same date
Smith conquered with ``Independence'' in 1996 and ``Men'' in '97.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a piece of me that likes to say, `July 4 is my day,' I
dare you to stick another movie there,'' he exults.
</P>
<P>
   It's something to be proud _ even a little egotistical _ about.
All the more so since Smith is the first African-American actor
since Eddie Murphy who can claim such across-the-board popularity.
</P>
<P>
   That's one accomplishment, though, which he finds a little hard
to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uncomfortable, sometimes, because there are so few
successful black actors in comparison to successful Caucasian
actors,'' he says. ``So few that every move you make is `a step for
your people.' It's like, wow, that's a bit much. I try not to think
about it. My only real litmus test is, `Will my mother be
embarrassed by the work I do?' As long as Mom and my family aren't
embarrassed, then it generally works out for my people also.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Smith hopes to play the most iconic of role models,
Muhammad Ali, in his next film project.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's going to happen, it needs to happen fairly soon,''
Smith says of playing the outrageously articulate, now tragically
impaired boxing legend. ``At this point in my life and where my
body naturally wants to be is perfectly in the middle to lose
weight and play Ali young and go up to 210 or 215 to play him a
little older. Now is optimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not right now. After finishing post-production special
effects work on ``Wild West'' in a few weeks, Smith plans to spend
several months just ``changing diapers and heating up bottles.''
Family, he makes it very clear, is as important to him as stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting married didn't really change anything in our
relationship,'' he says of longtime sweetheart Pinkett, with whom
he tied the knot last New Year's Eve. ``Spiritually, we had already
committed our lives to one another before that. It's so important
to be friends, beyond being just in love and thinking each other is
sexy. We were so comfortable that we weren't even going to have a
ceremony, but her mom was not having that!
</P>
<P>
   ``No, this is the life that I've always dreamed of. I wanted to
be married and have kids at, like, 16. There were four of us in the
house when I grew up, and I always loved that family interaction.
So I've just been dying to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as his celebrity has skyrocketed and continues to expand,
Smith remains well aware that there are more precious things in
life. And that's what gives him the strength to tackle the
ever-harder new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to depend on yourself, learn not to let your
successes go to your head or your failures go to your heart,'' he
reckons. ``I don't know how someone can survive this type of
success without ever having any stable life experience. Hollywood
can eat you alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can take it.''

A LOT OF TALENT SQUANDERED IN `CELEBRITY'

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Woody Allen aims at a big, obvious target _
America's obsession with fame _ and mostly makes broad, obvious
hits in his latest grouchy comedy, ``Celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Shot in black-and-white (by Sven Nykvist, no less) and episodic
even for an Allen film, it's both tepid and mean-spirited. That
makes it kind of a pale mirror image to Allen's last feature, the
laceratingly angry, bold and exhilaratingly complicated
``Deconstructing Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not an exact, if drabbed down, reflection. Allen stays
behind the camera for this one, and recruited the younger Kenneth
Branagh to be his neurotic, womanizing stand-in. While this is
something of a mercy, considering that the character romances the
tender likes of Winona Ryder, Charlize Theron and even Melanie
Griffith, there's nothing merciful about watching the
self-regarding Shakespearean sputter his way through an Allen
impersonation that's all twitch and stammer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Woody is too old for the young leading ladies he favors.
But he's nonetheless the only one who can do a tolerable Woodman.
</P>
<P>
   Branagh's Lee Simon is a Manhattan entertainment journalist who
gets a ruinous case of midlife cris-itis when a flighty movie star
(Griffith) bestows a quickie during an interview lull.
</P>
<P>
   In no time, he's left his schoolteacher wife, Robin (Allen
favorite Judy Davis), taken up with a publishing professional
(Famke Janssen) who's both too good for him and for him to
appreciate, and in hot pursuit of the twin chimeras of dangerous
beauties (Theron's easily distracted supermodel, Ryder's teasingly
noncommittal bohemian) and selling a screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   The film's funniest 10 minutes _ and an object lesson in why the
hottest actors on the planet drop everything to work with Allen for
scale _ involve Lee's extended pitch meeting with a misbehaving
movie star played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Uproariously lampooning
every dark speculation that's been made about his ``King of the
World'' lifestyle, Leo abuses a girlfriend, trashes hotel rooms,
maintains an entourage, gambles away fortunes and conducts orgies,
all the while making narcissistic story suggestions to the
desperate Lee.
</P>
<P>
   It's great stuff, and there are spatterings of similar satiric
brilliance elsewhere in the film. But the overall picture is
lazier. Allen leans heavily on cheap sex jokes and the
less-than-urgent notion that our media-drenched society devalues
real humanity.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, there is a bit more complexity in Robin's case.
Devastated by Lee's abandonment, she dithers her way into a
relationship with a pretty nice and enormously patient tabloid TV
producer (Joe Mantegna). But while their affair may bring Robin
long-delayed personal fulfillment, it also leads to a broadcast
job, which turns her into one of those on-air personalities whose
superficiality is matched only by their cluelessness.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think Davis, who was so ferocious, vulnerable and
hilarious for Allen in ``Husbands and Wives'' and ``Deconstructing
Harry,'' could turn Robin into another real force of insecure,
guilt-choked nature. But her performance is surprisingly
uninvolving _ not because she doesn't try, but because Allen has
her waste too much time on lame routines about plastic surgery and
fruit-based sex technique instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, there's a sour quality to ``Celebrity's''
humor. That's nothing new for Allen; he was first roundly
criticized for it in the 1980 ``Stardust Memories,'' another media
satire that, in retrospect, leavened its misanthropy with smarter,
more daring comic invention than what's displayed here.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, ``Stardust'' was the film in which fans of Allen's
autobiographical character told him they preferred his ``earlier,
funny ones.'' Compared to ``Celebrity,'' that movie was one of
them.

`DANCING' MISSES SOME STEPS ON SCREEN

OUR RATING: 3 Stars

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Redeemed by uniformly moving performances,
``Dancing at Lughnasa'' nonetheless seems far less stirring as a
movie than it did on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps both the expansiveness of the Irish countryside and the
close-up intimacy of the camera work puts Brian Friel's Tony
Award-winning insights into their proper, not-as-illuminating
perspective. Then again, it may have something to do with the
film's director, Pat O'Connor, whose approach tends toward the
plodding.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor has a thing for memory pieces _ his last two features
were the '50s period ``Circle of Friends'' and ``Inventing the
Abbotts'' _ and ``Lughnasa'' starts right up with a tremulous
voiceover about ``the year when everything changed.'' We're alerted
that everything we're about to see will be filtered through a veil
of nostalgic melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   That year is 1936, the location rural Donegal, and the narrator
Michael Mundy, who was 8 at the time. Played well and without fuss
by Darrell Johnston, young Michael is the only male in a houseful
of women.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the first thing that changes. The spinster Mundy
sisters _ humorless schoolmarm Kate (Meryl Streep), Michael's
sensual mom Christina (``Dangerous Beauty's'' Catherine McCormack),
fun-loving Maggie (Kathy Burke, Queen Mary in the current
``Elizabeth''), slightly retarded Rose (Sophie Thompson, Emma's
sis) and quiet, dependable Agnes (Brid Brennan, the only holdover
from the Broadway cast) _ are all excited about their brother the
priest's return from decades of missionary work in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   When Father Jack (Michael Gambon) steps off the bus, however,
he's distracted and disoriented. Apparently having suffered a
nervous breakdown, he also seems to have traded his Catholic
beliefs for tribal mysticism. This amuses most of the sisters but
appalls straight-laced Kate, who's embarrassed enough by her other
siblings' sinful or silly ways.
</P>
<P>
   Kate is further mortified when Michael's charming absentee
father, Gerry (Rhys Ifans), pays a visit on his way to fight the
fascists in Spain. She insists that he sleep in the barn; she fails
to prevent Christina from joining him. Worse, the ancient pagan
harvest celebration of Lughnasa is coming around again, and her
sisters' civilized Christian veneers seem to be collapsing in
Celtic anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to fret about, like how the poor Mundys are going
to survive in the face of dire economic changes. To underline all
the quiet desperation, there's implicit criticism of the Catholic
Church, which is set up as the main force responsible for
repressing the sisters' natural exuberance. Mostly, though, the
movie reinforces the old standby that family beats anything else,
even if you usually can't stand your relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Streep does another impeccable accent job as the domineering
Kate, who'd be insufferable if she weren't undergoing humanizing
self-doubts for what could well be the first time in her bottled-up
life. Thompson stands out among the other women; her Rose may be a
dope, but her tentative determination to get more out of life makes
her weirdly, poignantly heroic.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, though, for a story about female endurance, Father Jack
is the most memorable character. Gambon invests this holy fool with
a transcendent serenity that, though clearly a form of madness,
looks far preferable to the sensible, dreary lives his sisters must
accept.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, being women, they don't have quite the opportunity,
in that time and place, for such self-indulgent bliss; the biggest
thrill they can expect is good reception on that newfangled radio
contraption. When the climactic, title dance breaks out, the joy it
represents is so obviously brief it's heartbreaking.

`WAKING NED DEVINE' A WINNING TICKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Accept the fact that the British film industry
will go down in the cloying quicksand of post-``Full Monty'' whimsy
for the foreseeable future. But be encouraged that something as
genuinely likable as ``Waking Ned Devine'' already has emerged from
the muck.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by English commercials wiz Kirk Jones, set
in Ireland and filmed on the Isle of Man, the movie takes cues not
just from the current cycle of heartwarming little-guy comedies,
but also from the classic Scottish community farces ``Tight Little
Island'' and ``Local Hero.'' It has charm to burn, something to say
and even an anti-moralistic subversive streak.
</P>
<P>
   And it has old guys riding motorcycles naked. Doesn't anybody
wear clothes in that part of the world?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ned Devine's'' most pleasing elements are the personalities
inside those well-worn birthday suits. Ian Bannen, 70, and David
Kelly, 69, turn in a highly appealing buddy act as two incorrigible
old schemers whose generosity of spirit is matched only by their
greedy ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   Congenitally naughty Jackie O'Shea (Bannen) and beanpole-thin
Michael O'Sullivan (Kelly) have been pals all their lives.
Considering that time span was spent entirely in an isolated
seaside town, Tully More, with a population of 52, there wasn't
much choice in the matter. Still, Jackie and Michael are clearly
choosy about the company they keep. When they find out one of their
neighbors has won the national lottery, they make like best friends
to all, hoping the winner will prove generous to his mates.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the local pig farmer (James Nesbitt) whose true love
(Susan Lynch) can't stand how he smells? Or is it the postmistress?
The publican? The crabby Lizzy Quinn? No one's copping to a big
windfall, but Jackie continues blowing what little money he has on
buying rounds and hosting chicken dinners for the whole community.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone, that is, except Ned Devine. The old fisherman
hasn't been seen in days. Jackie discovers what's happened to Ned,
and it's problematic. He then must enlist his skeptical wife, Annie
(Fionnula Flanagan), then Michael, then ... Well, things get mighty
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Bannen, whom you may remember wearing ``Braveheart'' war paint,
and Kelly, who's probably best known for playing the incompetent
carpenter on John Cleese's ``Fawlty Towers'' Britcom, create a
marvelously convincing rapport. They quickly make it understood
that Jackie's gotten Michael into trouble throughout their lives,
and Michael has never found anything better to do than come back
for more. Flanagan makes Annie a perfect third wheel, always wary
of her husband's shenanigans (she worries more about Michael's than
shrewd Jackie's fate should they get busted), yet avaricious enough
to happily help them along.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, these three whitehairs come at us bearing a full
complement of vitality and passion. Yet they're mature imps;
experience governs their every move. When real decisions have to be
made, real people make them. Neither cartoonishly cute nor grumpy
old geezers, their mischievousness masks genuine wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Amusing as these mild Irish rogues may be, ``Ned'' boasts more
than character and caper humor. It laughs in the face of the
cherished movie convention that the sudden promise of big, unearned
bucks can only lead to ruinous consequences (like we'll see next
month in ``Little Voice'' and ``A Simple Plan''). While it doesn't
say greed is good, ``Ned'' is happy to raise a pint to the
proposition that more money can definitely be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   A thing so good, it can actually bring the closest of friends
and communities closer together. If British cinema has to exploit a
winning concept to death, may it continue to do so with the eminent
good sense and cheer displayed by ``Waking Ned Devine.''

JACKSON POLLOCK: A GREAT ARTIST FOR OUR TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID BONETTI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1949, Life magazine published a story
provocatively titled, ``Jackson Pollock: Is he the greatest living
painter in the United States?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackson Pollock,'' at the Museum of Modern Art through Feb. 2,
updates that question, implicitly asking whether Pollock
(1912-1956) is the greatest American painter of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which travels to London after it closes here,
has a lot riding on it. It is the first full-fledged Pollock
retrospective since 1967, and because of the relative rarity of his
work and its ever-rising prices, it is likely to be the last for
probably at least as long a period of time.
</P>
<P>
   To say it is the show of the year is to undervalue its
importance. It is impeccably organized by Kirk Varnedoe, whose
lucid catalog essay is rooted in a sketch of Pollock's life with
full discussion of his work and a history of its critical reception
and influences. Exercising its considerable power, MoMA was able to
borrow virtually everything it wanted, including paintings seldom
seen in public, so museum visitors can make informed judgments
about Pollock's status.
</P>
<P>
   Most viewers, however, will be satisfied merely to indulge in
the unprecedented beauty Pollock created in a few years circa 1950.
</P>
<P>
   To say the show is exciting is to understate its effect. There's
a scene in the movie ``12 Monkeys'' in which Bruce Willis is
reveling in his first encounters with the real world. As Fats
Domino's ``Blueberry Hill'' plays on a car radio, Willis screams,
``I love the music of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a space in the exhibition, where Pollock's three great
mural-scale ``drip'' masterpieces from 1950 hang together, where I
had to restrain myself from similarly screaming, ``I love the
painting of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   And as much as I do love 20th century painting, I have to admit
I don't get such an urge very often.
</P>
<P>
   But MoMA also took a risk by showing Pollock now. The question
that hovers over the exhibition about Pollock's greatness would
have been answered 25 years ago with a simple, ``Of course _ who
else?''
</P>
<P>
   Between then and now, there have been developments in the way
art is thought about and thus seen that have raised questions about
Pollock's achievement.
</P>
<P>
   A whole body of criticism sees Pollock's painting and that of
the entire abstract expressionist generation as having been used by
the State Department in Europe to advertise democratic freedom of
expression in contrast to Soviet repression. In addition, a crisis
surrounding painting in general was created by feminist critics who
dismiss painting as a male-identified medium and other theorists
who promoted concepts such as the ``death of the author'' _ not to
mention the rise and apparent triumph of camera-based arts.
</P>
<P>
   To many involved in the liveliest arts of the past
quarter-century, being the greatest American painter of the 20th
century is not quite the achievement earlier generations would have
understood it to be.
</P>
<P>
   But whether because good art, whatever its medium, always
eventually trumps theory or because we're now looking freshly at
painting again, Pollock's art here looks vital and thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all his paintings are equal. Like most members of
his artistic generation _ the misfits out of the Western plains,
homegrown dandies and striving immigrants from the Netherlands,
Germany, Russia and Armenia who propelled New York painting to the
forefront of world culture during World War II _ Pollock was
self-invented and went through a long and tormented apprenticeship.
</P>
<P>
   MoMA began buying his works when they were brand new, and
Pollock was being anointed the painter of his generation even
before he had figured out who he was. When Life asked its question,
Pollock hadn't yet made his masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are early works that grab your imagination and
won't let go. The tiny self-portrait he painted some time between
1931 and 1935, for instance, is haunting. Those deep, brooding eyes
that pull you in recur in later works, buried beneath whorls of
poured and dripped paint, and they hint at the unspoken anguish
that eventually led Pollock to a violent grave as well as to an
untopped, untoppable peak of personal creativity.
</P>
<P>
   And his late work is all too often tragically inept. Pollock
made relatively few pieces during the five-year bender he embarked
upon after Hans Namuth shot his famous film of the artist, a bender
that ended only with his death in a drunken automobile crash.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling that to repeat himself would be dishonest, Pollock
experimented by pouring black paint onto canvas, finding faces and
figures in the process _ a figurative recidivism he had previously
avoided. And in the few paintings, like ``Blue Poles,'' in which he
tried to create a lacy interweaving of poured and dribbled lines
characteristic of his classic drip paintings, he lost almost all
lightness and spontaneity, creating clogged compositions instead.
</P>
<P>
   In between, however, Pollock experienced an outpouring of
creative invention that is unequalled in American art. From 1946 to
the end of 1950, an astonishingly brief period, Pollock changed the
nature of painting and the status of American art.
</P>
<P>
   How he did it we'll never know, even with all the evidence
before our eyes. How he took several disparate influences _
including the regionalist painter Thomas Hart Benton and the
Mexican muralists who excited political artists during the 1930s
and '40s _ and put them together to create ``One: Number 31,
1950,'' ``Number 32, 1950'' and ``Autumn Rhythm: Number 30, 1950,''
the three great paintings that form the heart and soul of the
exhibition, will remain forever a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Such a feat reminds us that all creativity is essentially
unknowable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pollock invented a way of putting paint on a canvas surface that
served his purposes perfectly. He created vast veils of visual
activity, in which long, languorously applied lines were knitted
together with others violently thrown down and spattered.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Fields of energy caught in mid-action like a fly
caught in a fly trap. No one else captured so rightly the anxiety,
the fears, the hopes, the ecstasy of having survived the
mid-century chaos in which so many others perished. Today, they
look as if they had been just painted, but they also look like
relics of a far-off, never-to-be-lived-through-again time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (There is a $3 surcharge for the Pollock exhibition added to
normal Museum of Modern Art admission prices of $9.50 for adults;
$6.50 for students.)

`COLD STORAGE' OFFERS COMIC VITALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Expect more cool and edgy than warm and fuzzy
when you see a Ronald Ribman play.
</P>
<P>
   Take Ribman's 1976 ``Cold Storage,'' a comedy about death so
loftily cerebral that at times it seems to have been incubated on
Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Not that ``Cold Storage'' lacks humanity. In the Odyssey
Theatre's feisty new production, humanity in all its anguished
eccentricity practically oozes from the pores of Joseph Parmigian
(Len Lesser) and Richard Landau (Jeff Seymour), two patients who
strike up an unlikely friendship in the rooftop garden of a New
York City hospital.
</P>
<P>
   To first appearances, the men hail from separate universes.
Parmigian, a cranky, conspiratorially minded Armenian, runs a fruit
and vegetable stand. Landau, Jewish and prosperous, is an
investment adviser in fine art.
</P>
<P>
   What begins as wary small talk builds (at a rather dreamy pace)
to more rancorous, metaphysically resonant repartee, prompting a
good deal of uneasy laughter both on stage and from the audience.
Kevin Hunt's purposefully spare scenic design makes the men's
encounter appear to be taking place at some featureless cosmic
waystation.
</P>
<P>
   Parmigian, though confined to his wheelchair, plays the
interrogator, querying Landau about the seriousness of his illness
and the happiness of his personal life, while making caustic
observations about the hospital's slipshod management.
</P>
<P>
   Lesser's funny devil's advocacy keeps us guessing: Is Parmigian
taunting Landau, or is he simply curious? Cheerfully fatalistic or
rudely insinuating?
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, is the outwardly self-assured Landau calmly deceiving
himself about that nasty black spot on his X-ray?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Storage'' ultimately dodges the dramatic conflict between
its two main characters, sliding off in Act 2 into Landau's long,
guilt-ridden anecdotal admission involving a memory of the
Holocaust. Though the specter of mass annihilation raises the
play's humanistic stakes, the dramatic resolution Ribman supplies
is less than convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing an extra hat as director, the understated Seymour
doesn't always succeed in keeping Lesser's amusing banter from
accelerating into aggressive shtick. Some exchanges may remind you
of Archie Bunker and Meathead in one of their classic ``All in the
Family'' screaming matches.
</P>
<P>
   More distracting are Parmigian's long, simile-laden bouts of
circular philosophizing, along with cryptic allusions to dead male
poets. ``It's time to spread your filthy dream out in front of me
like a moth-eaten Moroccan carpet,'' he exhorts Landau in one
all-too-typical platitude.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Seymour, Lesser and Magda Rivera, who has a small part as a
nurse, have succeeded well in conveying Ribman's icily intelligent
humor. For all its intellectual noodling, ``Cold Storage'' is a
powerful piece of writing which insists that, against all odds, a
warm pulse still reverberates in this freezing, starlit void in
which  &UR;  &LR; we spin.

`GODS AND MONSTERS' DIRECTOR TO HOLD Q&AMP;A SESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For those of us on the outside looking into this
fish bowl called Hollywood, the movie mecca hasn't lost any of its
fascination from the days when gossip columnists Hedda Hopper and
Louella Parsons gave the inside dirt and heralded the next star.
Only today, thanks to the likes of Steven Spielberg and George
Lucas, directors command equal attention, too.
</P>
<P>
   Regent Westlake Theaters in Ventura County is hosting director
Bill Condon of ``Gods and Monsters'' at 8:15 tonight for a
screening and question-and-answer session afterward. Condon is
appearing as part of an occasional film forum that brings together
audiences and contemporary filmmakers for some all-too-rare
interaction between creators and consumers of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Condon was named best director at the recent Seattle Film
Festival International, and his ``Gods and Monsters'' is currently
playing in theaters. Its subject is famed director James Whale,
whose 1931 ``Frankenstein'' motion picture led to a series of
lesser imitations. ``Gods and Monsters'' stars Sir Ian McKellen,
Brendan Fraser (``George of the Jungle'') and Lynn Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the novel ``Father of Frankenstein,'' the film examines
the friendship between Whale and his handsome young gardener that
bears a strange resemblance to the one between Dr. Frankenstein and
his monster.
</P>
<P>
   Director Don Roos was a guest earlier this year at the forum
when his ``The Opposite of Sex'' screened at the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are $7. Call (818) 889-2388 or (805) 379-4100 for
information. The Regent Westlake Theaters are at 4711 Lakeview
Canyon Drive in Westlake Village.
</P>
<P>
   A WISE CHOICE: Robert Wise was a gifted film editor with a knack
for making great RKO films greater and B movies extraordinary, but
he wanted more. He wanted to direct.
</P>
<P>
   He got his chance in 1943, when the director of ``Curse of the
Cat People'' was replaced when the film fell behind schedule. Wise
took over the helm, ``Cat People'' was a success, and his
reputation grew from there.
</P>
<P>
   Wise, the Academy Award-winning director and producer of ``West
Side Story'' and the ``Sound of Music,'' is the guest of honor at
``An Evening With Robert Wise'' at 8 p.m. Dec. 2 at the Alex
Theatre in Glendale. Clips of his acclaimed films, which include
``The Set-Up,'' ``The Andromeda Strain,'' ``The Sand Pebbles'' and
``The Day the Earth Stood Still,'' will be shown, and Leonard
Maltin of ``Entertainment Tonight'' and the author of the popular
guide to film on video will interview Wise on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Wise was a then-27-year-old film editor who had worked his way
up from messenger boy at RKO when he was assigned to ``Citizen
Kane.'' His skill so impressed Orson Welles that the director told
the studio's bosses that he wanted Wise's talents on his next
project, ``The Magnificent Ambersons.'' Ironically, when the studio
ordered a recut without Welles, Wise directed the additional
footage.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets cost $10 and can purchased by calling (800) 233-3123.

TWO MORE REASONS TO THINK DVD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The DVD revolution is in full force. Prices on
players are dropping dramatically (some for under $300), and you'll
see a big sales push this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Besides much better picture and sound quality than VHS, DVDs
offer convenience (they take up less room and you can jump from
scene to scene without rewinding) and extras that are attractive to
film buffs.
</P>
<P>
   And since you'll need something to watch after you succumb to
the sales pressure and buy that player, here are a few titles of
note that have hit stores recently.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with two Oscar-winning best pictures _ ``Dances With
Wolves'' (Image Entertainment; $24.99) and ``West Side Story''
(MGM, $24.98).
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Costner's directorial debut has a certain old-fashioned
sweeping grandeur about it. ``Dances'' tells the story of a Union
officer (Costner) who is sent to a remote frontier outpost after
the Civil War, where he befriends a Lakota Indian tribe. The film
won seven Academy Awards and is filled with wonderful performances,
including those of Graham Greene, Rodney A. Grant and Mary
McDonnell, as well as rich visuals that benefit from DVD quality.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD offers commentary on the filming of the movie from
Costner and his producing partner, Jim Wilson. If you haven't seen
``Dances,'' watch it first and then you can follow along with
Costner and Wilson, who sat down nine years later to watch the film
and talk about about what they were doing in each scene. It's
actually quite interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Side Story'' also benefits from being on DVD. The
landmark musical, an updated version of ``Romeo and Juliet,''
contains an unforgettable score by Leonard Bernstein and explosive
ballet- and jazz-infused choreography by Jerome Robbins. The
direction, by Robbins and Robert Wise, is sometime clunky but often
brilliant, capturing the rhythm of the music and the New York City
streets. The colors jump out at you on the DVD format while the
classic score sizzles. Best Supporting Actress winner Rita Moreno
is superb, and numbers like ``America'' or ``The Jet Song'' haven't
cooled down in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 1962 political thriller ``The Manchurian Candidate'' (MGM,
$24.98) remains as provocative as ever. This DVD version includes a
short 1989 feature where the film's star, Frank Sinatra, sits down
with its director, John Frankenheimer, and screenwriter, George
Axelrod, to reminisce about the film. In it, Sinatra shows off his
pinky, which he broke while doing the ``first kung fu'' film fight.
The three also talk about how the audience didn't seem to notice
that Laurence Harvey was only one year younger in real life than
Angela Lansbury, who played his mother with such steely resolve.
The DVD also has a scene-by-scene commentary by Frankenheimer,
including his thoughts on the incestuous Lansbury-Harvey
relationship in the film.
</P>
<P>
   You won't confuse ``The Dirty Dozen'' (MGM, $24.98) with
``Saving Private Ryan.'' Unlike Spielberg's gritty World War II
film, ``Dozen'' is one of those old-fashioned flicks that examines
the dual themes of heroism and the tragedy of war. It's a familiar
enough story, with Maj. Reisman (Lee Marvin) leading an elite force
behind enemy lines to eliminate a stronghold of German officers the
night before the D-Day invasion. Instead of consisting of
top-flight fighters, however, the team is made up of 12 army
prisoners _ soldiers who have committed murder, rape or other
violent crimes. Each has been sentenced to death or lengthy terms
in prison, and volunteering for the mission is their only way out.
There are some marvelous performances _ playing a sociopath is
always fun for an actor _ including those of John Cassavetes, Telly
Savalas and Charles Bronson. The DVD includes an informative
10-minute behind-the-scenes ``making of'' special documentary and
the film's original trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Another war flick, ``A Bridge Too Far'' (MGM; $24.98) was
thought by many to be too long, but Richard Attenborough's
adaptation of Cornelius Ryan's book about a disastrous raid behind
German lines in Holland during World War II is worth watching. It
also looks at the absurdity of war while not overlooking the
sacrifices made by both civilians and soldiers. The ill-fated
mission was conceived by British Field Marshal Montgomery, who
air-dropped some 35,000 troops behind Nazi lines in order to
shorten the war. But the mission is riddled with bad decisions
(based on politics and vanities) and communications failures that
ultimately cost many men their lives. The all-star cast includes
Dirk Bogarde, James Caan, Sean Connery, Robert Redford, Gene
Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, Laurence Olivier and Liv Ullmann. The DVD
also has a behind-the-scenes ``making of'' documentary. &QL;

   For his first album in four years, the Grammy-winning Seal again
collaborates with producer Trevor Horn for a soulful and appealing
collection of elegant electro-tinged tunes. While there's nothing
here as immediately grabbing as the classy 1991 smash ``Crazy'' or
the award-winning ``Kiss From a Rose,'' there are warm nods to a
variety of styles, from techno-dance (``Latest Craze'') and sad
ballads (``Lost My Faith'') to acoustic tunes (``When a Man Is
Wrong'') and grand statements (``Human Beings''). Pleasant enough.

MARIAH CAREY/``1's'' (Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   This Christmas winner collects all of Carey's 13 chart-toppers,
from ``I Don't Wanna Cry'' to the amazing vocal performances of
``My All'' and ``Honey,'' plus four new cuts. It's a useful disc if
you're a Mariah fan and don't have all the albums or singles. Along
with the familiar romantic-ballad chart-busters, the track list
includes the megahit single version of ``Fantasy'' (featuring
rapper ODB) and a previously unreleased live version of ``Hero.''
The quartet of new cuts features ``When You Believe,'' a so-so duet
with Whitney Houston from DreamWorks' forthcoming ``The Prince of
Egypt,'' and ``Whenever You Call,'' a much better duet with Brian
McKnight. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JEWEL/``Spirit'' (Atlantic)
</P>
<P>
   A flower child who's apparently spent too much time in the
potting soil, Jewel is back with another wispy, wistful set of
lighter-than-air acoustic guitar-picked melodies and greeting-card
sentiments. It's 13 tracks of ``everything's gonna be OK,'' cut too
quickly as a follow-up to her 8 million-selling debut, ``Pieces of
You.'' The songs that stood out on that first disc, incidentally,
were co-written with veteran San Diego singer-composer Steve Poltz;
he's nowhere to be found on ``Spirit,'' and maybe Jewel should have
considered sharing the credit _ and some of the loot _ one more
time. Her band is solid, but the only tracks that have long-term
listening value here are ``Kiss the Flame,'' the first single
``Hands'' and ``Down So Long.'' The rest of these songs have as
much depth as a stick of gum. 2 { Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JIMMY SCOTT/``Holding Back the Years'' (Artists Only!)
</P>
<P>
   A half-century after he broke into the business with the Lionel
Hampton Orchestra, emotive crooner Scott lends his eerie,
penetrating voice to pop fare by the likes of John Lennon
(``Jealous Guy''), Elton John (``Sorry Seems to be the Hardest
Word''), Bryan Ferry (``Slave to Love'') and Elvis Costello
(``Almost Blue''), transforming each into a torchy gem. Other
highlights of this recommended jazz vocal collection include a
passionate reading of ``The Crying Game,'' from the 1992 film of
the same title, a poignant ``Nothing Compares 2 U'' by Prince, and
a remake of Scott's own bluesy hit from 1955, ``Don't Cry Baby.'' 3
{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
OFFSPRING/``Americana'' (Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   Fans of hits like ``Come Out and Play (Keep 'Em Separated)'' by
Orange County bashers Offspring will find much to enjoy in the
follow-up to the band's best-selling ``Ixnay on the Hombre'' disc.
Produced by the always-reliable Dave Jerden, the punk quartet's
energetic fifth album slams through standout melodic thrashers like
``Have You Ever,'' ``The Kids Aren't Alright'' and the sardonic
look at high school, ``Pretty Fly (For a White Guy),'' while
landing only one bum note, a prank cover of ``Feelings.'' 2 {
Stars. &QL;

 &QL; 
FEAR OF POP/``Fear of Pop Vol. 1'' (550 Music)
</P>
<P>
   Ben Folds of Ben Folds Five wrote all the material and played
all the instruments here, but don't expect anything resembling the
compelling piano-led trio he fronts as his day job. Instead, the
experimental yet still tuneful ``Fear of Pop Vol. 1,'' which
features ``Star Trek's'' William Shatner on hammy spoken-word
vocals on one track, breaks little new ground and should probably
be avoided until the new Ben Folds Five album next year. 1 {

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOUNDTRACK/``The Prince of Egypt'' (DreamWorks) &QL; 
VARIOUS/``The Prince of Egypt: Inspirational'' (DreamWorks) &QL; 
VARIOUS/``The Prince of Egypt: Nashville'' (DreamWorks)
</P>
<P>
   This was the worst music marketing idea of the decade,
especially during a flat year in the record industry. Three
completely useless soundtracks, all released on a single Tuesday,
will do little more than cause puzzled fans to scratch their heads
and purchase the Mariah Carey greatest-hits disc or the Springsteen
box instead. Tied to the animated story of ``Exodus'' due in
theaters next month, these discs represent blatantly hollow aims.
The soundtrack itself is simply empty orchestral drivel with some
Ofra Haza thrown in along with a tepid Mariah Carey-Whitney Houston
duet on the movie's theme, which resembles two tomcats being
throttled to within an inch of their lives; the gospel collection
tries to wedge every contemporary Christian star and gospel-pop
crooner from Take 6 to Kirk Franklin to Jars of Clay under one
mediocre roof; and the country disc featuring an overbearing
Wynonna, Vince Gill and Faith Hill is enough to drive real country
fans to jazz. 1 { Stars each. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HANK WILLIAMS/``The Complete Hank Williams'' (Mercury Nashville)
</P>
<P>
   His recording career lasted only six years, his time at the top
of his profession barely four, and he was just 29 when a life of
excess caught up with him. Nonetheless, honky-tonk crooner Williams
created one of the greatest bodies of work in American music. Songs
like ``Your Cheatin' Heart,'' ``Hey, Good Lookin''' and
``Jambalaya'' sold millions, crossing over from the country to the
pop charts and becoming the model for all authentic country music
that followed. This 10-CD box contains more than 225 tracks,
including 53 previously unissued, from Williams' earliest sessions
in 1946 to his last date in 1952, as well as rare radio
performances, demos, TV and concert recordings and 14
never-before-released tunes. While it's a little difficult to get
through all this in even a single weekend, this stuff will live on
forever. 4 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ORB/``U.F. Off'' (Island)
</P>
<P>
   The Orb's ``hits'' album celebrates 10 years of strange blips,
beeps and layers of noise otherwise known as the electronic genre
ambient-house. Masterminded by the very odd Dr. Alex Paterson, the
synth-heavy Orb typically weaves multirhythms, mixes in classical
influences and wraps it up with mid-tempo electronic beats. It's
been dubbed ``lame ambient noodling,'' but as background music
while vacuuming, the Orb can't be beat. 2 { Stars &QL;

SHAWN MULLINS GETTING   GOOD AIRPLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The times are a-changing for singer-songwriter
Shawn Mullins, whose major-label debut has garnered airplay
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been touring for nine years in a van with my dog, Roadie,
and now we've got a tour bus,'' Mullins explained. ``Now, I can
walk around or do pushups, sit, write or watch TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Mullins worked his material out the
old-fashioned way, by playing more than 200 gigs a year.
</P>
<P>
   His debut, ``Soul's Core,'' originally released on Mullins' own
SMG imprint, was recently issued by Columbia with new packaging and
an additional track (``Shimmer''). Last year, he was voted best
acoustic artist at the Atlanta Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The new album's ``Lullaby,'' a hook-filled, drum-loop-driven
electro-acoustic saga of Hollywood heartbreak and redemption, is a
staple at album alternative and modern-rock stations from sea to
shining sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``When radio picked up on `Lullaby,' it was a total surprise,''
Mullins said. ``Out of my nine records, six have landed airplay on
local stations, but not like this. Before this happened, I could
never get booked at this club I always wanted to play in Chicago. I
just drew 800 people to the city's biggest club, the Metro. That's
what radio is doing for me. I can't believe it, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins says he gets his inspiration from journal entries while
traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write a lot on the road,'' he said. `` `Lullaby' was
inspired by a gig I played at a venue that is also a Chinese
restaurant. I could tell that one of the five people in the
audience was moved by the music. She told me her story over Chinese
food. I wrote down a few lines in my journal _ `she grew up with
the children of the stars.' Her story was sad, but I wanted to give
her some hope. A week later, driving through the desert, the hook
came to me _ `everything gonna be alright, rock-a-bye.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bonus track ``Shimmer'' came a lot faster. The tune was ``one of
those songs that just totally fell in my lap,'' Mullins said.
</P>
<P>
   Another memorable number on ``Soul's Core'' _ which was No. 59
and rising last week in the nation's pop albums chart _ is ``Twin
Rocks,'' which came about after a visit to the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so blown away by the West that I was trying to express
what I felt inside about that part of the country,'' Mullins said.
``I wrote that song after I met a guy in Big Sur and a lady in
Portland who told me similar stories. I try and make poems from the
stories I hear and come up with songs that way, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins says he's not just relating the experiences of others,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to meet people, and part of it is opening your heart to
people on the road,'' he said. ``You can gain so much by being
open. It allows you to communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins got his start after winning a ninth-grade high school
talent show with an original song.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had girls doing the Whitney Houston thing, you had the kid
who wants to be a comedian, and I did my thing,'' he recalled. ``I
couldn't believe I'd won. The prize was like 100 bucks and that was
inspiration, let me tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   The songwriter said ``Lullaby'' took off when an Atlanta
modern-rock station began spinning the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the next week, a bunch of modern-rock stations had
added it,'' he said. ``For the first time in my career, I'm being
radio-driven. It just blows me away.''

`MY HEAD'S A HARD DISK'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; We were wondering where an obsession with pop
music can lead.
</P>
<P>
   So, we asked Colin Larkin, author of ``The Encyclopedia of
Popular Music, Third Edition'' ($750; distributed by Grove
Dictionaries for Muze Inc.), which at eight hardback volumes fills
8,000 pages with more than 18,500 entries on everyone from Brit
punk act A Certain Ratio to Southern blues-rockers ZZ Top.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin, who has chronicled pop music for 31 years, penned the
encyclopedia along with a hand-picked team of a dozen contributors.
Covering performers, composers, producers, record companies,
events, venues, musical theater, films, video and music magazines,
the encyclopedia's just-issued third edition documents pop music's
position in culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a full-time life's obsession,'' admits Larkin, 48. ``My
dream is to get it to 20 volumes.''
</P>
<P>
   While the full $750 set is a bit steep for the average fan,
Virgin Publishing is releasing separate paperback encyclopedias on
every major musical movement, including blues, '60s music, r&AMP;b and
soul, country, '70s music, reggae, '80s music, and indie and new
wave, over the next two years. There's also a concise single-volume
edition of the encyclopedia at 1,296 pages due this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get letters from all over the world, so I know plenty of
music fans are buying the complete set, along with libraries, media
outlets, record companies and radio stations,'' Larkin said. ``Rock
and pop has grown up to such an extent that it's important in so
many people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin grew up in the Britain of the '60s, going to gigs,
learning guitar and filling his home with countless albums,
singles, music magazines and books. He says that since 1961, he
hasn't discarded a single issue of any music publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``My head's a hard disk,'' Larkin said this week. ``I've been
filling that hard disk up since I was very small, since I was 3,
when I recall vividly being moved by early r&AMP;b and rock. I finally
got the opportunity to spew it all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1989, Larkin has focused on the herculean task of
compiling the pop equivalent of the ``New Grove Dictionary of
Popular Music and Musicians.'' He released the first edition of his
encyclopedia at four volumes in 1992 and the second, six-volume
edition in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Currently living in a converted 17th-century barn in his native
Essex, Larkin is still a collector and fan above all. He says his
ideal evening would be spent sipping a glass of wine, listening to
records and reading a music biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through three marriages _ that's how I know this is
a lifetime passion and obsession,'' he said.

PARENT TIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday Nov. 26)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Greetings, from one small and blue'' began the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   One of my college friends from California has just gotten
online, and a real luxury for us is the ability to compare
parenting notes every few days instead of in scattered phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   We've exchanged fears about overindulgence, and overindulged our
fears. We've talked about how expectations of being a mom and wife
don't always mesh with reality, and how the reality of being a mom
and wife often overshadows all else, even ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Both of us being only children, we've watched as our two
offspring navigated sibling rivalry and tried to figure out where
to step in.
</P>
<P>
   She stayed at home with her oldest, who is now 4, and devoted
herself to his care and development. I worked full-time, sometimes
putting in 60-hour weeks during my son's toddlerhood. We both had
reasons for our choices, and were careful not to judge the other.
But there were definitely danger zones in our conversations during
these years that we stepped around, so as not to fall through.
</P>
<P>
   Now, both working part-time and having added another baby to the
mix, we're finding common ground a lot more frequently. And with
the convenience of e-mail, we can traverse some of that territory
together.
</P>
<P>
   One of the luxuries of our friendship ... one I truly don't
deserve ... is that she lets me write about her. Whereas most of my
friends have disclaimers (``What I'm about to tell you is NOT to
show up in the newspaper, by the way'') Kris has always told me
that her life is fair game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write about all of it,'' she says. ``That's what writers do,
isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   She has been included in several of my columns, daring to let me
expose her fears and joys and eccentricities.
</P>
<P>
   And so, my e-mail greeting from one small and blue shall be
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Kris, her husband, and their oldest son are going to play
therapy to try to figure out why Dylan has so many temper tantrums
(I have changed her husband's and son's names, for their privacy.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a play therapy day. I have not kept a journal in
years, but I am starting to as of tonight, just to document this
whole process. Dylan as a little mirror is holding up a reflection
of our life that is so alien to me. Last week (session one) was
just Bill and I and the therapist where we spent about two hours
describing the situation, etc ... pretty generic counseling stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today (session two) was just Dylan and the therapist playing
in the structured playroom for an hour. I waited in the waiting
room and read magazines while Bill stayed home with the baby. I
heard lots of laughter come from the room at different times, but
otherwise I have no idea what they did. When Dylan came out an hour
later, he was carrying a picture he had drawn. The therapist
explained that it was for her file, that we couldn't keep it, but
he wanted to show it to me. On the picture were three big giant
smiling people with names written underneath them _ Daddy, Dylan,
Grandma. (I've had counseling classes _ they were in the center of
the page, large and powerful ... there was some self-esteem going
on ... this is good right?) But in between Dylan and Daddy, at
about one-fourth the size of everyone else, with a frown so large
it took up half of her face AND the only one who was any color at
all _ dark blue _ here was MOMMY!! I am embarrassed to tell you how
much my heart was broken by this drawing. I smiled and said that it
was nice and thanked the therapist and scheduled next week's
appointment and walked to the car chatting with Dylan (all the
while feeling like I was going to burst into tears any minute. When
I got home and Max was out of view, I did burst into tears and
could not stop crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill, trying to comfort me, told me it was silly to let the
drawing of a 4-year old upset me so ... that it doesn't mean
anything. (sure _ he was big and white and powerful ... he can talk
like that.) I don't know exactly what bothered me so. This whole
process is emotional. Another thing that struck me when I looked at
his picture is that this is how I see myself, overwhelmed by the
constant demands of Dylan, Bill and the baby, and not so happy
about it. Anyway, I never dreamed that seeking help for managing
tantrums would lead to such drama. We have signed up for an
eight-week session ... with next week being Max and me playing in
the playroom with the therapist. I'm afraid I will do everything
wrong, and wish I could send the great, powerful Bill instead.''
</P>
<P>
   I wrote Kristin back about the time Adam told me he loved his
daddy differently than he did me, and I said, well, of course,
honey, everyone loves everyone else differently, and he said, no, I
mean, I love daddy MORE, and I cried all night with Jim telling ME
that it was silly to let the passing thoughts of a 4-year-old upset
me so.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't feel silly, at the time.
</P>
<P>
   I also believe it's the fate of moms, for the most part, to be
the disciplinarians, the ones who say no all the time, the ones who
wear their emotions close to the surface, and the ones who are not
to be mistaken for the Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz, the persona
daddies get to inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan, I think, isn't showing disdain for Kris as much as
sympathy: `Hey, mom, I know you have to do a lot and put up with a
lot and sometimes it makes you unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, what wouldn't we all give to be the bright, smiling
parent at the top of the page, paying no attention to the small,
uncertain parent behind the curtain.
</P>

`ENEMY OF THE STATE': THE WALLS HAVE EARS AND EYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though ``Enemy of the State'' finds a flimsy excuse for setting
one scene amid lingerie models, babes have nothing to do with its
notion of sex appeal. Instead, it's the gigahertz that are hot in a
thriller that treats technology as its biggest turn-on.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech surveillance (``Enhance, then forward frame by
frame!'') is at the heart of this latest splashy collaboration
between Tony Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer (``Top Gun,'' ``Crimson
Tide''), with its premise that privacy is imperiled by runaway
electronics. In a week that finds the nation listening to
surreptitiously taped Washington telephone calls, who's to say that
``Enemy of the State'' doesn't have a point?
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: it has a hurtling pace, nonstop intensity
and a stylish, appealing performance by Will Smith in his first
real starring role. And although Scott has done popular culture no
great favor by pioneering the Simpson-Bruckheimer school of empty
but sensation-packed filmmaking, he now looks like a veritable
Billy Wilder beside latter-day Top Gunners like Michael
(``Armageddon'') Bay.
</P>
<P>
   As a grand old man of the thrill-happy genre, Scott gives this
film a fine cast, a modicum of wit on the run and a reasonably
human dimension. As Gene Hackman, playing an eccentric technology
wiz, finally admits about Smith's lawyer-turned-action hero: ``Not
too stupid after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith plays Robert Clayton Dean, an upright and happily married
lawyer who winds up, quicker than you can say John Grisham, being
targeted, chased and spied on by ruthless forces within the
National Security Agency. Needless to say, the ``huh?'' factor is
considerable.
</P>
<P>
   How exactly does Dean go from peace and quiet to a scene in
which he must run away from a helicopter, a truck and a train
simultaneously? The screenplay by David Marconi seems to be wired
with its own self-destruct mechanism, so that it works within the
moment but stops making sense the minute you walk out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' begins with the murder of a congressman
(played by an unbilled Jason Robards) because he opposes a
Telecommunications Security and Privacy Act that a certain NSA
official (Jon Voight, who modeled his appearance here on Robert
McNamara) dearly hopes will pass. But it happens that a nature
photographer (Jason Lee, a star of ``Chasing Amy'') is monitoring
geese in the very park where the killing takes place.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer becomes toast as soon as he relays this
information to someone else by telephone, since there are no such
things as unmonitored phone conversations or camera-free
buttonholes in this movie. Incidentally, everyone who makes phone
calls here tends to be doing at least one other thing _ fiddling
with a keyboard, peering at a monitor screen, watching television _
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   And information is gathered and processed with dizzying
rapidity. The real world's hourglass icon, the one that indicates a
computer is taking its sweet time about something, is nowhere to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   In what passes for crafty plotting here, Dean happens to be
buying holiday underwear for his wife (of course it's
Christmastime) when the photographer bursts onto the scene and
hides a copy of his incriminating evidence in Dean's shopping bag.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a whole nerd squad back at headquarters begins
studying the configuration of the bag and then monitoring Dean's
every move. His house is fitted with more bugs than there are in
children's films this season. There's a sensor in his pants.
</P>
<P>
   A special dedicated satellite, filmed as if this were ``Star
Wars,'' is devoted to chasing him. The question of why one little
vote in Congress _ or even one little murder, in this cutthroat
context _ is enough to set off such techno-frenzy is one more
``huh?'' along the way.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott comes up with enough snazzy equipment, wild chases and
explosive notions (like blowing up the original Dr. Pepper factory
in Baltimore) to keep the story moving faster than the speed of
scrutiny. And he does use sharp, video-influenced editing more
effectively than most (though John Frankenheimer's ``Ronin''
achieved the same high velocity without benefit of MTV tricks).
</P>
<P>
   The film's juxtapositions, sharp angles, jump cuts and aerial
surveillance shots (a la the Gulf war) have a rhythm that suits the
material. And Scott avoids touches of overkill, like pumped-up
emotional heft or an overlay of musical schmaltz.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the filmmakers' claims that actual surveillance
capabilities go well beyond what is seen here give added interest,
not to mention true menace, to much of what is seen.
</P>
<P>
   Making memorable appearances here are Regina King (from ``Jerry
Maguire'') as Dean's sturdy wife; Barry Pepper, Ian Hart and Jake
Busey as young thugs on Dean's trail; Lisa Bonet as an
ex-girlfriend of Dean's, and Tom Sizemore as a tubby mobster.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Byrne appears in a brief, baffling role. The film's
horde of foxy screens, transmitters, buttonhole cameras and laptops
probably deserve an acting credit of their own.
</P>
<P>
   (italics)``Enemy of the State'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes mild sexual
suggestiveness, occasional violence and one major shootout at its
finale.(end italics)

 &HT;    GOP CALLS ON CLINTON TO LEAD SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM
 &HT;    With SOCIAL-TEXAS.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the jungle warfare of Social Security reform,
House Republicans on Thursday asked President Clinton to walk
point.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before a White House conference on the politically
perilous options for shoring up Social Security's shaky finances,
GOP lawmakers said Clinton must offer a specific proposal soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a specific plan from the president, a very difficult
job will become much, much harder,'' said Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, at a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``General principles won't get the job done. Broad outlines
won't work. It will take presidential leadership. It requires
specifics. In short, it takes a president,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said he wanted Clinton to offer a proposal by the end of
the two-day conference Dec. 8 and 9, but Assistant Treasury
Secretary David Wilcox said there weren't any plans for the
president to do so before the White House and congressional leaders
work out an agreement sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., said he was disturbed by the
administration's failure to offer a reform plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that this president can't come up with a plan?''
Shaw asked. ``We're running out of time. If it's not done during
the rest of the term of this administration, it will be looked at
as a real tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Without reforms _ which could include unpopular measures such as
raising contributions or limiting eligibility for benefits _ Social
Security will not be able to pay full benefits by 2032, but could
continue paying about 75 percent of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from both parties agree that early reforms would
reduce the pain of any fixes imposed over the long term, but they
disagree over both the cause of the problem and its potential
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   And they distrust each other not to use reforms for partisan
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's hearing, which follows Republican election losses
earlier this month, reflected the partisan wrangling surrounding
any Social Security reform.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are reluctant to go first in offering a solution.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, burned when its early efforts to reform
health care were roundly attacked by special interest groups and
Congress, has taken the position that any plan bearing Clinton's
name would merely polarize the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, burned in the past two elections by Democrats who
demonized their attempts to reform Medicare or to use part of the
budget surplus for tax cuts, are reluctant to unite behind a plan
without guarantees they won't be attacked by Clinton and the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox, speaking for the administration, declined to offer any
specifics for reform except to say that Clinton did not envision
raising the payroll tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   Still on the table, he indicated, could be raising the
eligibility age, investing the federal surplus in private
securities or allowing limited personal investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were clearly unhappy with the administration's
unwillingness to offer specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sound like you're bobbing and weaving and waiting for the
next election, and there is no next election,'' said Rep. Bill
Thomas, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas asked whether Clinton would offer a reform plan by his
State of the Union in January, his budget submission in February,
or the end of the fiscal year in September 1999. Wilcox declined to
predict when Clinton would act.

`CELEBRITY': EYING THE GLITTER-CRAZED IN MANHATTAN'S DOLCE VITA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)``Celebrity'' was shown as part of this year's New York
Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review,
which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 25. The film opens
nationwide Friday.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   In ``Celebrity,'' Woody Allen presents a world in which the VIP
status of Joey Buttafuoco (seen fleetingly on a talk show) makes as
much sense as anything else. He wonders whether being able to
provide Knicks season tickets and hot restaurant reservations for
relatives can be the highest form of breadwinning in ``a culture
that took a wrong turn somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Famous for trashing hotel rooms? For being in a coma? For
reading the weather report on television? In the glitter-crazy
world of ``Celebrity,'' the only fate emptier than being famous for
practically nothing is not being famous at all.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what befalls the film's main character, a
journalist peering into the lives of the famous with his nose
pressed to the glass, when he embarks on a string of
neo-Felliniesque encounters with the rogues' gallery of celebrities
seen here.
</P>
<P>
   Playing this role in an exceptional feat of mimicry, Kenneth
Branagh assumes the corduroy mantle of Allen and takes on the full
panoply of self-effacing nervous mannerisms (``Really? Great,
great, 'cause I don't wanna be, uh... '') as assiduously as if he
were tackling ``Richard III.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the film allows this character, a dolce vita hanger-on
lacking anything like the Mastroianni magnetism, to violate one of
the most basic rules of celebrity culture. Even at its most
fatuous, fame is about being one of a kind. And Allen is the only
man who can save these tics from whiny obsequiousness and, with
such agile genius, make them work.
</P>
<P>
   So the journalist Lee Simon is one of the filmmaker's wearier
creations, in ways that deny ``Celebrity'' the bracing audacity of
recent, better Allen films like ``Deconstructing Harry'' and
``Everyone Says I Love You.'' And even with Branagh as his younger
alter ego, Allen finds no way to revitalize the character's
predictable worries about advancing his career and chasing
beautiful women.
</P>
<P>
   This film's central situation, involving the post-divorce
romances of Lee and his high-strung ex-wife, Robin (Judy Davis),
becomes little more than a pretext for watching fame crop up in the
most peculiar places. There are a handful of fabulous caricatures
in Allen's Manhattan sketchbook, but the film too easily allows
these peripheral figures to outshine its central story.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise: the most wildly famous figure whom Lee encounters
happens also to be this film's hottest star. In a devilishly
satirical sequence midway through the film, Leonardo DiCaprio
(uncannily well cast before the release of ``Titanic'') bursts into
the story while trashing a hotel room at the Stanhope and slapping
around his equally hysterical moll (Gretchen Mol).
</P>
<P>
   Just as the police are being summoned, Lee arrives to pitch his
screenplay to the bad-boy wonder and is caught up in the frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Several other guest-star segments in ``Celebrity'' stand out in
equally bright, witty relief. ``You're going to send off those
truffles to the president,'' Melanie Griffith's pampered movie
queen instructs her staff, just before drifting into a very funny
brief encounter with Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Another dazzling vignette presents Charlize Theron emerging from
her cocoon of clean-cut roles (as in ``Devil's Advocate'') to play
a stunning, imperious model who takes Lee in tow. Once again, Allen
shows a keenly acerbic eye for the scene he sets (downtown hip,
with Isaac Mizrahi as a painter who complains about being too
popular) while letting it upstage the putative center of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Celebrity'' is filled with beautiful and famous faces,
it has plenty of opportunity to bog down between star turns, and
some of the episodes about the Simons are astonishingly flat. Lee's
high school reunion, where he is filled with contempt for his aging
classmates and myopic self-involvement, is a sequence as dismal as
his quip: ``Ask not for whom the bell tolls _ or more accurately,
for whom the toilet flushes.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lee drifts among glamorous women (with Famke Janssen as a
svelte book editor and bewitchingly flirty Winona Ryder as an
ambitious waitress-actress), Robin fumes and tries desperate
measures. She visits a religious retreat where a priest with a
television show signs autographs. She goes to a plastic surgeon
(Michael Lerner) who's been dubbed ``the Michelangelo of
Manhattan'' by Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   She begins dating a television producer (Joe Mantegna) who takes
her to a screening of a film he finds pretentiously shot in black
and white. (``Celebrity'' is, of course, also shot in black and
white, enhanced by the superb clarity of Sven Nykvist's
cinematography.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis plays Robin in a harried, antic manner at first, then
softens as she evolves into the film's most unlikely luminary. Ms.
Davis also gets to deliver the film's obvious message in a single
unremarkable line: ``You can tell a lot about a society by who it
chooses to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of what you can tell from the fun-house mirrors of
``Celebrity'' is what you already know.

</P>
<P>
   LA-CATHEDRAL-LADN (Los Angeles) _ Our Lady of the Angels,
scheduled for dedication in 2001, will replace the
earthquake-damaged St. Vibiana's Cathedral as the religious center
for 4 million Catholics in the Los Angeles area. Poised above the
third-busiest freeway in California and designed to seat more
worshippers than any cathedral in the country, Our Lady of the
Angels will be a world-class religious monument befitting a city of
Los Angeles' stature, church leaders say. By Deborah Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN-HNS (San Francisco) _ Seven days after he learned
that two of his daughters and his grandson had died in the mass
murder-suicide of Jonestown, the Rev. John V. Moore delivered his
Sunday sermon to his United Methodist congregation in Reno. He had
not planned to speak, but his wife Barbara convinced him the effort
was crucial. By Stephanie Salter.
</P>
<P>
   JEWS-IDENTITY-NYT (Undated) _ In an attempt to rebuild religious
identity among young Jews, who are marrying non-Jews and abandoning
the faith in large numbers, Jewish organizations plan to start a
program that will pay for any Jew in the world between age 15 and
26 to travel to Israel for 10 days. By Laurie Goodstein.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-JONES-COLUMN-TEX (Houston) _ A few miles north of the
San Jacinto Battlefield where Texans won their independence from
Mexico in 1836, another small band of Texans declared their
independence this week. About 500 Texas Baptist conservatives met
at a church in east Houston and officially formed a breakaway state
convention as an alternative to the moderate-controlled Baptist
General Convention of Texas. The new group will be called the
Southern Baptists of Texas. By Jim Jones.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-BUDDHISM-BOS (Charlemont, Mass.) _ Buddhism _ a
philosophy that through meditation cultivates self-awareness,
compassion, discipline, and moderation _ has become trendy in
recent years, the favored faith of celebrities like Richard Gere,
Courtney Love, and members of the Beastie Boys. It has also been
the focus of recent Hollywood movies such as ``Kundun'' and ``Seven
Years in Tibet.'' Instruction in arcane Buddhist meditation
techniques, some once confined to remote Tibetan monasteries, is
now almost as easy to find as yoga or karate training. But there
are few places in the nation where Buddhism in its major forms and
schools of practice has put down roots so deeply and become such an
accepted part of the landscape as in the verdant hill towns of
northwestern Massachusetts. By William A. Davis.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN-BOS (Undated) _ One night when she was a
15-year-old worried about grades and boyfriends, Naomi Levy was
awakened by her mother and sister. In her groggy state, Levy
thought they were saying, ``The doctor gave Daddy a shot.'' ``So
what?'' Levy replied. ``So what if he got a shot?'' But what they
were really trying frantically to tell Levy was that her father had
been shot in a botched robbery attempt on a Brooklyn street. Three
days later, her father died. For Levy, many other things died, too
_ her religious faith, hopes for future, and confidence in herself.
But it was from that despairing moment that Levy began a new life
whose foundation was built on her Jewish roots. By Diego
Ribadeneira.
</P>
<P>
   BISHOPS-ABORTION-NYT (Washington) _ The nation's Roman Catholic
bishops declared Wednesday that they have a pastoral duty to speak
out to persuade public officials who support abortion rights, and
Catholic officials in particular, to undergo ``a change of heart.''
By Gustav Niebuhr.

 &HT;    GRAMM, ARCHER DISAGREE ON SOCIAL SECURITY
 &HT;    With SOCIAL-SECURITY.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Texans who will play a major role in reforming
Social Security disagreed Thursday over how the program works.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the Social Security trust fund
doesn't really exist, that it doesn't receive interest payments and
that its soundness rests on the moral obligation of the government
to pay benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said the trust fund holds special
U.S. Treasury bonds that pay interest and are as sound as U.S.
savings bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee's Social
Security subcommittee. Archer is chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over Social Security in
that chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm made his comments at the start of a Ways and Means hearing
on Social Security reforms. Archer made his comments after Gramm
left the room.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm compared the Social Security trust fund to a child with a
paper route who gave his earnings to his mother for safekeeping. If
his mother put the money into a cookie jar solely for the child's
use, it was a trust fund, Gramm said. If she used it as part of the
family budget, it was not a trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the federal government uses Social Security, he
said. The money goes into the unified budget, and there is no
benefit of compound interest.
</P>
<P>
   Archer disagreed. Social Security payroll taxes are used to
purchase special Treasury bonds which can be redeemed only to pay
benefits to Social Security recipients, he said. The bonds earn
interest at about 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The special bonds are as safe as a Series EE U.S. savings bond,
Archer said. Anyone who doesn't believe that should burn their
savings bonds, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Although they disagree on the way the system works, Gramm and
Archer have both suggested reforming the program to allow workers
to create their own investment accounts using a portion of their
payroll taxes.

MCDERMOTT'S QUIET STORY EDGES WOLFE'S BLOCKBUSTER AT AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID MEHEGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  NEW YORK _ For the second year in a row, the heavy favorite
among bettors on the National Book Awards Wednesday night proved to
be lame in the stretch, as Alice McDermott's ``Charming Billy''
edged out Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in Full'' in the fiction category.
</P>
<P>
   Like Don DeLillo's ``Underworld'' last year, which lost to
Charles Frazier's dark horse ``Cold Mountain,'' the buzz among
publishing insiders was that Wolfe's glitzy blockbuster was a
shoo-in. But McDermott's novel, a quieter story about a troubled
young man and his lost love back home in Ireland, took the coveted
$10,000 prize. Publisher Farrar Straus &AMP; Giroux was the night's big
winner, collecting three of the four prizes: fiction, nonfiction,
and children's.
</P>
<P>
   The winner in nonfiction was Edward Ball for ``Slaves in the
Family,'' about the author's search for his family's slaveholding
history _ and his African-American relatives _ in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The children's award went to Louis Sachar for ``Holes,'' the
story of a boy sent to a juvenile detention center for a crime he
did not commit. In poetry, the prize went to Gerald Stern for
``This Time: New and Selected Poems'' (Norton).
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows were raised last month when the Wolfe novel was
announced as a finalist before the book was published, even before
book editors had seen prepublication galley. Wolfe is famous for
last-minute alterations, and the fiction judges received the
700-plus-page book in loose typeset pages in a box. Novelist Thomas
Mallon, chairman of the fiction committee said, however, there was
precedent for prepublication nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In her acceptance, McDermott, whose previous work has probed the
heart and pain of the Irish-American experience, said, ``I wouldn't
be true to my Irish roots if I thought this was entirely a good
thing. I can hear my grandmother saying, `Now don't go getting a
swelled head.'''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the awards, novelist John Updike received the
National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to
American Letters, which also carries a $10,000 prize. Runners-up in
all categories get $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The other finalists in fiction:
</P>
<P>
   _Allegra Goodman, of Cambridge, for her first novel, ``Kaater- &QC; 
skill Falls'' (Dial Press), about gentiles and Orthodox Jewish
residents of a village in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   _Gayl Jones, for ``The Healing'' (Beacon Press), the story of
faith healer Harlan Jane Eagleton. It is Jones's first novel in 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   _Robert Stone of Westport, Conn., for his novel ``Damascus
Gate'' (Houghton Mifflin), about an attempt to bomb the Temple
Mount in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   _Tom Wolfe, for ``A Man in Full'' (Farrar Straus &AMP; Giroux), the
best-selling novel of race, business, and the New South.
</P>
<P>
   In nonfiction, the other finalists were:
</P>
<P>
   _Harold Bloom for ``Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human''
(Riverhead/Penguin), a close reading of the plays that argues that
the bard created the idea of character as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   _Yaffa Eliach, for ``There Once Was a World: A 900-Year
Chronicle of the Shtetl of Eishyshok'' (Little, Brown), which tells
of a hamlet in Poland, from the Middle Ages to its destruction by
the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   _Beth Kephart for ``A Slant of Sun: One Child's Courage''
(Norton), an account of the raising of a child with a severe
developmental disorder.
</P>
<P>
   _Henry Mayer for ``All on Fire: William Lloyd Garrison and the
Abolition of American Slavery'' (St. Martin's), a biography of the
Boston editor and abolitionist.
</P>
<P>
   The other poetry finalists were:
</P>
<P>
   _B. Harry Fairchild for ``The Art of the Lathe'' (Alice James
Books), about small-town, working class life in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   _Alicia Suskin Ostriker for ``The Little Space: Poems Selected
and New, 1968-1998'' (University of Pittsburgh Press), poems on
childhood, family, motherhood and religion.
</P>
<P>
   _Linda Pastan for ``Carnival Evening: New and Selected Poems
1968-1998'' (Norton), about the passions and complexities hidden
under ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   _Carl Phillips for ``From the Devotions'' (Graywolf), poems
about the interaction of desire with physical, moral, and spiritual
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   In children's literature the other finalists were:
</P>
<P>
   _Ann Cameron for ``The Secret Life of Amanda K. Woods (Farrar
Straus &AMP; Giroux), the story of a girl who carves out a new identity
for herself.
</P>
<P>
   _Jack Gantos for ``Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key'' (Farrar Straus
&AMP; Giroux), about a boy struggling with hyperactivity.
</P>
<P>
   _Anita Lobel for ``No Pretty Pictures: A Child of War''
(Greenwillow), a memoir of imprisonment and flight in Nazi-occupied
Poland.
</P>
<P>

FOLK ART AS FINE ART 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before movies and television, Americans knew how to
entertain themselves. One way was through folk art, an engrossing
pastime for the maker and a continuing delight for the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Folk art can also be appreciated as fine art, particularly at
the Fall Antiques Show, running Friday through Sunday at the Armory
on Park Avenue at 67th Street. In connection with the fair, the
Museum of American Folk Art has organized a loan exhibition of folk
art treasures privately purchased at the show over the past 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Several veteran folk art dealers, including Kelter-Malce, Peter
Tillou, Steven Score, America Hurrah and Ricco/Maresca, will be at
the fair. There's also some new blood, with new participants
presenting different kinds of folk art.
</P>
<P>
   One new dealer is Clifford A. Wallach of New York City, who is
bringing examples of ``tramp art,'' household objects covered with
thousands of bits of carved wood that have been lovingly glued on.
His wares have great charm, and range from heart-shaped picture
frames given as tokens of affection to everyday, utilitarian items
like sewing boxes that have been festooned with pyramids and
virtuoso squares of wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tramp art was not an American invention,'' said Wallach, who
has specialized in it for 12 years and is the author of ``Tramp
Art: One Notch at a Time'' (Wallach-Irons, 1998). ``Originally
called chip carving, it was pervasive around the world.'' He
speculated that tramp art originated in Europe and came to the
United States with German and Scandinavian immigrants in the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   It took off in this country in the 1860s, when cigar smoking
became fashionable. Cigar boxes were made of fine woods like
mahogany and cedar, and whittlers loved them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boxes were easy to carve because they were made of good
wood,'' Wallach said, adding, ``All the carver needed was a knife _
and some imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the artists were anonymous, Wallach said,
``working-class, frugal, often inveterate whittlers, tinkerers,
inventors, sometimes artisans by profession, and discontent to be
idle.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled one man's reminiscence about his grandfather, who he
said would sit before the fire, carving with his pocketknife as he
talked to the women of the house while they did their sewing.
``They often called tramp art `men's quilting,''' Wallach said.
``It was time-consuming and labor-intensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Some pieces commemorate an event, like a wedding, in their
maker's life. Others deal with history; Wallach has a row of framed
portraits of presidents. Items like these cost a few hundred
dollars each, while his ``masterpiece,'' a blue wall cabinet whose
sides are totally covered with stacked-wood pyramids, costs
$38,000. Made about 1880, it has intricate sunflowers on its doors
and a crest decorated with wooden semicircles that look like early
Frank Stella paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Once seen as plebeian, tramp art is beginning to be taken
seriously. The Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Center for Folk Art in
Williamsburg, Va., is planning a tramp art exhibition in 2000.
Richard Miller, a former curator at the center, writes in the
introduction to Wallach's book, ``Seemingly common, everyday
objects are revealing themselves to be neither particularly common
nor everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Darwin's Antiques of Pine Street in Philadelphia is another new
exhibitor at the fair. William Woody, Darwin's owner, said he sells
intensely personal folk art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Darwinian things,'' Woody said, like ``natural history
specimens and relics of the Grand Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently sold an enormous ship anchor to the Port of History
Museum in Philadelphia. The anchor was made as a gift for a ship
captain who retired in 1862.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was chipped-carved wood to imitate wrought iron,'' Woody
explained. ``All the places the captain had sailed were marked on
the anchor, from Cape Horn to the Cape of Good Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody, who served in the Navy, said it reminded him of ``when
ships were wood and men were iron.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody once studied architecture and is attracted to large
architectural elements. At the fair, he is selling a fine 1830
wooden mantelpiece from Boston that was decorated with smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``They held the candle next to freshly painted wood, so the
smoke would curl up and make it look like marble,'' he explained.
``In those days, people wanted to be entertained by their
surroundings.''
</P>

<P>
   A Dauphine's Commode
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Christie's New York will auction the fine French and
English furniture collection of Martin Zimet, the chairman of
French &AMP; Co., an art and antiques gallery in Manhattan that he
bought in 1968. The pieces, many with royal provenances, go on view
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Zimet said he was selling the collection because his son Henry,
now president of the firm, wanted to stick to old master paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the pieces are grand and ornate, impressive both
visually and historically. Probably the most beautiful is the Louis
XV black lacquer commode made and signed by BVRB, Bernard II Van
Risenburgh, one of the most important cabinetmakers of the Rococo
era. The piece dates from circa 1744. Christie's experts were
apparently the first to look at the back and discover its royal
inventory number.
</P>
<P>
   Alistair Clarke, the head of Christie's department of European
furniture, said the commode was made for the Versailles bedroom of
the dauphine, the Infanta Maria-Teresa-Rafaella, who was the
daughter of Philip V of Spain and married Louis XV's eldest son in
1745.
</P>
<P>
   The commode, feminine in appearance, is covered with prized
17th-century Japanese lacquer panels inlaid with mother-of-pearl,
gold and silver leaf. ``Such panels were amazingly rare in the 18th
century,'' Clarke said. ``Others went to Louis XV or Madame de
Pompadour.''
</P>
<P>
   The panels depict a group of court ladies gathered in a
manicured landscape, surrounded by exquisite little pavilions and
exotic birds and butterflies. The scenes are framed with delicate
gilded ormolu mounts. You can practically see the chisel marks on
the sculpted shells, flowers and trailing foliage.
</P>
<P>
   The workmanship is exquisite. Tony Victoria, the Manhattan
dealer who specializes in French antiques, said, ``You can't do
much better than that commode.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimet bought the royal commode around 1980 from the Paris dealer
Jacques Perrin. It is a tour de force with an estimate to match: $4
to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Zimet is also selling two pairs of George III amaranth,
tulipwood and ebonized marquetry armchairs. Designed by John
Linnell, the English cabinetmaker, each of the first pair of chairs
has an oval back with a pierced splat in the form of a neoclassical
urn filled with blooming lilies and daisies. In design they are
reminiscent of the work of Robert Adam, 66 of whose designs from
the Sir John Soane Museum in London are on view at the Octagon
House museum in Washington through Jan. 3. (Estimate: $250,000 to
$400,000.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The common thread in this auction is that each lot is very
strong on its own,'' Zimet said. ``There are no wishy-washy
pieces.''

`CENTRAL STATION'` A JOURNEY OF HOPE AND SELF-DISCOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Walter Salles' ``Central Station,'' a hit at Sundance and the
winner of top honors at this year's Berlin Film Festival, a
cynical, joyless woman crosses paths with a lonely young boy.
There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of
Salles' film is all in the telling.
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully observed and featuring a bravura performance by the
Brazilian actress Fernanda Montenegro, it gracefully watches these
oddly paired characters develop a fractious bond that winds up
profoundly changing both of them. Salles' background as a
documentary filmmaker also gives this lovely, stirring film a
strong sense of Brazil's impoverished rural landscape once its
principals take to the road.
</P>
<P>
   Vinicius de Oliveira was a 10-year-old shoeshine boy when he
encountered Salles at an airport and asked the man to help him buy
a sandwich. Now he movingly plays the child named Josue who is
foisted by fate onto this irascible older woman. Ms. Montenegro's
Dora is a former schoolteacher who earns her living writing letters
for the illiterate at the Rio de Janeiro railroad station of the
title.
</P>
<P>
   She spends all day listening to the heartfelt thoughts of
strangers, writes them down and then makes cruel fun of them when
she gets home. After joking about the letters with her kinder
friend Irene (Marilia Pera of ``Pixote''), Dora never bothers to
mail them. Then a letter by Josue's mother permanently alters
Dora's world.
</P>
<P>
   With suspicious little Josue in tow, the mother dictates a
beseeching letter to her absent husband, then leaves the station
and is killed by a bus. Suddenly, the boy knows no one and has no
place to go.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her hardened bitterness and obvious loathing for
children, Dora grudgingly takes him home, where Irene finds Josue
adorable and is happy to help him. But Dora has other plans; she
wants to sell Josue to an adoption racket and effectively trade him
in for a new television set.
</P>
<P>
   This scheme subsequently gets Dora into so much trouble that she
abruptly decides to leave town. And she agrees to take Josue on a
wild goose chase in search of his father, whom the boy says is a
carpenter named Jesus. These are the events that send ``Central
Station'' off into the countryside, and take both these hard-bitten
travelers into parts unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that
punctuate this odyssey, from the boy's drunken outburst on a bus to
Dora's shy flirtation with a trucker she meets along the way. By
the time the travelers are caught up in a religious pilgrimage, the
film has taken on a Felliniesque sense of spiritual discovery just
as surely as Ms. Montenegro resembles Giulietta Masina in both
feistiness and appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Her performance here is superbly modulated as Dora begins
rediscovering herself in ways she could never have expected. Though
eternally gruff, she finds herself regaining a long-lost faith in
life and in the very humanity she scorned when those letter writers
came her way.
</P>
<P>
   The film eventually views these strangers' faces in the rapt,
joyous spirit that is the story's greatest reward and that becomes
Dora's saving grace. And it is the filmmaker's elegant restraint
that makes such sentiments so deeply felt.
</P>
<P>
   Salles directs simply and watchfully, with an eye that seems to
penetrate all the characters who are encountered on Dora's and
Josue's journey. His film is also scored with a gentle piano melody
that heightens its heartfelt embrace of the world that ``Central
Station'' sees. &QL;

`WAKING NED DEVINE': WE HAVE A WINNER! TOO BAD HE'S DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The delightful ``Waking Ned Devine'' takes place in the
picturesque Irish village of Tulaigh Mohr (or Tully More). There
are 52 souls here, and 51 pairs of eyes twinkle. (One sour old
woman is the unofficial town witch.)
</P>
<P>
   There also happens to be a winning lottery ticket somewhere in
the village, and the film starts with a tireless campaign by Jackie
O'Shea (Ian Bannen) to root out the luckiest of his neighbors.
Leading questions (like ``So tell us, are you going to take a
holiday this year?'') don't turn up any obvious mad money, though.
</P>
<P>
   Aided hilariously by his wife, Annie (Fionnula Flanagan), and a
fellow codger, Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly), Jackie carries out
his detective work while the film introduces its sharply-etched
rustic characters. Kirk Jones, who wrote and directed this blithe
comedy, has been a prize-winning director of television
commercials. And he has the knack of finding rubbery, expressive
faces and letting each villager's quirks emerge on cue.
</P>
<P>
   His Tully More soon seems a jolly close-knit community where an
audience can easily linger, savoring characters like the
love-struck pig farmer (James Nesbitt), whose lovely lass won't
marry him until he does something about that smell. ``If it weren't
for the pigs, I'd marry you tomorrow!'' Maggie (Susan Lynch)
declares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ay, look at that: we're already 50 pounds and one meat pie
lighter!'' grouses Jackie to Annie, when their efforts to bribe
(fruity soaps for the pig farmer) and cajole (a meat pie for a
newly happy-looking lady) likely suspects fail to get results.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jackie and Michael cook up the idea of a chicken dinner for
the 18 biggest lottery players in town, and a funny thing happens:
One chicken dinner goes unclaimed. It was intended for a neighbor
named Ned Devine. And Ned proves to be the local person least
likely to cash in a lottery ticket on his own steam.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of this good-hearted film concerns Jackie and Michael's
efforts to create a lively, plausible Ned for the sake of a
visiting lottery official. Conveniently, the lottery man is a
sneezer, so he announces his whereabouts as clearly as the
clock-swallowing crocodile who stalked Captain Hook. This gives an
extra screwball quality to the old men's efforts to con him.
</P>
<P>
   Giddiest of all is the point when Kelly and then Bannen, each of
whom is about 70, wind up speeding down back roads on a motorcycle
naked. Though ``Waking Ned Devine'' doesn't have the tart edge of
``The Full Monty,'' it does share that film's flair for making an
improbably funny spectacle of men in the buff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine,'' whose title suggests the hearty Irish
wake that the film finally becomes, differs from most lottery
stories in that it turns out to be about generosity, not about
divisive greed. Johnson has said he had something like a
faster-paced ``Local Hero'' in mind.
</P>
<P>
   His film doesn't match the quirky enchantment of that one, but
it does have a similarly benign spirit. Shot in a government-owned
historical village on the Isle of Man, this film also shares the
sense of having wandered into a quaint, isolated world with its own
set of rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' could never work as well as it does
without the wonderful performances of the scrawny, supremely
dignified Kelly (a veteran stage actor who also worked on ``Fawlty
Towers''), the hearty Bannen and Ms. Flannagan as a wife who shares
her husband's taste for mischief and his case of lottery fever.
</P>
<P>
   (italics)``Waking Ned Devine'' is rated PG (Parental guidance
suggested). It includes rear-view nude images of its elderly male
stars.(end italics)

SURREAL, BUT NOT TAKING CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Start with the name Man Ray and you have the crux of
Man Ray's working method. His given name was Emmanuel Radnitzky.
But he cropped it, and cropped it well. He didn't become Manny
Radnik or Manuel Nitzy. He folded and trimmed his name so that the
new one would have a shiny new meaning, half human, half light. Man
Ray cropped with flair, and chance had nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Man Ray (1890-1976), who started out as a
painter and became famous for his Surrealist photographs of
fashion, art, women and objects, affected a lazy, devil-may-care
attitude. He often worked in bed. And like the rest of the
Surrealists, he admired all the uncanny things that could happen
when chance, randomness, dreams and the unconscious were given free
rein. But Man Ray did not practice what Surrealism preached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man Ray: Photography and Its Double,'' a surprising and
absorbing new exhibition at the International Center of Photography
Midtown, suggests that Man Ray kept chance on a very short leash.
While he cultivated the look of chance in his work, and even
invented stories about the role that chance had played in his
important discoveries, his actual working method _ shooting his
subjects from a distance, then carefully cropping the images to
make them look surreal _ could not have been more calculated.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this news now? For a long time, Man Ray has been
flash-frozen, known mostly for the few dozen iconic images that he
himself selected for his exhibitions and publications. (He was as
avid about cropping his oeuvre as he was about cropping individual
photographs.) But in 1994, a few years after Juliet Man Ray, the
artist's widow, died, part of the Man Ray estate _ 12,000 negatives
and 5,000 contact sheets _ went to the National Museum of Modern
Art in Paris. Lucien Treillard, Man Ray's personal assistant, added
to the windfall by throwing in another 1,500 negatives. At long
last, scholars had a chance to study Man Ray's working method
carefully. And what they found turns the story of the Surrealist
photographer upside down.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition of some 240 images, drawn from an exhibition
twice that size organized at the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris
by Emmanuelle de l'Ecotais and Alain Sayag, includes many of Man
Ray's greatest hits _ his solarization of Suzy Solidor, his
cameraless Rayographs of indecipherable objects, his ``Violon
d'Ingres,'' his portraits of Dora Maar, Lee Miller, Kiki of
Montparnasse, Picasso, Dali and Duchamp. But the real thrill is
seeing the contact prints with all of Man Ray's foldings and
markings. Because contact prints are made by placing the
photographic paper in direct contact with the negative, they show
exactly how the photographer framed his shot.
</P>
<P>
   Man Ray's contact prints prove, Ms. de l'Ecotais said, that he
never shot his pictures the way he intended them to be. Even though
Man Ray knew he would end up with a tightly cropped shot, he tended
to photograph his models from a great distance, often including the
props they used to hold their poses. Then he indicated the final
boundaries of each image by aggressively marking his contact print
with a pencil or red pen or even by folding or cutting it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``The Wasteland,'' one of Man Ray's few landscapes,
shows some tracks pointlessly running up a hill, the joint of a
tree branch as it splits from its trunk and the metal frame of an
abandoned bed. It looks like a ready-made Surrealist shot. But in
the contact print, you see all the things _ the rest of the tree
and a bit of another hill _ that make the landscape hang together
and look ordinary. And you see Man Ray's marks on the contact print
delineating how he planned to cut them all out. In other words, you
see Surrealism in the making.
</P>
<P>
   From the look of Man Ray's contact prints, the alterations could
be radical. But in the end the finished works were smooth and
seamless. A four-breasted torso, which in the exhibition is clearly
spliced together from two movie stills, turned out smooth, seamless
and therefore uncanny in the final version (which is not in the
exhibition). ``Composition,'' a fashion shot from 1936, shows a
woman in a ball gown against a pure black background standing and
looking up at a reflection of herself seated. Odd as it is, it has
a perfectly untouched look, as if this were exactly the way Man Ray
found her.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Man Ray's finished works are so finished that they have
a glaze of inevitability about them. So it is exciting, even
touching, to see how they came by their surreality.
</P>
<P>
   Take Man Ray's most famous photograph, ``Le Violon d'Ingres.''
The finished print, which was owned by the Surrealist Andre Breton,
looks as if Man Ray instantaneously saw the shape of the violin in
his model's back and simply drew in the f-holes to complete the
picture. But the outtakes tell a different story. There is a
side-view of the same model, Kiki, in the same turban and
waist-cloth, and there is a shot of her with her hands laced on her
head. As Ms. de l'Ecotais observed, ``It is as if Man Ray said to
himself `What am I going to do with this great body?''' and then
made a methodical tour.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And what of Man Ray's well-known picture of Lee Miller's head
trapped in a wire hat? Part of what makes this photograph surreal
is the indecipherability of that thing on her head. In this show it
is no longer indecipherable. Among the many contact prints that Man
Ray made that day are some with a nude Miller wearing the wire
contraption on her arm. It is clearly a cast. The surrealism of the
final photograph depended not only on Man Ray's cropping the
picture itself, but also on his suppressing the pictures that
showed the cast on the arm, where it belonged.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting session for ``Tears'' shows the value of
methodically suppressing the mundane. This exhibition does not
include the well-known print that shows only the huge
mascara-covered eyes looking upward and the huge, round glass tears
perched near the nose, but it does include some full-face shots
taken the same day. The uncropped faces do not look surreal, and
the glass beads stuck to them do not look like big tears. They just
look silly.
</P>
<P>
   Silly can be good. What this show restores is some of the fun
that went into making these pictures. Take for example the now
iconic photograph called ``Prayer.'' It is a woman's rump with her
feet and hands tucked under her. You would never know from looking
at this now-mythic shot that it once was part of a playful
melodramatic sequence showing a woman meeting her lover, then
smoking, lying down on her stomach, praying and finally being
stabbed by her jealous husband, played by Man Ray himself. In the
final frame, the woman's blood, drawn in childish red ink, runs
from the puncture wound in her chest into a little pool by her
side.
</P>
<P>
   You want childish? Take Man Ray's series of his friend Marcel
Duchamp shampooing his hair. In 1924, Duchamp decided he wanted to
learn more about the mysterious laws of chance. So he planned a
trip to Monte Carlo to test a scheme he devised for winning at
roulette. To finance his trip, he issued bonds. And for the center
of each bond, he needed a picture of himself. Man Ray obliged by
photographing Duchamp with his hair shampooed into a frothy pair of
horns.
</P>
<P>
   On the bonds, Duchamp looks like the devil himself, intent on
gambling. But in the original, uncropped contact prints, you can
see the devil's soapy preparations with his sleeves rolled up. One
shows Duchamp's hands calmly whipping up the foam to get ready for
the next shot. Another shows Duchamp before the suds had reached
their demonic peaks. He looks damp and bedraggled. It is clear from
these outtakes that the Surrealist touch was a matter of careful
selection, cropping and working up.
</P>
<P>
   Why aren't these outtakes better known? Did Man Ray find
something shameful about having to work so hard to get the effects
he wanted? Whatever the reason, he suppressed the signs of his work
and gave chance and accident all the credit for his advances.
</P>
<P>
   Take the 1922 image that helped make Man Ray a famous
portraitist, his picture of Luisa Casati with two sets of eyes. In
his autobiography, Man Ray attributed the portrait to a series of
mishaps. He said that when he took this picture, his electrical
system failed and he was forced to use daylight and a long
exposure. When he asked his subject to sit still, instead she
``acted as if I were doing a movie of her.'' When he developed the
negatives he found them ``all blurry'' and ``worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a great creation story, but, as the curator points out,
impossible. The archival picture shows two distinct sets of eyes
rather than a blur, indicating that Man Ray intentionally made a
double exposure ``by opening the lens twice.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not Man Ray's only tall tale. He attributed his 1922
discovery of the photogram, which he called a Rayograph, to the day
that he absent-mindedly placed some objects from the darkroom,
including a glass funnel and a thermometer, on a piece of unexposed
photographic paper, which just happened to be sitting in a
development bath. And he concocted an even more improbable story
about his 1929 discovery of solarization, which involved a mouse
running across Lee Miller's foot.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over again, Man Ray claimed for chance what should
really have been claimed for hard work. Over and over again, he hid
his conscious, deliberate methods behind the glaze of a smooth,
uncanny result. Why? Or to state it another way, if Man Ray cared
so much about chance, why didn't he rely on it more? Why didn't he
try to get Surrealist effects straight out of the camera? Perhaps
it was because he did not agree with Breton's idea that
``Surrealism is contained in reality itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, after Man Ray made the shift from painting to
photography, straight photography was all the rage. Photographers
were trying to reproduce reality with their cameras. Man Ray went
the other way. By shooting his subjects from a distance and then
cropping them down to their final dimensions he was, Ms. de
l'Ecotais said, ``making a gap between reality and its images.'' In
other words, he cared less about championing chance than fighting
against naive realism. And the best way to fight realism is not to
find the surreal in the real but to refuse to take reality
straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man Ray: Photography and Its Double'' remains at the
International Center of Photography Midtown, 1133 Ave. of the
Americas, at 43rd Street, through Jan. 24. It is sponsored by
Calvin Klein.

 Order Out of Business Card Chaos  
 By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business cards are the bane of my existence. Everywhere I go I
collect them. I swear that I'll enter them into my database as soon
as I get back to the hotel. I'll do maybe one or two, but then
fatigue creeps in and sleep is more important. At the end of each
trip, I dump the stack of cards in a desk drawer with all the rest
of those that I've never typed into the computer. The desk draw is
full.
</P>
<P>
   The problem becomes especially acute during conventions and
trade shows. As you read this, I'll be at Comdex in Las Vegas,
where 200,000 of my best friends will all try to give me their
business cards. There is no room in my desk drawer.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to be done. The something is to take another look
at business card scanners. I had one several years ago, but I
quickly stopped using it because the Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) software just didn't work very well. The problem was that
companies and individuals try to make their cards distinctive. That
distinctiveness -- fancy fonts, intricate logos and sideways
printing -- caused real headaches for the scanning software.
</P>
<P>
   With the right software, you can use just about any
TWAIN-complaint scanner, but there are several companies that make
dedicated business card scanners. I tested Corex Technologies'
CardScan 300. The company was one of the first into the market and
is one of the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It took very little time to get up and running. It took exactly
22 minutes from the time I opened the box, including reading the
Quick Start Guide, until I scanned my first card into the system.
My only complaint about the process was that the A/C power brick is
as heavy as a real brick. I can't remember when I've seen a heavier
one. It weighs more than the scanner. I'm going to have to have a
really good reason to scan cards on the road before I lug that
thing around. Cards are going to get scanned when I get back home.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, the software has reached a point where it whips
through a variety of business cards without breathing hard. While
you have to feed the scanner one card at a time, it zips them
through fast enough that you can keep a steady flow going. The
software then processes them all at once -- what we old-timers call
batch mode.
</P>
<P>
   I fed through 156 cards and the software failed to read only 4
of them. Each one was really off the chart. One was gold leaf with
Old English script. Another had a black background with silver
letters. The third had a picture and the text wrapped around it.
The last one had all the text woven through the company's logo.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that all the cards were translated perfectly.
I had to edit about five percent of them. But even those edits were
minor. I had one from a professor whose titles ran on forever. The
software has a simple solution when it cannot figure out where to
put information. It dumps it all in a category called ``Other'' and
lets you figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   While the ability to accurately read, translate and properly
categorize business cards is the core of the product, I was most
impressed with how well it then moved that data into other programs
and devices. This is no mean feat. The CD-ROM comes with a version
with a version of Intellisync for all the popular personal
information manager (PIM) software products. It also lets you link
directly to Palm Pilot and Windows CE devices. I had it set to
update my address book in both Outlook 98 and my Palm III. It
worked the first time without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Card Scan software is quite good as a stand alone contact
manager. While it lacks the functionality of the full-featured
programs, I found it wonderful as a sort of clearing house for
database clean up. On occasions, a hot sync will fail during a
normal Palm Pilot transfer, and when it finally works again, I can
end up with duplicate entries. The Card Scan software has a ``find
duplicate'' function and it took no time to get rid of the excess.
A re-sync and all my databases matched.
</P>
<P>
   Two pleasant things developed during this evaluation, I found
the card of a missing friend and my desk drawer is now half empty.

with a version of Intellisync for all the popular personal
information manager (PIM) software products. It also lets you link
directly to Palm Pilot and Windows CE devices. I had it set to
update my address book in both Outlook 98 and my Palm III. It
worked the first time without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Card Scan software is quite good as a stand alone contact
manager. While it lacks the functionality of the full-featured
programs, I found it wonderful as a sort of clearing house for
database clean up. On occasions, a hot sync will fail during a
normal Palm Pilot transfer, and when it finally works again, I can
end up with duplicate entries. The Card Scan software has a ``find
duplicate'' function and it took no time to get rid of the excess.
A re-sync and all my databases matched.
</P>
<P>
   Two pleasant things developed during this evaluation, I found
the card of a missing friend and my desk drawer is now half empty.

ARTS(AT)LARGE 
 HIGH-TECH COMPANIES SLOW TO SUPPORT HIGH-TECH ART 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to Bill Viola, David Ross was able to play Andrew S.
Grove like a fiddle. But high-tech companies' support for
multimedia creativity still sounds more like a string trio than a
symphony.
</P>
<P>
   During a retrospective of Viola's video art at the Whitney
Museum of American Art in New York last spring, Ross, then the
Whitney's director, led Grove, chairman of the mammoth chip maker
Intel Corp., on a tour of the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was blown away by it,'' Ross, now the director of the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art, recalled in a recent telephone
interview. ``From that point on, the conversations with others at
Intel became a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Those conversations culminated in a late-September announcement
that Intel would commit $6 million to sponsor ``The American
Century: Art and Culture 1900-2000,'' a sprawling overview
scheduled to open at the Whitney in April before moving to SFMOMA
in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy was impressed'' by the Viola tour, said Dana Houghton,
Intel's director of corporate affairs. ``Andy had been pretty
lukewarm. He's chairman of the company, and if he's lukewarm, it's
pretty hard to spend 6 million bucks without him knowing about it.
I don't know if it was Viola's work or Ross's salesmanship --
probably a combination of both.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the grant is believed to be the largest ever given
to an art museum for a specific exhibit -- and the $6 million
figure does not include another $2 million to $4 million for what
Houghton described as ``digital extensions'' to the show, including
an education-oriented Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant to those interested in digital art is Intel's
willingness to finance commissions if the museums decide they want
to complement the ``American Century'' exhibit with new work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got money to do those kinds of things,'' Houghton said.
``Those are not real high-budget programs. You could do quite a bit
for a couple hundred thousand bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if that amount seems small in context, it represents a
remarkable departure for the computer industry, which has been slow
in supporting the new-media arts initiatives that its own
technology has enabled.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the heart of Silicon Valley, known as a hothouse
for digital creativity, the San Jose Museum of Art has not
progressed as quickly as officials had expected in collecting funds
for a 900-square-foot multimedia center, bringing in just half of
its $1.3 million goal so far. Among the projects planned for the
space, scheduled to open in a year, are a computer-based
three-dimensional recreation of the avant-garde electronic-art show
in the Pepsi pavilion at the 1970 World's Fair in Osaka, Japan, as
well as an Internet database providing access to the work of Bay
Area new media artists.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after its Whitney pledge, Intel did make a donation of
$10,000 to the San Jose center. Josi Callan, the museum's director,
said she was pleased that the chip maker was finally supporting the
arts in a substantial way, but that it was a ``bit of a
disappointment that it wasn't closer to home.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that Silicon Valley denizens are not
always accustomed to encountering high-tech art, said Randall
Packer, the San Jose art museum's director of multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is also a contributor to the newly reopened Tech Museum of
Innovation in San Jose, which has a high-tech art gallery called
``Center of the Edge.'' During a recent visit, Packer heard an
attendant describe one virtual-reality piece, Michael Naimark's
``Be Now Here,'' as ``the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who work in the industry here are not particularly
interested in art,'' Packer said. ``They're interested in
technology, and they love the idea that there's a museum where you
can go see the latest technology -- and have fun. But in terms of
the sociocultural context of technology, that's just not what turns
them on. That's why I'm so impressed with David's work with Andy
Grove. He somehow managed to spark his imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hero, president of Community Foundation Silicon Valley,
which promotes philanthropy in the region, confirmed that ``there
aren't any really big corporate givers to the arts out here.''
</P>
<P>
   But a major factor that hinders arts giving in the area, Hero
explained, is that most of the companies are young, staffed by
employees who are relatively new to the region and managed by
executives who do not yet grasp that a strong cultural base can
help attract and retain workers. ``They just don't feel that
community obligation yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hero recalled a conversation several years ago with Bill
Hewlett, co-founder of the Hewlett-Packard Company, who he said
told him, ``Don't be so frustrated. These companies are so new. We
weren't really known for our charitable giving until we were 20
years old, but that was in 1964.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: some high-tech companies have supported, and
continue to support, traditional arts programs. While they are not
as closely associated with the arts as Philip Morris, Sara Lee,
Texaco and Reader's Digest, technology companies like IBM and
Hewlett-Packard actively support museums, orchestras and other
cultural institutions. Microsoft Corp. even has an art acquisition
committee that arranges for works to be displayed throughout the
software giant's campus.
</P>
<P>
   The largest gesture on this front was the Oct. 27 announcement
that five Dell Computer Corp. executives and their wives would
donate $13 million toward the construction of a new $35 million
home for the Austin Museum of Art, which is near Dell's home base
of Round Rock, Tex. Elizabeth Ferrer, the museum's director, said
one of the building's exhibit spaces would be designated as the Art
and Technology Gallery, devoted exclusively to artists who
incorporate technology into their work.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the National Endowment for the Arts is still
coping with budget cutbacks, this kind of support from the
high-tech community is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Jedlicka, president of the Business Committee for the
Arts in New York, said, ``High-tech companies are involved in the
arts; they just don't receive a lot of publicity for their
involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose art museum's Packer said: ``It's difficult to have
the opportunity to deal with highly educated people who are
interested in culture in Silicon Valley. Sometimes you wonder if
they really exist.''

FORMER PLAYMATE WINS ROUND IN FIGHT OVER WEB SITE LABELS 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terri Welles, a Playboy centerfold model turned Internet
entrepreneur, has won another significant round in court to protect
her right to use the magic words ``Playmate'' and ``Playboy'' to
promote her Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In a blow to her former employer, Playboy Enterprises Inc., the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Diego
recently affirmed a lower court ruling and refused to grant an
injunction that would have temporarily prohibited Welles from using
the bunny empire's trademarked words in her ``meta tags'' -- hidden
labels in a Web page that draw the attention of Internet search
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy, which claims that Welles' meta tags are sneaky and
unfair, is far from willing to give up the legal fight. The company
is seeking permission to add new charges to its $5 million
trademark infringement complaint and is preparing for a full-blown
trial in federal court in San Diego next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the intensifying legal scrapping, the case is helping to
answer a question that has important implications for electronic
commerce: What is the purpose of a meta tag?
</P>
<P>
   In general, meta tags provide information that is not intended
to be read by Web users. Some give instructions to users' browsers
on how a Web page should be displayed. The kind of meta tags at
issue in the Welles case provide information about the page's
content to the robots used by search engines to update their
databases. For example, the operator of an investment site might
include the words ``stocks'' and ``trading'' in the ``keyword''
meta tag of the site's home page.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy says a meta tag containing the word ``Playmate''
indicates that the site is authorized by or connected to the
Playboy empire. It says that Web users who type the keyword
``Playmate'' into a search engine could be confusingly diverted to
the Welles site, which is not affiliated with the Chicago-based
company.
</P>
<P>
   Welles's response is that a meta tag merely indicates the
contents of a particular Web site -- and that in her case, the
inclusion of the word ``Playmate'' is justified because, as her Web
pages accurately state, she is a former Playboy Playmate. Her view
has been endorsed by the courts so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Court of Appeals' ruling reaffirmed what my lawyers and I
have known all along,'' Welles said in a telephone interview. ``I
can use the words 'Playboy' and 'Playmate' as descriptive terms in
my meta tags because that was my title. That's who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Welles, a San Diego resident who was crowned Playmate of the
Year for 1981 and is now a single mother of a teen-age daughter,
said she will see the case through, despite the cost. She said she
has spent about $120,000 on legal bills to protect her Web
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so far into it, I can't see quitting,'' she said. ``This
is my livelihood. This is how I feed my daughter. And I'm right.''
</P>
<P>
   Welles's Web site, which was launched last year, features nude
photographs of herself and others, biographical notes about her
days at the Playboy Mansion and a personal appearance calendar. She
says she has 500 to 600 subscribers who pay $9.95 a month for
access to the photo collection. The site also features banners that
advertise more explicit sex sites. Along with the words
``Playmate'' and ``Playboy,'' the site's meta tags include other
keywords like ``Welles,'' ``model,'' ``naked'' and ``breasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Playboy filed a trademark suit against
Welles, claiming that her site unlawfully used its registered
trademarks, like ``Playmate'' and ``Playboy,'' in its text and in
the invisible meta tags. The company also sought a preliminary
injunction before trial -- a standard tactic in a
trademark-infringement suit.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, Judge Judith N. Keep denied Playboy's motion in
federal appeals court in San Diego. Concluding in part that Playboy
was unlikely to win its case on the merits, the judge said that
because Welles was a Playboy Playmate, she could state her title
and employment history in the text of her Web site -- a ``fair
use'' of Playboy's trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoning that a meta tag was similar to a card catalog entry
that describes the content of a book, Judge Keep said that Welles
could also use the trademarked terms in her meta tags because they
accurately reflected the contents of her site.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of the consequences of a Welles victory, Playboy
appealed the ruling to the Ninth Circuit, focusing its argument
more on the meta tag issue. But on Oct. 27, in a four-paragraph
decision that did not address the merits of the case, a three-judge
appeals panel said Judge Keep had not abused her authority in
making the decision. The case is now scheduled for a pretrial
hearing in April.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in what some legal observers have termed an
aggressive move, Playboy three weeks ago asked permission to amend
its original complaint to add a claim of trademark counterfeiting
against Welles -- a charge that, if proven, could result in
statutory damages and the seizure of her computer server, hard
drives and other alleged counterfeiting materials. The company is
also seeking to sue, as a new co-defendant, the man who originally
set up Welles' site and who actually placed the Playboy trademarks
in her meta tags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going after the webmaster puts one more degree of pressure on
Terri Welles,'' said Liam B. Lavery, an intellectual property
lawyer in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also chills the market,'' he said. ``It says, in a sense,
'Nobody ought to be doing this, otherwise we will go after you and
the person who helped you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lavery added that he believes Welles will eventually win. He
said that her situation is very different from other cases
involving meta tags, where unscrupulous Web site owners used the
trademarks of business competitors in a meta tag for no other
reason than to misdirect potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Oppedahl, a cyberspace law expert based in Colorado who was
involved in one of the first meta tag cases, agreed: ``If she was a
Playmate of the Year, how can it be wrong to tell people?''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Playboy says it is unfair and simplistic to
characterize the continuing lawsuit as a David vs. Goliath battle,
or as an effort by the company to protect the franchise of its
recently launched subscription Web site, which allows members to
view photos of past Playmates.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Francescani, a lawyer in New York who represents
Playboy, says the implications of a Welles victory are ominous for
all trademark holders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say a hard-core sex site out there posts a story about
Hugh Hefner and Playboy,'' said Francescani. Under the Terri Welles
theory, it could then embed the words ``Hefner'' and ``Playboy'' in
its meta tags because those keywords reflect the content of the
site. ``But that's not fair at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey R. Kuester, an intellectual property lawyer in Atlanta
who has written about meta tags, rejected the Playboy lawyer's
gloomy scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``What prevents a porn site from writing or posting an article
about Playboy?'' he asked. ``Nothing. It's free speech. And if
there is a legitimate editorial use of another company's
trademarks, if it's okay to use a word on a Web site from a
trademark point of view, then sticking that word in a meta tag
doesn't make it wrong.''

COLLEGE OPENS STUDENT RECORDS TO MOM AND DAD 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Deborah A. Dixon wants to see how her son, Eric, a freshman
at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania, is doing at school she no
longer has to pick up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she can power up the computer at home or at work and
visit the college's Web site. There, after punching in a user name
and a private password, she can find information ranging from
course descriptions and syllabuses to her son's grades and his bill
at the bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   It's all done with Eric's permission, via a novel computer
service launched recently at the small liberal arts college
situated about a mile from the Civil War battlefield. ``It's
wonderful, because I live so far from campus,'' said Dixon, a
Chicago resident. ``I can check on his classes and see how he's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The service is an addition to what the college has dubbed
``CNAV,'' a Web-based system developed by the school to give
students easy access to their transcripts, bills and other
information. Each student is given a password to see his or her
private records online as well as gain entry to other features,
like a computer matchmaking service that brings up courses or
extra-curricular offerings that match the student's interests.
Through CNAV, students can also see a list of names and photographs
of other students enrolled in the courses they are taking.
</P>
<P>
   It was an inadvertent misuse of the system that led college
officials to decide to open up portions of CNAV to parents,
according to Donald L. Redman, a programmer analyst who helps run
the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we'd notice that a kid would log on from campus and
then a half hour later log on from New Jersey, which, no matter how
fast you drive is just not feasible,'' he said. In other words, a
student excited about the system would invite Mom and Dad to take a
peek courtesy of his password -- and contrary to requirements that
he keep his password strictly to himself.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to the system administrators that parents might be
interested in some version of CNAV and they set about designing the
service that was unveiled at Fall Family Weekend in late October.
</P>
<P>
   About 140 parents have requested accounts with the system. They
are given their own passwords, which they use to access a number of
features, including the matchmaking service, which can call up
items that might be of interest to them. Their children decide how
much personal information they allow their parents to see. They are
given a list of six items, including grades and phone bills, and
check off which ones they want the folks at home to be able to
access.
</P>
<P>
   Eric decided to show his mother everything. ``I saw no reason
not to,'' he said. ``These are things she should see anyway --
bills, things like that. It's nothing incriminating.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say whether Gettysburg is the only college or
university to open up its student records to parents
electronically. Redman said he believes Parent CNAV is unique.
Kenneth C. Green, who directs an annual study of technology use on
campus, and Garret W. Sern, a policy analyst for Educause, an
organization that promotes the use of technology in higher
education, both said they were unaware of any similar service, but
added they could not say for sure that others don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Green said the project points to a larger trend in colleges: an
effort by administrators to use the Internet to reach the
non-campus community. ``You see more campuses looking at electronic
access for lots of different audiences, such as providing e-mail
services to alumni,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Redman said the project was launched to bring parents,
who may live hundreds of miles from campus, into the college
community. ``The point is to connect the parent to the student and
the general college atmosphere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some elementary and secondary schools are beginning to share
records with parents via the World Wide Web, too. For about a year
and a half the Uinta County School District in Wyoming has offered
parents access to everything from grades to attendance records as
part of a test of a product called PowerSchool. The product, which
is now in about 90 schools, mostly in Utah, will be officially
launched in January, according to a company sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the Gettysburg College system raises questions. Robert
Ellis Smith, the publisher of Privacy Journal, a newsletter
examining the impact of technology on privacy, said he believes the
Web is still not secure enough from hackers and other
mischief-makers to house sensitive student records, whose privacy,
he noted, is protected by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also said he hopes the system is set up so that students
fully understand what it is they are allowing their parents to see.
``Consent should be meaningful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Redman responded that administrators keep an eye on the system
to prevent unwanted intrusions. And, he said, he believes that at a
time when people increasingly conduct financial transactions over
the Web, the network can be kept safe from prying eyes. ``What we
are delivering is equal to the way that's done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Redman also said he believes that offering students a check-off
list of items to open -- or close -- to their parents helps build
informed consent into the system. ``Students have to be proactive
and say 'Yes, I want to show them that,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that not all students will be as liberal with their
check-offs as Eric. Redman recalled a comment made by one parent
during a demonstration of the system at family weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the fathers said: 'I don't think my son will let me see
his transcript. He likes to break that to me gently.'''

 &HT;    PROFILES OF POTENTIAL WITNESSES IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
 &HT;    EDS: Hyde plans to have the formal vote to approve these
subpoenas at a meeting immediately after Starr's testimony ends.
Since the GOP has more votes, they should be approved.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., has said Republicans
on his House Judiciary Committee plan to subpoena at least four
witnesses other than Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, who
testified Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Each would be questioned privately by committee staff members.
Some might then be called to testify before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   DANIEL A. GECKER
</P>
<P>
   An attorney in Richmond, Va., he represented Kathleen Willey
during much of the time that she dealt with demands for her sworn
testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit and in the
independent counsel's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Willey has charged, denied and then charged once again that
President Clinton made an unwelcome and uninvited pass at her in
1993, when she was a White House volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Willey's attorney-client privilege would keep Gecker from
talking about his dealings with her. But Republicans want to know
whether Gecker, 42, noticed signs that other people were trying to
influence Willey's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   NATHAN LANDOW
</P>
<P>
   He met Willey when she and his daughter were both White House
volunteers during Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
   He has confirmed to reporters that last fall he had her flown
from her home in Virginia to his retreat on Maryland's Eastern
Shore to discuss her misgivings, but has denied that he told Willey
to perjure herself or to avoid testifying.
</P>
<P>
   But when he was subpoenaed this year to testify before a grand
jury seeking to find out whether whatever he said was done on his
own or on behalf of the president, Landow invoked his Fifth
Amendment right not to testify. He may have feared opening the door
to questions concerning another federal probe, which concerns his
dealings with an Indian tribe that had hoped its campaign
contributions would help it obtain approval of a land deal by the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Landow, 65, is a developer whose nationwide business started
with projects in the District of Columbia and its suburbs. A former
Maryland Democratic Party chairman, Landow is best known as a
gregarious Democratic volunteer who specializes in convincing other
rich business people to give up to $1,000 apiece to presidential
campaigns. He raised substantial funds in 1976 for Jimmy Carter,
and a total of $600,000 for the 1992 and 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaigns, and even more for the losing campaigns of Walter Mondale
in 1984 and Al Gore in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   BRUCE R. LINDSEY
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who graduated from Rhodes College and Georgetown Law
school, the 50-year-old Arkansan has known Clinton since 1968,
offering personal and professional advice and relaxing with
hundreds of games of hearts during all of Clinton's campaigns for
and terms as governor and president.
</P>
<P>
   A close and close-mouthed confidant, Lindsay has been involved
in many of Clinton's discussions and strategy sessions on how to
deal with career-threatening controversies over concerns ranging
from early Whitewater land deals to Monica Lewinsky's testimony and
the rejection of suspicious contributions to Clinton's first legal
defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   Because Lindsey is on the public payroll as deputy White House
counsel, Clinton was unable to convince the courts that
attorney-client privilege could be invoked to keep Lindsey from
testifying before one of Starr's grand juries. Though that
testimony turned out to be relatively innocuous, Starr has since
tried to convince the Judiciary Committee that when Clinton and
Lindsey discussed the handling of the Paula Jones lawsuit, the
president was improperly using a government attorney ``to assist
his personal legal defense.''
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT S. BENNETT
</P>
<P>
   As the private attorney defending Clinton against the sexual
harassment lawsuit brought by Paula Jones, Bennett succeeded in
delaying the case until after the 1996 election, then convinced a
judge to throw out the lawsuit. Jones appealed, but Bennett
negotiated a settlement before the appeals court ruled on the case.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the president was answering questions under oath
during that lawsuit, he falsely denied that he had a sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Starr has told the committee
that he believes that Lewinsky and Clinton conspired to lie in that
case. How Bennett, 58, could offer useful testimony without
violating his legal duty to protect Clinton's attorney-client
privilege is unclear.

   THE WATERBOY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adam Sandler, Kathy Bates, Henry Winkler, Jerry Reid, Fairuza
Balk &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Frank Coraci &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 91 minutes
</P>
<P>
   An extremely simple bayou boy of 31, Bobby Boucher ( Sandler)
lives with his mama (Ms. Bates) and works as ``water distribution
engineer'' for a nationally ranked college football team.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby talks as if he had a Ping-Pong ball surgically implanted
in his mouth and is interested only in the elaborate water buffets
(no Gatorade) he sets out along the sidelines. The players, abusive
imbeciles all, relentlessly make fun of him, as does their
demagogic coach (Reid), who finally fires him.
</P>
<P>
   Mama is delighted because that will keep Bobby at home with her
and away from such influences as sex and education. But the gentle,
sensitive Bobby remains the idiot savant of water serving.
</P>
<P>
   Against Mama's wishes, he takes a job at a grubby little school
whose team, the Mud Cats, have lost 40 straight. There the players
are still louts, but the long-suffering coach (Winkler) taps the
anger in Bobby and turns him into a linebacker who makes 20 sacks a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Soon ESPN takes notice, as does a big-hearted and sexy former
convict (Ms. Balk), who makes the liberation of Bobby her special
project. At first Mama reacts by grounding her boy, but later, in
an epiphany of enlightenment, she frees him to do as he wishes. And
so it's on to the Bourbon Bowl and the inevitable showdown with
Bobby's old team. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE On the field, it's a smash-mouth brand of football.
Otherwise none. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX There is some playful nudity and plenty of relatively mild
innuendo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY A moderate amount. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-7 Written on an infantile level, the movie is clear
enough in many respects, but it's not for small children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8-10 By this age they are responding to Sandler's siren's
call. And the film is harmless enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP ``The Waterboy'' has taken in more than $80
million at the box office, helping make Sandler one of the hottest
film actors. Here is the ultimate underdog. Teen-agers especially
appreciate Bobby's goofball vulnerability, not-so-stupid stupidity
and good-natured resilience. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SIEGE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington, Bruce Willis, Annette Bening, Tony Shaloub &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Edward Zwick &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R 109 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A bomb tears apart a bus in lower Manhattan, and a larger blast
claims many victims in a Broadway theater. A confluence of federal
agents, squabbling mightily over who has jurisdiction, determine it
is the work of Arab terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI man, Anthony Hubbard (Washington), is nominally in charge
of the case, but he is not receiving full cooperation from Elise
Kraft (Ms. Bening), a shady CIA operative and Middle East
specialist who has much inside information on terrorist cells but
isn't sharing it with Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   Then somebody drives a van full of explosives into a federal
building, killing 600 people. Another terrorist with a bomb holds a
classroom full of children as hostages. The city is in a panic.
Hate crimes against Arab-Americans are rising.
</P>
<P>
   With Hubbard and Kraft not making much headway, it is decided to
send in the Army and declare martial law. That introduces Maj. Gen.
William Devereaux ( Willis), who narrows the hunt to 20 individuals
among the Arab-American community in Brooklyn. The object, as
Devereaux sees it, is to seal off the borough, ``squeeze it'' and
``be home in time for the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of innocent Arab-Americans are thrown into an
internment camp. But the city rebels against the military presence.
Meanwhile, Hubbard is making some progress on his own. But with the
general obstructing him at every turn, can he crack the case?
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Bombings are graphic (in the theater explosion, one
woman emerges minus an arm), and point-blank shootings rip big
holes in people. At one point, the general tortures a suspect and
executes him. That scene is not shown, but the victim screams
loudly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Kraft makes love to a suspect, with the pair fleetingly
shown coupling by an infrared surveillance camera.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY A lot and strong. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE In keeping with the World Trade Center and Oklahoma
City bombings, this kind of scenario plays in our darker
imaginings. The ethnic factor and questions of civil rights also
might have inspired thoughtful treatment. Instead, banalities of
dialogue and predictability of plot reduce the subject to
commonplace action fare. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12 To begin with, the film isn't for any children, but
with visions of fireballs and Willis, many youngsters could be
attracted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP They too might be expecting a summer action film,
but this one is talky, with internecine wrangling _ a tired device
to begin with in movies of this kind _ so protracted it almost
becomes parody.
</P>
<P>
   I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy, Freddie Prinze Jr., Matthew
Settle, Mekhi Phifer, Muse Watson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Danny Cannon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R 96 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, as was related in the first movie of the series
(same title but delete the ``Still''), some graduating high school
seniors in a BMW accidentally ran over Ben Willis (Watson) and
tried to cover up the matter by tossing his body into the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   However, Willis revived and, understandably annoyed, dressed
himself in a long slicker and began polishing off the young people
one by one with a cargo hook.
</P>
<P>
   One summer later, only Julie (Ms. Hewitt) and Ray (Prinze)
survive. Julie's nightmares place the man with the hook in every
nook and cranny, but it's not until a stormy weekend in the Bahamas
that she and three friends meet him face to face. On with the blood
bath.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Willis buries his hook into throats and skulls and does
in others by alternative means (at one point, he tries to grill
Julie in a tanning machine). The violence is gory and, from about
the midway point in the film, so continual and predictable that all
suspense is lost. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Two of Julie's friends (Brandy and Phifer) talk about all
the sex they're going to have, but they never seem to get around to
it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY A stream. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP In the recent tradition of the slasher movies
``Scream'' and `'Scream 2,'' not to mention ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer,'' this kind of movie is designed for teen-agers.
Parents should be aware (as if most aren't already).

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The battle over the Helen Hayes Theater ended this
week with the announcement that ``Band in Berlin,'' a new musical
about a singing troupe in Nazi Germany, would open there in late
February.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the theater's owner, Martin Markinson, to book
the musical was a heartbreaker for two off-Broadway hits vying for
a Broadway house: ``Wit,'' Margaret Edson's acclaimed drama, and
``This Is Our Youth,'' a dark comedy by Kenneth Lonergan.
</P>
<P>
   But by week's end there was a happy ending for at least one of
the shows. Negotiations were completed Thursday to bring ``Wit'' to
the Union Square Theater, a 499-seat house where ``Visiting Green''
closes on Sunday. ``Wit'' will finish its current run on Dec. 13 at
the 99-seat MCC Theater before reopening later that week in the
larger space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're totally thrilled,'' said Bernard Telsey, who will
produce the show along with Daryl Roth and the Long Wharf Theater.
``It's going to be the same intimate experience but for 500 people
a night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Our Youth,'' meanwhile, was also negotiating a
possible deal to move from its current home at Second Stage to the
Minetta Lane, where ``Primary English Class'' is folding after a
rude reception from critics.
</P>
<P>
   At the Helen Hayes, Markinson said he hoped ``Getting and
Spending,'' the current occupant, would last into 1999. But don't
count on it; weekly grosses are hovering around $70,000, an
estimated weekly loss of more than $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Band in Berlin,'' the move to Broadway comes as a pleasant
surprise. The show had originally been scheduled to open in
November at the Union Square but was bumped when the producer of
``Visiting Green'' unexpectedly extended that show. ``The Helen
Hayes was always my dream,'' said Robert V. Straus, a producer of
``Berlin.'' ``I didn't really want any other theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Something's Coming
</P>
<P>
   When Livent was chosen in August to renovate the Times Square
Theater on West 42d Street, it triumphed over higher bidders
because it planned a new theater for the space. But now that the
deal has collapsed, live performance may not be in the cards for
the 78-year-old landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Cora Cahan, the president of New 42d Street, which oversees the
space, said this week that of the half-dozen candidates for the
renovation, most made it clear they were not interested in building
a performance space. The theater poses several problems for
productions, ranging from its age to potential noise problems, to
its lack of an adequate lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really great for theater in its current state,'' Ms.
Cahan said.
</P>
<P>
   A real estate executive said current candidates included
Empire!, a Roman gladiator-theme restaurant; the Laugh Factory, a
comedy club, as well as the Manhattan Theater Club and the producer
Alexander H. Cohen, with a proposal for a vaudeville theater. Ms.
Cahan said she hoped for a decision by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Experience Optional
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect, most Broadway producers are a, well,
mature breed. And manly, too.
</P>
<P>
   Not Arielle Tepper. At 26, she is by far the youngest producer
on Broadway today, sharing top billing on Sandra Bernhard's ``I'm
Still Here . . . Damn It!''
</P>
<P>
   The show is Ms. Tepper's second on Broadway; her first was John
Leguizamo's ``Freak,'' which she produced with Gregory Mosher and
Bill Haber. Off-Broadway, Ms. Tepper is involved in ``Villa
Villa,'' at the Daryl Roth, and ``Trainspotting,'' at the Player's
Theater. Not bad for a woman whose first professional producing
experience was in March 1997, putting on an unknown musical in a
small theater in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a job after my freshman year in college in a production
office,'' Ms. Tepper said, speaking from a cellular phone from the
set of an independent film she's producing in Yonkers. ``Within 24
hours I knew this was what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tepper grew up in a wealthy family on the Upper East Side of
Manhattan and attended the Dalton School before studying lighting
design at Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   Like her idol, Cameron Mackintosh, she has experienced both
success and something less. While ``Freak'' was a hit, and ``I'm
Still Here'' is showing promise, ``Trainspotting'' has had a rough
time with the critics. Still, Ms. Tepper seems undeterred. ``If
I've figured one thing out,'' she said, ``it's the only way to
learn is to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   `Godot' Has Arrived
</P>
<P>
   Add ``Waiting for Godot'' and ``Stop Kiss'' to the growing list
of off-Broadway productions showing strong sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godot,'' which opened on Wednesday at the 180-seat Classic
Stage Company on East 13th Street, has sold out almost all its
six-week run, through Dec. 20. Barry Edelstein, the artistic
director of the theater, said that it had held back 500 seats, and
that those tickets would go sale today at $45, up from $35. With
apologies to Beckett, the obvious draw has been the cast: John
Turturro, Tony Shalhoub and Christopher Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to see actors they know are great,'' Edelstein
said. ``And in our theater, you're sitting five feet away.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of ``Stop Kiss'' is less easily explained. The play,
which began previews at the Public Theater on Tuesday, was about 85
percent sold out by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction has flummoxed the playwright, Diana Son, whose most
recent work had a brief off-off-Broadway run earlier this year.
``Stop Kiss'' concerns the repercussions on the lives of two women
after they kiss. ``I think people have heard it's a comedy about
New York, a drama about gay bashing and a love story, and it really
is all of those,'' said Ms. Son, 32. ``I guess people want to see
if we can pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   You Know His Name
</P>
<P>
   The next cast for ``Art'' _ George Wendt, Judd Hirsch and Joe
Morton _ will take over on Dec. 22. It will be the Broadway debut
for Wendt, the former ``Cheers'' star who just finished a
14-week-run of ``Art'' in London. ``The idea of opening London as
an American was a little scarier,'' he said. ``This is kind of a
lateral move in terms of scariness.''

   MILWAUKEE _ Sometimes, from some angles, Milwaukee can fool you.
Is this Chicago? There's the lake: the same immense lake, Lake
Michigan, stretching to the horizon, bigger than all of
Switzerland. There's Wisconsin Avenue, the main drag, which crosses
the Milwaukee River on a bridge that looks a lot like the one that
carries Michigan Avenue across the Chicago River.
</P>
<P>
   Both cities have bold, modern trademark buildings with prominent
zigzag braces, designed by Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill: the Firstar
Center in Milwaukee and the John Hancock Center in Chicago. Both
cities nurture old-country traditions, exuberantly celebrated at
annual festivals. Both have mastered the Midwestern knack of
keeping their feet on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But Milwaukee, as its visitors bureau proclaimed in an
advertising campaign a few years back, is Chicago several million
people ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is less crowded, less clogged with traffic, less expensive.
``It's a big little town, a real family town,'' said Terry Benske,
a real estate agent, who makes part of her living selling houses to
people who move here from Chicago after they marry and have
children, commuting back to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On a gloomy day, when the cold, raw winds are blowing hard,
Milwaukee may indeed provide ``a gray landscape, drawn with hard
lines and great attention to detail,'' as English photographer
Cecil Beaton wrote after a 1955 visit. But on a bright day with the
sun glinting off the lake, downtown is something else again,
whatever the season, a triumph of civic resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   The city has saved the best of its past. ``Those old Germans,''
a Milwaukee friend of mine says, ``were too frugal to tear anything
down, thank God.'' So marvelous Victorian buildings like the
Richardsonian Romanesque Pfister Hotel and the pseudo-Flemish,
flatiron-shaped City Hall, built in emulation of guild halls in
Belgium, stand amid sober neo-classical structures like the
headquarters of Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co.; Art Deco
towers like the jaunty Wisconsin Gas Co. building, with a neon
``flame'' on top whose color forecasts the weather, and modern
high-rises by the likes of Chicago's Harry Weese and Helmut Jahn.
</P>
<P>
   You can see a lot of them from the new Riverwalk, a pleasant
introduction to the city, if not quite the throbbing crossroads
that San Antonio's is. From there, it's only a short stroll to
Marquette University's campus on the western edge of downtown.

   Lately, Milwaukee has been on a building spree. In July, the
first phase of the post-modern Midwest Express Center, a
667,475-square-foot convention site, opened for business. In 2000,
Miller Park will open, a new ball park in an old idiom, like
Baltimore's and Cleveland's, a kind of monument to Bud Selig, the
former owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, now the commissioner of
baseball, who waged war with the politicians over financing and
location.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, a $50 million addition to the Milwaukee Art
Museum is to be unveiled. Overlooking Lake Michigan, designed by
Santiago Calatrava, a young Spanish architect on the brink of
international superstar status who has never built anything in the
United States, it is meant to be a kind of signature structure for
the city, comparable to Sydney's Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   So far, downtown is a happy mix that looks neither random nor
``renewed,'' but somehow organic. That, a low crime rate and the
many comfortable residential neighborhoods, from upper-crust
Shorewood, north along the lake, to the more proletarian South
Side, help to earn Milwaukee the prime 20th-century urban
encomiums. It is a ``livable city,'' people say. ``Manageable.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack L. Goodsitt, one of the city's most lovable curmudgeons,
complains that Milwaukee has been in decline since the 1930s, when
George M. Cohan and Helen Hayes brought touring companies into
downtown theaters, and Eugene's, a waterside restaurant, served
``the best food the city has ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But he moved back after spending four years in Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing ever happens here,'' groused Goodsitt, a lawyer. ``But
the one thing we have is people. They do read books, they think,
they talk. There's real intellectual ferment. That matters more
than the weather or anything else. Palm Beach? All they talk about
there is golf and boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's shoulders may not be as big as the Windy City's, but
it is no 90-pound weakling. It is the nation's 17th largest city,
with a population of 610,000 and an area of 96 square miles, and
the four-county metropolitan area has a population of 1.4 million.
Enough to support the Brewers and the basketball Bucks, enough to
sustain a venerable cultural tradition, and enough to consume
Rabelaisian quantities of bratwurst, beer and frozen custard.
</P>
<P>
   Modern-day Milwaukeeans don't have much time for the
stereotypical image of their city. They don't think of themselves
anymore as a beer-'n'-brats, blue-collar bunch, however many
sausages they might scarf down during a Sunday doubleheader at
County Stadium (or when they head in their tens of thousands up
Interstate 43 to Green Bay, a couple of hours north, for a Packers
game).
</P>
<P>
   Nor do they think of themselves as America's pre-eminent German
city, even if President Clinton brought Germany's then-Chancellor
Helmut Kohl to town to give him a taste of home. Look at our Polish
festival, they say, our Irish festival, our Summerfest. Look at
Serb Hall, on the south side; go on Friday night, for the fish fry.
</P>
<P>
   Schlitz, ``the beer that made Milwaukee famous,'' is gone, which
is hard to believe in a city where they used to say that kitchens
were built with three taps, marked hot, cold and Schlitz. Only the
philanthropies of the Uihlein family, who brewed it, remain as
reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Blatz is defunct, the grand old brewery recycled now as
apartments and offices. Pabst lives on solely in the elaborate
theater that Capt. Frederick Pabst built in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   Only Miller Brewing Co. prospers (you can tour the brewery on
West State Street), joined by a number of thriving micro-breweries,
notably Sprecher and Lakeside. But everyone knows the big keg now
is St. Louis, another city with roots in Germany and the
headquarters of Anheuser-Busch.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Milwaukee's famous German restaurants have seen better
days, though there is nothing faded about Fred Usinger Inc., which
has been the king of American wurstmachers (sausage-makers) since
1880. The 1998 Christmas catalog rests beside me as I write, pure
balm for the Hun in me: braunschweiger, beerwurst, thueringer,
weisswurst, yachtwurst (ah, yachtwurst).
</P>
<P>
   People here, as in Munich or Hamburg, are compulsively orderly;
anyone who doesn't keep a neat house and a trim lawn is treated as
a menace to society. But few speak German anymore, though as late
as 1885, two of three people who read a daily newspaper here read
it in that language, not in English.
</P>
<P>
   If the Milwaukee Germans have assimilated, along with the Boston
Irish and the Philadelphia Italians, they have left behind a
formidable legacy; Milwaukee's German-American past has shaped its
more cosmopolitan present.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The city's economy is built upon precision manufacturing, a
field in which the German and other immigrants brought skills as
well as Mitteleuropean work habits with them. That tradition lives
on in industrial companies like Johnson Controls, A.O. Smith,
Briggs &AMP; Stratton, Harnischfeger and Rockwell Automation (formerly
Allen-Bradley), all with headquarters in Milwaukee. Harley-Davidson
motorcycles are made here, Case International tractors in Racine.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the immigrants carried progressive political ideals in
their baggage. Milwaukee elected Victor L. Berger, the first
socialist to sit in Congress, in 1910 and again from 1918 to 1926.
Daniel Webster Hoan, another Socialist, served as the city's mayor
for 24 years, and one of its most impressive bridges is named for
him, although he opposed its construction.
</P>
<P>
   Socialist ideas had a profound impact on young Golda Mabovitz,
whose family had immigrated to Milwaukee from the Ukraine. Educated
at North Division High School and Milwaukee Teachers' Training
College, she married a sign painter and emigrated to Israel in
1921. As Golda Meir, she rose gradually in the Labor Party and
served from 1969 to 1974 as Israel's fourth premier.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Milwaukee, socialism eventually died out, to be
succeeded by liberalism, its half-brother, as the city's creed. For
decades, two German-American Democrats held sway here: Mayor Henry
Maier, who served seven terms, and Rep. Henry Reuss, an expert on
the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee lent strong support as well to statewide political
powers like the La Follettes and other Progressives, and liberal
Democrats like Gaylord Nelson and Patrick Lucey. Even in a
conservative era like the present, the city contributed a thumping
majority to the recent re-election of Russell Feingold, one of the
more liberal (and less conventional) members of the Senate, whose
father was a part-time Progressive organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Like many medium-size cities with a Germanic heritage, like St.
Louis and Cincinnati, Milwaukee has a well entrenched musical
tradition. But like many cities, Milwaukee watched in dismay as the
finances of its musical mainstay dried up. Starting in the 1980s,
season subscriptions to the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra stalled;
fund-raising flagged; labor relations soured, so much that in
January 1994, musicians refused to take the stage.
</P>
<P>
   But the refurbishing of Uihlein Hall, part of the Marcus Center
for the Performing Arts, and the appointment in 1996 of Andreas
Delfs as musical director helped spark a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   German-born, Juilliard-trained, Delfs also conducts the Hanover
State Opera and Orchestra in the hometown of the new German
chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, and Milwaukee classical music fans
have flocked to his concerts. Accustomed to three sellouts a year,
the orchestra had 30 last season.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining schedule for this season includes programs
featuring Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, the violinist; Sabine Meyer,
the clarinetist, and Pascal Roge, the pianist. Mahler, Mozart and
Brahms will get their turns, but there are several more venturesome
items on the program as well: contemporary works by Takemitsu and
Corigliano, plus a Howard Hanson symphony and large-scale choral
works (Mendelssohn's ``Elijah'' in March and Martinu's Tocatta in
June).
</P>
<P>
   Now 66 years old, the Florentine Opera Company, which also
performs in Uihlein Hall, opened last week with ``Cav'' and
``Pag.'' But it, too, is dipping into unfamiliar repertory.
</P>
<P>
   In February, it will give the American premiere of Lowell
Liebermann's ``Picture of Dorian Gray,'' the first such premiere it
has ever presented. Based on Oscar Wilde's novel and first
performed in Monte Carlo in 1996, the opera is part of a Wilde
boomlet on stage and screen.
</P>
<P>
   A third Uihlein tenant, the Milwaukee Ballet, has sunk a million
dollars into a new production of ``The Nutcracker'' for the holiday
season, a lot for a small regional company. The choreographer is
Lisa de Ribere, an alumna of both the American Ballet Theater and
the New York City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Lunt, Milwaukee-born, would be pleased with his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Four touring Broadway shows will hit town this season, as well
as five productions by the Skylight Opera Company, including
Gilbert and Sullivan, Rodgers and Hammerstein and Donizetti's fizzy
``Don Pasquale.'' The Pabst Theater; the Milwaukee Repertory,
currently presenting works by Tennessee Williams, Carlo Goldoni and
Steve Martin, and First Stage Milwaukee, which commissioned a new
play this year from the 1992 Pulitzer Prize winner, Robert
Schenkkan, all contribute to a sparkling cultural scene. Nobody
need go to Chicago for brain food.
</P>
<P>
   Even a slavish devotee of Eero Saarinen and Frank Lloyd Wright
like myself must admit that neither did his best by Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Facing an impossible commission to design a combination war
memorial and art museum, Saarinen built something boxy that has
aged poorly, but its shortcomings will soon be eased. Attempting to
echo the domed majesty of Santa Sophia in Istanbul, Wright designed
a sky-blue and buff-colored flying saucer for the Annunciation
Greek Orthodox Church, but several of Wright's masterpieces are
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The art museum's setting smack on the lakeshore, shared by few
other Milwaukee buildings, is its trump card. That will be
re-emphasized by Calatrava's addition, south of the Saarinen
structure, that recalls both his celebrated Alamillo Bridge in
Seville, a harp-like span across the Guadalquivir River, and his
Satolas train station at Lyons airport in France.
</P>
<P>
   Here, a vaulted, 450-foot-long pavilion, a story and a half
tall, with new galleries for temporary exhibitions, forms a link to
a 90-foot-high reception hall, covered by a movable, louvered sun
break made of carbon fiber.
</P>
<P>
   This will be connected to the foot of Wisconsin Avenue, where an
orange Mark di Suvero sculpture stands by an airy suspension
footbridge. For someone strolling down Wisconsin toward the lake,
the sculpture will line up with the bridge and two angled masts:
one, 90 feet long, atop the reception hall, the other, 200 feet
tall, at the end of the bridge. Saarinen's building is right
angles; Calatrava's, designed to complement it, is curves.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel called the plan audacious and
congratulated the museum for doing something so ``daringly
un-Milwaukee.''
</P>
<P>
   During construction, the permanent collection remains open. Its
strengths, to my eye, are a superb assemblage of American folk art,
one of the world's leading collections of Haitian art and a
fabulous group of German Expressionists: Kirchner, Nolde, Beckmann
et al. (A word of warning: owing to the vagaries of donors' wills,
the Expressionists are split into two groups on two different
floors.)
</P>

<P>
   Here is information about visiting the Milwaukee area:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   HILTON, 509 W. Wisconsin Ave., (414) 271-7250. This 500-room Art
Deco monolith started life as the Schroder, then became the Marc
before joining the Hilton clan. Voted one of the best in the chain
after a recent renovation (still more rooms are coming), it is well
situated for conventions and culture. Doubles, $109 to $154.
</P>
<P>
   METRO, 411 E. Mason St., (414) 272-1937. Brand new, and
brilliantly designed to evoke France in the 1920s, with unusually
handsome chairs, rugs and sofas in the lobby. Its 65 suites are
also well done, with purest cotton sheets on the beds. The cafe has
tables outdoors and a sinuous, welcoming bar. Doubles, $165 to
$225; weekend specials, $129.
</P>
<P>
   PFISTER, 424 E. Wisconsin Ave., (414) 273-8222. ``Grande dame''
is the cliche among older hotels; the Pfister lives up to it. The
Victorian lobby _ painted ceiling, palm court and paintings of
zaftig ladies _ bustles all day long, and rooms in the old section,
opening off blessedly wide corridors, offer every comfort; stay
there, if you can, rather than in the newer tower. Room rates:
Doubles, $244 to 284 weekdays and $169 to $209 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN CLUB, Highland Drive, Kohler, (920) 457-8000. Built in
1918 to house immigrant workers at the Kohler plumbing-fixture
works, this rambling red-brick building has been transformed into a
quiet, tasteful resort with courtyard gardens, good food, two Pete
Dye golf courses, indoor tennis, trout fishing, pheasant hunting
and cross-country skiing. An hour from Milwaukee. Doubles, $155 to
$190 weekdays and $185 to $220 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   BARTOLOTTA'S, 7616 W. State St., (414) 771-7910. A plain,
vibrant, yellow-walled room hung with family photos, this trattoria
has good blood lines. Paul Bartolotta runs Spiaggia, Chicago's best
Italian restaurant; here, his sister, Maria, a onetime vocalist
with Peter Duchin, dispenses Italian comfort food: pasta quills
with duck ragu, sausage and peppers on polenta.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN ERNST, 600 E. Ogden Ave., (414) 273-1878. Ratzch's has
slipped; Mader's caters to tour buses. But Ernst's (founded 1878)
upholds German-American tradition with Teutonic tankards along the
walls, mellow Pschorrbrau from Munich on tap and proper schnitzel,
sauerbraten and bratwurst on the plate.
</P>
<P>
   LEON'S, 3131 S. 27th St., (414) 383-1784. Milwaukee dotes on
old-fashioned frozen custard. Leon's is the drive-in shrine,
turning out a dense, eggy, creamy freeze fully worthy of the state
that calls itself America's Dairyland. Opened in 1942, this
neon-clad spot inspired ``Happy Days.''
</P>
<P>
   EDDIE MARTINI'S, 8612 Watertown Plank Road, (414) 771-6680. A
1940s throwback (``steaks, chops, seafood,'' says the sign
outside), Martini's is Milwaukee's restaurant du jour, jammed every
night. Fine strips and porterhouses, sure, but also ono and ahi
tuna from the Pacific, as well as walleye, the firm, sweet lake
fish that has vanished from most menus because of dwindling
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   SANFORD, 1547 N. Jackson St., (414) 276-9608. Sandy D'Amato is a
cook of rare virtuosity who produces a different ethnic menu each
night (Hungarian, Greek, Provencal . . .) as well as his regular
fare. His wife, Angie, presides winningly over a dining room that
was once his grandfather's and father's grocery store. The flavor
combinations are spectacular: sweet figs, pungent pomegranate
sauce, foie gras, squab; grilled shrimp, Thai basil oil, peppery
curry noodles.
</P>
<P>
   THREE BROTHERS, 2414 S. St. Clair St., (414) 481-7530. Branko
Radicevic can be as cranky as his Serbian brethren in Belgrade, but
he runs a restaurant with very high standards. On simple Formica
tables in an old Schlitz tavern, he serves succulent roast lamb and
suckling pig, chicken paprikash and an amazing, discus-sized phyllo
pie called burek, stuffed with spinach or cheese.
</P>
<P>

GO AHEAD AND CONTACT DAD
</HEADLINE>
  By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: I grew up in a foster home, but years ago _ I'm 60 now
_ I found my mother. I've been trying to track down my father ever
since. Now I know where he is, but when I telephoned a stepsister
to ask about him, she said he's 82 and dying. She told me to leave
him alone. Should I listen to her? _ Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: The decision is not up to her. Brothers and sisters are
often rivals for parental attention. All of a sudden you're coming
out of the ozone and saying, ``Hey, I'm going to come talk to
Dad.'' That means more people at Thanksgiving and a smaller
inheritance. Dry your tears and send your Dad a card, saying you'd
like to come to Florida to see him. Send pictures of your children
and grandchildren. That always helps.
</P>
<P>
   Get in there with Dad and do it quickly. You don't need your
stepsister's permission. If you don't have his number, check the
telephone book in his city or go online. If you don't know how to
use the Internet, ask your grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I just came back from one of those corporate retreats
on leadership. I thought I was the perfect executive, a creative
woman with enthusiasm who cared for her staff. I even lecture on
leadership! Now I find I was all wrong. The feedback is that I'm a
penny-pincher and my meetings are a waste of time. How can I make
my image of me the one people recognize? _ Dayton, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Thank goodness for this revelation. You've had a
wonderful window into who people really think you are.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you look at yourself and at the person other people see,
you'll find some overlap. Clearly you're authoritative. Clearly
you're able to make decisions. But it sounds like your decisions
are very bottom-line oriented rather than people-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just focus more on having people give you feedback BEFORE
you make decisions, which will make them more enthusiastic team
players. They will feel they are being consulted; you will feel you
are a much more enlightened boss who is listening better. The whole
thing about leadership is figuring out where people want to go and
getting there first.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, stop beating yourself up. Leadership styles
have changed significantly. Make a couple of the people you feel
are the bravest and have the best ideas your boardroom cabinet and
get some consensus from them. You can still make your own decisions
but you'll have a little more thumb on the pulse of the employees.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My wife is always testing me. She asks me questions
and I know she has an answer in mind, like what I'd like to do for
the weekend or what I'd like for dinner, but I'll be darned if I
can figure out what she wants. My mother did the same thing to my
father and that's what finally killed him. How can I get her to
understand how much this bothers me? _ Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Always being under pressure to come up with the right
answer is like taking a quiz you haven't studied for. If you look
for the question rather than the answer, you will find fewer
battles at home and be more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask your wife what she wants from you, perhaps you can
determine your specific request _ or that she doesn't know. Asking
others for their questions allows them to tell you what's important
and true for them. Worst case scenario: Tell your wife what she
thinks and if she disagrees you can at least have an interesting
conversation. When in doubt, offer an opinion. Maybe her Spanish
Inquisition routine is her way of trying to get SOMETHING out of
you.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My brother has five step-grandchildren under age 12. I
always remember their birthdays with a card and $10, but I never
get a thank you and they don't acknowledge my birthday. It really
makes me mad, but should I complain to my brother or their parents?
_ Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Hey, let's lighten up here. First, it's not your job to
raise your brother's step-grandchildren. Second, go out and buy
five birthday cards and address them. Send them out next year --
just the cards. Then when the kids ask why they didn't get any
money, say you haven't received a thank-you note. Third, put that
$50 aside to buy yourself a present.

JOBLESS-ARIZONA (Phoenix) - With the holidays approaching,
retailers at Arizona Mills last month went shopping for workers.
The Tempe, Ariz., mall held two job fairs in October, seeking to
fill 800 full and part-time positions. But many stores left with
their bags empty, as the recruitment effort generated just 500
referrals - and not all of those people were hired. Despite a
slowing national economy, a lingering crisis in Asia and some
well-publicized layoffs among local high-tech and mining companies,
Arizona's job market continues to boom. In fact, the Department of
Economic Security said Thursday that the state's jobless rate has
dropped to its lowest level since modern record-keeping began 28
years ago. By RUSS WILES. Story will move in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NURSING-SHORTAGE (Phoenix) - Every day in the Phoenix area, there's
a chance that a hospital unit could be shut down because of a lack
of nurses. Arizona is experiencing a shortage of up to 10,000
nurses, and even the most generous incentives aren't solving the
problem. Nurses, particularly those from out of state, are being
offered signing bonuses of up to $6,000, trips to Hawaii, college
tuition for their children and other incentives to work at Valley
hospitals. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will move in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BIBLE-ARIZONA (Undated) - Sixteen simple words adopted in 1791:
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. But why is it OK to pray
before a town council meeting but not proclaim Bible Week? Why can
the president proclaim National Day of Prayer and not get sued?
Religion is pervasive in government and civic life and the line of
church-state separation is fuzzy at best. We talk to experts on
both sides about what specifically is and isn't legal and how some
things - like National Day of Prayer - may violate the
Constitution. By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ENEMY-MOVIE (Undated) - Maybe Will Smith decided to star in a bad
spy thriller to find out if we really, really like him. You'd
better be among Smith's top fans because he's the only thing
``Enemy of the State'' has going for it. By BOB FENSTER. Story will
move in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CELEBRITY-MOVIE (Undated) - Writer/director Woody Allen stays
behind the camera in ``Celebrity,`` a bitter comedy about a
magazine writer who pursues famous women but can find no
satisfaction. Allen's witty observations about human foibles are
dragged down by Kenneth Branagh's annoying over-anxiety and
off-putting comic delivery. By BOB FENSTER. Story will move in the
``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
JOURNEY-THEATER (Undated) - Anyone who has watched Arizona Theatre
Company grow from a Tucson community theater to the state's largest
stage operation must be bursting their buttons with pride. With
``Long Days Journey Into Night,'' the company has outgrown Arizona.
This production, a landmark revival of Eugene O'Neill's
masterpiece, is as fine a piece of theater as you would see in New
York and London. By KYLE LAWSON. Story will move in the ``E''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SPACEY-MOVIE (Undated) - Terrorizing young children, berating the
elderly and flaunting a scathing personality. Not exactly the
behavior one would expect from an Oscar-winning actor, especially
in a Disney film. But please, rub your hind legs together for Kevin
Spacey in ``A Bug's Life,'' and his portrayal of Hopper, the
baddest grasshopper this side of the cinema.By KATHY CANO-MURILLO.
Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (Undated) - Macho truck guys adore the mighty Ford
F-250 Super Duty. Its hulking appearance, its brawny V-10 engine,
its broad interior: This is a big rig among pickup trucks.The Super
Duty is a truck for the job site. For personal use, it could be
used for carrying big loads, towing heavy objects or lugging a
camper. But the Super Duty is not exactly the kind of pickup you'd
choose for your hip urban vehicle, as you might an F-150
flare-side. By BOB GOLFEN. Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL;

 &HT;    An urban 'Nutcracker'
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Give Nena Gilreath and Waverly Lucas a kid who lacks
focus, discipline or self-esteem, and they'll put him in a pair of
tights.
</P>
<P>
   Then they'll teach the youngster the meaning of hard work and
responsibility through a series of body-writhing, toe-pointing,
leg-leaping exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   As co-founders of Ballethnic, a classically trained dance troupe
that fuses modern, jazz and African dance movements with
traditional ballet, Gilreath and Lucas have been working their
magic on metro Atlanta kids for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The children will demonstrate their talent this weekend, when
the company stages its signature performance of ``Urban
Nutcracker'' at Georgia Tech's Robert Ferst Center. The ballet, set
on Auburn Avenue to depict the history of Atlanta's wealthy
African-American community, includes more than 70 youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Gilreath and Lucas started Ballethnic in 1990
was to take classical ballet to inner-city youths. They especially
want to expose black males to the art form, to give them a positive
alternative to drugs, crime and other anti-social behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas tries to counteract myths that real guys don't wear tights
by rattling off a list of macho men who learned how to be more
agile in sports by dancing on their toes.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Swann. Herschel Walker. Willie Gault. Jean Claude van
Damme. Then there's Lucas himself, a basketball player and martial
artist who grew up in the 'hood and took his first ballet class at
age 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were not doing this, you can imagine what I, a young
black man on the streets of Detroit, would be doing,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to start portraying dance in a different way for young
men. For me, dance is very masculine,'' added Lucas, who is also
the company's choreographer and artistic director and Gilreath's
husband of six years.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Perry, 14, has been a student at Ballethnic since he was
7. His classmates used to tease him when he took up ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it doesn't bother me,'' said Jamal, who performs a Russian
dance in the ``Urban Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to say I must can't play football, or I must can't
play baseball. But this year I played every game. The only time I
got off the field was at halftime. Now they're like, `Wow, ballet
must really help you.' Now they want to take dance too,'' he said.
``They just don't want to wear tights.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballethnic's founders think ballet is one of the best ways to
teach youngsters the self-discipline they need to succeed in school
and in life. That's why dance classes focus on exercises that
require students to sit still, listen and follow instructions.
</P>
<P>
   The company offers courses to children as young as 6. In
January, classes will begin for preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Gilreath and Lucas also want to show young people through their
own example how hard work and determination can help accomplish
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Gilreath, a petite woman with a dynamic voice, recalls how they
had to scramble for costumes for ``Urban Nutcracker's'' first
season. Every weekend, they rummaged through garage sales in search
of discarded prom dresses and formals. They had to stage the ballet
in November, a month earlier than the Christmas story is normally
performed, because all the theaters were booked. And the troupe
started with Act II, because Gilreath and Lucas didn't have the
resources to stage the first act.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple's dream of running Atlanta's first black ballet
company never died. These days, dance critics compare it to Dance
Theater of Harlem, the only other African-American classical ballet
company in the country. Lucas and Gilreath, both 34, danced with
the Harlem company and the Atlanta Ballet before going out on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Their resourceful spirit is one of the things that attracted the
support of Mozel Spriggs, former chairwoman of dance in Spelman
College's Division of Fine Arts, and big corporations such as
NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that they were the future of Atlanta,'' Spriggs said.
``Their energy, their determination, their ideas for combining
these art forms in a ballet company was, in a way, revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Ballethnic's approach to students.
</P>
<P>
   They want to work with the boys who might be a little clumsy or
rough around the edges. They welcome the girls whose bodies fill
out their tutus. And most of all they inspire kids whose faces are
browner, their hair kinkier, than the stereotypical ballerina's to
master the art form.
</P>
<P>
   Their students see them as family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Waverly really cares a lot about us,'' Jamal says.
``Sometimes, we come early to class, and he'll help us with our
homework.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing can definitely be a self-esteem builder,'' adds
Jennifer Thomas, 15, who has three parts in ``Urban Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never really talkative,'' she says. ``Now I'm a lot more
open. Dancing has brought out different things in my personality
and helped me become more of the person I am now.''

 &HT;    `Elizabeth' examines the Virgin Queen from a fresh, feminist
perspective
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth'' is such a good idea for a movie that it's sort of
amazing no one thought of it during, say, the past 25 years.
Basically, the film puts a slight feminist gloss on the ascension
of Queen Elizabeth I, known not only as the Virgin Queen but also
as one of the most powerful and effective rulers in British
history. She stayed on the throne for more than 40 years and, like
her descendant Queen Victoria, gave her name to an era.
</P>
<P>
   She's been portrayed onscreen before (most famously by Bette
Davis), usually as a strong-willed yet love-starved woman, torn
between her professional duties and her personal life.
``Elizabeth'' takes something of the same tack. So does most of
feminism, which makes the film seem both familiar and provocative.
Yet the connection is made with a relatively light hand. We're not
being preached at so much as being invited to see a celebrated
historical figure in a fresh way.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts in 1554 with Mary (Kathy Burke), Elizabeth's
half sister and a devout Catholic, still on the throne. But she is
childless and unwell. Thus the younger Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett),
Protestant daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, poses a threat
by her very existence. Somehow surviving everything from palace
plots to imprisonment, Elizabeth becomes queen. How she's
transformed from the radiant, open-hearted girl we first meet into
the chilly icon of the Virgin Queen _ frizzy-haired and powder
white _ is the picture's focus.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchett, seen earlier this year as the sensibly eccentric
Lucinda in ``Oscar and Lucinda,'' makes a sensational Elizabeth.
She's a saucy and impetuous innocent in the early scenes, a guarded
and polished ruler by the end. Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush
(``Shine'') gives sturdy support as Sir Francis Walsingham, the
shadowy power behind the throne. We're never quite sure if he can
be trusted, or whether he's putting his own interests or
Elizabeth's first. Joseph Fiennes, who's almost as handsome as his
better-known sibling, Ralph (Blanchett's co-star in ``Oscar and
Lucinda''), is well cast in the comparatively thankless role of
Lord Robert Dudley, the man to whom Elizabeth gives her heart if
not her throne. There's even John Gielgud in a nanosecond cameo as
the decidedly anti-Elizabeth pope.
</P>
<P>
   Having the most fun, however, is the French contingent, Fanny
Ardant and Vincent Cassel. Ardant plays France's ambitious
``warrior queen,'' as formidable on the battlefield as she is in
the bedroom. Cassel is her whimsical nephew who, at her behest,
dutifully woos Elizabeth while still being true to his inner bad
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Indian filmmaker Shekhar Kapur isn't worried about the cliches
of historical drama: the portentous, history-in-the-making
dialogue, the elaborate royal entertainments, the whispered court
intrigues. Rather he embraces them, thus investing them with a
renewed vitality. True, there are a few lingering clinkers, but for
the most part, the movie's opulent production design (look for some
Oscar nominations), accomplished cast and raucous, event-filled
narrative win out.
</P>
<P>
   Should you tire of Elizabeth's romantic problems, remember that
sex and violence are what history is all about. There's plenty of
vicious religious fanaticism, manifested in scenes worthy of Ken
Russell's ``The Devils.'' And one sequence could be a replay of the
final purge in ``The Godfather,'' only the clothes are prettier and
the deaths more brutal.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is simple: ``Elizabeth'' is a really good
story. The story of a girl becoming a woman, of a woman becoming a
queen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush. Directed by Shekhar
Kapur. Rated R for sex and violence. At Tara. 2 hours, 4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The total woman, Elizabethan-style.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, Jill Vejnoska and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``American History X'' R (profanity, violence, sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.
</P>
<P>
   An ``X''-cessive mess. Edward Norton plays a reformed skinhead
trying to keep his younger brother (Edward Furlong) from following
the same sick, dead-end path. Though it trafficks in racial
confrontations and ethnic slurs, it never delves any deeper than
the junk spewed out on ``Jerry Springer.'' But Norton is
phenomenal. He disturbs us; his movie doesn't. 1 hour, 58 minutes.
C
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz'' PG
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone and Sylvester
Stallone.
</P>
<P>
   A visual picnic, a so-so script. This computer-animated feature
tells of worker ant Z (voice of Woody Allen) whose love of Princess
Bala (Sharon Stone) lands both of them in the scary world outside
the ant colony. It's fun, but the story is as predictable as the
spectacular visuals are not. 1 hour, 23 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' PG-13 (profanity, sex and sci-fi action)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   The world interpreted as a video game. While ``Deep Impact''
treated a similar let's-save-Earth story with sobriety,
``Armageddon,'' showing at area discount theaters, never lets the
threat of global annihilation get in the way of fun. It's a
space-cowboy movie, with Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck saving the
world for Liv Tyler. It's more enjoyable than ``Godzilla.'' But is
it good for you? Probably not. 2 hours, 24 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved'' R (violent images, sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, Kimberly
Elise.
</P>
<P>
   An A-list epic that inadvertently proves that Toni Morrison's
novels are unfilmable. Oprah Winfrey plays Sethe, a former slave
haunted by the ghost of her dead daughter, who takes in the
mysterious stranger Beloved (Thandie Newton). Too faithful to
Morrison's magic-realist prose, the movie substitutes mood for
emotional power and narrative clarity. 2 hours, 52 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Chill'' R (profanity, sexual inuendo, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Kline, Glenn Close, William Hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years after its original release, Lawrence Kasdan's film
about some college pals from the '60s, reunited for a long weekend
by the suicide of one of their group, is more than a requiem for
that era. The picture is about friendship, change, coping, lost
ideals, found strengths and, perhaps most of all, about the many
ways we give life to those we care about. 1 hour, 43 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity'' R (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Fame is the name of the game in this Woody Allen film, but the
game is all too familiar. Kenneth Branagh (doing an uncanny Woody
impersonation) and Judy Davis (doing her version of Woody) are
ex-spouses making their way through the celeb-filled worlds of
supermodels, TV talk shows, book signings at Elaine's, etc. Aside
from some amusing observations, the movie feels stale and strung
together. 1 hour, 54 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Cate Blanchett gives a luminous portrayal and
Geoffrey Rush gives her sturdy support as court politics and
intrigues swirl about. This is a really good story. Of a girl
becoming a woman, of a woman becoming a queen. 2 hours, 4 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling paranoia plot devices from other movies (``The
Conversation,'' ``Three Days of the Condor''), Tony Scott's lively
thriller keeps Will Smith and Gene Hackman on the run from big
government bad guys. A sharp cast and slick production compensate
for the movie's occasional lapses in logic. 2 hours, 7 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever After'' PG-13 (violence, emotional situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore, Dougray Scott and Anjelica Huston.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After,'' showing at area discount theaters,
proves you can teach an old doll new tricks. Reinventing the
Cinderella story in a way that targets ``Titanic''-loving teens,
the movie stars Drew Barrymore as the spirited heroine, Anjelica
Huston as her scheming stepmother and Dougray Scott as a prince
who's more than just another trophy husband. 2 hours. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' Unrated (plot contains pedophilia)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dylan Baker, Jane Adams, Cynthia Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' may be the most ironic movie title of the '90s.
This controversial film is a bleak, unsparing and yet relentlessly
comic look at several citizens of New Jersey whose lives are
defined by sexuality. Director Todd Solondz says he prefers the
expression ``sad comedy'' to ``black comedy,'' but ``Happiness'' is
about as dark as they come. 2 hours, 14 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' R (violence,
profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Tepid follow-up to last year's surprise hit, this teen slasher
flick transplants surviving cast member Jennifer Love Hewitt to an
island in the Bahamas. Back-from-the-dead killer Ben Willis is
there too, intent on using his deadly fishhook hand to finally
finish off Julie and her friends. Teenage singer and TV star Brandy
is the only spirited thing about this sequel. 1 hour, 36 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' PG (profanity, rude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Taylor Thomas plays a college kid who has to hitch his
way home to New York in time for Christmas Eve. If he's late, he'll
lose the Porsche his dad has promised. This Disney comedy has some
clever moments as Thomas, a scam artist, has to learn the meaning
of family. But it aims too often for the farfetched.1 hour, 26
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``John Carpenter's Vampires'' R (profanity, nudity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The vampires aren't the only things that suck. James Woods stars
as an expert vampire slayer employed by the Vatican. He meets his
match in a 600-year-old vampire with a vendetta against the church.
The movie starts out great, with Carpenter and his cast juggling
jokes and gore. But it loses focus and direction as it goes along
and ends up a jumbled disappointment. 1 hour, 47 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of a
concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. It certainly takes a certain courage to put
a life-affirming spin on Hitler's Final Solution, but Benigni's
low-comedy slapstick approach isn't entirely convincing and is
often chillingly wrong-headed. Subtitles. 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud'' R (profanity, drug use, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito and Queen Latifah.
</P>
<P>
   A suddenly single fortysomething (Holly Hunter) leaves her tony
Upper East Side co-op and ventures into new territory, an
cross-town jazz bar, where she becomes friends with the resident
torch singer (Queen Latifah), and has a ``kinda'' relationship with
her building's elevator operator (Danny DeVito). The tone is
bittersweet, the story unresolved, but the performances are fresh
and funny. 1 hour, 33 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Banderas and Catherine
Zeta-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right, showing at area discount theaters. Our
men in black are Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas, who double
our swashbuckling pleasure and double our fun as dual Zorros,
saving California and Hopkins' beautiful, spirited daughter
(Catherine Zeta-Jones) from the evil schemes of one Don Rafael
(Stuart Wilson). 2 hours, 16 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' PG-13 (profanity, some sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Clair Forlani.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brest's ponderous, three-hour update of ``Death Takes a
Holiday'' wastes a good cast, led by Anthony Hopkins. It's more
interested in corporate politics than the romance between Clair
Forlani and Brad Pitt, playing a puppyish Grim Reaper. 2 hours, 54
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' PG-13 (sexuality, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   Two '90s kids (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) are zapped
into a '50s sitcom, and slowly bring sex, color and rock 'n roll to
the black-and-white world. The movie gets preachy in its second
half. But the performances (in a cast including Joan Allen and
William H. Macy) and the lustrous mix of monochrome and color keep
you hooked. 2 hours, 4 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Practical Magic'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman play unalike sisters with one
strong bond: They're witches. In the lively film version of the
Alice Hoffman novel, the two deal with backfired spells and that
most unpredictable magic, love. Co-starring Aidan Quinn, Dianne
Wieste and Stockard Channing, it's lightweight but works like a
charm.1 hour, 45 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of E.G. Daily and Christine Cavanaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rugrats hit the big screen with a big issue: making way for
a new baby. The film version of the TV hit is amiable, if frenetic,
aimed at kids who need to be stimulated every few seconds.1 hour,
19 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush Hour'' PG-13 (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Kung Fu king Jackie Chan and fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker
play two cops whose clashes go way beyond cultural differences.
Thrown together by FBI agents who don't want either mucking up
their search for a kidnapped child, the pair drive each other
crazy, at first. Chan and Tucker learn to work together, in part by
imitating (sometimes badly) how the other one works.1 hour, 37
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' R (violence, profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be worse: a series of terrorist bombings of New
York, or the martial-law takeover by the Army as a response? Denzel
Washington, Annette Bening and Bruce Willis star in a fast-moving,
well-made paranoid thriller that ultimately reduces a hot-button
topic to a standard Hollywood action cliche. At metro theaters. 1
hour, 50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Velvet Goldmine'' R (sex, profanity, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Ewan McGregor and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   There is more style than substance in this glitter-and-be-gay
re-creation of the glam-rock scene in early '70s London. Jonathan
Rhys Meyers has the central role of a rock star whose abrupt
disappearance becomes the object of a search conducted by a
former-fan-turned-journalist. The second half is hopelessly
scattered, but the soundtrack is terrific, as is Ewan McGregor as a
Dionysian rocker. 1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' PG-13 (comic violence, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler and Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   A watered-down comedy. After a successful stab at romantic
comedy in ``The Wedding Singer,'' Adam Sandler returns to his
lowbrow roots with this ``Happy Gilmore'' rewrite about a bayou
bumpkin who becomes a college football star. It's dumb and
predictable, which would be OK if there were more laughs. But Kathy
Bates is hilarious as Sandler's domineering mama. 1 hour, 26
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wizard of Oz''G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Judy Garland, Bert Lahr, Ray Bolger, Margaret Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   An all-time favorite. Based on L. Frank Baum's classic
children's story, the movie opened in 1939, with Judy Garland
playing Dorothy, who, with her dog, Toto, is blown out of Kansas by
a twister and into the Land of Oz. On the yellow brick road they
meet up with the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow as
they sing and dance their way toward the Emerald City. 1 hour, 41
minutes. A

 &HT;    Woody's fame game goes stale
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woody Allen seems to be in a strange place these days.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, there was ``Wild Man Blues.'' Supposedly a
documentary about his jazz band's European tour, it was actually
some thinly disguised, image-enhancing spin control vis-a-vis
himself and his new spouse, Soon-Yi.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Celebrity,'' which features Kenneth Branagh _ as in
``Hamlet'' and ``Henry V'' _ doing a jaw-dropping imitation of his
director, down to every stammer and twitch. For a while it's eerily
fascinating and even a bit funny. But then it turns tedious and,
well, more than a little weird as you remember that Allen is
standing on the other side of the camera, watching _ approving! _
this homage/impersonation of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's Branagh's co-star, Judy Davis. A longtime,
usually brilliant Allen regular (``Husbands and Wives,''
``Deconstructing Harry''), she's doing Woody too. The neurotic
whining, the self-deprecating put-downs, even a Woody-esque worry
about contracting Lyme disease while strolling outside. Again,
you're initially intrigued, then you start to wonder, is this what
Woody wanted? Two people ``doing'' him?
</P>
<P>
   Within the movie's world, Branagh and Davis play former husband
and wife, Lee and Robin Simon. He's a travel writer and would-be
novelist with a screenplay he peddles on the side to his star
interviews. She's an English teacher, undone by the divorce and,
unlike her ex, just looking for a little peace of mind. Ironically,
during a should-I-or-shouldn't-I visit to a renowned plastic
surgeon, Robin meets a TV producer (Joe Mantegna) who not only
falls madly in love with her, but builds her into a major on-air
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity'' is a terrific idea for a movie. As one character
says, ``You can learn a lot about a society by whom it chooses to
celebrate.'' But perhaps Allen himself has been famous for too
long. His film is less a thought-through investigation of an
omnipresent phenomenon than a scattershot series of sketches about
supermodels, hotel-trashing movie stars (Leonardo DiCaprio), the
art world, book signings at Elaine's, and so on. It's as if he had
pulled some old scenes from his to-look-at-later drawer and strung
them together into what might pass for a cohesive narrative. Some
of the pieces are hilarious: backstage at a TV show where the
rabbis, skinheads and ACLU lawyers are old pals from making the
talk-show rounds (``The skinheads ate the bagels already?'' grouses
a rabbi), or a fan accosting a TV weatherman with the backhanded
compliment, ``You're usually wrong, but you're always so
cheerful.''
</P>
<P>
   But too much of the movie is familiar to the point of being
stale. The star-spangled cast helps (along with DiCaprio, there are
appearances by Melanie Griffith, Winona Ryder, Charlize Theron,
Famke Janssen, Bebe Neuwirth and Isaac Mizrahi). But, then, a cameo
in a Woody Allen movie has itself become a certification of
celebrity, hasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity'' is aimed at those who can pick out Erica Jong in a
crowd scene or know Joey Buttafuoco (billed in the credits ``as
himself'') when they see him. If that's you, get in line. But Woody
has done better _ by his audience and himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis. Directed by Woody
Allen. Rated R for language and sexual situations. At metro
theaters. 1 hour, 54 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Fame is the name of the game, but the game is too
familiar.

 &HT;    Keep telling yourself: `Rugrats' is for kids
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie'' takes the Nickelodeon hit from the small
screen to the big. And it tackles a big subject: making room for
baby.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Tommy Pickles (voiced by E.G. Daily) has to do when
his folks come home from the hospital with Dylan ``Dil'' Pickles.
On top of dealing with the constant crying, Tommy can't help
noticing all the attention his parents are giving to this needy
newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   His pals Phil and Lil (Kath Soucie does both voices) and Chuckie
(Christine Cavanaugh) aren't crazy about the new kid, either. So
when they all get lost in the woods, Tommy fears that he has to
choose between playing with his friends and tending his nuisance
baby bro.
</P>
<P>
   Having never seen a ``Rugrats'' TV episode, I'll defer judgment
to the tiny children at the screening, who seemed to enjoy the
frenetic movie and the forgettable songs. They didn't seem to mind
the scary wolf, and they dug the poop jokes and the runaway circus
monkeys that pester the kids.
</P>
<P>
   The movie takes care of grown-ups every now and then, tossing
off a circumcision joke or pop-culture reference (``Is it true a
dingo ate your baby?'' asks a reporter when the Pickles parents
realize their children are missing).
</P>
<P>
   Even so, adults will probably feel antsier than the children,
having to listen to adult actors performing in baby voices and
mispronouncing words in gosh-darn-cute-kid fashion. But, hey, look
at it this way: It could be another Barney flick, or a Teletubbies
feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of E.G. Daily and Christine Cavanaugh.
Directed by Norton Virgien and Igor Kovalyov. Rated G. At metro
theaters. 1 hour, 19 minutes.
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, powerful jet stream winds blowing 30,000 feet
over the northern Pacific Ocean were clocked at speeds near 200
miles an hour. This robust jet stream will set the stage for a
pattern of recurrent storminess over the Pacific Northwest over the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   A barrage of wind and rain will last for much of Friday in
western Washington and western Oregon as strong, low-level winds
off the Pacific rapidly transport moisture inland. Ocean winds will
average 25-50 miles an hour at the coast, with higher gusts on
exposed beaches. Rainfalls of 2 inches or more are likely along
west-facing slopes of the Olympics, the Cascades and the Coastal
Ranges, where moist Pacific winds are forced to ascend the sloping
terrain. Rainfalls could exceed 5 inches or more in some areas by
Saturday morning. The risk of flooding will heighten, particularly
in the drainage system near the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, air cascading down the eastern slopes of the
Rockies will warm on descent, extricating the high northern Plains
from the deep chill of earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, broken areas of rain will spread from the Ohio Valley
early Friday toward the Middle Atlantic states as a low-pressure
system ripples northeast along a cold front. Much of southeast New
England will brighten once an arm of moisture swings east over the
Atlantic. A plume of high clouds streaming northeast from the
Middle Atlantic low will render the day mostly cloudy in New York
and Boston, with some rain arriving later Friday or Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Dueling Gulfs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many recipes for stormy weather in the East include moisture
from the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Alaska also is a catalyst for
storminess. During the cold season, low-pressure systems coming off
the east coast of Asia are steered to the Gulf of Alaska, where
they often dissipate. But dying lows also plant seeds for new lows,
which then amplify, drawing energy from temperature contrasts
between the Arctic and milder air over the tepid waters of the
northern Pacific. This week, a huge, potent low over the Gulf of
Alaska will send a barrage of wind and rain into the Pacific
Northwest.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Standing in the hallway outside the House Judiciary
Committee hearing, Doug Muzzio waited much of Thursday for his turn
to see a half hour of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up at 5 o'clock this morning and said, 'How can I be
here and not watch this?' I'd be crazy to miss it,'' said Muzzio, a
New York University professor here to do research at the Library of
Congress for a book on movie history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he WAS crazy,'' said his wife, Barbara, who
nonetheless came with her husband at about 7 a.m. to await their 30
minutes in the two seats set aside for the public in the packed
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Rotating through, scores of visitors got a first-hand glimpse of
this long day of drama and droning on, as the only third
impeachment proceeding in the nation's history dragged toward its
uncertain conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was presenting his
case against President Clinton to Congress, and seeing it on a
small screen was not good enough for these folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an historic process,'' said Isamu Dyson, a George
Washington University student who arrived at 5:45 a.m. to be the
first in line. ``I'm being a good citizen being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in line, people pointed excitedly when committee members
passed by _ celebrities to the committed devotees of cable TV
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an addict,'' admitted Muzzio, who teaches public policy
and wrote a book on the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side of the Rayburn Building, other tourists
gathered to gawk at TV correspondents as reporters and technicians
worked in a makeshift studio set up in a lobby. Signs taped to
partitions identified the media territories: Fox, CBS, ABC, Lehrer
News Hour, Court TV, CBN. From chairs on the adjoining balcony,
carefully coiffed men and women told their stories with the Capitol
as a backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a parade of committee members stopped by the bank of
microphones and cameras set up at the end of the lobby to give
their spin on the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now this is good theater over here,'' said Rep. Lindsay
Graham, R-S.C., after a bystander yelled his opinion. ``But the
question is: Is Ken Starr unfair?''
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly the opinion of Michael Moore, the documentary
film-maker of ``Roger and Me,'' who was filming a segment for his
TV program ``The Awful Truth,'' which appears on Bravo. ``I'm
shooting stuff on Ken Starr's attempted coup d'etat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Starr was a hero to the protesters outside _ so-called
``freepers'' devoted to FreeRepublic.com, a conservative Internet
site. Wearing engineer's caps, they blew whistles and cheered the
start of ``the impeachment express.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Muzzios inched closer to the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to do the museums today,'' lamented Barbara
Muzzio.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thinks this is the line to see the van Gogh exhibit,''
laughed another of those awaiting entry.

`SAINT MAYBE': RAISING ORPHANS TO ATONE FOR THEIR LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)

<P>
   It's the sort of thing that happens when you're exhausted and
fed up and have been holding something back. It happens to Ian
Bedloe one night when his wacky sister-in-law, Lucy, asks him to
baby-sit for an hour, and then doesn't come back. This causes him
to miss a romantic dinner date with his girlfriend, Cicely.
</P>
<P>
   So by the time Ian's brother, Danny, turns up and drives him to
Cicely's house, Ian is steaming. He lets the accusations rip:
Hasn't Danny noticed that Lucy goes out a lot, supposedly with her
girlfriends, and comes back late, and that she seems to be buying a
lot of things she can't really afford? The clues make it all too
clear: She's being unfaithful.
</P>
<P>
   Danny, who has had suspicions, is now convinced. He lets Ian out
of the car and promptly drives into a tree, killing himself. Ian
will spend the rest of his life atoning.
</P>
<P>
   That scene sets the mood for ``Saint Maybe,'' a CBS movie based
on Anne Tyler's 1991 novel of the same name. Ms. Tyler, as her many
readers know, likes to take a cold, bleak look at human
relationships, particularly within families. Her characters reach
the warm, beaming-with-contentment stage _ if they do at all _ only
after painful self-examination under harsh light at the kitchen
table.
</P>
<P>
   As long as ``Saint Maybe'' keeps Ms. Tyler's tone, the film is
fascinating and moving. But apparently the writer, Robert W.
Lenski, or whoever gave him the assignment, just couldn't resist
turning it lazily heart-warming just in time for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Blythe Danner as Ian and Danny's mother helps,
because her glow always has a certain edge. Edward Herrmann is well
cast as the father. Mary-Louise Parker is one of the few actresses
who can get away with playing daffy, as she does here as Lucy. And
Thomas McCarthy makes Ian's transformation from college brat to
responsible surrogate father largely believable and sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Saint Maybe,'' the movie, refuses to do much questioning.
After the death of Danny (Jeffrey Nordling) and Lucy's subsequent
suicide, Ian wanders into a storefront church, where a minister
tells him the only way to be forgiven for his sin is to rear the
three children Lucy and Danny left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The only hint that this might be a strange, rather sudden turn
of events comes from Ms. Danner. Ian rushes home, tells his parents
about his plan and explains, ``It's the will of God.'' Ms. Danner
says, ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   And the film seems to skip over what must be the most difficult
and most rewarding part of Ian's story: the two decades of rearing
the children. One minute, it seems, two children are in grade
school and one in the crib, and Ian is dropping out of college; the
next, the older daughter is a doctor in Los Angeles and Ian has a
receding hairline.
</P>
<P>
   There is one scene in between, in which the older daughter
declares herself an atheist and stays home from church. Apparently
that is meant to represent the day-to-day, never-ending challenges
of being a parent.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Ian was wrong about Lucy in some very
important ways, a fact that would haunt any thinking, feeling adult
for life. But in all fairness, he and the rest of the tortured
Bedloes certainly do deserve a merry Christmas scene by the tree,
and they get it.

`THE RUGRATS MOVIE': A SIBLING TAKES A NEW RIVAL FOR A RIDE

   Dil Pickles is not the first baby whose resentful older sibling
wanted to return him to the hospital, but he's probably the only
one who has such an interesting trip back.
</P>
<P>
   A talking wagon named Reptar takes him down the street, through
the playground, into the back of a Night Mattress truck and into
the forest, which is pretty scary and, as his big brother, Tommy,
says, ``biggerer than the park and the backyard put together.''
Luckily the whole ``Rugrats'' gang is with him.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Dil (full name: Dylan Preston Pickles) is the newborn hero
of ``The Rugrats Movie,'' a film that had to happen. No popular
children's television series goes unmerchandized these days, and
``Rugrats'' is Nickelodeon's most popular. The pleasant surprise is
that the film is a delight.
</P>
<P>
   The stars of ``Rugrats'' are five talking babies: Tommy Pickles,
his cousin Chuckie Finster (a redhead who, despite his extreme
youth, wears eyeglasses just like his father's), the twins Lil and
Phil Deville, and the oldest child, Angelica Pickles, whose raison
d'etre seems to be misguiding the other babies.
</P>
<P>
   At Tommy's mother's baby shower, for instance, Angelica informs
Tommy that when the new baby arrives he'll be completely forgotten;
in fact he'll be turned into a dog and forced to sleep outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy's mother, Didi, goes into labor at the baby shower, and
everybody heads for the Lipshitz Maternity Hospital. This is the
sort of place where an expectant mother might choose to deliver in
the Tibetan Terrace Room.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a constantly changing Due/Arrived/Delayed chart just
like the ones in airports. Tommy tries to like the baby, Dil, when
he arrives, but the first thing Dil does is to grab and twist
Tommy's nose.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks later, Dil has pretty much taken over the household.
So when Tommy's pals suggest that they take him back to ``the baby
store,'' Tommy doesn't put up much of a fight. ``You can't do that;
my mom and dad want to keep him,'' he says halfheartedly, and
before you know it the five babies are on the road, with Angelica
and her treasured doll Cynthia not far behind.
</P>
<P>
   The group's adventures in the woods include encounters with
wolves, a supposed wizard and a troupe of out-of-control Russian
circus monkeys who escaped while their owners were discussing
whether the coffee was better in St. Petersburg or Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the monkeys kidnap Dil. It all seems pretty
threatening, but at a recent preview screening the young audience
was laughing rather than cowering in fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie'' does throw in some material for the
grown-ups. There is a mention of gender stereotyping, a passing
reference to Pearl Harbor and a scene with some pathetic reporters
who turn up at the Pickles house when the children disappear,
getting everybody's name wrong and asking, ``Is it true a dingo ate
your baby?''
</P>
<P>
   There is even, seriously, a scene that re-creates Abraham's
near-sacrifice of his son, Isaac, to God.
</P>
<P>
   Just to keep up with the Joneses (i.e, Disney and Dreamworks),
``Rugrats'' has hired some big names as guest voices. Tim Curry,
for instance is Rex Pester, the most obnoxious of the reporters,
and ``This World Is Something New to Me,'' one of the film's
several musical numbers, is sung by a chorus of newborns, whose
voices include those of Laurie Anderson, Beck, Jakob Dylan and
Patti Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography includes an unusual group effort at the end
that Busby Berkeley probably never thought of. &QL;

AT THE MOVIES: COLD WAR MOOSE ON THE LOOSE; NEFARIOUSNESS WITH A
TWIST; A LEAP FOR TOMLIN  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The Cold War produced plenty of victims, but the
ending of the Cold War has had its victims, too. The
military-industrial complex is a shadow of its former size, the
backyard bomb-shelter business has died, and Rocky and Bullwinkle
have become forgotten heroes without a Boris Badenov or Natasha
Fatale to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Or so we thought. Evil has a way of adapting itself to every
generation, and Boris and Natasha and their fearless leader,
Fearless Leader, have emerged from the '60s and reinvented
themselves as villains for the millennium; now they have a scheme
to take over the world by taking over television. Only a flying
squirrel and a 7-foot-tall moose can stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Studios and TriBeCa Pictures, Robert De Niro's film
company, are preparing to make a big-budget movie based on the old
Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon show, with filming set to begin in
January. The director will be Des McAnuff, who won a Tony in 1993
for directing on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The movie intends to be more than just another retread for
nostalgic baby boomers. Like the original show, noteworthy for its
mocking, satirical edge and wordplay, the picture will be
self-mocking with an edge of tart political satire as it takes on
the media in the latter years of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole premise is, `Gee, the world has changed,''' said
Jane Rosenthal, the movie's producer. ``They sort of drop in and
the Cold War is over and they wonder what evil spies do now. Well,
they seek world domination through TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie will be shot in live action, with only Rocky and
Bullwinkle done in an old-fashioned cartoon style. None of the
casting has been formalized, but De Niro is expected to play the
Fearless Leader.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Snider, president of production at Universal Pictures,
said that as part of the plot the two cartoon characters,
subsisting on tiny syndication checks from the show's diminishing
reruns, contemplate making a Rocky and Bullwinkle movie. They go to
a studio executive, Mini Mogul, to pitch their idea. Her boss
rejects the notion, insisting he does not do moose movies. And Jim
Carrey rejects the lead role because he does not want to walk
around in a heavy, hot moose suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We admit throughout that we're in a movie,'' McAnuff said.
``And we'll have that narrator's voice coming in explaining things.
It's like breaking through the fourth wall of the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The duo find redemption by frustrating the plot of Boris and
Natasha, but only after a string of misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of parachute these Cold War icons into our own day and
age, and what it does is remind us how cynical we've become,''
McAnuff said. ``They bring a kind of clarity to the age of
information through their bumbling. This great big stupid moose
comes up with these gems of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It gets farcical and there's lots of satire, but the
art is to not overdo it. It's like extracting the essence of
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad Guys Who Are Hip
</P>
<P>
   You know that cool guy, the insouciant character who rejects the
establishment, as demonstrated by his yellow-tinted glasses and
unkempt short hair dyed dark red or defiantly spiky hair pushed
straight up. Now imagine that that guy is working for the
government and out to destroy you, using every bit of computer
technology that exists.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the post-Cold War nightmare of Tony Scott. The new
thriller he has directed, ``Enemy of the State,'' due out on Nov.
20, is a relatively standard film of paranoia about a battle of the
little man against overwhelming forces. But there is a twist. In
this bleak view, the hipsters we learned to trust because they
fought the accepted order and pushed creativity ahead of conformity
are now the ones tracking the individualists down, ruthlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's view is not too bleak because the good guys _ one,
played by Will Smith, in a Brooks Brothers suit, and the other,
Gene Hackman, a nondescript everyman in a flannel shirt and
horn-rimmed glasses _ win. But, the movie asks, what kind of
victory is it?
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Smith is a Washington labor lawyer fighting with
some mobsters when a chance encounter with an old classmate turns
his life upside down and he suddenly finds himself struggling
against the awesome resources of the National Security Agency. The
mastermind of the plot against him is a rogue spymaster, played by
Jon Voight, made up as a carbon copy of former Defense Secretary
Robert McNamara. The malevolent force behind all this intrigue is
the telecommunications industry. The old communists look like
pushovers by contrast.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said the point of the movie, which cost roughly $85
million, was to reverse expectations by making the characters
usually presented as nefarious government geeks into hipsters
rather than warped super-patriots. The conservative characters with
the brush cuts are now the good guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was more spooky that way,'' Scott said. ``The
world's changed. The tables have turned. That's what I was aiming
to show here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scott said the movie is not off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make a commitment to a film until I check it out, and
I was able to toy around at the CIA and NSA,'' he said. ``I was
amazed. It was like the campus of UCLA. They were all kids and they
looked like these guys in the movies, sitting with their laptop
computers. I took a leaf out of the reality book when I made it
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   The young agents are meant to be particularly intimidating to
aging baby boomers, Scott said. But he said that at age 54, he does
not regard members of Generation X as rivals.

 HOLLYWOOD: bad thing.''

<P>
   A Nurturing Tomlin
</P>
<P>
   Lily Tomlin has proved her versatility many times over, with
everything from a well-received one-woman show on Broadway to movie
roles like the recent part of an aging producer of LSD in
``Flirting With Disaster,'' and characters like her famed telephone
operator from her television days. But making the leap to play an
American lesbian archeologist in Italy during World War II was
something new.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Tea With Mussolini,'' which will open in late November, Ms.
Tomlin takes on an unusual dramatic role that not only gave her a
chance to try something different, but also took her to Italy for
three months and put her in company that, she said, left her awed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini,'' directed by Franco Zeffirelli, is based
on a chapter in his autobiography that tells the story of his
boyhood. Zeffirelli was illegitimate, and his father took little
responsibility for his upbringing. After his mother died, he was
taken under the wing of a group of odd English women in Florence,
who cared for him during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The women are played by some of the grande dames of the British
theater _ Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench. But
Zeffirelli added two characters for the film.
</P>
<P>
   Cher plays Elsa, an amorous American art dealer who is part of
their circle, and Ms. Tomlin is Georgie, the archeologist, who is
aggressive and protective of this unlikely band of eccentrics who
are struggling to get by as the clouds of war gather. Georgie
teaches the Zeffirelli boy, Luca in the film, to play soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The British women embrace the idea that Mussolini is not such a
bad dictator until Elsa, who is exposed as a Jew, is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about the part, it was actually pretty
negligible, but I just didn't want to pass this up,'' Ms. Tomlin
said from Los Angeles, where she was filming an episode of one of
her favorite television shows, ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, she added: ``Franco rewrote it. Making this was
hilarious, scary, exhilarating, insecure-making. It was everything.
Frustrating. I felt like a bobby-soxer around these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tomlin said that half the fun was swapping stories and
hanging out with the distinguished cast in between takes, but that
the work could get intense because of Zeffirelli's famous
perfectionism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Franco is completely, um, unique,'' she said, fighting for the
diplomatic phrase. ``He's inspiring. He's spoiled. He's
infuriating. He's endearing, all in one day. You would see him do
the most impassioned things.''
</P>
<P>
   Some modifications had to be made for Ms. Tomlin's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one scene she has to swing up these big suitcases,'' Ms.
Tomlin recalled, ``and I just said, `I can't do that physically.'
We had to change it a bit, but she still came through, even with
all those great ladies around. What a trip.''

BRANAGH'S ADAPTATION OF WOODY ALLEN NOT AS YOU'D LIKE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Woody Allen has used the stammering comic delivery to
tease, tense and release laughs for decades. Kenneth Branagh, on
the other, you know, on the other, well, the other hand, should go
back to stammering school.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Celebrity,'' Branagh takes the Allen role on camera (while
Woody stays behind the camera, writing and directing). Branagh
tries to use Woody's trademark stammering delivery to milk the
anxiety jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he becomes the movie's major source of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Branagh single, well, all by him, you know, single-handedly
ruins what would otherwise be one of Woody's middle pictures, not
as deep and funny as ``Manhattan,'' ``Bullets Over Broadway'' or
even ``Deconstructing Harry,'' but more interesting than ``Husbands
and Wives,'' ``Crimes and Misdemeanors`` or ``Shadows and Fog.''
</P>
<P>
   Branagh plays Lee, a struggling magazine writer who covers
celebrities, an opportunity he uses to pantingly pursue movie stars
(Melanie Griffith), supersexed supermodels (Charlize Theron) and
actresses (Winona Ryder) who are even more neurotic than he is.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is free to chase these women, while also chasing a dream of
becoming a serious novelist, because he has just dumped his wife of
16 years, Robin (Judy Davis).
</P>
<P>
   Robin finds that the way to put your life back together when it
has been shattered is to become as shallow as everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   While searching for ways to rid themselves of guilt and
self-contempt, or at least find someone to go home with, Lee and
Robin wallow around the periphery of the famous, trying to get a
piece of it for themselves. This gives Allen a chance for satirical
takes on movie stars, writers and the clamor of celebrity itself.
</P>
<P>
   Allen seems to be saying that being rich and famous isn't all
champagne and caviar. Sometimes it's champagne and caviar and
beautiful women throwing themselves at you.
</P>
<P>
   Allen has dealt with the hardships of celebrity before, notably
in ``Stardust Memories,'' in which he depicts his fans as a
Frankensteinian mob after his head.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Celebrity,'' Allen lays off the fans for the most part and
concentrates on the way fame separates people into two classes:
those who have it and those who aren't going to get even their 15
minutes' worth.
</P>
<P>
   The humor has Woody's typically bitter edge, with the occasional
release of his witty observations about human foibles.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has been in enough Allen movies to handle the angst humor
adroitly. But Branagh drags it down with his annoying overanxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Allen should have taken the lead role, but he probably had
reservations about picturing himself pursuing a so-young Ryder on
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's most fun is wondering which star will turn up in a
cameo next. Leonardo DiCaprio tops the list as a pampered movie
star who has a celebrity arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity,'' filmed in black and white to no particular
advantage, is rated R for profanity and sex. 2 stars. &QL;

`REAR WINDOW': REVIVING A SNOOPER SLEUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(bl) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's be blunt about the average viewer's response to the very
idea of Christopher Reeve in a remake of ``Rear Window'': it sounds
like a cruel joke.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve has accumulated an immense amount of good will for his
strength and tenacity after a riding accident left him paralyzed
from the neck down three years ago. Still, it's one thing to watch
James Stewart, in the 1954 original, play a man in a wheelchair
with a broken leg who spies on his neighbors and thinks he spots a
murderer. It's another to imagine Reeve taking over a role he would
seem to be living rather than acting. How can anyone overlook that
difference?
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly sensible answer is that the difference is not
ignored but placed front and center. This film is less about
remaking Hitchcock than about reinventing Reeve as an actor, and he
pulls the trick off with a true performance and a remarkable
display of his old movie-star presence.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a tacky embarrassment, this ``Rear Window'' is
tasteful, engaging and extremely clever as it revamps the original,
tailoring it for Reeve.
</P>
<P>
   The story includes embedded messages about the lives of the
disabled; Reeve's character lives in a high-tech apartment, in
which everything is voice-activated, including the camera and
monitor that allows him to amuse himself by snooping into the
apartments next door.
</P>
<P>
   This version is not nearly as snappy as Hitchcock's, even with
slight plot changes to add surprise. But it is a slick enough
cat-and-mouse game to serve the purpose of giving Reeve a star
turn.
</P>
<P>
   And, intentionally or not, his presence in the film bolsters its
theme of voyeurism. In the movie, his character watches the
neighbors; in everyday life, we watch Reeve interviewed by Barbara
Walters. We are all voyeurs to some degree, and at its core ``Rear
Window'' is about the guilty satisfactions of invading someone
else's intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Where Stewart's character was a photographer, the Reeve
character is an architect named Jason Kemp. The film begins with
his dream of the car crash that left him a quadriplegic, unable to
breathe for long without the help of a vent delivering air. While
still in the hospital, his breathing tube falls out and he clicks
out a message for help with his teeth. Even then, Jason never seems
a victim or an object of pity, as Reeve and the character swiftly
blend together.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long to get used to the scratchiness in Reeve's
voice. He smoothly registers emotions with his face and eyes as
well as dialogue. And the use of judicious close-ups and editing
create a dynamic sense of Jason as the most active player in this
drama.
</P>
<P>
   The script has its share of preachy lines. Like Reeve, Jason is
blessed with financial freedom, though the script has him dutifully
note about his new technological equipment, ``Do you have any idea
how expensive it is to be disabled in this country?'' Only when
Jason arrives home does the story become recognizable as ``Rear
Window.''
</P>
<P>
   From his window, he spies on an up-to-the-minute array of
neighbors: a gay couple; a workaholic man always at his computer; a
heavy-drinking blonde with a passing resemblance to Sharon Stone,
who fights constantly with her husband, a sculptor. When she
vanishes after a violent argument, Jason is convinced the police
should search for her corpse.
</P>
<P>
   As in Hitchcock, point of view controls the suspense here. As
the murder plot comes to involve e-mail, cell phones and even
sabotage on Jason's air supply, we know only as much as he does.
Yet throughout, the quiet moments are equally involving, with his
face registering loneliness and longing as he observes the ordinary
lives of others.
</P>
<P>
   So much attention has been lavished on Reeve's role that the
others are not nearly as well drawn or cast. In the Grace Kelly
part, Daryl Hannah plays Claudia, this time an architect called in
to help Jason finish a project. She shares his voyeuristic
amusement and ultimately his belief that a murder has taken place.
</P>
<P>
   But when Jason's health-care aide, Antonio (Ruben
Santiago-Hudson), says of Claudia, ``She likes you, the way a woman
likes a man,'' he might as well be explaining to the surprised
audience as well as to Jason. The problem is not Reeve's
disabilities. Jason is attractive, he's charming, he's Christopher
Reeve, after all. But Ms. Hannah's cold-fish performance gives
little hint of the attraction built into the script, and resolved
with a too-easy storybook ending. Her stiffness is miles away from
Kelly's cool surface and simmering sexuality. And while Antonio is
pleasant enough, he's no substitute for Thelma Ritter's acerbic
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Before his accident, Reeve was beginning to reinvent himself as
an actor who could go beyond ``Superman,'' notably as a congressman
in ``The Remains of the Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rear Window'' is another reinvention of the actor, in a role
that carries a subtle message. Our initial fears that the film
would be a tasteless joke reflect just the sort of preconceptions
he is doing so much to dispel.
</P>

`THE SHADOW OF KILIMANJARO': TRAVELING ON FOOT THROUGH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(rl) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a world that is smaller and smaller, it's harder and harder
to write travel books that have the zing of adventure and the
unknown to them, but a host of traveler-authors continues to plow
the historic terrain. And no terrain in this regard is more
historic than East Africa, a portion of which _ from the summit of
Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to the shores of the Indian Ocean in Kenya
_ was traversed on foot last year by Rick Ridgeway and a team of
expert Kenyan guides.
</P>
<P>
   Ridgeway, whose new book, ``The Shadow of Kilimanjaro,'' is an
account of his trip, broaches a variety of subjects as he and his
companions make their way through an area rich with animals and
echoing with the exploits of earlier travelers _ British empire
builders, native hunters, tourists like Ernest Hemingway.
Ridgeway's effort is to use his trek, which takes him from the ice
fields of Africa's highest mountain to the Indian Ocean, about
three days' walk away, as a starting point for reflections on
history and nature.
</P>
<P>
   He describes the activities of pioneering game wardens to save
the local elephants. He ruminates on the Waliangulu, the famed
People of the Long Bow, perhaps the world's greatest archers, whose
way of life has been abruptly terminated by the requirements of
conservation. He reads widely and recounts the experiences of
predecessors in this part of Africa, for example, Lt. Col. J.H.
Patterson, a railroad builder whose greatest adventure was to hunt
down two lions that had eaten dozens of his Indian coolies.
Ridgeway also scrutinizes his own reactions and emotions to try to
answer some questions: Why do men enjoy hunting? Why are hunters
also conservationists?
</P>
<P>
   The past events and the present situation of East Africa are so
intrinsically interesting that it would be almost impossible to
write a boring book on these subjects. Still, ``The Shadow of
Kilimanjaro'' is limited in important ways, in large part because
Ridgeway, likable and earnest as he is, does not have either the
literary or philosophical originality to provide compelling answers
to the questions he raises. His own excursion through the African
bush also falls short of what might be called great adventure. But
one reads his book with pleasure, enjoying his companionship and
conversation, his keenness for experience and knowledge, and the
quality of many of his observations.
</P>
<P>
   Ridgeway, who lives in California, was in East Africa making a
documentary film (which is what he does for a living in far-flung
parts of the globe), so he did not exactly travel light. His
companions were three experienced Kenyan mountaineers and game
guides, as well as a cameraman and three African park rangers
carrying high-powered rifles to protect the team from any attacking
elephants, buffalo, hippos or lions. Here and there at designated
points on the route, porters and a cook showed up in Land Rovers so
that Ridgeway and his company could get close to nature and arrive
in a comfortable and well-equipped camp at the end of each day.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, while the expedition was on foot _ ``the only
way,'' Ridgeway writes, ``to gain a tactile knowledge of Africa's
wildlands and wild animals'' _ this was something of a champagne
safari. One doesn't blame our travelers for that, but the very
comfort of it robbed the experience of some of its literary
possibilities. Hardship in the African bush is more interesting to
read about than the enjoyment of mozzarella and tomato salad served
with iced beer, which is why accounts of some of the earlier
explorations described in passing by Ridgeway seem more exciting
than his own.

 UNDATED: his own.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ridgeway team saw plenty of animals in the two parks it
traversed, Tsavo West and Tsavo East, which extend eastward from
the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro, but the presence of armed guards
took away the suspense. At one point, the group is charged by an
elephant matriarch, but the park rangers fire bullets over its head
and the elephant, no fool, ``plows its front legs to a stop, veers
and runs at an angle away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   The elephant charge is a high point for Ridgeway, one that he
comes back to several times as he ruminates on human pleasure in
the hunt. After considerable reflection, he arrives at the not very
astonishing conclusion that the pleasure has to do not with the
kill itself, but with the previous connection to the bush, ``the
razor edge your senses take'' at the nearness of a buffalo or ``the
charge of a 12,000-pound elephant who means to do you harm.''
</P>
<P>
   A more poignant reflection comes near the end of the trip when
Ridgeway and his team visit members of the Waliangulu tribe, once
great elephant hunters, most of whom have spent terms in prison for
poaching. The Waliangulu had established an equilibrium with the
elephant, which they hunted with poison-tipped arrows. The
equilibrium, Ridgeway concludes unsentimentally, was due to the low
level of their technology, not to some ecological wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   But the elephant population declined anyway because of the
poaching of others, and that required a ban on all elephant
hunting, even if it meant prosecuting the Waliangulu for carrying
on the way of life of their ancestors. Ridgeway leaves the
Waliangulu village with the memory of a former hunter chewing
slowly on a sheep bone and saying: ``In the old days, we did
important things. Now, we only farm.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an elegiac ending for a people caught in the very vise
that Ridgeway represents, the vise of European visitors, tourism,
international markets, high-powered rifles. To his credit, Ridgeway
understands that fact as he makes his morally cautious way through
Africa. What he understands is that, moral caution or not, he is
able to enjoy it, and the Waliangulu are not.

 MEMBER OF MOHEGAN TRIBE SUES U.S., CLAIMING LIBERTY ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, Timothy J. Stoddard has tried to be
noticed in his campaign for American Indian rights. A member of the
Mohegan tribe, he and other American Indians sought to celebrate
tribal prayer and water ceremonies last year on Liberty Island,
home to the Statue of Liberty, but federal authorities prevented
the news media from filming the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Stoddard sought revenge of a legal sort. He filed
suit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,
alleging that Liberty Island was originally owned by Mohegans and
other Northeastern tribes like the Manhattans and was never
properly sold to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of one of those tribes, Stoddard is laying claim to
Liberty Island, or at least seeking a ``third party,'' like the
International Court of Justice at The Hague, Netherlands, to decide
who really owns the land. If he wins, he will seek some of the
tourist revenue from the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Stoddard, 35, a computer network engineer from Slingerlands,
N.Y., a suburb of Albany, says he is three-eighths Mohegan on his
father's side. Bruce Clark, a lawyer, drafted the complaint, but
Stoddard said he would represent himself. Stoddard said in his
complaint that any land that has not been properly transferred, by
deed or treaty, remains Indian land. ``We want to be seen as a
sovereign nation whose land was usurped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Liebman, 57, a Columbia University professor of property
law, called Stoddard's suit ``the latest in a long series of
disputes as the United States continues to wrestle with claims that
go back to the original occupation of the continent.'' It is
similar to suits filed in China, India, Australia and Canada, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The view in all these cases is that the rights of native
peoples were never properly paid for,'' Liebman said.
</P>
<P>
   But American law, which has granted land to American Indians in
certain cases, is far more complicated than that, Liebman said. It
is true that the law says title to land must be properly
``extinguished,'' or resolved, but that can include war or a
declaration by Congress, he said. Also, Stoddard has to prove that
the Mohegans owned Liberty Island and that he is a Mohegan. ``Was
that group really there, and can he show continuous descent?''
Liebman said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest hurdle, Liebman said, is that courts have
consistently ruled that domestic land disputes are to be settled in
American courts, not international ones.

   Back to Comedy
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ In one scene in Ron Howard's upcoming movie,
``edTV,'' a loutish character played by Woody Harrelson stands in
front of a television camera and delightedly discloses that his
sister is dating a man who plays the piano so badly that during a
gig at a bar his head was cracked open by someone throwing the tip
glass. How funny that the couple met in a bar, he blabbers, because
his sister is an alcoholic. Hah-hah!
</P>
<P>
   ``EdTV'' is about a family made famous when it agrees to have
its life broadcast 24 hours a day, and Ron Howard wants us to
understand that celebrity does strange things to people.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nine years since Howard, the director and producer,
created a comedy. His last comic effort was ``Parenthood,''
followed by dramas like ``Apollo 13'' and ``Ransom.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back with ``edTV,'' which stars Matthew McConaughey,
Harrelson, Jenna Elfman and Martin Landau, all part of or friends
of the family, with the focus on one of the sons, Ed, who makes
himself a television fixture. Unlike the character in ``The Truman
Show,'' these slightly dysfunctional people invite the camera to
observe, until their lives spin out of control. The film, produced
by Howard's partner, Brian Grazer, is scheduled to open next spring
and carries a new, somewhat personal edge for Howard.
</P>
<P>
   The film is not just a comedy; it has a serious point to make
about how celebrity can twist people, an apt sentiment for a man
who says he suffered under his early celebrity as a child actor and
who has struggled to build himself a world of normalcy ever since.
Howard lives in Westchester County in New York, not Los Angeles,
and he said his four children go to public schools there.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said he had been looking for a way of getting back into
comedy; he called ``edTV'' ``thoroughly unpretentious
entertainment.'' Yet, he added, it offers an object lesson for a
country obsessed with the idea that celebrity solves rather than
creates problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I can relate to,'' Howard said. ``It's about
the notion of volunteering to become a celebrity and how you can
get caught up with it. But it was a way to deal with these issues
without copping to a poor-me attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, the normally controlled and somewhat
cerebral Howard suddenly spoke loudly, above the din of a
restaurant here, to imitate the way football players at the
University of Southern California, which he attended for a few
years, used to shout and call him ``Opie,'' the character he played
on television years ago. The memories clearly stung.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't exactly a happy kind of thing to face, but in this
movie I didn't want to do a story that was just bleak and awful,''
Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's not really about the media, although it does
use the power of television. It's about grabbing at the shortcut,
about what people think that will do, and what it really does.''
</P>
<P>
   Pig at a Snail's Pace
</P>
<P>
   Few films in recent years have charmed audiences with such
seeming effortlessness as ``Babe,'' a $30 million movie about a pig
that thinks it's a sheepdog. The seductive little hero won hearts,
awards and a huge box office gross with what seemed like the
simplest of techniques. What an easy film to follow up with a
sequel, one would think.
</P>
<P>
   One would have to think again. George Miller is the producer,
director and screenwriter of ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' and in an
interview this week he sounded zombielike after a string of what he
said had been 20-hour days, desperately scrambling to complete the
picture for its Nov. 25 release.
</P>
<P>
   More than double the amount of money was spent on the sequel as
on the original. It has many more lavish special effects, and it
has been anything but effortless, Miller said. The post-production
_ the process of editing, adding titles and combining the dialogue,
music and sound _ has been difficult, expensive and more
time-consuming than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a charity screening event had to be canceled at the last
minute because the movie was not ready, and there was even a
last-minute scramble to change some scenes so the film would get a
``G'' rating rather than ``PG.''
</P>
<P>
   The film was shot in Miller's home, Australia; it takes the
little pig on a journey of healing into the heart of the heartless
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an incredibly complicated movie because of all
the animals,'' Miller said. The production notes say that 799
animals were involved, from dogs and mice to, of course, pigs.
Miller explained that most had to be shot individually, and then
combined in the editing room to create the illusion that they were
talking to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the biggest problems involved the soundtrack. Early
last week, he said, the production team discovered that the sound
was grating on the ears, and that they would have to remix and
redub the entire thing. That is what forced the cancellation of the
advance screenings, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I realized how bad it was I thought the sound would
completely undo us,'' Miller said. He added that round-the-clock
efforts by a team of experts resolved the problems, but left
everyone exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a sensible way to make a movie,'' he said, adding
that he broke a front tooth several weeks ago and still has not had
time to get it repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Science Throwback
</P>
<P>
   Science has become one of the more frightening characters in
movies. Science fiction has become equated with malevolent forces;
at the least, science in film usually involves the creation of
technologies that have a funny way of falling into the wrong hands
and threatening civilized society, if not a neighborhood or two.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Johnston, who directed ``Jumanji'' and ``Honey, I Shrunk the
Kids,'' and created special effects for several Star Wars films,
introduces a radical vision of science in his upcoming movie,
``October Sky.'' The movie is a decided throwback, in that it is
based on the premise that science is about fulfilling dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, which is based on a true story, the character Homer
Hickam, a boy living in the rough and tumble mining town of
Coalwood, W. Va., in 1957, looks up into the October sky one night
and sees a streak of light that changes his life. It is the Soviet
sputnik satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The vision is tantalizing and makes Homer and three of his
friends believe that, by building their own model rocket, they just
might escape the mines and find a new life built on their
imaginations and mastery of science. Homer is played by Jake
Gyllenhaal and his father by Chris Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read the first draft of the script, I thought to
myself, `This is probably not a film for L.A., or New York, or
parts of Chicago,''' Johnston said. ``It's not very hip. It borders
on corny at times. I did this as a conscious decision to be a
little old-fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Johnston, 48, said ``October Sky,'' which is scheduled
to run next spring, was an effort to ``overcome'' his background in
expensive, special effects-laden movies, about which he harbors
mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when he first saw the script, he had been working
on another expensive science fiction movie, but dropped it in an
instant to make ``October Sky,'' which is also about a boy's desire
to find a way of connecting with a distant father. The movie cost
$23 million, about a third the cost of ``Jumanji,'' which used some
of the most complex special effects ever created for film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped this would open up another avenue for me,'' said
Johnston, who said he took a big cut in his usual fee to direct the
film. ``I'd kind of been looking to do this for a long time.''

   IMPEACH-RDP (Washington) _ Independent counsel Kenneth Starr
opened the third presidential impeachment inquiry in the nation's
history Thursday by charging before a bitterly divided House
Judiciary Committee that President Clinton ``misused his authority
and power'' to impede civil and criminal cases against him. By
Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-MEMBERS (Washington) _ The House Judiciary Committee,
known as the most fiercely polarized panel on Capitol Hill, did not
disappoint Thursday. During a full day of testimony, Democrats and
Republicans sparred repeatedly as they tried to either savage or
laud independent counsel Kenneth Starr. By Eric Schmitt and Lizette
Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ASSESS (Washington) _ A news analysis: How Starr acquits
himself. By Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-SMOKE (Beijing) _ Scientists have for the first time
calculated the devastating health toll of cigarette smoking in
China and declared the country to be on the verge of a major
epidemic of smoking related deaths that they said may well kill 1
in 3 Chinese men. By Elisabeth Rosenthal with Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-WESTBANK (Psagot, West Bank) _ The signing of the Wye
peace memorandum in Washington last month dropped like a missile of
doom into Israel's political right wing. It shattered alliances,
blurring the political identity of a movement built around
defending the Jewish homeland against territorial compromise. It
expanded the political center, and transformed those who clung to
their right-wing ideology into a kind of fringe. What has emerged
most powerfully is a new pragmatism, which puts the movement's
guiding ideology on the back burner, if not in the waste bin. By
Susan Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-PATRIOTS (Hartford, Conn.) _ A miffed owner and an eager
governor shook hands Thursday, giving the New England Patriots a
new home in downtown Hartford and infusing Connecticut's blighted
capital with big-league cachet. Gov. John Rowland promised to build
a $350 million stadium for the Patriots owner, Robert Kraft, who
said he felt the Massachusetts Legislature had been too stingy. By
Mike Allen.

REEVE IS SOLID IN AN OTHERWISE REMAKE OF `REAR WINDOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Curiosity seekers will be tuning to ABC Sunday to see how
Christopher Reeve fares in his first acting role since being
paralyzed in 1995. They should be immensely pleased. Relying only
on facial expressions and an unpredictable voice, Reeve is solid
and convincing in Hallmark Entertainment's remake of ``Rear
Window.''
</P>
<P>
   But others intent on making a comparison between this version
and Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterwork about voyeurism will not be
impressed. Aside from Reeve's gutsy performance, the view from this
``Rear Window'' is unsatisfying.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if director Jeff Bleckner (``Serving in Silence: The
Margarethe Cammermeyer Story'') spent so much energy focusing on
Reeve's comeback that he forgot to create a complete story.
</P>
<P>
   As an executive producer, Reeve also deserves some blame for
using the project as a platform to raise awareness about the
abilities of people with spinal-cord injuries. He's not the first
to act from a pulpit, but in choosing ``Rear Window'' as the
vehicle Reeve has tinkered with the essence of a fine story and
rendered it very dull.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliance of Hitchcock's film lay in the claustrophobic
sense he created by shooting virtually every scene in the
protagonist's tiny apartment. Bleckner, on the other hand, chooses
to venture outside, especially at the beginning, to establish how
Reeve's character, Jason Kemp, becomes paralyzed. In doing so he
wastes precious time and ultimately fails on two key fronts: He
never gives viewers time to make up their own mini-stories about
the neighbors that Jason is spying upon, and he never gives the
supporting players enough time to make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Hannah, for instance, is amazingly graceless in the role
Grace Kelly made memorable nearly a half-century ago. In a role
that didn't offer much screen time, Kelly managed to convey the
complexities of Lisa Fre-
</P>
<P>
   &UR; xr &LR; mont: sophisticated socialite, vulnerable girlfriend,
scheming collaborator, mischievous adventurer.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck this time. Hannah's character is named Claudia
Henderson and she is not a girlfriend _ yet _ but rather a
co-worker of Jason's. Both are architects, and Claudia has taken on
Jason's biggest project while he recuperates from the car accident
that made him a quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   Jason is clearly vexed when he returns home to a specially
modified _ and hardly claustrophobic _ tri-level condo that has
enough high-tech assistive gadgetry to send his wheelchair to the
ninth ring of Saturn. Though energized and motivated by six months
at a rehab center, Jason is not a completely happy camper. He
thinks his partners have rendered him useless by farming out his
prized project to Claudia, a junior associate whose motives he
doesn't trust.
</P>
<P>
   We're to assume here that Jason has so much time on his hands
that he gives in to his Mr. Peepers tendencies and starts spying on
neighbors across the way. But in updating Cornell Woolrich's
original story, screenwriters Eric Overmeyer and Larry Gross have
weakened it considerably, and perhaps unwittingly.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchock's 1954 protagonist, played by Jimmy Stewart, is L.B.
Jeffries, a magazine photographer who can't work because of a
broken leg. Cranky and bored, he takes to watching the neighbors to
pass the time and ends up convincing himself that he has witnessed
a murder in the apartment building across from his.
</P>
<P>
   Same thing happens to Jason Kemp in the remake. But since his
income allows him everything he needs to continue working,
including voice-actuated computer and live-in assistant, the
voyeur-out-of-ennui scenario is hard to swallow, especially with
Claudia coming by daily to consult on work-related projects.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah doesn't help, offering a performance that is remarkable
only for its complete lack of emotion, even as Claudia buys into
Jason's theory and becomes his willing accomplice in bringing down
the bad guy. Robert Forster, meanwhile, is simply underused as
police detective Charlie Moore, leaving to carry the entire film.
</P>
<P>
   Where the original ``Rear Window'' is stylish, sexy, funny and
scary, Sunday's remake gets maybe half a point for scary _ when the
suspect confronts Jason _ but it comes up short on the other three.
</P>
<P>
   Even more disappointing: In order to show ``Rear Window'' as a
November sweeps stunt, ABC had to pre-empt ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rear Window. Two-hour TV movie about a voyeur who thinks he has
witnessed a murder. Starring Christopher Reeve, Daryl Hannah and
Robert Forster. Sunday, ABC. Check local listings. Parental
guideline rating: TV-PG.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+

IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First it was Roger. Then Mo. Now Bob.
</P>
<P>
   Two are players. One is an owner. But their stories are the
same. In the end, their stories are all about money. The bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens left to make a financial score in Toronto and
blamed Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn is on the way out the door for more money and uses the
same exit strategy: Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kraft, who obviously has forgotten those nightmares he used
to have about the Boston Braves leaving town, has his New England
Patriots heading down the Mass. Pike to Hartford. He has the
perfect foil to blame for it: House Speaker Tom Finneran. If
politicians ever wonder why the public has so little regard for
them, all they have to do is listen to what Finneran has to say. To
label him the ``Speaker'' is to demean the term.
</P>
<P>
   I have the same beef with Kraft that I do with Clemens and
Vaughn. None is man enough to speak the truth on the way out the
door: ``I am doing this for money.''
</P>
<P>
   I watched Kraft's press conference in Hartford Thursday on
television and winced when he said he would have had to sell the
team if he had to continue to play in Foxboro Stadium under the
present conditions.
</P>
<P>
   That's a crock.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that Bob Kraft is taking his team to Hartford to
make more money than he could ever make in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   However, don't think for a moment that he wasn't doing well in
Foxborough. Here he had a home run with his investment. Hartford _
unless the deal falls apart, and I still give that a chance _ will
be a grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Said one NFL owner Thursday, ``He bought the team for $160
(million). When he opens in Hartford, it's worth $500 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft and his sons know how to make money. Within two years of
taking over the Patriots, they moved the franchise from near the
bottom of the NFL in gross revenues into the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Through their tough business acumen, they tripled local radio
and television rights to more than $6 million a year. And there's
no telling for sure how they did selling stadium advertising,
scoreboard rights, etc.
</P>
<P>
   When Kraft came into the league four years ago, the television
revenue from national networks averaged $38 million a year. In this
new deal, which has seven more years to run, it will average $70
million.
</P>
<P>
   Since he purchased the team, interest rates have dropped
dramatically, making it easier for him to make his payments.
</P>
<P>
   He will take in $17 million as his share from the expansion
Cleveland Browns. He will get just as much from the next expansion
team in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   No. Owning the Patriots has not been a hardship. We haven't even
mentioned that the government allowed him to write off more than 50
percent of his purchase fee, tax-free, over five years. That's at
least $15 million a year he doesn't pay taxes on. The government
also allows him to amortize the player contracts.
</P>
<P>
   No. Bob Kraft hasn't been mistreated in Foxborough. During his
ownership, the fans have responded by purchasing every available
seat for every game, a fact the team likes to announce proudly in
almost every publicity release. And local businesses have supported
him fully by giving him top dollar for radio, TV, and stadium
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft likes to say he cannot compete in Foxborough because of
all of the new stadiums being built in other cities for his
competitors. He creates the illusion that by having more money, you
have a better team.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings have taken in less money than any other
team in the league. Look at their record.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Redskins, in their new stadium, take in the most
money. Look at their record.
</P>
<P>
   Every year Kraft has been in Foxborough, that stadium has
produced more revenue than Green Bay's Lambeau Field. Who has had
the better team over the past four years? Packers or Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   Each team in the league takes in roughly $58 million from
television this year, and the salary cap is in the area of $53
million.
</P>
<P>
   The salary cap is the same for every team in the league. So is
the TV money. The difference is in how much money they can generate
beyond the regular gate receipts. And this is where Karft's
fortunes will take a big upswing in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has 45 luxury boxes and no preferred seating in
Foxborough. In Hartford, he will have at least 100 luxury boxes and
better than 6,000 preferred seats. Kraft does not have to share the
money from the luxury boxes with the players. NFL players are
entitled to 64 percent of the revenues, excepting that taken in
from special seating.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the greatest difference will come between the
Foxborough and Hartford stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important difference lies in who is responsible.
Here Kraft would have to write the check to pay for the stadium. It
wouldn't have been his money, as his supporters like to say. The
money to pay for ``his'' Foxborough stadium would have come from
selling personal seat licenses for the most part.
</P>
<P>
   In Hartford, the state of Connecticut is on the hook. It writes
the check. There will be no personal seat licenses. Kraft keeps 90
percent of the revenues, if what we read and hear at this point is
to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is doing what 99.9 percent of all businessmen in this
country would do. He is taking the better deal. Just like Roger.
Just like Mo.
</P>
<P>
   He could have stayed, just as they could have stayed. The issue
was for how much, and they went for more.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the state of Rhode Island thought it had a deal with
Kraft. At noon one Monday, the governor's press aides alerted the
local media that he would have a press conference at 6 p.m. to
announce an agreement in principle, or a letter of understanding,
whichever you want to call it, with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came, the embarrassed governor had to meet the
press to tell them there was no deal. The story is that Kraft tried
to up the ante at the last minute, and the state walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Until this is all signed and there is no way out in Connecticut,
do not consider it a deal.
</P>
<P>
   If they do make it, imagine how embarrassed the other owners
will be when the time arrives to vote on the move _ taking a team
out of the Boston area, where every seat has been sold for five
years, the team generated some of the highest revenues in the
league from its stadium, and it is still allowed to leave for one
reason, and one reason only.
</P>
<P>
   To make more money.

   JAPAN-CLINTON (Tokyo) -- President Clinton brings a message of
hope to Japan about its crucial role in resolving the Asian

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Standing in the hallway outside the House Judiciary
Committee hearing, Doug Muzzio waited much of Thursday for his turn
to see a half hour of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up at 5 o'clock this morning and said, 'How can I be
here and not watch this?' I'd be crazy to miss it,'' said Muzzio, a
New York University professor here to do research at the Library of
Congress for a book on movie history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he WAS crazy,'' said his wife, Barbara, who
nonetheless came with her husband at about 7 a.m. to await their 30
minutes in the two seats set aside for the public in the packed
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Rotating through, scores of visitors got a first-hand glimpse of
this long day of drama and droning on, as the only third
presidential impeachment proceeding in the nation's history dragged
toward its uncertain conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was presenting his
case against President Clinton to Congress, and seeing it on a
small screen was not good enough for these folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an historic process,'' said Isamu Dyson, a George
Washington University student who arrived at 5:45 a.m. to be the
first in line. ``I'm being a good citizen being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in line, people pointed excitedly when committee members
passed by _ celebrities to the committed devotees of cable TV
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an addict,'' admitted Muzzio, who teaches public policy
and wrote a book on the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side of the Rayburn Building, other tourists
gathered to gawk at TV correspondents as reporters and technicians
worked in a makeshift studio set up in a lobby. Signs taped to
partitions identified the media territories: Fox, CBS, ABC, Lehrer
News Hour, Court TV, CBN. From chairs on the adjoining balcony,
carefully coiffed men and women told their stories with the Capitol
as a backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a parade of committee members stopped by the bank of
microphones and cameras set up at the end of the lobby to give
their spin on the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now this is good theater over here,'' said Rep. Lindsay
Graham, R-S.C., after a bystander yelled his opinion. ``But the
question is: Is Ken Starr unfair?''
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly the opinion of Michael Moore, the documentary
film-maker of ``Roger and Me,'' who was filming a segment for his
TV program ``The Awful Truth,'' which appears on Bravo. ``I'm
shooting stuff on Ken Starr's attempted coup d'etat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Starr was a hero to the protesters outside _ so-called
``freepers'' devoted to FreeRepublic.com, a conservative Internet
site. Wearing engineer's caps, they blew whistles and cheered the
start of ``the impeachment express.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Muzzios inched closer to the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to do the museums today,'' lamented Barbara
Muzzio.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thinks this is the line to see the van Gogh exhibit,''
laughed another of those awaiting entry.
</P>
<P>
   In Capitol Hill offices, staffers kept one eye on TV screens _
turning their complete attention to the hearing when Starr faced
aggressive questioning from Democratic members. For many, it was
the first time they had seen the independent counsel without his
familiar cup of Starbucks coffee as television cameras showed him
leaving his house for the morning drive to the federal courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The witness was hardly dynamic, however, as he answered the most
antagonistic questions in a slow, calm cadence. There was nearly as
much fidgeting among those sitting in seats inside the hearing as
those standing in line outside.
</P>
<P>
   During Starr's two-hour opening statement, Rep. Barney Frank, a
Democratic committee member from New York, even took a break to go
to the gym, Reuters reported. When he returned 45 minutes later,
Starr was still speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience is the law and the courts. I am not a man of
polls, public relations or politics _ which I suppose is obvious at
this point,'' the witness conceded.

AROUND FOXBOROUGH, SOBER REALIZATION SETS IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It was a dark, dank day, reflecting the mood
of those who walked around the tired-looking stadium with a blank
stare as if they'd just lost something precious.
</P>
<P>
   As the television blared in the makeshift press room that
doubles as a super suite on game days at Foxboro Stadium, a crowd
of media types hovered to watch a press conference from Hartford,
where Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland and Patriots owner
Robert Kraft were pictured arm in arm ready to enter into a 30-year
agreement for a 68,000-seat open-air stadium in downtown Hartford
that would house New England's NFL team starting in 2001, pending
legislative approval and a three-quarters vote of National Football
League owners.
</P>
<P>
   The mood there appeared joyous and celebratory, but here there
was a feeling that something familiar was ending. An era was over.
</P>
<P>
   Done.
</P>
<P>
   Dead.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the media people wondered whether their outlets would
give the Patriots the same coverage in Hartford that they'd
received in Foxborough, and most concluded that coverage in this
part of New England would be reduced dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots coach Pete Carroll seemed uneasy addressing the subject
of moving. After all, his team has enough problems, owning a 5-5
record and having lost four of its last five games; now comes this
major distraction. By 2001, Carroll would be in the final year of
his contract, but he couldn't feel comfortable about being around
that long if the team continues to slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to Bob last night, and he told me there might be an
announcement today concerning a move,'' said Carroll. ``He hoped it
wouldn't disrupt the team and the preparation for (Monday's game
against the Dolphins at Foxboro Stadium), but I think this was
motivated by the situation down there and a decision had to be made
at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   It all felt so strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived in the same house in Walpole for 28 years, and my
wife has already said we're not moving to Hartford,'' said a
security guard outside the gated area at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 100 stadium employees, many hold positions that
augment incomes of spouses with full-time careers. For them, job
security is scheduled to last until 2001, when they, too, would bid
the stadium and the Patriots farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Those who would move with the team, such as director of football
operations Ken Deininger, would have to transplant their families
to the Hartford area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at this as a positive move,'' said Deininger.
``Kids tend to adapt quickest. They'll be adapting to new schools
and making new friends, but what I've told my kids is that there is
baseball and basketball and football and soccer and religion class
in Connecticut as well. As a family, you hope you can afford more
than what you have when you move. You don't want to move backwards,
so I hope to upgrade with the move.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots vice president of player development and community
affairs Don Lowery said he hasn't talked to many employees, but
``if this deal wasn't struck, the franchise would have been sold
and moved. I would think people are pretty happy that we kept it in
New England. We've had people who have been going through this for
10-12 years who are probably relieved about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Deininger will have to engineer the Patriots' move three years
from now. In the meantime, the Patriots also must decide about
their training facility for the short term. For several years, they
have trained at Bryant College in Smithfield, R.I., but the lease
ran out last summer. They can return to Bryant if they so choose,
and in the weeks ahead, that decision will be made while the
Patriots seek to design a new training facility in the Greater
Hartford area.
</P>
<P>
   The players appeared a little confused. Many may not be around
in 2001. Many don't live in New England year round, anyway, so
playing in Hartford would be no different from playing in
Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Tebucky Jones would be going home, having grown up in New
Britain, Conn., but he groused about having to provide more tickets
for family and friends. Ed Ellis, an offensive lineman of the
future who hails from Hartford, was pleased about the prospect of
relocating.
</P>
<P>
   But for most, the issue was peripheral.
</P>
<P>
   Punter Tom Tupa kidded, ``At the end of the year, if an owner
out there needs to have their team moved, call me.'' Tupa once
played with another team that moved _ the Cleveland Browns (now the
Baltimore Ravens).
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe, who knew the move was inevitable, chimed in,
``Anybody want to buy a house?'' Bledsoe and his wife, Maura, are
building a huge home in Medfield. ``There's still time to pick out
the carpet,'' he said. ``I guess we'll live in it for a couple of
years and then sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he'd never been to Hartford. Carroll said he might
have passed through there before. But for most, there was a bigger
issue _ Monday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had better not be a distraction,'' said Bledsoe. ``We have
to play so well to win Monday night that this can't be a
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt ``mad.'' Not about the move, but about the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are pretty mad right now,'' said Bledsoe. ``To have the
kind of talent we have and be 5-5 ... it makes people angry.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was willing to predict what the crowd would be like
Monday night. Carroll alluded to the possibility that some fans
might express their displeasure with the move by taking it out on
the team. He asked for the fans' full support against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely emotional area of the country,'' he said.
``There might be something like that going on. There'll be some
reaction to it, but I hope people continue to support us.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Patriots don't want is for their home games to become
tantamount to road games, but Lowery said he expected support to
continue for the final two-plus years in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fans all over New England now,'' he said. ``Based on
what we see when we're winning, we'll get support. The television
ratings show that they are terrifically supportive of the Patriots,
and the attendance figures show they're terrifically supportive of
the Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery said season ticket-holders would receive a letter in the
mail today or tomorrow telling them they would have preference in
retaining their seats.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that 30-33 percent of the Patriots' 17,000 season
ticket plans are from Rhode Island or Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   How about the new fans in Hartford? Will they be accommodated?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have 8,000 more seats with the additional
luxury boxes (100 instead of 42),'' said Lowery. ``We feel with a
68,000-seat stadium, that should handle the excess we may have from
Hartford-area people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery said Kraft spoke to Governor Paul Cellucci Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob called Governor Cellucci . . . and told him this was going
to happen,'' he said. ``The governor was remorseful but
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots hope their fans will be in the same mood this week.

AUTO SAFETY: PENALIZING ADULTS FOR UNBUCKLED KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also sent in category `a') 
(bl) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Transportation Department plans to announce a
rule in a few days that will require standard hardware in cars and
child seats to make the two fit together better, with the aim of
lowering the annual death toll of about 600 children under age 5.
</P>
<P>
   But seats not secured to the car is the smaller part of the
problem, safety experts say; a bigger one is children not secured
to the seat. About 60 percent of the children killed in car crashes
were not buckled in, although there was often a child seat in the
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new standard will help people who are already doing the
right thing to do it better,'' said Chuck Hurley, a spokesman for
the National Safety Council. ``It won't deal with the central issue
of what's killing kids.''
</P>
<P>
   What will? And what, for that matter, will deal with the issue
of getting adults to buckle themselves in? Widespread use of
conventional seat belts could save 10,000 lives a year, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Police think they know what will work, and will be trying to do
their part this weekend. Nearly 5,000 law-enforcement agencies
around the country will conduct a seat-belt enforcement blitz.
First tried by 1,000 police departments around Memorial Day 1997,
and expanded to about 4,000 for Memorial Day this year, the tactic
has proved so successful that safety strategists have decided to
make the crackdown a twice-a-year event, including Thanksgiving
this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
just before and after Memorial Day this year, taken on streets and
highways around the country, found an increase in compliance with
seat-belt laws, to 65.1 percent from 62.2, which works out to 6
million people. In passenger cars, the rate jumped to 68.7 percent
from 65.6, and in pickups, vans and sport utility vehicles, to 60
percent from 56.
</P>
<P>
   If all these vehicle occupants stay buckled for a year, experts
say, the annual death toll of 41,000 or so will fall by about 700.
But this will probably require continued fear of getting a ticket.
``You can pass laws, but people have to know that they exist and
that they're going to be enforced,'' said Dr. Ricardo Martinez,
head of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Since all cars built since the '60s have safety belts, the
problem is attitude, not hardware. That turns out to be true for
baby seats, too, according to a recent survey of parents who
received tickets for having unbelted children.
</P>
<P>
   In California, which has relatively strict enforcement of laws
requiring child-safety seats, judges often order offending parents
to take a remedial education course on the importance of
child-safety seats, and from January to July of this year, the
instructors polled 745 of them. Ninety-five percent said they had a
seat, although most said they had left it at home or in another
family car. Almost 30 percent had child seats in their cars at the
time they received tickets for not putting their children in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people who take better care of their
groceries than they do of their kids when they drive on the
highways,'' Martinez said. ``We have to do a better job of getting
these kids properly restrained and protected during the violence of
a crash.''
</P>
<P>
   A study of accidents in California from 1987 to 1996 found that
558 children under age 4 died in that period, and that all but 97
would probably have lived if they had been properly buckled. Very
few died if they had been correctly buckled.
</P>
<P>
   Compliance is highest for newborns and infants, and declines
year by year until about age 25, according to surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, a former emergency-room physician, quoted an old
saying in medicine: ``Good judgment comes from experience, and
experience comes from bad judgment.'' The problem, he said, was
that waiting for people to gain experience by not using seat belts
or baby seats was not a useful strategy. As a result, federal and
state officials plan a long campaign of enforcing laws requiring
adults to wear seat belts and children to be secured in child
seats.
</P>
<P>
   While a change in parents' behavior is necessary, the easier
part _ changing the rule on how the auto makers and seat
manufacturers build their products _ will come before Christmas,
Martinez said. The likely choice for the agency is a requirement
for car makers to install small bars near the spot where the seat
bottom and seat back come together; baby seats would latch into the
bars the way that removable seats in the back of a minivan attach
to the floor. Or the bars might have a strap attached to them that
looks like the male end of a seatbelt, only smaller; a female end
would be required on the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the solution, baby seats would come with two attachment
systems for a transition period of several years.
</P>
<P>
   As for adjusting attitude, that will take a continuing effort,
especially where children are concerned. ``This has to be addressed
forever and ever and ever,'' said Stephanie Tombrello, the head of
Safety Belt Safe, a 19-year-old nonprofit organization in
California, ``because there's a new parent born every day.''

working well together and have extensive backgrounds in
agriculture. They say they will turn the committee into an
agressive and powerful force in Congress. Combest, who will chair
the committee, said he will embark on a PR campaign to educate the

   JAPAN-CLINTON _ TOKYO _ Taking his message of hope and change
far from home, President Clinton gave Japan an economic pep talk on
Thursday, urging the country to get behind a controversial set of
programs aimed at ending seven years of stagnation here that is
dragging down the world economy. With Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
struggling to implement $700 billion worth of initiatives meant to
shore up the country's debt-ridden banks and stimulate spending and
growth, Clinton avoided high-pressure rhetoric, publicly at least,
and instead encouraged the Japanese to embrace Obuchi's plans.

Thanksgiving. The port city of Plymouth is making plans for its
first American Thanksgiving Festival, complete such exotic-sounding
dishes as succotash and pumpkin pie to complement a dinner of
turkey with cranberry sauce. By some counts, as many as 250,000
Americans live in the United Kingdom, and many feel somewhat
dislocated during periods of traditional U.S. holidays such as
Independence Day, Halloween and Thanksgiving. And despite a full
embrace by many Britons of such American cultural icons as
McDonald's, shopping malls and Homer Simpson, there is only a vague
awareness that there is any significance to last Thursday of
November. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

   ANATOMY OF A CRASH
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529 was only a little
propeller-driven plane that fell in an obscure hayfield in west
Georgia: 10 people died, 19 survived. In terms of lives lost,
certainly it was not on scale with TWA Flight 800 and Swissair
Flight 111. More than 200 people died in each of those crashes. Yet
the ASA crash is writ large across many lives. Nearly two-thirds of
the people aboard survived _ a miracle gift _ and so this crash is
not
</P>
<P>
   only about death, but life.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reporter Gary M. Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from
Georgia to Maine to Texas to Alaska _ to track down and interview
survivors of ASA Flight 529. He also canvassed investigative files
of the National Transportation Safety Board and testimony taken
during the ensuing litigation. Pomerantz vivdly describes the 9
minutes and 20 seconds of horror aboard that doomed aircraft as it
fell to earth, the fire that consumed the broken fuselage, as well
as how the tragedy has reshaped lives.

   CRASH-BLADEMAN _ TYLER, Texas _ The broken propeller stub showed
signs typical of fatigue cracking. It also yielded the most
important clue: serial number 861398. The paper chase now was on:
Maintenance records revealed blade 861398 had been repaired 11
months earlier after failing an ultrasonic inspection. Following
the paper trail, investigators discovered the repair _ a sanding
job _ had been made by a mechanic who signed himself in small,
tight handwriting: ``CSB.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Scott Bender, young, blond and earnest, is a
mechanic no more. He's 27, a Bible student now. Although the crash
is never far from his thoughts, he still knows few details of what
happened. But he knows that it was his blade that broke, and he's
often wondered: Was it my fault? (Pomerantz, Atlanta

AUTO SAFETY: PENALIZING ADULTS FOR UNBUCKLED KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also sent in category `f') 
(bl) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Transportation Department plans to announce a
rule in a few days that will require standard hardware in cars and
child seats to make the two fit together better, with the aim of
lowering the annual death toll of about 600 children under age 5.
</P>
<P>
   But seats not secured to the car is the smaller part of the
problem, safety experts say; a bigger one is children not secured
to the seat. About 60 percent of the children killed in car crashes
were not buckled in, although there was often a child seat in the
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new standard will help people who are already doing the
right thing to do it better,'' said Chuck Hurley, a spokesman for
the National Safety Council. ``It won't deal with the central issue
of what's killing kids.''
</P>
<P>
   What will? And what, for that matter, will deal with the issue
of getting adults to buckle themselves in? Widespread use of
conventional seat belts could save 10,000 lives a year, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Police think they know what will work, and will be trying to do
their part this weekend. Nearly 5,000 law-enforcement agencies
around the country will conduct a seat-belt enforcement blitz.
First tried by 1,000 police departments around Memorial Day 1997,
and expanded to about 4,000 for Memorial Day this year, the tactic
has proved so successful that safety strategists have decided to
make the crackdown a twice-a-year event, including Thanksgiving
this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
just before and after Memorial Day this year, taken on streets and
highways around the country, found an increase in compliance with
seat-belt laws, to 65.1 percent from 62.2, which works out to 6
million people. In passenger cars, the rate jumped to 68.7 percent
from 65.6, and in pickups, vans and sport utility vehicles, to 60
percent from 56.
</P>
<P>
   If all these vehicle occupants stay buckled for a year, experts
say, the annual death toll of 41,000 or so will fall by about 700.
But this will probably require continued fear of getting a ticket.
``You can pass laws, but people have to know that they exist and
that they're going to be enforced,'' said Dr. Ricardo Martinez,
head of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Since all cars built since the '60s have safety belts, the
problem is attitude, not hardware. That turns out to be true for
baby seats, too, according to a recent survey of parents who
received tickets for having unbelted children.
</P>
<P>
   In California, which has relatively strict enforcement of laws
requiring child-safety seats, judges often order offending parents
to take a remedial education course on the importance of
child-safety seats, and from January to July of this year, the
instructors polled 745 of them. Ninety-five percent said they had a
seat, although most said they had left it at home or in another
family car. Almost 30 percent had child seats in their cars at the
time they received tickets for not putting their children in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people who take better care of their
groceries than they do of their kids when they drive on the
highways,'' Martinez said. ``We have to do a better job of getting
these kids properly restrained and protected during the violence of
a crash.''
</P>
<P>
   A study of accidents in California from 1987 to 1996 found that
558 children under age 4 died in that period, and that all but 97
would probably have lived if they had been properly buckled. Very
few died if they had been correctly buckled.
</P>
<P>
   Compliance is highest for newborns and infants, and declines
year by year until about age 25, according to surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, a former emergency-room physician, quoted an old
saying in medicine: ``Good judgment comes from experience, and
experience comes from bad judgment.'' The problem, he said, was
that waiting for people to gain experience by not using seat belts
or baby seats was not a useful strategy. As a result, federal and
state officials plan a long campaign of enforcing laws requiring
adults to wear seat belts and children to be secured in child
seats.
</P>
<P>
   While a change in parents' behavior is necessary, the easier
part _ changing the rule on how the auto makers and seat
manufacturers build their products _ will come before Christmas,
Martinez said. The likely choice for the agency is a requirement
for car makers to install small bars near the spot where the seat
bottom and seat back come together; baby seats would latch into the
bars the way that removable seats in the back of a minivan attach
to the floor. Or the bars might have a strap attached to them that
looks like the male end of a seatbelt, only smaller; a female end
would be required on the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the solution, baby seats would come with two attachment
systems for a transition period of several years.
</P>
<P>
   As for adjusting attitude, that will take a continuing effort,
especially where children are concerned. ``This has to be addressed
forever and ever and ever,'' said Stephanie Tombrello, the head of
Safety Belt Safe, a 19-year-old nonprofit organization in
California, ``because there's a new parent born every day.''

SIGMAR POLKE: WHEN PRINTER'S MISTAKE IS PAINTER'S OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With so much postwar abstraction in New York just now
_ Pollock, Rothko, de Kooning drawings _ it's a good time to
consider some of the genre's contemporary masters. One is the
German painter Sigmar Polke, who has a show of two dozen strange,
beautiful, sort of abstract new paintings at Michael Werner
Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Polke, 57, is an of-the-moment master, one for whom the very
notion of mastery _ the virtuosic touch, the thrill of
self-expression _ seems to hold little intrinsic interest. His
painting is a post-epiphany, post-ego art, a hybrid thing, impure,
mixing in a wide range of ideas and formal ploys like so many
chemical additives. They preserve a tradition, and they also turn
it into something else.
</P>
<P>
   The very title of his show, ``Sigmar Polke: New Paintings,
Printing Mistakes,'' gets the feeling of what he's about. It sounds
both celebratory and debunking, formal but also abject.
</P>
<P>
   For years Polke has been collecting examples of printing errors
found in newspapers: the off-register photograph, the passage of
smudged or bleached-out type, the strand of hair on the press plate
that shows up as a streak on the page.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the paintings at Werner are based on such errors
magnified many times so they became images in themselves, their
original contexts unrecognizable. Some of the forms are amorphous
and abstract; others take on new identities, as in the painting
``Structural Poetry,'' where a rupture in a field of benday dots
looks like a devouring cancer or a burrowing animal.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, Polke manufactures his own accidents. The
elongated figures in ``From `Learning to Learn Anew''' are the
result of his having dragged a picture through a photocopier. And
in ``Break Domination,'' he introduces a literal gremlin in the
form of a bizarre composite creature _ part human, part beast, part
plant _ lifted from the margins of a medieval manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   This leering little grotesque _ a mistake of nature, you might
say _ evokes the spirit of the myth-enthralled Joseph Beuys, who
was once Polke's teacher. But it is also a metaphor for the
mongrel, endlessly layered, decidedly unmythic medium that painting
has become in Polke's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Everything in his inventive art feels reality-based, and nothing
is simple. For years he has painted on printed fabrics, the kind
used for curtains and tablecloths, putting images on images. Many
of the works in the current show are done on stretched white
polyester that turns transparent when moistened, so that whatever
is painted on one side shows through as a distant ghost on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally he creates a further impression of depth by adding,
in front of or behind the transparent ground, a sheet of openwork
fabric netting with a diamond-shaped pattern resembling the wire
mesh embedded for security purposes in thick panes of glass.
</P>
<P>
   Ambiguities of surface and depth are especially pronounced in
paintings that have been coated with countless layers of synthetic
lacquers. In ``Salamander Stone,'' for example, the painted forms _
big black hand-rendered dots and a glistening, sluglike organic
``mistake'' _ seem to float like holographic images in an illusory
three-dimensional space.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is an optical trick wrought through a careful recipe.
Pollock and Rothko, using more traditional means, did somewhat the
same thing: the former with overlapping skeins of paint, the other
with fields of color that, if looked at in the right way, seem to
palpitate with transcendental potential.
</P>
<P>
   But Polke is asking something different from painting, maybe
something that only a television-generation artist could want, or
even envision: an art object that offers transporting
possibilities, but that also carries real-world information.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This may explain why the banal and the visionary enjoy a happy
marriage in Polke's work. His colors are prosaic. Some are pretty,
others gross; most, doused in lacquer or resin, are just neutral. A
few paintings are executed on a photo-refractive fabric that turns
ambient light into a prismatic sheen, a magically tawdry effect.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of the images in the paintings, the
glorified glitches that have been hand painted, reworked, built up
and fussed over, have a surprising metaphoric weight.
</P>
<P>
   The brainlike bulge that swells from the surface of ``Elementary
Building Material'' seems to be packed with molecular forms and
hidden meanings; a tabletop still life of a bottle and glasses in
an untitled piece appears to atomize into a field of tiny rosebuds,
which are actually the pattern of an underlying fabric.
</P>
<P>
   A painting like this comes from a culture of fragments, of
ruins, of things coming apart, as the art of Pollock, Rothko and de
Kooning does not. Their paintings were part of a still-romantic
moment when abstraction was an intact, horizonless frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Polke's work _ not romantic (not even a little bit),
conceptually grounded in defect, heterogeneous, intellectually
probing _ is something else and very much of its time.
</P>
<P>
   It will be fascinating to see where he continues to take all
this. But there is no question about his secure, maverick place in
an exalted 20th-century lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sigmar Polke: New Paintings, Printing Mistakes'' remains at
Michael Werner Gallery, 21 E. 67th St., New York, through Jan. 16.

NFL MATCHUPS: WEEK 12

<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 1 P.M.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (7-3) vs. Minnesota (9-1)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Minnesota won the first meeting, 37-24, back in October
in a Monday night game where Green Bay was flattened on the ground
by back Robert Smith and punished in the air by quarterback Randall
Cunningham's 442-yard passing game. This time look for Packers
receiver Antonio Freeman and Vikings receiver Cris Carter to steal
the show. Both make big plays on third-downs and both will duel in
another high-scoring affair where the defenses will be reeling.
Look for Green Bay to gain retribution. Look for Favre-to-Freeman
to break the game open. This is only the second time these teams
will meet this season. Breaking even here, Green Bay sets the stage
for a nasty third meeting, a final war between the teams during the
NFC playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Packers, 34-28.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (5-5) vs. Washington (2-8)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Arizona toppled Washington, 29-27, earlier this month
with Joe Nedney converting a 47-yard field goal with 2 seconds
remaining. That victory helped keep the Cardinals alive in the
playoff chase. Washington was out of the hunt a long time ago but
showed life last week by whipping the sorry Eagles, 28-3. Arizona
limited Washington to 89 rushing yards the last time and if it can
duplicate that it will be on its way to victory. So much, too,
rides on Cardinals' quarterback Jake Plummer. In two starts vs.
Washington he has passed for 523 yards, five touchdowns and two
interceptions. He will keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Cardinals, 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (3-7) vs. Atlanta (8-2)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: The Bears and Falcons have not met since 1993. What a
welcome sight they will be for the Falcons. After gaining
tremendous confidence by beating the 49ers last week, Atlanta is
ready to roll. If already has its best start in club history. It
has won 13 of its last 16. It can win its eighth straight at home,
a club record. It has scored 284 points (third-most in the NFC) and
has the best rushing defense in the conference. Jamal Anderson (10
rushing touchdowns) is ripping defenses. Chris Chandler at
quarterback is steady and sometimes super. The defense keeps
flowing to the football. Need more reasons for an Atlanta victory?
</P>
<P>
   Score: Falcons, 30-10.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (3-7) vs. Tampa Bay (4-6)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: The season has sunk for the Buccaneers, who had such
high hopes and grand plans but have seen inconsistency on offense
result in a crash. It is not over for the Bucs, but it is getting
close. They were hammered by Detroit, 27-6, earlier in the season.
But the Bucs will make one last run for the playoffs by winning
this one with defense and by showing a bit of offensive spark led
by back Warrick Dunn. Tampa Bay is 4-1 in its new Raymond James
Stadium and plays three of its next four games there. That helps
the Bucs cause in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Buccaneers, 21-13.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (2-8) vs. Buffalo (6-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Peyton Manning has thrown a touchdown pass in seven
straight games. He has passed for 2,289 yards. He has taken every
Colts snap (642 plays). And he was sharp in the end in beating the
Jets on last Sunday. But Buffalo counters with quarterback Doug
Flutie, who is 13-6 as an NFL starter and in nine home games during
his career has never lost. Flutie looks at home. He is at home.
Great news for the Bills. Antowain Smith (3.7 average yards gained
per carry) can help Flutie and his team with a breakout game. Look
for Thurman Thomas, too, to shine (4,264 receiving yards). With 38
additional receiving yards he passes Jerry Butler for third most in
club history.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Bills, 28-17.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (8-2) vs. Pittsburgh (6-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Here go the Jaguars and Steelers again in another close
game with big hits and big plays and momentum swinging moments that
punctuate the game. That's what happens when these teams meet. The
last one ended in a Pittsburgh overtime victory. The last six
meetings have all been won by the home team. Pittsburgh has endured
a deflating Jekyll-Hyde year. They win a big game. They lose a big
game. They win on the road. They lose at home. Consistency has been
hard to maintain, but Pittsburgh gives it another shot with an
emotional defensive display and with hard Jerome Bettis running.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Steelers, 17-16.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (5-5) vs. Dallas (7-3)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Seattle is more talented than Dallas. Seattle is more
talented than several teams. Why the .500 record? Poor play. Poor
leadership. Poor production. This game may swing things Seattle's
way. Look for back Ricky Watters to break loose. Expect receiver
Joey Galloway to streak into the end zone. And watch for Michael
Sinclair (11 sacks) to apply pressure on Dallas quarterback Troy
Aikman. This victory could swing Seattle into gear for a strong
playoff push as the season concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Seahawks, 26-20.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia (2-8) vs. Giants (3-7)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Can either of these teams get the football into the end
zone? It could be brutal to watch. The Giants are more physical and
are at home, so that helps their cause. They should easily handle
the Eagles, especially if they pounce on them early, because
Philadelphia is a team full of doubt. Too, the Eagles are minus-12
in turnover differential. They will cough it up. The Giants will
scoop it. All day long.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Giants, 27-6.

   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs (4-6) vs. San Diego (4-6)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: The bottom has fallen out for Kansas City, and it is
not pretty. Linebacker Derrick Thomas will not play due to
suspension for personal foul penalties vs. Denver. It is a game
where the Chiefs attempt to regain respect for being a class group
of players rather than thugs _ that is the way many fans, unfairly,
think of them now. On the field, the chief problem has been the
offense. It doesn't produce points. The receivers don't make deep
plays downfield. Kimble Anders is a fullback. He leads the Chiefs
in receptions. This is a problem. San Diego has had its share,
especially with rookie quarterback Ryan Leaf succumbing to
pressure. Kansas City needs this victory after five straight
losses. It gets it.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Chiefs, 19-13.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (1-9) vs. St. Louis (3-7)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Must we watch? Can we bear it? The Panthers and Rams
might just punt all day long. Or maybe they will fumble it all
afternoon. Or maybe they will drop it or kick it or just lose it.
Who knows. Does anyone care? Sure, their fans do. Steve Beuerlein
leads the league with a 63.7 completion percentage. He is a leader
among the Panthers. Unfortunately for them, there is not enough
talent or winners to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Rams, 24-9.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (3-7) vs. Cincinnati
</P>
<P>
   Comment: What a horrible year for both clubs. Both were expected
to be in their divisional chase. Both have become mired in bad
play. The Bengals win because they are playing this game at home.
They win it with Paul Justin in at quarterback, and he provides an
instant lift. It will be another tough game for Ted Marchibroda,
the Ravens' head coach, whose days in Baltimore are now numbered.
Watch Ravens' cornerback Rod Woodson. He has seven career
interceptions versus Cincinnati, the most he has gained against any
team.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Bengals, 23-17.
</P>
<P>
   Jets (6-4) vs. Tennessee (6-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Tennessee has won five of its last six, and in that
stretch quarterback Steve McNair has passed for 1,195 yards with
six touchdowns and three interceptions. Houston is a hot team.
McNair is a hot quarterback. The Jets are sorrowful after beating
Buffalo and then losing to Indianapolis. Opportunity wasted. The
Jets will blitz McNair and attempt to confuse him with a variety of
pass coverages. But look for McNair to find tight end Frank Wycheck
when it counts and for back Eddie George to keep the Jets' run
defense on edge. Two teams with intriguing schemes results in an
intriguing matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Oilers, 21-20.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders (7-3) vs. Denver (10-0)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Boy, the Raiders would love to upset Denver. They would
love to see Denver squirm. They would be thrilled to put an end to
this thought about Denver achieving a perfect 16-0 regular season.
It would be such a nice thing for Raiders head coach Jon Gruden. Al
Davis, the Raiders owner, would fly home without a plane. The team
would be jacked, ready for a strong push into the playoffs. Raiders
fans would laugh. Broncos fans would cry. The Raiders would be the
talk of the league. They would be only two games behind Denver in
the AFC West with five games to go. Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Broncos, 36-10.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (5-5) vs. San Francisco (7-3)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: The 49ers are suffering an identity crisis after
dropping two big games in recent weeks, Green Bay first and then
Atlanta next. Who are we? Are we kings anymore? This is the 49ers'
psyche. Well, here comes a welcome face _ the Saints. They will
soothe the 49ers' egos. Quarterback Kerry Collins gives the Saints
a better chance versus the 49ers, but he will not be enough to end
San Francisco's spell over New Orleans. Steve Young will outplay
him and, for a change, the 49ers defense will soar.
</P>
<P>
   Score: 49ers, 30-14.

   Comment: Welcome to lovely Hartford, Conn., for this showdown
between two ... uh, that's in 2001. Yes, the Patriots are moving to
Hartford, but this one will be played in Foxboro, Mass., at Foxboro
Stadium. The clock is ticking. Soon the Patriots will be gone. But
there is plenty of business to take care of first, including this
divisional battle with the Dolphins in front of the nation. The
Patriots fans will arrive and some, no doubt, will show their
displeasure with their team moving. But others will root and enjoy
as the Patriots get injured receiver Terry Glenn back and he
returns in a big way with big catches for long scores.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Patriots, 27-24.

<P>
   TOKYO _ For years, investors have nagged Toyota Motor Corp. to
put its huge pile of cash _ some $20 billion at last count _ to
work.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the company has taken a hammer to its piggy bank,
those same investors are questioning the way some of the money is
being spent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Toyota raised its stake in Chiyoda Fire and
Marine Insurance Co., increased its holdings in a brokerage firm,
Kokusai Securities, and bought control of a longtime affiliate,
Daihatsu Motor Co., a small-vehicle manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   It spent more than $450 million in the process, almost 10
percent of its estimated operating profits for the fiscal year that
ends in March, and it may spend more if it takes part in a bailout
of the troubled Sakura Bank, which it says is under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The company has justified past investments in software and
telecommunications as keys to its future as it develops alternative
engines, ``smart cars'' and the infrastructure to support them. And
indeed, roughly two-thirds of Toyota's investments are clearly
auto-related.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been some notable gaffes outside the automotive
business, in prefabricated housing and in a long-distance telephone
company. Toyota has given only the broadest description of the
plans for its latest investments, leaving some investors to
question the company's motives.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that Toyota hopes to create a
financial-services empire a la General Motors Acceptance Corp., the
arm of GM that extends well past financing car purchases, or
General Electric's profitable powerhouse, GE Capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear that Toyota is buying a stake in an insurance
company or a mobile-telephone operator, it sounds astounding,''
Iwao Okijima, executive vice president in charge of financial
matters, said in a recent interview. ``But please understand that
the majority of Toyota's investments are in car-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toyota is now expanding its auto-financing business all over
the world. Please regard it as part of our auto business from now
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company's plans for a financial-services business
seem to lack a road map. How does a securities firm like Kokusai,
in which Toyota has a 10 percent stake, fit in? What is the
potential in Chiyoda? What does a commercial bank have to do with
the auto business? How do they all fit together and complement the
auto business?
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy is difficult to understand at the moment,'' said
Takaki Nakanishi, an auto analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in
Tokyo. ``It could be a great opportunity, but what we need is a
specific strategy, presented in terms of how much they will spend
and where they are headed with it.''
</P>
<P>
   This confusion over Toyota's strategy has led some investors to
wonder whether there is another, perhaps unconscious, agenda behind
the company's interest in the financial-services business: using
its shareholders' money to support troubled related companies and
in the process preserving a system out of keeping with trends in
the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese companies are clustered in loose alliances around
a bank or trading company. These groupings, called keiretsu, form a
symbiotic relationship based on mutual shareholdings, debts and
other obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The system is slowly coming unraveled as the financial crisis
here forces Japanese banks and companies to unload their mutual
shareholdings and turn to the global capital markets for financing.
But Toyota, with its pristine balance sheet, appears to be bucking
the trend.
</P>
<P>
   The company is already part of the keiretsu centered on the
trading giant Mitsui &AMP; Co. _ as are Chiyoda, Daihatsu, Sakura and
Hino Motors Ltd., a beleaguered truck manufacturer in which Toyota
is considering raising its stake.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mitsui group is slowly loosening the ties that bind
it, Toyota is increasing its relationships with certain group
companies and earning its nickname, Toyota Bank. The way some
investors see it, Toyota is using their money to prop up its ailing
corporate cousins.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Toyota's purchase in September of a majority
interest in Daihatsu, the feisty but financially pressed
small-vehicle manufacturer in which Toyota has long had a stake,
made good sense. It ensured that Daihatsu stayed out of reach of
competitors and offered benefits from shared costs of development,
procurement and design.
</P>
<P>
   But some have questioned the motive behind its additional
investment in Chiyoda, because investors know that a struggling
life insurer that is also a Mitsui affiliate desperately needed to
sell its Chiyoda shares and could not find a buyer until Toyota
stepped up to the plate. Its purchase bailed out the life insurer
and bolstered Chiyoda, but its benefits to Toyota remain to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of the cross-shareholding business,'' said Jay
Woodworth, an independent auto analyst. ``Toyota is putting equity
into its longstanding relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Okijima said. On the contrary, it's all part of the
transformation away from the very conservative company outlined by
Hiroshi Okuda _ the first top executive in decades who was not a
member of the company's founding Toyoda family. One of the
strategic goals Okuda announced when he became president in 1995
was to have ``alternative'' businesses account for as much as 10
percent of Toyota's sales by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Under Toyota's definition, many businesses seemingly unrelated
to auto manufacturing are, in fact, keys to its future. Take
software development and telecommunications, which it began
investing in more than a decade ago. Its engineers foresee a day
when a Toyota Corolla running on a fuel cell will virtually drive
itself using an on-board computer navigation system, mobile-phone
technology and satellites to guide it.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, the company has started using its ties to
Chiyoda to create insurance products that are used as sales
incentives. Analysts are particularly keen on the first joint
Toyota-Chiyoda product, incentive insurance for buyers of Toyota
cars that incorporate a new safety-enhancing body.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, what may seem like disparate investments are
central to Toyota's vision of the future, right down to a
helicopter service it says will be used to produce maps for
on-board navigational systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that in the future, through these businesses, we'll
assure the long-term success of Toyota Motor,'' Okijima said.
``These investments are not very large, and they're all related to
the future of Toyota.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But others have more trouble seeing the relationships. ``Our
great hope is that the companies we invest in stick to their core
competencies,'' said John Alkire, managing director at Morgan
Stanley Asset and Investment Trust, which owns Toyota shares. ``I
cannot see how Chiyoda and some of these other things fit into
their core competency, which is making cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Redl, an automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter in Tokyo and longtime critic of Toyota's investments, has
even said he believes Toyota's real reason for buying the
helicopter company, Aero Asahi, was to further its plans to go into
the aircraft-engine business.
</P>
<P>
   He suspects that rather than digital map-making Toyota really
wants Aero Asahi's political expertise to help it win necessary
approval from the government.
</P>
<P>
   In several annual reports Toyota has expressed an interest in
pursuing aircraft-engine manufacturing, and it has been investing
in air-related businesses since 1988. That aspiration dismays
analysts who still remember Nissan Motor Co.'s ill-fated foray into
that business.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, some of Toyota's ventures outside the auto industry
have been discouraging, although none so costly as Nissan's
misstep. Toyota's sideline business of manufacturing prefabricated
housing, embarked on as a way to demonstrate the versatility of the
vaunted Toyota Production System, has been mostly in the red.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a string of losses, Toyota ended up investing about
$1.4 billion in Teleway, a long-distance telephone company, for
more than 10 years. Teleway and KDD, another long-distance
provider, are now merging in a deal that will leave Toyota with a
passive 8.4 percent in the new company _ whose short-term prospects
have also dimmed as competition has increased.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are urging Toyota to pull the plug on Nippon IDO, a
mobile-telephone provider that they say is unlikely to ever win
significant market share. ``They have failed to take a leadership
position in telecommunications, which was one of their goals,''
Nakanishi of Merrill Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Now investors are worried that Chiyoda and, especially, Sakura
could become similar money pits for Toyota. The company's track
record for managing financial matters within its traditional line
of business is less than stellar, according to analysts, raising
questions about its ability to manage a far-flung
financial-services empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Toyota is a top-rate manufacturer, wringing costs out of
its production system and making excellent cars, the way it has
managed financial matters like hedging against currency
fluctuations and return on its balance-sheet assets have been less
successful,'' Woodworth said. ``On balance, this has cost Toyota a
fair amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps recognizing its own limitations, Toyota may be backing
away from raising its stake in Sakura, currently at 2.3 percent.
The government is shoring up weak banks with public money, and now
analysts expect Toyota to invest between 30 billion and 60 billion
yen in Sakura, down from the 100 billion to 150 billion yen
previously discussed. Okijima stressed that no decision had been
made yet.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it is unclear why Toyota, with a mountain of cash,
a pristine balance sheet and ready access to the capita markets,
needs a bank. Okijima supplied a rationale. ``It might be true that
Toyota Motor Corporation enjoys strong surplus capital,'' he said.
``But when you think about the whole Toyota group, in auto
financing, suppliers, imports and dealers, on a consolidated basis,
we need access to a bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting the issue of Sakura aside, Toyota's financial-services
plans, however fuzzy, have a certain logic, considering General
Motors' success with GMAC _ and many of GMAC's activities fall far
afield of car manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be an interesting strategy for the company to use its
funds more efficiently,'' said Peter Boardman, an analyst at
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo, citing the potential for Toyota to
sell asset-backed securities and other financial instruments
related to its business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, how do they go ahead and do that?'' he asked.
``I think you could make an argument that that concern is why the
share price has come off lately. A lot of shareholders are nervous
about whether they're managing their cash wisely or efficiently.''

RUSSIA TO LAUNCH FIRST STEP IN NEW SPACE STATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After years of failed rocket launches, slashed funding,
and a few near-fatal accidents, Friday, should be a banner day for
Russia's beleaguered space program.
</P>
<P>
   Russia plans to launch the first stage of the world's most
ambitious space project ever, the $40 billion International Space
Station, designed to replace the battered Mir orbital craft and
form the basis of manned exploration of the heavens for the next
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Financed primarily by the United States, Canada, Japan and 12
European countries, the project offers cash-strapped Russia a
chance to revive its proud space program largely at someone else's
expense.
</P>
<P>
   So why do Russian space officials look so glum?
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Russia looks askance at accepting for the first
time what officials here see as a supporting role, one the Soviet
Union never played when it put the first man in space and
established records for longevity in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling has Russian space officials calling to keep Mir in
orbit, raising concerns that Moscow will not be able to muster the
funds to meet its commitments to the new space station.
</P>
<P>
   Those worries have cast a shadow on the launch, billed as the
dawn of a new era of cosmic cooperation between the two main
competitors in the Cold War-era space race.
</P>
<P>
   Built in Russia and paid for by the United States, the first
stage of the new station, the $238 million Zarya (``Sunrise'')
module, will lift off from the Baikonur cosmodrome on the frozen
steppes of Kazakhstan, 1,100 miles southeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Zarya will be followed over the next six years by 45 launches
carrying the 500-ton station into space and the record books.
</P>
<P>
   When completed in 2004, the station will be one of the brightest
lights in the night sky. It will provide for international science
an orbiting laboratory the size of two football fields, the largest
flying man-made object ever built. Pieced together by space-walking
astronauts and robot arms, it will be the most expensive and
complicated peacetime construction project ever undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   But as they tick off these superlatives, space agency officials
from United States and other participating countries are crossing
their fingers that the project does not turn into the world's
biggest cosmic headache.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the project has been delayed by a year by Moscow's
inability to complete the third module, the living quarters of the
station.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Russian space officials began appealing to keep the
12-year-old Mir in orbit despite previous agreements to ditch the
aging craft in the Pacific Ocean next summer.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials play down their differences with Moscow. But they
make it clear that they expect Russia to stick with the plan to get
rid of Mir.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians must decide if they can financially support two
vehicles,'' said NASA spokesman Rob Navias. ``We don't believe they
can, and we don't think they believe they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Yury Koptev, the head of Russia's Space Agency, admitted
this week that the Russian government had not delivered enough
financing to keep Mir in space, much less fund the Russian
commitments on the International Space Station. Koptev has pushed
for Russian involvement in the new station, which would mean up to
80,000 jobs over the next 15 years, as a way to revive the national
space program.
</P>
<P>
   But Koptev also wants to keep Mir flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conserving Mir as a unique piece of long-life space equipment
is possible and worthwhile,'' Koptev said. ``Mir has a chance to
survive. To sink such wealth in the Pacific Ocean, as has been
planned for 1999, would be irrational.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the idea of keeping Mir in space seemed irrational.
The aging station had barely survived a series of accidents that
nearly destroyed it and its crew. Once seen as the pride of the
Russia space program for surviving more than double its expected
life span of five years, Mir had become the butt of space-jalopy
jokes everywhere, from the Russian media to the Hollywood film
``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian cosmonauts have dismissed the US demand to ditch
Mir as a case of space envy.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Solovyov, a top Russian cosmonaut who has flown five
times on Mir, was asked this week why he thought Russia was being
asked to shut down the Mir program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear why,'' Solovyov told Reuters. ``Who has the
station? We do.''
</P>
<P>
   Solovyov caused a stir last year when the Russian press quoted
him as saying he wouldn't fly on the new space station under a less
experienced American commander. He later denied making the
comments, but there is no denying that Russia rankles under the
idea that the main mission control for the new station will be in
Houston, not Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Americans suggested they control everything from
Houston, we were not in agreement,'' Viktor Blagov, deputy flight
controller at Russian mission control since Mir was launched in
1986, told The Associated Press. ``Why should we go there when we
have everything here?''

`BURNING HABITS': HOW A LESBIAN CURSE MADE A GAY BAR SUFFER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(smw) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first time I saw ``Burning Habits'' _ with its
gay vampires, catatonic bartenders and nuns who swear like sailors
_ was at a bar off Avenue A. Every Monday night for eight weeks a
new episode was presented as the audience, which had paid $5 a
head, drank beer or vodka tonics and strained to see the actors,
who performed without benefit of a stage. It was always a good idea
to arrive early so you could sit in one of the first three rows.
And there unfolded the multiple story lines of Kidd Gottahave (``an
angry young lesbian teen who has yet to experience love''); Priapus
Columns, the bisexual (maybe); Vonda Von Vickers, a lapsed Roman
Catholic vampire (described in the program as ``evil Catholic
witch'') and a host of others.
</P>
<P>
   Now at last the cast of ``Burning Habits'' has a real stage,
although a small one, at Here, in SoHo, and the production holds up
well. It may take a certain attitude to love ``Burning Habits'': a
childlike glee in seeing authority figures ridiculed, a thorough
distaste for sexual hypocrisy and a strong aversion to organized
religion. But if you have those, you will get a major kick out of
``Burning Habits.''
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that long ago three lesbian nuns were burned to
death in a convent that now houses a gay bar. As they died, they
cursed whoever entered the building in the future to suffer as they
had suffered. And God knows, everybody does. The plot, while
deliberately convoluted and many-tentacled, is just an excuse for
the gags.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Fell, who wrote and directed the play with great style,
alternates with David Gerard in the role of Crow Gottahave, the
hunky bartender who hasn't had sex in 10 years. Oddly, Fell doesn't
seem quite comfortable with his own material (but his arms look
great).
</P>
<P>
   Christa Kirby is still a knockout in her double role as Sister
Godelieve Macievelli, the kind of nun who makes drill sergeants
look soft-hearted, and Thelma D'Gretts, a confused, mistreated
housewife whose husband, Otis D'Gretts, has put her in the basement
and built a brick wall to keep her there.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen O'Connor remains fabulous as Vicki Von Vickers, a sweet,
suicidal debutante with low self-esteem, and Milly the Screamer, a
barfly who likes to shout her life story to people but always seems
to be telling the stories of various television characters instead
(``I was a witch once. Never marry a man in advertising'').
</P>
<P>
   Jason Little, who is new to the cast, makes Tommy Alan Poe, a
young man who lives for musical comedy, a joy to behold. His Jules
Putan, an existentialist, is not quite as wonderful, but you have
to sympathize with a character who is leaving New York because here
``I have not been able to concentrate on my meaninglessness.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the cast is pretty great, too. Laura Desmond's
characters _ Odetta D'Gretts (selfish teen-ager) and Rachel-Rachel
(servant) _ seem to be the same person with different hairdos, but
Ms. Desmond has such a lovably goofy comic presence that it doesn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burning Habits,'' which is in eight episodes, continues
through March 13, on Friday and Saturday nights only. Every two
weeks a new episode in the series of eight begins. There will be
kidnappings, institutionalizations, hunchbacks, back-stabbing and
special appearances by the three dead lesbian nuns.

WORRIED STATE OFFICIALS SEEK ROTATING PRIMARY SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fearful of a truncated primary schedule that could
determine a presidential candidate within a couple weeks rather
than months, a group of state election officials recommended
Thursday switching to a rotating regional primary system.
</P>
<P>
   Different sections of the country would take turns being among
the first to vote for a party's nominee for president. New
Hampshire and Iowa would be exempt from the rotation, continuing to
kick off the presidential campaign season every four years,
according to the plan proposed by the Committee on Presidential
Primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin, the chairman
of the committee, said he would bring the recommendation to a full
meeting of the National Association of Secretaries of State in
February. But it will take approval by every state's legislature to
turn the idea into reality, and that would be a massive undertaking
unlikely to happen before 2004, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still very concerned about 2000,'' Galvin said. ``The
current (schedule) represents a national potential for a
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin and his colleagues said a compressed primary schedule
could make it difficult for anyone other than a front-runner with
name recognition and money to win the Democratic or Republican
nomination. It could also have the opposite result of elevating a
relatively unknown candidate before voters know enough about that
person, testified William Mayer, a political science professor from
Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, states around the country have continued to push
up their primary dates in the hopes of having the sort of influence
and attention that Iowa and New Hampshire enjoy. Recently, a group
of eight Western states moved to hold a joint, regional primary on
March 11 of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we in the West feel we haven't had any say in the
selection of a president,'' said Olene Walker, the lieutenant
governor from Utah who endorsed the rotating primaries. ``We have
been totally non-players.''
</P>
<P>
   While the secretaries of state seemed eager to make changes,
officials at the Democratic National Committee and the Republican
National Committee are not. Further, candidates for president in
2000 are proceeding on the assumption that the primaries will be
bunched close together, requiring them to raise massive amounts of
cash in order to compete in numerous states simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Grossman, chairman of the DNC, said voters may feel
empowered and energized if they believe their votes matter when
they all go to the polls at about the same time in March of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, nor do I think anybody knows one way or the
other what impact this will have,'' Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Yu, a spokesman for the Republicans, said the RNC leaves
scheduling up to the individual states. ``We have a philosophy of
empowering the states and the state parties to decide how and when
their primaries take place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican convention in 1996 decided to award bonus
delegates to states that agree to hold their primaries later in the
calendar year. However, Mayer said, that arrangement had failed to
solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, candidates who have declared and even those who have
not are working to raise money. Senator Paul Wellstone, the
Democrat from Minnesota, has raised $500,000 since he created his
presidential exploratory committee last April. Steve Forbes, the
Republican publisher, has pulled together $10 million from
individual donors for his nonprofit group, Americans for Hope,
Growth and Opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shown he's the number one Republican fund-raiser in the
country right now,'' said Paul Young, a Forbes adviser in New
Hampshire. ``Every dollar's a vote, and number two, it's going to
take a lot of money with these crowded primary fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas D. Rath, an adviser to Republican Lamar Alexander, said
candidates must be prepared to raise between $15 million and $19
million during 1999 in order to compete in the primaries that come
after New Hampshire. That works out to about $35,000 to $40,000
that needs to be raised every business day for the next 10 to 12
months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't, you'll be blown out of the water,'' Rath said.

STARR DEFENDS LEWINSKY PROBE AT IMPEACHMENT HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr defended his
probe of President Clinton Thursday, telling the House Judiciary
Committee's impeachment hearing that he didn't pass judgment on
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky but instead has focused
on the coverup of their affair.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the Clinton-Lewinsky sexual relationship was not a
``high crime or misdemeanor'' defined in the Constitution as
impeachable offenses, Starr said. Instead, he said, his report
urging the House to impeach Clinton is based on issues of
obstruction of justice, lying under oath and witness tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's statement was an attempt to deflate a Democratic charge
that the Lewinsky probe was a morality-tinged probe of an illicit
sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   He also took aim at the Democratic contention that impeachment
was intended to be reserved for presidential misconduct in official
duties, not private behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said a president who bribed a witness in a private lawsuit
would be subject to impeachment under the Constitution's
designation of bribery as an impeachable offense, he said. Also, a
president who committed murder or rape could be impeached, Starr
said. Linking impeachment to official duties is ``an incorrect
interpretation of the Constitution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Clinton's efforts to conceal his 18-month
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky ``caused all
of us considerable dismay _ and continues to do so,'' Starr told
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ``I am proud of what we did,'' he added. ``We were
assigned a difficult job. We have done it to the very best of our
abilities. We have tried to be fair and thorough.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Chairman Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., tried to open
Thursday's proceedings on a non-partisan note. The hearing, he
said, ``is not a trial nor is it White House versus Ken Starr, or
Republican versus Democrat. Rather, the hearing today is another
step in our attempt to carry out our constitutional duty.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get very far. Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass., made a
motion to allow Clinton's lawyer David Kendall two hours to
question Starr, instead of the 30 minutes allotted by Hyde.
Republicans defeated the motion 21-16 on a party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde promised that Clinton would receive ``unlimited time'' if
he chooses to make a personal appearance before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Starr spent over eight hours at the witness table in the same
room where the Judiciary Committee held impeachment hearings
against President Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He took two hours to read a 58-page statement in a professorial
voice, and then parryed the expected Democratic crticism of his
conduct of the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a federally-paid sex policeman spending millions
of dollars to trap an unfaithful spouse ... would have been
unthinkable prior to the Starr investigation,'' said the
committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan. ``Let
there be no mistake, it is not now acceptable in America to
investigate a person's private sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington lawyer Theodore Olson, a close friend of Starr's,
described the independent counsel's testimony as vintage Starr,
noting that Starr didn't allow himself to be ``perturbed by the
tone of some of the questions which were hostile and
aggressive...He certainly demonstrated himself to be capable of not
letting people get under his skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prepared statement contained few surprises, going over
much of the same ground covered in his Sept. 9 report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's intimate relationship with a subordinate
employee was transformed into an unlawful effort to thwart the
judicial process,'' Starr said. ``This was no longer an issue of
private conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said Clinton lied under oath about Lewinsky in his Jan.
17, 1998, deposition in the Jones civil lawsuit, and also lied that
same month to his Cabinet and at a televised public event.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, he added, also pressured his personal secretary, Betty
Currie, into agreeing with him that he and Lewinsky were never
alone, and that Currie could ``see and hear everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also lied in his Aug. 17, 1998, grand jury testimony by
claiming his Jan. 17 denial of a sexual relationship with Lewinsky
was legally accurate, Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr zeroed in on instances in which he claimed that Clinton
had stalled the legal process in the Lewinsky matter by refusing
for seven months to testify before the grand jury and trying to
prevent White House lawyer Bruce Lindsey and Secret Service
personnel from testifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president used the machinery of government and the power
of his office to conceal his relationship with Monica Lewinsky,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On six occasions, from Dec. 17, 1997, when Clinton called
Lewinsky at 2 a.m. and told her she was on the witness list in the
Jones lawsuit to Aug. 17, 1998, when he admitted an ``improper
relationship'' with Lewinsky, ``the president had to make a
decision.'' Starr said. ``He could choose truth, or he could choose
deception. On all six occasions, the president chose deception _ a
pattern of calculated behavior over a span of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr disclosed that his office considered recommending that the
House undertake an impeachment investigation on the original
Whitewater allegations, but ultimately he declined to send it. The
issue concerned Clinton's testimony that he didn't know about a
fraudulent $300,000 loan and a second loan from Madison Guaranty
Savings &AMP; Loan which was owned by the president's former business
partners, James and Susan McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also told lawmakers he found no evidence of impeachable
offenses in his separate investigations of White House possession
of FBI files on Republicans _ an episode known as ``filegate'' _ or
in the firing of career White House travel office workers and their
replacement by employees close to Clinton _ ``travelgate.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr served in the Justice Department in the Reagan
administration and was appointed to the federal appeals court in
Washington by Reagan in 1983. During the Bush administration, he
was the U.S. solicitor general, the government's chief advocate
before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   With such a Republican pedigree, Starr made a point of defending
the Lewinsky probe as one staffed by career federal prosecutors and
FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a bright line between law and politics, between
courts and polls,'' Starr said. ``It leaves the polls to the
politicians and spin doctors. We are officers of the court who live
in the world of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said he kept the attorney general's office informed of the
course of his investigations, even quoting Attorney General Janet
Reno that in high-profile cases ``you're damned if you do and
damned if you don't, so you'd better do what you think is right.''
</P>
<P>
   He also defended what Democrats have characterized as strong-arm
tactics by agents and prosecutors in confronting Lewinsky at a
hotel in suburban Washington in January 1998. Starr's staff
attempted to dissuade Lewinsky from calling her lawyer and her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   While such tactics ``may not be entirely comfortable for some
witnesses,'' Starr said, ``it was not our place to reinvent the
investigative wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   During a break, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., called Starr's
argument about impeachment and official duties ``pretty
weak...Impeachment is meant to protect the Constitution, not punish
the wrongdoer.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Is a chief of executive, through a course of
conduct, rendered incapable of performing his duties? A lot of that
has to do with his stature with the electorate. The American people
have reached that conclusion.''

AMID MOUNTING LOSSES, HARVARD PILGRIM TRIMS EXECUTIVE JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the wake of unprecedented financial losses at
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, the state's largest health maintenance
organization has eliminated the jobs of four high-level employees,
including Dr. Patrick Mattingly, widely perceived as the No. 2
executive at Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement follows a report released Friday that outlined
the extent of Harvard's losses, which amounted to $22.2 million in
the first three quarters of 1998. Harvard expects &UR;  &LR;  to lose as much
as $30 million for the full year, including about $10 million in
one-time charges associated with the layoffs of 100 employees and a
bond refinancing that would save the HMO money in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   The losses prompted a recent decision to lay off 100 people as
part of an effort to trim the company's $3 billion annual budget.
At the time, Harvard said cutbacks would be made ``at all levels of
the organization,'' but health care observers were surprised that
the layoffs would claim executives at such lofty levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very significant positions,'' said Ellen Trager, a
health care consultant with Brown Rudnick Freed &AMP; Gesmer.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly's departure, in particular, was unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge surprise to me,'' said Stephen Caulfield,
chairman of the Chickering Group, a health insurance company in
Cambridge, who said he is a friend of Mattingly. ``I think he is a
real thought leader in this industry, and I think he's been
extraordinarily loyal and devoted to the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In his job as senior vice president of planning and development,
Mattingly was part of an inner circle of decisionmakers at Harvard
Pilgrim. He played a key role in the company's strategic direction,
health policy and government relations. Mattingly was once in
contention for the top job at Harvard Pilgrim after the 1995 merger
of Harvard Community Health Plan and Pilgrim Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   Others on the list of layoffs include Dr. John Ludden, senior
vice president of medical affairs; Daniel D. Kaplan, senior vice
president of the Massachusetts region; and William Schlag, vice
president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Ludden, a psychiatrist, joined Harvard Community Health Care in
1972 as director of Harvard's Kenmore center. From 1983 to 1994, he
was Harvard's top physician, serving as corporate medical director.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan has been in charge of negotiating contracts with
Harvard's network of more than 15,000 physicians and 90 hospitals
in Massachusetts, while Schlag oversaw the marketing and
communications functions. Efforts to contact Mattingly, Ludden,
Kaplan and Schlag Thursday were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the people, it was the positions,'' said Allan
Greenberg, chief executive of Harvard Pilgrim. ``We found we could
spread the responsibilities of these positions or eliminate the
work to some extent.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg emphasized that Harvard Pilgrim's expected loss for
1998 of nearly $30 million , while unprecedented, is just one
percent of the company's $3 billion budget. ``We're talking about
small variances here,'' he said. ``As a nonprofit company, we've
never tried to budget extraordinary profits. As a result, you have
very small margins, and when you miss your numbers, you fall into
the red zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The operating loss largely resulted from higher-than-expected
medical expenses. Inpatient hospital expenses, for example, came in
over budget, Greenberg said. Harvard Pilgrim was also hit by a
larger-than-average share of seniors with higher medical expenses,
a fact that led Harvard on Monday to discontinue offering unlimited
drug benefits to seniors enrolled in its First Seniority Medicare
HMO, effective Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the layoffs, Harvard is expected to raise the
premiums it charges in 1999 in an effort to return to
profitability. While premiums for employers who are Harvard Pilgrim
customers went up an average of just 2 percent in 1998, they are
expected to rise between 6 percent and 8 percent next year.

IN HURRICANE-RAVAGED HONDURAS, KC-BASED GROUP WORKS TO REBUILD
LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY SANCHEZ  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star   SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras _ When
Blanca Estela Rodriguez looks over the village of Guacamaya, she
sees more than the physical damage from Hurricane Mitch. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She sees health and medical problems that will plague Hondurans
for months and years to come if she and her group of volunteers
don't intervene. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Men shovel floodwater from a roadway in one part of town.
Rodriguez, a veteran relief worker, knows the stagnant water is a
breeding ground for mosquitoes carrying deadly malaria. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patches of mud have dried and cracked into jigsaw puzzle pieces.
She knows the dirt soon will become airborne, a noxious dust that
can cause asthma and bronchitis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barefoot children, shoes lost in the hurricane, run through mud
nearby. She knows the muck holds tapeworms and other parasites
waiting to infect the children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The weight of her mission grows even heavier as she visits a
crushed medical clinic in Guacamaya, on the outskirts of San Pedro
Sula, Honduras' second largest city. All that remains is a roofless
shell of a building, half-buried in an avalanche of mud and dirt
from the Mico Quemado Mountains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The clinic is one of 13 medical and dental centers run by Kansas
City-based Children International, the relief agency Rodriguez
works for. These centers are the group's best hope of keeping
Hurricane Mitch from claiming more lives in Honduras. Already 7,000
have died, the country's worst tragedy in centuries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Rodriguez promises to get them running soon, so people can
get the medical care and supplies they need. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to accomplish it,'' she says while standing at
the demolished clinic. ``The people here still have a lot of faith
in us and we are the only really constant thing in their lives.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez says she'll leave it to others to rebuild the roads
and bridges. Her crusade is to make sure people have food,
medicine, homes. &QL; 
 &LR; brk:Saving children &QL; 
 &LR; tx:Rodriguez is Children International's project coordinator in
Honduras. The 14-year-old relief group is best known for recruiting
people in the United States and Canada to ``sponsor'' children in
nine poor countries. These donations have enabled the agency to set
up schools, medical check-ups, dental care and other benefits for
13,600 children in 70 towns in Honduras. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ordinary times, Children International's goal is to make
families self-sufficient. Rodriguez's team of 52 doctors, nurses,
dentists, teachers and social workers have trained more than 1,700
mothers in and around San Pedro Sula in hygiene, well-baby care and
organizational skills. A corps of volunteer mothers keeps the
agency's work alive in villages around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Rodriguez and her team of workers and volunteers have taken
on the daunting task of hurricane relief. The crisis has brought
out the best in people, Rodriguez said with pride. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As one mother fled her flooded home, she rescued an electric air
compressor that runs the drill in one of the program's dental
clinics. She hauled it with her to a homeless shelter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In many of the shelters for hurricane homeless, the volunteer
mothers assumed leadership. They began teaching the dangers of
contaminated water and noting who was missing family members or who
most needed medical care. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that we have taught the people is what is needed
most right now,'' Rodriguez said. &QL; 
 &LR; brk:`Just unbelievable' &QL; 
 &LR; tx:Children International, with headquarters in south Kansas City,
has kept close tabs on the Honduras relief effort. On one recent
day, CEO Jim Cook flew in from Kansas City so Rodriguez could show
him some of the hard hit spots in the San Pedro Sula area in
western Honduras. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First they drive to Guacamaya. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Rodriguez visited soon after the hurricane, she went by
raft. On this day, she and Cook drive in on a path plowed by
bulldozers. The original road ends midway over a collapsed bridge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At this Children International clinic, dirt surrounds the
building almost all the way to the roof. Cook easily steps onto the
roof supports to survey the landscape. Most of the homes nearby are
buried or completely washed away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disaster,'' he says. ``It is just unbelievable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They meet Eva Cruz, who lives in a home behind the demolished
clinic. She is in her kitchen, boiling a meal of corn on a wood
fire. A hen and her chicks peck the concrete floor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, whose six children are sponsored by Children
International, has laid her baby's underwear to dry on what used to
be the clinic's roof. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the hurricane, the family fled to the mountains nearby.
They feared that their house, which sits between two streams, would
float away. It didn't, but the water caved in one wall and mud
flooded it waist-high. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For four days, many people from the area lived in the mountains,
taking shelter under a piece of corrugated tin. The only food was
the platanos (bananas) the children gathered. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, a volunteer mother, said she would wait for the clinic to
rebuild. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stay here and wait to see what happens,'' she said.
``We have nowhere else to go.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At another town, Rodriguez leaves her high heels in the van and
puts on black, knee-high rubber boots. They are necessary to walk
the streets of Asentamientas Humanos, a village of about 4,000
people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Children International has a one-story building here with a
kindergarten, a dental clinic, a gynecology clinic and a meals
program. Mud and water flooded the building to its roof. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, volunteer mothers splashed pans of water on the
walls, scrubbing everything with bleach. Many were cleaning the
clinics before cleaning their own flooded homes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Rodriguez and Cook stop and talk with Lorenzo Dominguez
who is shoveling a canal to drain water away from his house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inside the three-room home, the family's refrigerator is wrapped
in twine and suspended from the ceiling beams six feet off the
ground. Dominguez hoisted it there before fleeing the floods. He
never dreamed the waters would rise above it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He lives in a shelter now with his wife and four children.
During the day, he returns to Asentamientas to work on the house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him we feel for him and the clinic will be up and running
to help soon,'' Cook tells the translator. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez's attitude is similar to many people Cook meets during
the tour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With God's faith we will go ahead,'' he told the translator to
tell Cook. ``We don't have to cry for this.'' &QL; 
 &LR; brk:Garnering support &QL; 
 &LR; tx:Back in San Pedro Sula, Rodriguez spends much of her time in
meetings and on the phone. She fulfills the pivotal, though perhaps
not glamorous, role of recruiting volunteers, donations and support
from business and civic leaders in Honduras and around the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing with Cook, they discuss how Hurricane Mitch has
affected Children International in Honduras. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Has this deterred your plans to expand our services here?'' he
asks through a translator. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, Rodriguez answers. By Nov. 30, she will know the cost of
rebuilding the damaged clinics. Others are being cleared of mud,
scrubbed and fumigated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even with those obstacles, she plans to help 40,000 more
children in 1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are needed now, more than ever,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cook tells her of letters sent this week to 200,000 current and
former sponsors, seeking contributions for Honduras. The agency has
never made a special plea, he says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In another meeting, Rodriguez successfully secures crucial
support from the city. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even before everyone is served coffee in the mayor's office, she
is smiling broadly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Roberto Larios Silva has promised to ease the passage of
Children International goods through customs. He has promised
storage space in the city warehouse. But most of all, he has
promised city land for a new development that will provide a
medical clinic and 4,000 homes for the 20,000 people who lost
everything to the hurricane. Construction should begin in a month
northwest of San Pedro Sula. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The village will be called Nueva Vida _ New Life. &QL;

THERE HE GOES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There's still a lot of yardage between Foxborough and
Hartford. And given the way the offense is playing this year,
there's reason to believe the New England Patriots may not make it
to the Nutmeg State.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the latest wave of mostly sports media-driven hysteria,
a ``deal'' between Connecticut officials and Patriots owner Robert
Kraft is far from done.
</P>
<P>
   What was announced Thursday is a memorandum of understanding
that provides for an exclusive period of negotiation between Kraft
and the state of Connecticut. It spells out a set of legislative
and economic conditions that would bring the Patriots to a new
downtown Hartford stadium in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone still needs time to digest the fine print. But chances
are, even if Connecticut Governor John Rowland says there's no
wiggle room, there's plenty of weasel room for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   From Kraft's perspective, why sign anything in front of TV
cameras, anyway, if not to start drumming up yet another
save-the-Patriots outcry on Boston talk radio? He could have signed
the thing in private, and in 45 days, backed up the trucks to
Foxboro Stadium to drive Drew and the boys down to Nowheresville,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the odds seem strong that the Patriots will end up in
Hartford. On paper, a $350 million publicly financed stadium
project sounds like a very good business opportunity, quite
possibly too good to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   How much do we really care? Does Massachusetts without the Pats
really become Tupelo without Elvis as a legendary native son?
</P>
<P>
   A loud gaggle of media and business people will argue
passionately that we are on our way to turning into Dubuque without
the Patriots. The argument ignores the fact that the Patriots left
Boston more than 20 years ago and, far from being dead, the city is
more vibrant than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Polls consistently show a majority in this state does not care
enough about losing the team to spend public money to keep them
here. There's almost a Monica Lewinsky dynamic going on here. The
public yawns, while the media insist the common man or woman is
just too stupid to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe they do get it. Maybe they do understand the
Kraft-Patriots saga is all about money, ego, and leverage and has
little or nothing to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   And the matter of ego, by the way, applies to Kraft and his
nemesis, House Speaker Thomas Finneran. The speaker really should
stop arguing this as a matter of principle, when he is making it so
very personal with his comments about ``fat-ass millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kraft takes the Hartford deal, he is making a clear,
bottom-line business decision. The status quo _ being the leader of
a Foxborough-based Patriots Nation _ is unacceptable because he is
a businessman and he wants to make more money. He can do it two
ways: by selling the Patriots; or, if he wants to retain ownership,
he can make money by bringing in more revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the way to maximize revenue is to get someone else to
pay for a bigger stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran says he won't go higher than $57 million for
infrastructure, versus the $72 million offered by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Both numbers are very far away from the amount Hartford is
willing to put up.
</P>
<P>
   They are so far away it seems unlikely Kraft would turn down the
Hartford deal _ as long as he keeps emotion out of the equation and
doesn't start to imagine how it will feel to ride a golf cart onto
the 50 yard line and be closer to Waterbury, Conn., than to
Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Kraft, we, too, should take the emotion out of the
equation. We can like football and think a professional football
franchise is nice to have. But we can still think of it as an
amenity, not a necessity. We can believe Boston is a terrific city
without the Patriots and that Hartford will be a better city, but
far from a terrific one, even with them.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand: if Kraft leaves, the Patriots are gone.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a psychic loss to some and an economic one to
others, at least until the land around Foxboro stadium produced
revenue from future development.
</P>
<P>
   It would mean nothing to most everyone else.
</P>

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Six Atlanta chief executives, peering beyond the
cloudy economic decline of next year, predicted tough and growing
competition in the next millenium, but expanding opportunities
because of advancing technology.
</P>
<P>
   The executives talked to an audience of Metro Atlanta Chamber of
Commerce members and others in an all-day symposium at the Downtown
Hyatt Regency Hotel, addressing the topic, Strategies in the Next
Millenium.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen included F. Duane Ackerman of BellSouth Corp.; A.W.
``Bill'' Dahlberg, Southern Company; A.D. ``Pete'' Correll,
Georgia-Pacific Corporation; Frederick Schwab, Porsche Cars North
America; Charles Brewer, Mindspring Enterprises, and L. Phillip
Humann, SunTrust Banks.
</P>
<P>
   John Youngdahl, vice president and senior money market economist
for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., set much of the tone with a prediction
that economic growth could slow next year to 1.5 percent, even more
bullish than the 2 percent growth rate projected by the Federal
Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a good news, bad news year,'' Youngdahl said. The
bad news is that consumer demand will be dampened, job growth will
weaken and a deeper sense of caution may rule consumer habits.
Also, because of political demands, there is little chance that
government spending or other steps will be available to stimulate a
new level of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   On the good news side, he said, inflation should stay moderate,
interest rates will remain low, and the equity markets should do
moderately well.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, Correll said his company, a world
powerhouse in lumber and building products, was deeply troubled by
the overseas malaise. Worsening economic conditions, especially in
Asia, have slashed currencies, thereby giving advantages to
exporters of pulp, board and other items that compete directly with
Georgia-Pacific's lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``As usual, the producers in Asia are likely to export their way
out of trouble and that spells trouble for us,'' Correll said.
``Pulp prices have dropped a third and other products even more.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the overseas threat was real for capital intensive
businesses like Georgia-Pacific, and the outlook is gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face more uncertainty than we have faced in years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the other players were generally more upbeat, but did
not see a landscape free of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman of BellSouth foresees continuing transformation of the
phone company into Internet business, wireless TV, and hopefully
long distance service.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the policy area, BellSouth should be allowed to deliver
long distance service,'' he said. Furthermore, he said, the company
plans bigger networks for digital distribution of data, using
packet switching for speed and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth wants authority to get into long distance to connect
to its local exchanges, as well as enable it to offer bigger long
distance networks, Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dahlberg, the affable chairman of Southern Company, said
the complicated fight to deregulate electric power would likely
succeed eventually. For that reason, he said, the company needs to
continue to be more aggressive in building buisiness elsewhere
across the nation and around the world to offset potential losses
through domestic competition.
</P>
<P>
   The company will continue to seek opportunities in the Northeast
and possibly in Texas, areas where power costs are relatively high,
to build power plants and compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always lose something in deregulation,'' he said, but
promised meanwhile to fight hard to preserve the Southeast customer
base.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Humann of SunTrust said the company would continue to
concentrate on its best customers, business and individual, and
persuade them to ``migrate'' to additonal services.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company would concentrate on developing its
talents and personal service. One element of the strategy, he said,
is to focus training and effort on 300 top corporate employees to
buttress the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``PC and Internet banking are the wave of the future,'' Humann
said. ``Though they are small now, they are growing.''

 &HT;    Final acceptance: `I still do pray for them'
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS AND ILLUSTRATIONS
 &HT;    By Gary M. Pomerantz

<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the night of the crash, investigators arrived to a
floodlit hayfield. There, in the days that followed, they studied
scattered plane parts and ground scars. They took a thousand
measurements and more in reconstructing the crash of ASA Flight
529.
</P>
<P>
   Forty feet past the tree line, members of a National
Transportation Safety Board team found pieces of the left wing.
Farther along the wreckage path, they came upon the left propeller
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   It contained three intact blades but only a stub of the fourth.
The missing 4-foot segment of the broken blade would be found by an
Alabama farmer 35 miles west of the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   The broken propeller stub showed signs typical of fatigue
cracking. It also yielded the most important clue: serial number
861398.
</P>
<P>
   The paper chase now was on: Maintenance records revealed blade
861398 had been repaired 11 months earlier after failing an
ultrasonic inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer, Hamilton Standard, has produced propellers,
including those that powered Lindbergh across the Atlantic, since
1919. Three times in the year and a half before the ASA crash,
Hamilton Standard blades had broken in flight due to fatigue cracks
_ first in Canada, then Brazil and finally Luxembourg. All three
planes landed safely.
</P>
<P>
   Following the paper trail, investigators discovered the repair _
a sanding job _ had been made by a mechanic who signed himself in
small, tight handwriting: ``CSB.''
</P>
<P>
   So when NTSB investigators arrived at Hamilton Standard's repair
shop in Rock Hill, S.C., a week after the crash, they wanted to
know: ``Who is CSB?''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Scott Bender, young, blond and earnest, is a
mechanic no more. He's 27, a Bible student now. Although the crash
is never far from his thoughts, he still knows few details of what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows that it was his blade that broke, and he's often
wondered: Was it my fault?
</P>
<P>
   ``To think that something I touched my hands on could have done
something like that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Bender sits on a sofa in east Texas struggling for words and
nervously twisting his right thumb into his left palm until the
palm turns a bloodless white.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he says, ``I would much rather have died in their place.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender never saw a picture of the burned-out fuselage and knows
nothing of the human horrors in the hayfield. He says he has
wondered what became of the passengers' lawsuits. (They were
settled out of court by Hamilton Standard.)
</P>
<P>
   He has not read the NTSB's 1996 report on the crash, and no one
from Hamilton Standard ever called to tell him about it. The report
concluded that although his sanding repair was ``inappropriate''
and camouflaged a deeper crack in the propeller blade from being
detected in a later inspection, Bender did what he was instructed
to do.
</P>
<P>
   The report also concluded that he had been given ``inadequate''
tools and training.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bender stresses his desire to be accountable: ``I know with
anything that happens, there is somebody that blame is going to
fall on, and so if what happened is a result of my negligence or
anything like that, then it is my responsibility and the blame is
on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender thinks a lot about God and man. He reads extensively _
from Corinthians to John Locke _ and lives with his wife, Amy, in a
mobile home at the Youth With a Mission (YWAM) campus in Tyler,
where both recently finished training as missionaries. They intend
to remain in Tyler for five more years, training other
missionaries, and only recently bought the double-wide mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   Bender says his only work as a mechanic now is fixing YWAM's
school buses.
</P>
<P>
   Here, where the wide Texas sky confirms man's mortality and
place, Bender says he still prays for the people aboard Flight 529.
Usually something prompts him to think of the crash, like seeing a
Brasilia land or take off at the small Tyler airfield.
</P>
<P>
   He knows none of the 29 names from the ASA crash or even how
many people ultimately died. So when he prays, he prays for them
collectively.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bender and his wife attended a play at a Tyler
church. The play was about the crash of a small plane.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the audience learned about the lives of the doomed
passengers and their relationships with God. Just before impact,
some passengers repented, others cursed God.
</P>
<P>
   The stage lights suddenly went dark, and Bender heard the
screams and crash noises. When the stage lights returned, the
audience found out which passengers went to heaven and which were
taken by a demon to hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you OK?'' Amy Bender asked him during the play.
</P>
<P>
   Bender told her he was fine, but the play got him wondering once
more about the people of Flight 529.
</P>
<P>
   What was it like as they were going down? What were the
passengers thinking?
</P>
<P>
   Were they crying out? Holding each other?
</P>
<P>
   Cursing God? Repenting?
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Bender imagines, there must have been a lot
of screaming.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7, 1994, 14 months before the crash, the recalled blade
arrived in Bender's hands in the South Carolina shop. It was among
490 that failed ultrasonic tests and were returned to Hamilton
Standard for evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Hired from a local pool of applicants, Bender had been at
Hamilton Standard in Rock Hill for only six months. He had
transferred from the company's nickel sheath and fiberglass repair
area to work on taper bores, the hollow interior of propeller
blades. A shop manager described Bender as ``extremely
conscientious,'' quite capable of following technical instructions
and respected by co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   He was earning about $12 an hour, more than he ever made working
on cars, and some weeks he worked 60 hours; the overtime pay was
good.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Bender had his own insurance, his own house
and a nice car. As he saw it, he had it all.
</P>
<P>
   Bender believed his hands were his great gift, and over the next
year and a half he worked on ``a couple thousand'' blades.
</P>
<P>
   Working on blade 861398, Bender used a fiberoptic scope, a long
rod with an eyepiece at one end and a mirror on the distant tip, to
search inside the blade for evidence of corrosion, pits or cracks.
</P>
<P>
   He found none.
</P>
<P>
   But because the blade had failed ultrasonic inspections, Bender
sanded, or ``blended,'' the area inside the blade where the
previous tests indicated a possible flaw.
</P>
<P>
   He sanded off two-thousandths of an inch of material, believing
this would eliminate whatever had caused the blade to fail
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Bender's sanding would have dramatic repercussions in a
subsequent blade inspection in which an ultrasonic beam was used to
detect fatigue cracks. His sanding marks caused the ultrasonic beam
to scatter, or diffuse, and thus fail to detect a crack caused by
chlorine corrosion that extended below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bender had not caused this crack, he unwittingly
concealed it.
</P>
<P>
   Blade 861398 passed inspection and in August 1994 was returned
to ASA along with a Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness
tag.
</P>
<P>
   Installed on the left propeller assembly of an ASA Brasilia, the
blade would make 2,425 flights over the next 11 months,
transporting thousands of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But on Aug. 21, 1995, when ASA Flight 529, Atlanta to Gulfport,
was more than three miles high in the sky, the fatigue crack split
toward the face of blade 861398, then traveled around both sides of
its hollow center, causing the blade to break.
</P>
<P>
   In his job at Hamilton Standard, Bender well understood that
human lives were on the line. His bosses saw to that. Whenever a
plane crashed, whether jet or propeller driven, it was discussed at
the morning meeting.
</P>
<P>
   This was, he knew, a reminder ``that it wasn't just some light
thing that we were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   When news of the ASA accident came, details were sketchy. In
Hamilton Standard's Rock Hill shop, Bender heard only that people
had died in the crash and that blade failure was possible. This
prompted a dark thought from Bender, who knew that ASA used
Hamilton Standard blades: ``I knew that every blade that had been
inspected internally, I had done. ... I was just devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   His manager sought him out to make sure he was OK. Only a few
weeks earlier, Bender, the son of a baker, notified the manager of
his plans to leave Hamilton Standard by the end of the year to
enter Bible school.
</P>
<P>
   Then he thought about the people in the plane and wished he
could make it all go away, or switch places with them. He went
outside the shop to be alone. He fought back tears, swallowing
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues came to see him. A few tried to take his mind off the
crash by talking about other subjects. Others related Air Force
experiences in which they'd seen mechanics cry over crashed jets;
things got better for those mechanics, they assured, and it would
get better one day for Bender, too.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Chris Bender, living alone, went home and cried. He
called his mother and sister to tell them what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Then he did the only thing he knew: He got before God. ``And I
really just laid it down before Him.'' Confused, the hourly
mechanic asked God why this had happened. He asked for strength.
``I knew I needed to be responsible for something that I did
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender's worst fears were confirmed when he looked at the
paperwork and saw his own writing: ``CSB.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice the NTSB interviewed Bender; he even demonstrated for
investigators his sanding repair on the accident blade.
Investigators were impressed by his knowledge of repairs and by his
assurance that, if he ever had doubts about a repair, he made sure
to seek the advice of managers.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1996, two weeks before the NTSB issued its accident
report and nearly a year after he left Hamilton Standard for Bible
school, Bender flew to Washington. There he was questioned under
oath by attorneys representing ASA passengers. He had been warned
that it would be difficult, and it was: a grilling intended to make
Hamilton Standard pay.
</P>
<P>
   In its final report, the NTSB determined that Bender mistakenly
used a sanding repair authorized for a blade with a different type
of inner surface. The agency found that Hamilton Standard's
internal documentation and communication had ``created confusion''
that led to Bender's ``misapplication of the blending repair.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to inquiries for this story, Hamilton Standard said
in a written statement that it ``accepts full responsibility for
the fracture of the blade which caused the crash'' and that it
``formally acknowledged liability for negligence ... in the
litigation arising from the crash.''
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, the company launched an extensive internal
program that it says ``resolved technical and operational issues.''
Further: ``The loss of lives and the injuries resulting from this
accident have saddened everyone at Hamilton Standard, and all of us
at the company continue to express our deepest regret and
sympathies to all those affected.''
</P>
<P>
   The company would not comment on Bender specifically but said
all employees who worked on the accident blade ``followed written
company processes and procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It still bothers him,'' Amy Bender says.
</P>
<P>
   She had known him, through discipleship classes, for several
months before he ever mentioned the ASA crash. Unsure of how to
respond, she prayed for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is a very peaceful person to be around,'' she says.
``He's someone who has a lot of strength in his quietness.''
</P>
<P>
   She once feared his shyness would keep him from proposing. But
in August 1996, a year after the crash, he bought a $20 ring from
Kmart _ ``cheap cubic zirconium,'' he says, ``one of those little
engagement rings they sell in their jewelry department.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, beneath a Texas sky filled with shooting stars, he
proposed. They married in the spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Bender expressed sadness when he learned that Hamilton
Standard, during companywide restructuring, closed its Rock Hill
facility last summer. He still refers to his two years there as
``the best secular job I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, sitting on a couch in a mobile home roughly the same size
as the passenger cabin of ASA Flight 529, Bender has a few
questions:
</P>
<P>
   ``How are the people doing?'' Hearing that one survivor,
Jennifer Grunbeck, was 92 percent burned and has undergone more
than 50 surgeries, he nods, grimly.
</P>
<P>
   But hearing that first officer Matt Warmerdam, though burned
severely, talks of flying again, Bender allows a small smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wondered,'' he says, ``how the families are getting
through all of this.'' Now he hears of Jackie Gannaway, the pilot's
widow, and of her three sons, now fatherless. And of Dawn Dumm, who
wrote what she thought would be a final note to her husband and two
boys as the plane neared the hayfield; and of Dumm's 64-year-old
mother, who survived the crash but died of a heart attack eight
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Bender listens to these stories _ and others _ expressionless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess one question in the back of my mind is: What did they
find in the investigation? What was the final conclusion?''
</P>
<P>
   Listening as portions of the NTSB report are read, his eyes
tighten at the corners, and at certain moments he nods.
</P>
<P>
   He has wondered about the crash survivors, and how he might like
to speak with them. ``I've often thought about that, but what would
I say?''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lengthy pause, and then he answers his question:
``Let them know that I do care and that I haven't forgotten about
them. I still do pray for them. I still pray that something good
can come out of something so awful. And, um'' _ his voice quavers
here _ ``if there was anything that was possible for me to try to
do, I don't even know what.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he says that speaking to the survivors maybe isn't such a
good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they would take me,'' he says. ``I mean, I
figure some people would probably be bitter about it, and probably
hateful toward me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's something I would totally understand.

and a nice car. As he saw it, he had it all.
</P>
<P>
   Bender believed his hands were his great gift, and over the next
year and a half he worked on ``a couple thousand'' blades.
</P>
<P>
   Working on blade 861398, Bender used a fiberoptic scope, a long
rod with an eyepiece at one end and a mirror on the distant tip, to
search inside the blade for evidence of corrosion, pits or cracks.
</P>
<P>
   He found none.
</P>
<P>
   But because the blade had failed ultrasonic inspections, Bender
sanded, or ``blended,'' the area inside the blade where the
previous tests indicated a possible flaw.
</P>
<P>
   He sanded off two-thousandths of an inch of material, believing
this would eliminate whatever had caused the blade to fail
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Bender's sanding would have dramatic repercussions in a
subsequent blade inspection in which an ultrasonic beam was used to
detect fatigue cracks. His sanding marks caused the ultrasonic beam
to scatter, or diffuse, and thus fail to detect a crack caused by
chlorine corrosion that extended below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bender had not caused this crack, he unwittingly
concealed it.
</P>
<P>
   Blade 861398 passed inspection and in August 1994 was returned
to ASA along with a Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness
tag.
</P>
<P>
   Installed on the left propeller assembly of an ASA Brasilia, the
blade would make 2,425 flights over the next 11 months,
transporting thousands of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But on Aug. 21, 1995, when ASA Flight 529, Atlanta to Gulfport,
was more than three miles high in the sky, the fatigue crack split
toward the face of blade 861398, then traveled around both sides of
its hollow center, causing the blade to break.
</P>
<P>
   In his job at Hamilton Standard, Bender well understood that
human lives were on the line. His bosses saw to that. Whenever a
plane crashed, whether jet or propeller driven, it was discussed at
the morning meeting.
</P>
<P>
   This was, he knew, a reminder ``that it wasn't just some light
thing that we were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   When news of the ASA accident came, details were sketchy. In
Hamilton Standard's Rock Hill shop, Bender heard only that people
had died in the crash and that blade failure was possible. This
prompted a dark thought from Bender, who knew that ASA used
Hamilton Standard blades: ``I knew that every blade that had been
inspected internally, I had done. ... I was just devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   His manager sought him out to make sure he was OK. Only a few
weeks earlier, Bender, the son of a baker, notified the manager of
his plans to leave Hamilton Standard by the end of the year to
enter Bible school.
</P>
<P>
   Then he thought about the people in the plane and wished he
could make it all go away, or switch places with them. He went
outside the shop to be alone. He fought back tears, swallowing
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues came to see him. A few tried to take his mind off the
crash by talking about other subjects. Others related Air Force
experiences in which they'd seen mechanics cry over crashed jets;
things got better for those mechanics, they assured, and it would
get better one day for Bender, too.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Chris Bender, living alone, went home and cried. He
called his mother and sister to tell them what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Then he did the only thing he knew: He got before God. ``And I
really just laid it down before Him.'' Confused, the hourly
mechanic asked God why this had happened. He asked for strength.
``I knew I needed to be responsible for something that I did
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender's worst fears were confirmed when he looked at the
paperwork and saw his own writing: ``CSB.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice the NTSB interviewed Bender; he even demonstrated for
investigators his sanding repair on the accident blade.
Investigators were impressed by his knowledge of repairs and by his
assurance that, if he ever had doubts about a repair, he made sure
to seek the advice of managers.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1996, two weeks before the NTSB issued its accident
report and nearly a year after he left Hamilton Standard for Bible
school, Bender flew to Washington. There he was questioned under
oath by attorneys representing ASA passengers. He had been warned
that it would be difficult, and it was: a grilling intended to make
Hamilton Standard pay.
</P>
<P>
   In its final report, the NTSB determined that Bender mistakenly
used a sanding repair authorized for a blade with a different type
of inner surface. The agency found that Hamilton Standard's
internal documentation and communication had ``created confusion''
that led to Bender's ``misapplication of the blending repair.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to inquiries for this story, Hamilton Standard said
in a written statement that it ``accepts full responsibility for
the fracture of the blade which caused the crash'' and that it
``formally acknowledged liability for negligence ... in the
litigation arising from the crash.''
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, the company launched an extensive internal
program that it says ``resolved technical and operational issues.''
Further: ``The loss of lives and the injuries resulting from this
accident have saddened everyone at Hamilton Standard, and all of us
at the company continue to express our deepest regret and
sympathies to all those affected.''
</P>
<P>
   The company would not comment on Bender specifically but said
all employees who worked on the accident blade ``followed written
company processes and procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It still bothers him,'' Amy Bender says.
</P>
<P>
   She had known him, through discipleship classes, for several
months before he ever mentioned the ASA crash. Unsure of how to
respond, she prayed for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is a very peaceful person to be around,'' she says.
``He's someone who has a lot of strength in his quietness.''
</P>
<P>
   She once feared his shyness would keep him from proposing. But
in August 1996, a year after the crash, he bought a $20 ring from
Kmart _ ``cheap cubic zirconium,'' he says, ``one of those little
engagement rings they sell in their jewelry department.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, beneath a Texas sky filled with shooting stars, he
proposed. They married in the spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Bender expressed sadness when he learned that Hamilton
Standard, during companywide restructuring, closed its Rock Hill
facility last summer. He still refers to his two years there as
``the best secular job I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, sitting on a couch in a mobile home roughly the same size
as the passenger cabin of ASA Flight 529, Bender has a few
questions:
</P>
<P>
   ``How are the people doing?'' Hearing that one survivor,
Jennifer Grunbeck, was 92 percent burned and has undergone more
than 50 surgeries, he nods, grimly.
</P>
<P>
   But hearing that first officer Matt Warmerdam, though burned
severely, talks of flying again, Bender allows a small smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wondered,'' he says, ``how the families are getting
through all of this.'' Now he hears of Jackie Gannaway, the pilot's
widow, and of her three sons, now fatherless. And of Dawn Dumm, who
wrote what she thought would be a final note to her husband and two
boys as the plane neared the hayfield; and of Dumm's 64-year-old
mother, who survived the crash but died of a heart attack eight
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Bender listens to these stories _ and others _ expressionless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess one question in the back of my mind is: What did they
find in the investigation? What was the final conclusion?''
</P>
<P>
   Listening as portions of the NTSB report are read, his eyes
tighten at the corners, and at certain moments he nods.
</P>
<P>
   He has wondered about the crash survivors, and how he might like
to speak with them. ``I've often thought about that, but what would
I say?''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lengthy pause, and then he answers his question:
``Let them know that I do care and that I haven't forgotten about
them. I still do pray for them. I still pray that something good
can come out of something so awful. And, um'' _ his voice quavers
here _ ``if there was anything that was possible for me to try to
do, I don't even know what.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he says that speaking to the survivors maybe isn't such a
good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they would take me,'' he says. ``I mean, I
figure some people would probably be bitter about it, and probably
hateful toward me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's something I would totally understand.

 &HT;    Hayes lists loses at $19.1 million
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hayes Corp. reported a $19.1 million loss Thursday for
the third fiscal quarter ending Oct. 3 as the deeply troubled
suburban Atlanta-based modem-maker continued to suffer from a slide
in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, which filed for bankruptcy protection Oct. 9, reported
revenues of $24.5 million _ a 53 percent plunge from $51.8 million
in revenues during the same quarter a year ago. The loss for the
quarter amounted to 99 cents per share, compared to a $6.7 million
loss, or 87 cents-per-share, for the same quarter in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view this as more of a snapshot of where we have been as
opposed to a picture of where we are going,'' said Ron Howard,
Hayes chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The company work force has already been slashed to 450 from a
one-time high of about 1,200 and will almost certainly shrink even
more with the planned sale of its Norcross, Ga. manufacturing
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will change the head-count pretty substantially,'' Howard
said. ``Hayes is now a company that is well into restructuring. I
don't look at these numbers and say this is what Hayes can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-term company hopes are pinned to new devices for connecting
customers to high-speed lines. But large-scale introduction of
digital subsciber lines by phone companies and cable modems from
cable companies is a few years away. Meanwhile, analog modem sales
have been erratic at best _ and often abysmal. Howard said the
company's financial bleeding has drained the strength needed to
exploit the demand that still exists. Hayes has ``substantial''
orders for modems that have gone unfilled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is scrambling to arrange the financing needed to
take advantage of those opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second sojourn in bankruptcy for Hayes, which in the
mid-1980s dominated the modem industry. The company emerged from
its first Chapter 11 in 1996, expecting growth, only to see sales
sag after several quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes merged with the much-smaller Access Beyond at the end of
last year. Since then, Hayes has reported sales of $101.7 million.
During the same three quarters of 1997, company revenues were
$146.7 million. The loss of $36.6 million for the first three
quarters of 1998 compares to a $14.5 million loss for the same
period of 1997.

STARR PRESSES CASE; DEMOCRATS PRESS STARR
</HEADLINE>
 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) (EDS: Will be led with later testimony) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth Starr presented the
case against President Clinton in meticulous detail Thursday as
Democrats tried to turn the historic impeachment hearing into an
indictment of the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The counterattack began even before Starr uttered a word as the
leadoff witness before the House Judiciary Committee. Later, Starr
accused the president of lying under oath, obstruction of justice,
witness tampering and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused Starr of leading a politically motivated
witchhunt that became fixated on Clinton's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, and many others, believe that Mr. Starr has crossed the
line into obsession,'' said Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, who
derided the independent counsel as a ``federally paid sex
policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   Conyers' opening statement set the tone for a politically
charged proceeding that provided plenty of partisan sniping but no
new revelations. By the end of the day, it was clear that no minds
had been changed on the 37-member panel that is expected to vote
strictly along party lines to recommend Clinton's removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Although the nationally televised hearing was only the third
time in the nation's history that a president had been subjected to
impeachment proceedings, the gravity of the occasion was often lost
in the bickering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the seating arrangement suits you. That's about all
that hasn't been complained of today,'' a sarcastic Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., the committee's chairman, told Democrats as the
session dragged into the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who maintained his quiet demeanor in the face of
blistering criticism, portrayed himself as an impartial public
servant whose only goal was the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respectfully but firmly reject the notion that our office
was trying to inflame the public,'' he said. ``I am not a man of
polls, public relations or politics. ... I revere the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also took issue with suggestions that he wanted to smear
Clinton by releasing graphic details of the president's sexual
liasons with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our referral never suggests that the relationship between the
president and Ms. Lewinsky in and of itself could be a high crime
or misdemeanor,'' he said. ``The propriety of a relationship is not
the concern of our office.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his X-rated Sept. 9 report to Congress, Starr's
58-page opening statement on Thursday avoided any mention of sexual
activity. The independent counsel kept the case against Clinton
tightly focused on the president's efforts to keep the affair
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said Clinton lied under oath in Paula Jones' sexual
harassment case, lied to a federal grand jury, lied to White House
aides, lied to members of his Cabinet and lied to the American
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``On at least six difference occasions _ from December 17, 1997,
through August 17, 1998 _ the president had to make a decision,''
Starr said. ``He could choose truth or he could choose deception.
On all six occasions, the president chose deception.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton ``repeatedly used the machinery of government
and the powers of his office to conceal his relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But Starr also acknowledged that he did not find compelling
evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton in several other matters,
including the failed Whitewater development that initially prompted
the four-year investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He cleared Clinton of any misconduct in the 1993 purge of the
White House travel office and the collection of FBI files on former
Bush administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found no evidence that information contained in the
files of former officials was used for an improper purpose,'' Starr
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Starr said Clinton and his White House aides
hindered virtually every step of his investigation. He suggested
that Clinton's supporters have paid Webster Hubbell, a Clinton
confidante and a former associate attorney general, about $550,000
to buy his silence _ an allegation that Hubbell has called untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats questioned Starr's motives and his tactics. They
accused him of putting undue pressure on Lewinsky to win her
cooperation, then ignoring her sworn statement that she was never
asked to lie or promised a job in return for silence.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said he did not quote Lewinsky in his report to Congress
because he thought her statement was misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, no one explicitly said, `You will lie,' using the L word.
Rather, it was we will continue with cover stories which are not
true,'' Starr explained. ``Ms. Lewinsky made it quite clear that
she knew how to lie. She was encouraging others to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the tactics used against Lewinsky, which included
discouraging her from calling a lawyer and threatening to prosecute
her mother, are standard investigative techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did, in fact, use a traditional technique that law
enforcement always uses,'' he said. ``She was a felon in the middle
of committing another felony.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans rallied to Starr's defense
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the target of the bull's eye,'' said a sympathetic
Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C. ``If half of the unfair comments leveled
at you are true, you should probably be keelhauled.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats seemed to agree.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT MEMO SHOWS FEARED IMPACT OF HIGH PRICES
 &HT;    470&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An internal document released Thursday at the
Microsoft antitrust trial reveals that top-level executives
discussed concerns that the company's high prices might threaten
its Windows software monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   A confidential memo to company chairman Bill Gates, written last
December, reviewed events that might ``derail'' Microsoft's pricing
strategy. It was written, at Gates's request, by Joachim Kempin,
vice president for sales to personal computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   The memo came to light as a government exhibit when economist
Frederick Warren-Boulton testified as the seventh witness to take
the stand. In a rare move, the Microsoft defense team insisted that
the entire Kempin memo, which was cited briefly in his 89 pages of
written testimony, be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Warren-Boulton contended that the memo shows Microsoft
calculating that the business climate would prevent other firms
from penetrating the market for operating systems. Microsoft asked
that the entire memo be made public in order to emphasize the point
that it considered its monopoly vulnerable to rapid technological
development.
</P>
<P>
   Firms such as Compaq Computer and Dell Computer, known in the
trade as original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, license various
versions of the Windows operating system from Microsoft and install
them on machines that they then sell to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our high prices could get a single OEM (Compaq might pay us
$750 million next year) or a coalition to fund a competing effort
(say in India),'' Kempin wrote. ``While this possibility exists, I
consider it doubtful even if they could get a product out that they
can market it successfully, (and) leapfrog us,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A potential coalition of hardware vendors that would gang up on
Microsoft and use their combined financial power to clone Windows
was not the only peril on the horizon, according the memo to Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Other risks are posed by Sun Microsystems Inc., which is
promoting its Java programming language as a cross-platform
alternative to Windows-only applications, and by Intel Corp., which
has much the same hold over the central processing units (CPU's)
that run personal computers as Microsoft has on their operating
system, or OS.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they decide to own the OS as well as the CPU our business
... will get ugly,'' Kempin said, referring to Intel. ``If they
decide to sell the OS for $1 and the CPU for $200 they will get the
OEMs on their side,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Kempin saw the threat from Sun's Java, which has recently loomed
large in anti-trust circles, as a more distant one. ``For the next
2-3 years the barriers are huge for them and even IBM, after
studying the technology, is not convinced that it would satisfy
customers when implemented during that time frame,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing the company's pricing options, Kempin favored a new
tack: licensing Windows ``for a limited time (to) create (an)
annuity business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best thing long term but it might disrupt end user
operations and could require end user registration,'' the Microsoft
executive noted. The annual licensing plan, he told Gates, probably
could not be put into effect ``until Windows NT 6.0 comes out (in),
say, 2001,'' Kempin said. Microsoft is currently shipping NT 4.0
while testing NT 5.0 among 10,000 beta users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a champion for this now if we want to do this,'' he
added, referring to the annuity pricing scheme. The memo's title
made it clear that Gates had requested Kempin's ``OEM pricing
thoughts,'' who also asked for ``feedback'' from Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The software giant contends it would be able to charge a lot
more for its Windows program if in fact it had a monopoly in
operating systems as the government alleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft does not charge more because this is a highly
competitive market, and a higher price would attract additional
market entrants,'' a recent company statement said.

GENDER BARRIERS HAVE FALLEN BUT NOT FAR ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is a measure of how far gender barriers have
fallen in politics that for the first time in history two women, a
Republican and a Democrat, ran credible races for top House
leadership posts.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of how far those barriers have yet to fall that
both were defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your perspective, you can look at this as the
equivalent of a political glass half-empty or a glass half-full.
</P>
<P>
   Women won six open House seats this month, bringing next year's
total for that body to a record 56 women, a net increase of two
from the current Congress. They held their own in the Senate at
nine seats, re-electing two incumbents and losing one but picking
up another female who was a challenger.
</P>
<P>
   But in the new Congress that is coming to power in January women
will make up only 9 percent of the Senate and 12.8 percent of the
House, even though they number 52 percent of the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 50 governors, there are only three women.
</P>
<P>
   Female candidates no longer generate the excitement of 1992, the
so-called Year of the Woman, when scores of them ran for office and
boosted their numbers in Congress overnight from 28 to 47. Since
then, the momentum and the novelty have passed.
</P>
<P>
   But recent predictions of an end to females' progress were
premature. Their political power, particularly in the state
legislatures, continues to grow, although at a snail's pace.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody blinked when Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., had the
audacity this week to challenge House Majority Leader Richard Armey
for his post, the most powerful and prestigious job in the House
except for the speakership itself. As Republican Conference vice
chairman, she had earned the right to try, although the effort was
a bit of a reach.
</P>
<P>
   Armey defeated Dunn and two other challengers, Steve Sargent of
Oklahoma and J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois. But Dunn is the most
visible GOP female in the House and lives to fight another day.
</P>
<P>
   She based her campaign in part on a contention that the GOP
leadership needs a woman's voice to soften the party's image and
present a more compassionate face to the world. `` I bring the
perspective of a working mother and a professional woman to the
leadership table,'' she argued.
</P>
<P>
   Most female politicians these days flaunt their motherhood,
although a quarter century ago it was considered a distraction and
a disadvantage for a public career.
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Pat Schroeder, also a mother, arrived in Congress in
1973, a male veteran lawmaker told her that he preferred his women
cuddly and sweet-smelling. She replied she preferred her men the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1984 Democratic vice presidential candidate, Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro, still another mother, was asked if she baked
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays motherhood is seen as a good credential for proving a
caring nature and an appreciation for the problems of ordinary
families. But motherhood did not cut much ice for Dunn with the GOP
male majority, which outnumbers the party's women 207 to 16 and is
more conservative than Dunn is perceived to be.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic House leaders also had a chance to pick a woman for a
top post and passed when Martin Frost of Texas defeated Rosa
DeLauro of Connecticut to become chairman of the Democratic Caucus.
Embarrassed by the fact that this leaves the diversity-conscious
Democrats without a woman in a top leadership post, Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt hastily volunteered he would find some appointive
top job for DeLauro.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, only one woman is in a leadership post _ the
Democrats just re-elected Barbara Mikulski of Maryland as
conference secretary. The Republicans maintained their all-male
leadership. It was easier for them because there are only three GOP
female senators.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no matter how slow the progress, the large numbers of women
now in politics have demonstrated that they are here to stay, as
they are in other workplace situations. The more, the merrier.
</P>
<P>
   When women were around in only token numbers, it was easy to
ignore them or treat them like out-of-place freaks. But now that
women sit on the major committees and are even knocking on the
doors of the congressional leadership, issues they are interested
in and policies they espouse are making their way into law.
</P>
<P>
   This also encourages that old speculation: Is the country ready
for a female president? The answer is usually yes in principle. But
things get complicated when you look for a woman with competitive
political credentials at that ultimate level. The list is pitifully
small.
</P>
<P>
   No female has ever made a serious run at the presidency,
although Schroeder tried briefly in 1988, Rep. Shirley Chisholm
made a frivolous run in 1972 and Sen. Margaret Chase Smith was
nominated at the 1964 GOP convention in a public relations stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, president of the American Red Cross, former
Cabinet officer twice and wife of Bob Dole, the 1996 GOP
presidential nominee, is often mentioned as a good candidate for
the Republicans. Despite frequent urgings from her husband, she
shows no sign of running.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Clinton is the top draw for Democrats,
although she denies any such ambitions, and the president has said
he doesn't think she would ever run in 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both Elizabeth Dole and Hillary Clinton are popular in the polls
and relish public life. But a female president is a tougher sell
than, say, a female House majority leader.

   Haven't you ever picked up the phone while you were online? You

</P>
<P>
   The modem has nothing to do with transmitting your voice. All
that stuff is handled by your sound card, which records what you
mumble into the mike, then funnels it into your video- or
audio-conferencing software. From there, it gets turned into tiny
little bundles of data and passed on to the Web.

ARIZONA TROUPE'S `JOURNEY' UNSPARING, BRILLIANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KYLE LAWSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Tyrones are scary sons-of-bitches, all the more
frightening because they are real people masquerading as stage
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene O'Neill's celebrated family, his own, thinly veiled by
artifice, makes you laugh as it slashes through the chest cavity,
looking for your heart. Then the tears come, and after that the
pity.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for their human frailties, you might think these
people are monsters from some other, more terrifying dimension. Of
all theatrical families, they are the most magnificently
theatrical, the most splendidly horrible, the most compulsively
watchable.
</P>
<P>
   James, his wife Mary and their sons Jamie and Edmund are the
charismatic, doomed clan at the center of O'Neill's ``Long Day's
JourneyInto Night,'' a masterpiece of world theater that is being
revived by Arizona Theatre Company and director Marshall W. Mason
at the Herberger Theater Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has never seen a production like this. New York and
London cannot best it. From the opening moments, when the Tyrones
stride boldly into their living room, the audience is aware it is
embarking on an experience that, if lucky, comes once in a
playgoer's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   James Tyrone is an aging, miserly actor, living on his dwindling
investments and the faded memories of his glory days as a matinee
idol. Mary is a morphine addict, the victim of painkillers
prescribed by a quack doctor during the birth of her youngest son.
Jamie is an alcoholic whoremonger, a bitter, acerbic man who is
fiercely protective of his kid brother Edmund.
</P>
<P>
   It is a naked portrayal of O'Neill's own family, and Edmund is
the playwright's unsparing look at himself, a writer of potential
who idolizes his mother and brother, tries to respect his father
and fears that all rue the day he was born. As the play begins, he
is nervously awaiting a doctor's diagnosis on whether he has
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   God help them, for these people are beyond saving themselves.
They have plunged into the abyss before ever the lights come up
onstage. All that is left for the audience is to bear witness to
their agonizing descent into self-immolation and madness. &QL; 
 &QL; 
O'Neill at his best &QL; 
 &QL; 
But what a journey. O'Neill has few peers in his understanding of
the human tragedy and this is as good as he gets, a passionate,
darkly comic, lyrical ode to that razor's edge that bloodies most
of us before death puts an end to the mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   The Tyrones exist in an emotional netherworld between love and
hate, a place where the most sincere endearments are quickly
trampled by devastating truths. Every slight is a cut to the quick,
every outward sign of affection an occasion for cynical assessment,
but they can no more resist the ties that bind them than the tide
can stop its constant ebb and flow on the shores of the ocean that
fronts their summer home in New London, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Mason wastes no time in pitching audiences into the heart of the
maelstrom. He is not the first great director to take on the
Tyrones. Jose Quintero's 1956 production is still remembered for
its boldly dramatic vision. But Mason is not Quintero. His fame
rests on his body of work with Lanford Wilson, a playwright of more
intimate horizons.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's years of collaboration with Wilson have made him
something of an introvert when it comes to characterization. He is
less concerned with the outward show of the Tyrones' behavior, and
more involved with their inner struggle. Thus the family's pain is
both more evident and more subtle than it was in Quintero's
forthright approach.
</P>
<P>
   Mason choreographs his actors as if they were enemy warriors,
caught in an uneasy truce, suspecting that any minute the bloodbath
will renew itself. The Tyrones circle warily, reaching out to
tentatively pat a shoulder, to clutch at a robe, even to hold one
another awkwardly at moments of emotional overload _ but they never
(begin ital) touch. (end ital) Emotionally, they are opposing
magnets; their hearts push away as their arms open.
</P>
<P>
   It is a psychologically unnerving piece of staging, contributing
to an imagery of tension that pervades every aspect of the play.
Ming Cho Lee's massive, ghostly set broodingly evokes the past as
it imprisons the family in the present. Phil Monat's lighting
changes constantly, now highlighting, now casting the actors into
shadow, a visual metaphor for the Tyrones' distressing habit of
blurting out the truth, then fleeing from it.
</P>
<P>
   Always there is Peter Kater's haunting, melancholic music.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can be trusted in this play, not love, not truth,
certainly not words. O'Neill uses them brilliantly, and at great
length _ the play runs 3 hours, 10 minutes, and, at that, Mason has
trimmed it considerably _ but always as a means to trap the unwary.
</P>
<P>
   The actors are finely tuned to this rhythm of deceit, stepping
on one another's lines as they battle to make their voices heard,
then falling into sudden silence as they realize they have
overstepped the bounds, even for this cacophonous family.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Reid's Mary may well be the definitive portrait of that
tragic, conflicted character. This is a woman who has seen the face
of God but who has forgotten what he looks like. Only devils peer
back at her now from her mirror, and she is frightened onto death. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tension-filled role &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reid judges her performance exactly, teetering on the edge of
sanity, a bomb surely primed to explode, but when? Yet that
explosion isn't what one anticipates. She goes not with a bang but
with a blood-curdling whimper. In more than 20 years of
theatergoing in Phoenix, this critic has seen nothing to match the
chilling impact of this moment.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Bennett's Jamie is another example of this actor's
chameleonic ability to transform himself. He can be, and has been,
everything from a teenager to an elderly geezer. This time, he is
many things at once. Like his father, Jamie is an actor, and
Bennett has the swagger, but a rot has set in, fueled by too much
booze, too many women and nightmares from which he can't seem to
awaken. Like different kinds of liquors blended in a single glass,
his feelings for his family swirl around and slosh over in messy
verbal confrontations that leave everyone soiled, himself most of
all.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, after seeing Jason Kuykendall's performances in
``All MySons'' and ``King Lear,'' Mason said he was convinced that
the 22-year-old actor could be another William Hurt. High pr aise,
for it was Mason who discovered Hurt and nurtured his career in its
early stages.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from Kuykendall's sensitive, tortured Edmund that
Mason has lost none of his ability to unleash promising talent. Few
actors Kuykendall's age could achieve the necessary emotional power
_ much less hold their own _ in the shattering scene with Reid
where Edmund, goaded beyond endurance, finally confronts Mary with
the truth of her addiction. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Low-key Pressman &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If this ``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' has a flaw, it may be
Mason's decision to avoid any flamboyance in Lawrence Pressman's
portrayal of James Tyrone. There is no sense of the great actor
here; rather, Pressman reminds one of Charley Grapewin, the actor
who portrayed Judy Garland's kindly Uncle Henry in ``The Wizard of
Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   This low-key approach has the effect of reducing James' tirades
to whines. Too often, he comes across as crochety rather than
tyrannical. One can understand the family's disgust with its
patriarch's miserly habits; it's harder to grasp their reluctant
admiration for him. Still, Pressman is a remarkable actor. His
innate ability to find the humanity in any role he essays
transforms criticism of Mason's artistic misstep into nothing much
more than a quibble when set against the overwhelming impact of
this production.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, they like to say Mason is washed up. Otherwise, why
would such a legendary director waste his time teaching at Arizona
State University? Why he's here is another story. ``Long Day's
Journey Into Night'' is proof he is still master of his trade.
</P>
<P>
   The legend is not fading. Every performance at the Herberger
burnishes it more brightly. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   SAVING&AMP;LOANS-LAWSUITS (Undated) _ The most important civil
litigation being pursued right now by the Justice Department? Don't
be too quick to answer the Microsoft case. An argument can be made
for the cases pending at the US Court of Claims over the detritus
of the savings and loan bailout. The government could be forced to
pay as much as $50 billion if it loses cases brought by financiers
who purchased failed S&AMP;Ls and claimed that Washington altered the
terms of the deals after the fact. Fully 7 percent of the lawyers
in the Justice Department's civil division labor on these cases. By
Stephen Labaton.

</P>
<P>
   INVEST-DEFLATION (Undated) _ Most investors are quick to dismiss
the very notion of deflation, an economic environment defined by
widespread declines in the prices of goods and services. Accustomed
to the inflation of the last half-century or so, they expect ever
higher prices for their cars, their homes and _ perhaps most
importantly _ their stocks. They simply cannot imagine a world
where most items they buy behave the way computers do now, getting
cheaper year after year. But the truth is that a lot of smart
people are thinking about the possibility _ and not just the
Cassandras of the stock market who insist that a crash is coming.

<P>
   BIZ-MEGASHIPS (Undated) _ Megaships are taking over the world's
ocean freight traffic, but they don't yet have a port in the United
States that can handle them. One port on each coast will get the
billions of dollars in investment needed to accommodate these
thousand-foot-long behemoths and the huge flow of freight traffic
and jobs they will bring. On the west coast, Los Angeles-Long Beach
is already building the necessary facilities, but which port will
be chosen in the East? Five ports are competing _ New York,
Baltimore, Norfolk, Quonset, R.I. and Halifax, Nova Scotia _ but
three of the five will be cut from the list in the next week or two
by Maersk-Sealand, the huge shipping consortium that is the first
of the world's megaship operators to designate an East Coast home
port. By Susan Diesenhouse.

MORE THAN A SIMPLE FLING: ULTIMATE FRISBEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Sidebar at end of main article.) 
(bl) 
 By JERRY BEILINSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ My wife doesn't stroke my ego the way she did before
we were married. I told her I was going to play ultimate Frisbee,
for the first time since college 10 years ago. She said, ``Wait, I
wanna buy more life insurance first.'' Then she felt bad and
offered to help me find my moldy old cleats, which hadn't been worn
in more than a decade. ``I don't need cleats,'' I said. ``This is a
mellow game. They even said beginners are welcome.'' Fran looked at
me with what I'm pretty sure was pity and told me to drink plenty
of water.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, I'm in Prospect Park in Brooklyn. I'm not quite
wheezing yet but my legs feel like lead and my man is running away
from me with ease. He crosses into the end zone and catches the
disk with the relaxed air of Michael Jordan shooting over, say, a
boiled chicken. This guy I'm failing to guard is named John, I
think. And I'm not sure, but there may be two Johns here. Either
that or all this panting is making me see double.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate is sometimes called Frisbee football, but it's really
more like soccer, especially from a cardiovascular perspective. It
was invented by some New Jersey high-school students in 1968 and
went on to spread through the country and to some extent through
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Official games have seven players on each side on a field that
is 40 by 70 yards, not counting two end zones that are each 25
yards deep. The teams line up on opposite goal lines and one throws
off to the other, as with the kickoff in football.
</P>
<P>
   But there the similarity to that game ends. Action is
continuous. You can't run while holding the Frisbee, but you do run
around like crazy trying to get open so your teammate can throw it
to you. If you catch a pass, you stop short, pivot on your heel and
pass the Frisbee in turn to another player, one who is preferably
further up the field.
</P>
<P>
   Drop the disk (slang for Frisbee) or throw an interception and
the game continues in reverse: while the other team goes on the
attack you switch to defense. To score, a team has to pass the
Frisbee across the goal line. Then finally play stops, and the
teams return to opposite ends of the field to start another point.
This is usually a good time for the paramedics to come in and tidy
up the likes of me.
</P>
<P>
   Like other team athletes, ultimate players scream. In Prospect
Park, one guy is shouting: ``Stack! Stack! Stack!'' Then, it's:
``Force home! Force is home!'' and other jargon I don't understand.
But when my side is on offense, I cut straight at the defender,
pivot and run full speed back at my teammate holding the disk. He
gets off a pass and I snag it. Someone calls, ``Good cut!''
</P>
<P>
   My defender is a few inches from me, shouting the stall count:
``Stall one! Stall two! Stall three!'' If I don't get a pass off by
the time he reaches 10, the Frisbee turns over. I fake right, pass
left and bury the disk in the grass. ``Don't air bounce!'' someone
screams. I was trying to throw under the arm of the defender and
then make the disk curve sharply up into the hands of my teammate.
It used to work in college. Back then, in the days when my friends
and I ruled intramural ultimate at our Midwest university. Out on
the meadow in front of the old library, we'd spend afternoons
tossing the disk around. It was translucent, and it traced long
arcs in the sky, pure as mathematics, or blistering straight lines.
No football or javelin ever had the beauty in flight of a 175-gram
ultimate Frisbee.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of ponytail and earring wearers, late sleepers
and guitar players in that group. On game day we'd show up late,
warm up with cigarettes and maybe a beer, and win. And we took
pleasure in beating the likes of the football fraternity. That team
would arrive wearing identical white T-shirts and prepare with
lock-step calisthenics. It was skill over strength, physics over
physicality, the triumph of the soul over mere substance.
</P>
<P>
   But the fit inherit the world. In Prospect Park, my head feels
as heavy as my legs and I've retreated to the grass under a shade
tree to drink water and watch the game. This is a pretty spot. The
field is called the Nethermead, and it's a short walk from the
Third Street entrance on Prospect Park West. The lawn is thick and
trees are scattered idyllically around the edges. If I do go back
in the game and the worst does occur, this might do nicely as my
final resting place.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of hours about 30 players have shown up. The game
has been going on every Saturday morning, rain, shine or snow, for
years. They even played in the big blizzard of 1996, says Scott
Bolden, who is not only tireless on the field but also has a sort
of world-culture cool going on. He's wearing a striped soccerlike
jersey, green shorts and wraparound sunglasses. While this is a
pickup game _ beginners welcome and all that _ he explains to me
that many of these players also compete on club teams.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive ultimate is governed by a somewhat anarchic group
called the Ultimate Players Association. There are men's and
women's divisions, with a recently begun coed division. College and
club leagues are separate; the clubs are better. There's no
professional play in ultimate and neither sponsorships nor any
officiating. Just a lot of players who can't kick the habit. This
is what I love about the game: its classic sporting attitude.
Baseball was maybe this cool in the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Castellino, chatting on the sidelines, tells me that a
couple of Prospect Park regulars have been on national championship
teams. His own club, F Train, is a ``scrub Brooklyn team,'' he
says. I saw the team earlier in the day practicing on another
field. It's a hefty notch below New York's best team, the name of
which seems to morph from year to year. Right now, it's called the
Westchester Summer League All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   I go back into the game. The problem with my regular
have-another-doughnut conditioning program is that I can really
only play one point before I get too tired to run very hard. After
that, I resort to a lazy sort of ultimate-playing defense off my
man, mainly staying far from the disk on offense. I retreat to the
sidelines again after three points.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Official ultimate Frisbee games have seven players on a side,
but you can play with fewer. Simply find a field, put out some
backpacks to mark the corners and you're set. In addition to the
pickup games in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and in Central Park,
there are regular games in Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, N.Y.;
Brookdale Park in Montclair, N.J.; Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx,
and at other locations. Information on ultimate Frisbee competition
and pickup games, and for the official rules is offered on the Web
site of the Ultimate Players Association at www.ultimate.org and by
telephone: (800) 872-4384.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PSAGOT, West Bank _ From the picture windows of his office atop
a commanding hill, Pinchas Wallerstein has a sweeping, bird's-eye
view of the chiseled limestone of Ramallah. But he sits with his
back to the Palestinian city, snug behind barbed wire in this
Jewish settlement. The Palestinians may be a fixture on his
horizon, he said, but that doesn't mean he wants to stare them in
the face.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Wallerstein, chairman of the Settlers Council, the
umbrella organization of the Jewish settlers' movement, looks at
maps, grids filled with colored splotches delineating the shifting
boundaries of Jewish and Palestinian areas in the West Bank. His
days of ideological lecturing against the peace accord are behind
him, he says. Another Israeli pullback is about to begin, and
Wallerstein has shifted his concern to roads, power lines, water
plants and security systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say I am not frustrated and angry,'' said
Wallerstein, who traveled to Wye, Md., during the peace talks last
month to lobby Netanyahu one last time. ``But I'm not a dreamer.
I'm a realist. There never was any insurance for us. Now I need to
help my settlers deal with our loss, and help them live a secure
and normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   The signing of the peace memorandum in Washington last month
dropped like a missile of doom into Israel's political right wing.
It shattered alliances, blurring the political identity of a
movement built around defending the Jewish homeland against
territorial compromise. It expanded the political center, and
transformed those who clung to their right-wing ideology into a
kind of fringe.
</P>
<P>
   What has emerged most powerfully is a new pragmatism, which puts
the settler movement's guiding ideology on the back burner, if not
in the waste bin. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who ran for
office as a hard-line ideologue, and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon,
the champion of Jewish settlement construction, set the course, but
the settlers' leadership and even the right-wing National Religious
Party followed.
</P>
<P>
   There is perhaps no clearer sign of ideological resignation than
the acquiescence of the settlers' leaders to the inevitability that
land will be returned to the Palestinians. But when the National
Religious Party, nine members strong, decided this week to remain
in Netanyahu's governing coalition, its vote against the peace
agreement turned into little more than a protest.
</P>
<P>
   In the halls of the Israeli parliament this week, the National
Religious Party was openly ribbed for turning mainstream by members
of the opposition Labor Party, who could not help but gloat. One,
Dalia Itzik, who wore a short, tight, very secular suit, teased
Nissan Slomiansky, with his rumpled white shirt and knitted
yarmulke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess from now on it's better to have a seat in the house
than all the land of Israel,'' she called out with a broad grin as
she sashayed past.
</P>
<P>
   All this accommodation by right-wing leaders to the
land-for-peace plan that sits at the heart of the left's platform
has sharply divided not only Netanyahu's governing coalition but
his Likud Party. It threatens to fragment the right, prompting more
small parties to form, which would endanger their electoral
chances, just as it did when Yitzhak Rabin was elected Prime
Minister in 1992. This is part of what makes the leadership so
pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the right have become vehemently uncompromising
because of deep feelings that they have been betrayed by Netanyahu
and Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the parliament approved the peace plan by a
significant majority, Netanyahu met with 18 key players, mostly
from his coalition, in a committee room. The meeting opened with a
half-hour lambasting of the prime minister by Uzi Landau, a Likud
member, so insulting it made even Labor members squirm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had that feeling of a private quarrel in a family,'' said
Yossi Beilin, a Labor member who was present. ``It was like two
brothers in a fistfight. Personally, we felt uncomfortable, like we
shouldn't open our mouths. Politically, well, if they fight, they
are split, and if they are split, they are weak _ which is not so
bad for us.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no clear successor to Netanyahu as the right's leader.
A Gallup poll taken last week by the newspaper Maariv showed the
right wing abandoning the prime minister _ with 62 percent in favor
of an alternative candidate _ but not knowing where to turn. On the
other hand, a poll of Jewish settlers by Wallerstein's organization
found an overwhelming majority supporting Netanyahu because there
was nowhere else to turn.
</P>
<P>
   Nekuda, the settlers' magazine, ran a front-page story in the
form of a classified ad. ``Wanted: a leader,'' it said, ``for the
nationalist camp. Necessary qualifications: loyalty to the
homeland; devotion to the heritage of Israel; ability to withstand
pressure; follow-through on commitments; truth-telling in any
weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Haggai Segel, one of the founders of the Ofra settlement,
in Nekuda: ``We are worthy of a leader who can say `no' to the
Americans, and who can protect the Jewish identity of the state and
its borders. It is fair to assume that such a candidate would fail
in the next elections, but would eventually win, due to the
demography of the religious public and what will be disillusionment
with the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of thinking unsettles settlers and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The zealots would bring this government down and inflict upon
us a left-wing Labor-Meretz combination that would be an outright
disaster,'' said Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom, a National
Religious Party member. ``We must take care not to cut off our nose
to spite our face.''

 PSAGOT, West Bank: our face.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happened within the National Religious Party this week
provides a fascinating peek into the nexus of religion, ideology
and power in Israel. When the party's leaders decided to stay in
Netanyahu's coalition, they chose to keep their place at the table,
along with all the perquisites of office. But they also turned
their backs on their spiritual leaders, who had directed them to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can hope that this is the beginning of their political
autonomy and release from the system of being ruled by haughty
rabbis,'' Yirimiyahu Yovel, a philosophy professor at Hebrew
University, wrote in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was pleased, though. It is likely to bring about a
split in a party that some believed was capable of transforming
itself into a genuine force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would we follow like sheep a prime minister who believes
in certain ideas and acts exactly the opposite and confuses
everyone?'' said Slomiansky, a dissenter within the National
Religious Party. ``Sometimes if you keep doing ideological
somersaults you end up on your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kleiner, the head of the Land of Israel front, said his
group, which opposes any territorial concessions, has been left
``an orphan'' by its ideological parent parties _ Likud and the
National Religious Party. ``The Likud and the NRP may have
capitulated, but there's still a constituency for our point of
view,'' he said. ``Maybe it's time for a new party, like when the
Republican Party was established in the United States. We can join
all the small forces on the right _ Tsomet, Moledet, Gesher _ with
Uzi Landau or Benny Begin from the disenchanted Likud.''
</P>
<P>
   In his settlement office, Wallerstein shrugged off the political
calculations. At this point, he said, it probably didn't matter
that much to the settlers whether Netanyahu or Ehud Barak, the
Labor Party leader, was in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we wouldn't have such good access to Barak, but Bibi'' _
Netanyahu's nickname _ ``had an open-door policy and look where it
got us,'' Wallerstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he authorized roadblocks, which briefly held up traffic
to and from Palestinian towns, after the agreement was signed so
that his people would have a way to express their frustration. ``It
gives them something to do even if it has no impact on the
government,'' Wallerstein said. ``If you don't give them a
psychological outlet, you cannot control them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallerstein, who is mayor of a group of settlements, said his
response to the Israeli withdrawal will be to expand each of the
settlements under his jurisdiction before the final status talks
that will decide the ultimate fate of the West Bank settlers. He
said he plans to double the number of settlers' houses in the area
from 3,500 to 7,000 by the end of next year. Already, he said,
1,000 new homes have been constructed, and they are selling for
$100,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Wallerstein said he had been doing some soul-searching and had
come to the conclusion that the settlers had alienated their
mainstream supporters, making it easier for Israeli society to
dismiss them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They describe me or my friends as fanatic, right-wing,
religious, with our prayer fringes hanging out, and a Kalashnikov
or Uzi on our shoulder,'' he said. ``And the majority of settlers
are secular and not armed. I think we project an image, like at our
funerals, that turns people away. That's why we lose someone in our
community to terrorism, it's, `Oh, just a settler, never mind.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help us to be a marked group,'' he said. ``I want
to be part of Israeli society.''

A VILLAGE WITH MUSIC IN THE FAMILY TAKES IT TO THE CLASSROOM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: New York)   (smw) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While many public schools, struggling under budget constraints
and competing academic interests, are marginalizing arts programs,
if not eliminating them altogether, the opposite is happening in
the small village of Greenport at the tip of the North Fork on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, under the leadership of David Kapell, the mayor
of Greenport since 1994, a new program will bring classical music
to the 600 students in the town's single public school. Kapell's
support for classical music comes not just from his belief in the
value of the arts but also from his personal history. He is the son
of the pianist William Kapell, who died in a plane crash in 1953
when he was just 31 and at the peak of acclaim. At the time, David
Kapell was 4.
</P>
<P>
   Kapell's mission has been aided by another Greenport resident,
John Serkin, also the son of a famous pianist. Serkin, the third of
Rudolf Serkin's six children and a onetime French horn player, is
now a piano technician and tuner and serves on the village's Arts
and Culture Committee. He was instrumental in working out the
details of the new arts program, which will bring students from the
Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia to classrooms in
Greenport, where they will discuss and perform music. Rudolf
Serkin, who died in 1991, was a longtime director of the Curtis
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   To raise money for the program, Serkin has solicited the help of
his younger brother, the pianist Peter Serkin, who is to play a
benefit recital on Sunday at 2 p.m. in the Greenport School
Auditorium. Serkin will perform on a grand piano provided by
Steinway &AMP; Sons in Manhattan. With this gesture, the company is
both supporting the educational initiative and honoring the memory
of two major pianists who were exclusive Steinway artists.
</P>
<P>
   The piano, valued at $50,000, is essentially being lent to the
school, though the term the company prefers is ``long-term
placement.'' It will be moved to the auditorium for Serkin's
recital but will be kept permanently in a new wing of the village's
Floyd Memorial Library, where the Curtis students will present
concerts in conjunction with their work in the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't be more grateful,'' Kapell said recently, speaking
of the contributions from the Steinway company and Peter Serkin.
``The arts program in Greenport has been minimal, if anything. Our
kids were missing cultural expansion, which is a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefit recital should generate enough money to support the
music program for a full three years, John Serkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The program has two goals: nurturing aspiring musicians and
developing appreciation and audiences for the arts. The response,
Kapell said, is ``really surprising'' and ``very encouraging.'' The
hall, which seats more than 700, is sold out for Sunday's concert,
and the waiting list for tickets is approaching 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelmingly local people who are coming, people who
live within 10 miles of the village,'' Kapell said.
</P>
<P>
   And, thanks to benefactors who contributed $500 each, at least
150 seats will be occupied free by students from nearby school
districts.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor described Greenport as a ``true blue-collar town,
fundamentally,'' though this ``belies the broader demographics'' of
the area and its small, stable and diverse economy. Local
industries include fishing, wineries, retail and tourism. While the
population of the incorporated village is 2,100, the school serves
a district of 5,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   John Serkin has been tuning the piano and voicing it (adjusting
the density of the felt hammerheads for sound quality) in
preparation for his brother's recital.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing the works he will play, Peter Serkin has devised a
substantive and varied program, including shorter pieces by Chopin,
Debussy and Messiaen; recent works by Gyorgy Kurtag and George
Benjamin; Schoenberg's Piano Suite, Op. 25 (a challenging 12-tone
work that Serkin plays vibrantly), and, in the second half,
Mozart's Sonata K. 332 and Beethoven's ``Les Adieu'' Sonata.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't wait,'' the mayor said. ``The students are excited.
You never know where the next great musician is going to come from.
It could be Greenport.''

MOVING A FRANCHISE? JUST ASK GEORGE YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Young knows about moving franchises. He saw it when the
Colts left Baltimore for Indianapolis. He saw it when the Raiders
relocated to Los Angeles from Oakland, and most recently when the
Cleveland Browns became the Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a void, no question about that,'' said Young, the
National Football League's senior vice president of football
operations, who came to the league office after a long career in
the front offices of the Colts, Miami Dolphins, and New York
Giants. ``I felt there was a strong effect when the Colts left, and
I know it has had an effect with the Browns, having to deal with
the Cleveland people.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Patriots have announced they intend to leave Foxborough
for Hartford in 2001. It wouldn't be a dramatic switch, but Young
understands that the fan base is affected by even a local move.
</P>
<P>
   He saw the Giants move from Yankee Stadium in New York across
the Hudson River to the Meadowlands in New Jersey, and he saw the
Jets leave New York's Shea Stadium for the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what it does to the mood of a city or the way
people feel about where they live,'' he said. ``But it changes
things, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said the reaction is strongest after a team is gone. ``You
see how much a city does to get a team back after it leaves,'' he
said. ``You saw it in St. Louis and you saw it Oakland.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Patriots, Young says he knows only what he has read
thus far. ``If it indeed does happen, they'll still be the New
England Patriots,'' he said. ``And I know that Bob Kraft is very
sensitive to the Patriot fans.''

`SUE': A LIFE CAREENING OUT OF CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at the end of review) 
(af) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anna Thomson delivers a wrenching portrait of a psychologically
disordered woman in the new Amos Kollek film, ``Sue.''
</P>
<P>
   As the constant focus of this relentless tale of a woman whose
life is slipping beyond control, Ms. Thomson, with her high
cheekbones, sad, down-curving upper lip and the ability to appear
simultaneously street tough and childishly vulnerable, gives a
performance that is as easy to admire as it is difficult to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay of ``Sue,'' written by the Israeli-born Kollek,
who is also the film's producer, may not plumb the psychic depths
necessary to illuminate the dark wellsprings of Sue's personality
disorder, but it unflinchingly observes the crucial weeks in which
her desperate life in New York unravels.
</P>
<P>
   She cannot pay her rent; she drinks heavily, often early in the
morning; she cannot sleep, and she is too damaged to respond to
overtures of friendship and help from Linda (Tracee Ross), a young
woman working toward a degree in psychology, or to love from Ben
(Matthew Powers), a journalist she meets in a coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   A good-looking, well-educated woman in her 30s who says she was
an office manager for a law firm for a dozen years, Sue seems far
more comfortable with people like Lola (Tahnee Welch), who carries
an automatic pistol and robs banks and video stores, or with the
men who provide her with casual sex after encounters in the streets
or in a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, like the woman tending her baby carriage in the
park Sue frequents, sense something about her loneliness,
desperation and disorder that makes them flee.
</P>
<P>
   When Sue, whose only relative appears to be a mother
institutionalized on the other side of the country with Alzheimer's
disease, defines herself, she says she has only accidental people
in her life. And, she observes, ``I only communicate through sex.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though Ben responds to her passion with his own, Sue
cannot handle their relationship in a mature manner, and when he
leaves the country for a month on an assignment, Sue ratchets
further down the ladder of her personal hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sue'' may not be a pretty picture of life in New York or a
fully rounded psychological case study, but Kollek and especially
Ms. Thomson paint its details with unsettling truth. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Their mother, whom they called Her Highness,
killed herself with the ``drink of silence,'' a toxic mix of
powders that included crushed remnants of the family diamonds and
pearls.
</P>
<P>
   Bereft, the prince and princess say, they slept with the corpse
on a stone slab, he on one side, she on the other. Then they did
the embalming themselves, careful to keep Her Highness' head on a
brocade pillow.
</P>
<P>
   The macabre has befallen the house of Oudh, creating an eerie
tale of people chasing the ghost of an old grievance and
squandering their lifetimes in the pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Oudh (pronounced ah-wud) was a wealthy swath of northern India
in the time of the maharajas. Its sovereigns traced their
bloodlines to ancient Persian kings. Their power seeped away under
the rule of the British, who finally seized the realm in 1856. Some
of the royal family never gave up their claim on the palaces. Nor
did their descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Best known among the bitter Oudh progeny has been the Begum
Wilayat Mahal. In 1975, trying to shame the government into
returning the family's estates, Her Highness moved into a busy New
Delhi railroad station along with a retinue of 13 ferocious dogs,
seven Nepalese servants and two of her children. They stayed 10
futile years.
</P>
<P>
   What finally coaxed them out was the offer of a substitute home,
a 14th-century hunting lodge built by a Delhi sultan and known as
Malcha Mahal.
</P>
<P>
   The stone monument _ without electricity or water, infested by
bats and pigeons _ sits on a concealed hill in a woody preserve in
the middle of the city. It is accessible by a brambly footpath, but
with the dogs snarling and signs warning that trespassers will be
shot, it was well suited to become a hermitage, and Her Highness
wished this so. She had decided that her family's public protest
would be replaced by lives of secluded misery.
</P>
<P>
   Her Highness died five years ago, and since then her mournful
daughter, Princess Sakina, who is about 40, has neither left the
grounds nor combed her frayed hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have divined that this world is nothing,'' she said,
flipping her hand as if to discard all earthly creation. ``Cruel
nature takes malicious delight in our ruin, so I desire nothing,
want nothing. We are now the dynasty of the living dead.''
</P>
<P>
   It was late in the afternoon, and the princess and her brother,
Prince Cyrus Riza, had granted a rare audience. This was arranged
through an exchange of notes, carried up and back the footpath by
the family's lone remaining servant, a young man dressed in a
formal black coat and white turban.
</P>
<P>
   The Dobermans and Labradors _ now numbering only seven _ were
chained, though there was no holding back the pigeons. They
streaked through the open archways of the dreary lodge, further
befouling the tattered oriental carpets on the stone floors.
</P>
<P>
   The princess, gaunt and dark-eyed, was wearing a soiled black
cape. ``Her Highness remained very restrained with us always,'' she
said, describing what was a decidedly unusual relationship. ``We
never took meals with her. We would never call her Mother. Here, I
will show you the bowl she drank from, taking her drink of
silence.''
</P>
<P>
   The bowl is centered on a table, set up as a shrine along with
Her Highness' gloves and shawl. As the princess talked, the prince
stood behind her. He, too, has sunken cheeks and he spoke of the
bizarre with the same air of poised nobility. Unlike his sister, he
ventures into the city from time to time and has even been to
Europe. He has secreted some of the family's final possessions, he
said. These are sold off to pay for food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are people of nature _ no plastics, no politics, no
business,'' he said. ``There are those who would like to befriend
us, and we would accept this, but they would have to be people of
status and character. We do not open our hearts to just anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Princess Sakina agreed with this, bemoaning what has become of
the world, lamenting the loss of palaces she never lived in,
nostalgic for a time a century before her birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have accepted ruination, but we will not accept the demonic
democracy of any country that has deprived royalty of their proper
position,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These words were an echo of her mother's. Her Highness had
claimed to be the great-granddaughter of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah of
Oudh, thought by some to be a poet and aesthete, and by others to
be a lecherous degenerate.
</P>
<P>
   Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, apparently took
some pity on her. According to various accounts, he gave her the
use of a house in Srinagar, in Kashmir. When fire destroyed it in
1971, Her Highness was offered a bungalow but felt such
accommodations beneath her. Her remonstrance led her to the railway
station.
</P>
<P>
   For 32 months the obstinate woman lived on a train platform,
later moving to an open portico built as a carriage drive for the
wealthy. Her beloved dogs discouraged anyone who might try to evict
her.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the Indian Home Ministry finally interceded, suggesting
that ``after repairs'' the derelict Malcha Mahal might be a fitting
home for the aristocratic squatters. Her Highness moved in. The
repairs were never done.
</P>
<P>
   Malcha Mahal proved as difficult a home as the train station. In
summers, bats flapped overhead and scorpions and snakes crawled
inside for the cool shade. During monsoons, rains poured through
the roof and collected in puddles on the uneven floor.
</P>
<P>
   Seclusion did not necessarily come with safety. One night,
intruders poisoned seven of the watchdogs and made off with antique
bowls and silver goblets kept on an ornately set table.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death of our animals made it hard for Her Highness to bear
the unbearableness,'' the princess said. ``So much is unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Highness took her own life at age 62. The prince and
princess, heirs to their mother's obsession, found her limp body on
Oct. 12, 1993. By their telling, they felt an obligation to embalm
Her Highness themselves. As the corpse dehydrated, they slept
beside her, something they had never done while she was alive.
</P>
<P>
   The method of embalming was one handed down from the time of the
pharaohs, Prince Cyrus said. But these esoteric techniques, however
trusted, would later be deemed a disappointment. After a year, the
corpse was removed from its crypt and inspected. Eternal
preservation had not been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral pyre was prepared. ``Do not use the word
`cremation,''' the princess pleaded. ``This is too common a term.
What we did was confer Her Highness to the pious flame.''
</P>
<P>
   The ashes, at least those that did not blow away, were released
into rivers that flow through the land once known as Oudh.

PATRIOTS DEAL A BOOST FOR UCONN PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the focus of attention was in Foxborough and Hartford,
Thursday's announcement that the Patriots have reached a tentative
agreement to move into a proposed state-of-the-art stadium in the
Insurance City in 2001 was cause for jubilation in the athletic
offices at the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Now the plans for UConn football to upgrade from Division 1-AA
to Division 1-A status can move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to wait for the stadium plan to be officially approved
by the state legislature,'' said athletic director Lew Perkins.
``Once that's done, we'll sit down and develop a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider that plan already formed. It's been in the works for
several years as the Huskies have dealt with the delicate issue of
moving from the Atlantic 10 to the Big East in football. They
already belong to the conference in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Like that of the Patriots, UConn's future has been directly
linked to a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a domed facility in Hartford, which would house both
the basketball and football teams, as well as a proposal for a
stadium on campus, came and went.
</P>
<P>
   So did an automatic time frame in which the Big East would have
been obligated to accept the Huskies as a football member. That
deadline passed Dec. 31, 1997, and while there seems little doubt
that the Big East will accept the Huskies as its ninth member,
there is no guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to formally apply for membership,'' said Big East
senior associate commissioner Tom McElroy. ``Then the presidents of
the football conference will have to vote on it.''
</P>
<P>
   McElroy pointed out that the dynamics of the conference have
changed since last year. The Big East is negotiating with ESPN
about whether the network will exercise an option to continue
televising conference football games through 2000. The league also
has an arrangement with CBS to televise conference games that must
be renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're comfortable with what we're doing and confident that it
will work out as well,'' said Perkins, who must begin to make
scheduling changes in anticipation of the jump to Division 1-A.
</P>
<P>
   Although the stadium is expected to be ready for the Patriots in
the fall of 2001, it will be at least three and possibly four years
after that before UConn can expect to play a full Big East
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it once, when there was an official deadline, when they
had a guaranteed spot,'' said Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese.
``So a lot of it is in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Tranghese says the Big East wants specific details about stadium
accessibility. The conference has dealt with dual use of facilities
in the past. Temple and the Philadelphia Eagles have used Veterans
Stadium for home games, and the University of Miami and the
Dolphins shared the Orange Bowl for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a new Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh reportedly
include dual usage by the University of Pittsburgh and the
Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the conditions in the Hartford plan is the sharing of
facilities by the Patriots and UConn beyond stadium use. Included
in the agreement is a plan for Patriot personnel's technical
support and facilities to be made available to the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens,'' said Tranghese, ``it's not going to happen
right away. It's my understanding that it's at least a five-year
project.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn's immediate problem is that Big East schools will be
hesitant to schedule the Huskies until they reach Division 1-A
status, since 1-AA victories do not count toward the six-victory
minimum required for bowl eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bottom line is that if our people want it to get done,
it will,'' said Tranghese. ``There isn't a detail that can't be
worked out.''

DESIGN REVIEW: WRAPPING THE WEST IN EASTERN MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Modern art in the West is inconceivable without the
salutatory effects of outside influences. African sculpture was
basic to the invention of Cubism; the woodcuts of Japanese
printmakers like Hiroshige, Utamaro and Hokusai inspired numerous
Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, most famously van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese prints were part of a veritable flash fire of Japanese
influence that raced through the United States and Europe after
trade with the West began in the 1860s. Japanese culture did not
distinguish between art and craft, which guaranteed that numerous
visual activities felt its heat: painting, printmaking,
architecture, furniture design, ceramics, silver and metalwork as
well as textiles and fashion.
</P>
<P>
   And the heat persisted from one generation to another: for
example, from the Esthetic Movement to the Arts and Crafts Movement
and the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright. Not surprisingly,
Japonism, as these cross-fertilizations came to be called, have
become a significant art historical subject, the focus of numerous
books and exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japonism in Fashion: Japan Dresses the West,'' at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art, is the latest such exhibition, and the first to
isolate the effects of Japanese textiles and garments on European
and American fashion.
</P>
<P>
   This beautiful show, which contains nearly 80 garments and spans
120 years, is a collaboration of two world-class textile
collections, Brooklyn's, which began about 100 years ago, and the
Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan. Founded in 1978 by Wacoal, a
Japanese lingerie manufacturer, the institute in Kyoto has amassed
substantial holdings in European garments from the 18th and 19th
centuries, Japanese-influenced Western clothes and the work of
contemporary Japanese designers. (For example, Rei Kawakubo, the
force behind Comme des Garcons, has recently donated her archive,
which includes more than 2,000 garments.)
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition begins with French and English evening gowns and
visiting capes and quilted silk dressing gowns made in Japan for
export, all dating from the last three decades of the 19th century.
It ends with the Japanese invasion that began in the early 1980s
when designers like Yohji Yamamoto, Issey Miyake and Ms. Kawakubo
took the international fashion stage by storm, fusing Eastern and
Western traditions, rethinking structure, fabric and finish, while
transforming the worlds of fashion and art into armies of women and
men in black.
</P>
<P>
   (Mysteriously, the final display in the exhibition is ``Draped
Female Sculpture,'' a wire-mesh sculpture designed by Yamamoto,
which indicates that he should stick to the art of fashion.)
</P>
<P>
   In between are clothes by French designers like Paul Poiret and
Madeleine Vionnet, whose unstructured streamlined garments fomented
revolutions of their own in the 1920s, and kimono-style coats and
dresses from the 1950s and '60s by the American designers Bonnie
Cashin and Rudi Gernreich.
</P>
<P>
   As with many exhibitions of Japonism, this one has the feeling
of an esthetic love affair, of one culture becoming infatuated with
and being happily seduced by another. Clearly, the Japanese
penchant for refinement and exquisite craft dovetailed perfectly
with the tastes and needs of designers making one-of-a-kind dresses
for upper-class women.
</P>
<P>
   It's a romance of several phases. In the beginning it was mostly
about looks, about surface, primarily the lavishly embroidered
silks used in the most sumptuous and formal of Japanese kimonos and
obis (the chunky sashes, often involving trains, that held kimonos
closed). The two evening gowns in the show's stunning opening
display are made from such fabrics, cream-colored silks densely
embroidered with floral and stream motifs in light, hot palettes
dominated by orange and gold.
</P>
<P>
   They flank an actual kimono (from the Philadelphia Museum of
Art) made from nearly identical fabric. The garment's simple lines
enable the full glory of the embroidered silk to assert itself.
Especially when hanging flat on the wall, it has the presence of a
painting or screen, and it reflects a reverence for crafted objects
rarely equaled in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with embroidery comes motifs: a range of
chrysanthemums, butterflies, cherry blossoms, clouds and peacock
feathers that reflect the Japanese love and ingenious use of
natural forms. In the exhibition, these designs and patterns become
increasingly sophisticated and abstract as time passes.
</P>
<P>
   One example is a silk tulle evening dress from 1919 (attributed
to Worth) that is covered with exquisite glass paillete embroidery
organized in ``crest motifs,'' according to the label. But what
makes the dress so striking is a background pattern that suggests
raked sand interrupted by wandering streams, or rocks, as in a
Japanese garden, or a Japanese screen. Nearby, a shiftlike evening
dress from 1924 by Vionnet is even more subtle: its interlocking
blocks of silver and gold-colored lame resemble the squares of gold
and silver leaf often found on screens.
</P>
<P>
   This last garment suggests a deepening romance: the love of
simplicity that balances out the Japanese penchant for decorative
excess begins to hold sway, altering the infrastructure of Western
clothing. Intimations of kimonos and obis work their way through
the garments in the central part of the show, which includes the
designs of Vionnet, Cashin and Gernreich as well as Mariano
Fortuny, Alix Gres and the Wiener Werkstaette designer Mathilde
Floegel. Don't miss the tie-dye horror from 1976 by Serendipity.
</P>
<P>
   At this point the exhibition is interrupted by a recently added
gift shop selling, among much else, contemporary kimonos. (It also
disfigures the handsome staircase carefully preserved in the recent
renovation of the museum's West Wing.) After this bit of marketing
desperation, the show concludes with a gallery devoted to the
daring work of the Japanese designers of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   If the romance metaphor continues, this is the abandonment phase
of the seduction. Japanese designers reclaim and brilliantly rework
their own traditions with more originality than Western designers
(Vionnet excepted) ever mustered. Miyake is particularly
impressive, exploiting his ingenious mini-pleats in garments that,
when worn, seem both fluid and geometric; laid flat, they acquire
some of the pictorial power of the show's opening kimono.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the gift shop, the main complaint about this show
concerns what's not here: It spreads itself too thin over a vast
and fascinating subject and sometimes feels like an outline for a
larger exhibition, or maybe even two. But let's not be ungrateful.
This is the Brooklyn Museum's first major textile exhibition since
1990, when the city's budget crisis forced the museum to lay off
the staff of its textile department and merge it with the
department of decorative arts, and the show deserves welcome with
open arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japonism in Fashion: Japan Dresses the West,'' is at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, 1000 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, through
Feb. 14.

SHOW COMBINES NEW METHODS, OLD TRADITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chiyoko Tanaka works alone in a cypress forest on the
edge of Kyoto. She weaves decorative fabrics of linen and ramie,
``grinding'' their surfaces by hand with stones, bricks and dirt to
achieve a timeworn appearance. She has, it would appear, not much
in common with the high-tech Bridgestone Metalpha Corp., a
subsidiary of the tire company, which produces _ with the aid of
robots _ a stainless steel fabric called Alphatex.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Tanaka meets Metalpha in ``Structure and Surface:
Contemporary Japanese Textiles'' at the Museum of Modern Art. The
show, organized by MoMA and the St. Louis Art Museum, salutes a
long-flourishing Japanese textile industry now reinventing itself,
in the process combining new techniques and materials with
ancestral traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying some 110 works by 29 artists, designers and
manufacturers, ``Structure and Surface'' is devoted mostly to
developments over the last five years. Its range of processes,
materials and products runs from the slick high-fashion fabrics
used by the designer Issey Miyake to a new knotless mesh created
for commercial fishermen by Toray, one of the largest textile
producers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers, Cara McCarty, curator of decorative arts and
design at the St. Louis museum, and Matilda McQuaid, associate
curator in MoMA's department of architecture and design, have
divided the textiles into six distinct but often overlapping
categories: transparent, dyed, reflective, printed, sculptured and
layered.
</P>
<P>
   The most imaginative works are found in the sections devoted to
sculpturing and layering. Turning surfaces into intriguing
terrains, the designers of these textiles achieve their effects by
cratering, eroding, wrinkling, rippling, pleating and puckering.
Heat plays an important role in sculpturing, with many fabrics
literally baked into their unique shapes.
</P>
<P>
   A striking example is Yuh Okano's ``Epidermis (Ocean)'' (1994),
a yellow-green polyester fabric that bristles with protuberances
suggesting undersea life. ``Epidermis'' got that way by means of
urea resin beads wrapped in the polyester, which was then dyed and
heat set before the beads were removed. One of the loveliest
handmade items is ``Shawl'' (1995), a mini-pleated silk wrap
painted in a range of warm to cool colors by Jurgen Lehl (a
German-born fashion designer who settled in Japan in 1971). Its
complex process involved twisting the silk threads, basting the
pleats, then setting them with a final steaming.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, pleating is the salient sculptural technique,
ingeniously accomplished by machine as well as hand, and resulting
in many different types of corrugated surface. The Inoue Pleats
Company, which brought pleats to Japan on a large scale and, along
with Issey Miyake, has been one of their biggest promoters
worldwide, presents 11 examples of its ripply products. Among them
is ``Wrinkle P'' (1995), an elegant grayish-white crumple of
polyester whose random folds were obtained by stuffing the fabric
into a small container, then heating it in a thermosetting machine.
</P>
<P>
   As for layering, it's an old Japanese tradition, expressed
perhaps at its fullest in the development of the kimono. During the
Heian period (794-1185 A.D.) high-ranking women wore 10 or more
layers of robes, each of a different cut and color that achieved an
overall harmony. Today one of the biggest designers of layered,
three-dimensional fabrics for fashion use is the kimono-loving team
of Issey Miyake and Makiko Minagawa. Their knockout ``Prism
Series'' (1997) of coats and dresses combines handwork with an
industrial carpet-making technique known as needle-punching. Layers
of material are webbed into a base fabric, on which pieces of other
cloth such as polyester chiffon are superimposed.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``transparency'' section, silk, as you'd expect, looms
large. There are the gossamer creations of Michiko Uehara, a weaver
from Okinawa, who uses only natural dyes and the thinnest possible
yarns in her work, which she describes as ``weaving air.'' A lovely
example is ``Sagen (Grassy Plains)'' (1997), whose lyrical pale
greens and yellows suggest not only meadow grass but undersea life.
</P>
<P>
   In quite a different mode is the equally see-through but far
more robust contribution of the Sakase Adtech Co. of Fukui, which
produces technical textiles. ``Triaxial Fabric'' (1991), is a
screenlike cloth of carbon fiber made by interlacing three yarns at
angles to each other. It can be stretched in all directions with no
stress at any one point; the structure providing strength rather
than the yarn. The triaxial weave was developed by NASA in the
1960s for aeronautical use. A similar process called ra was used in
Japan as far back as the 8th century A.D.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to admire in the ``dyed'' category, whose natural
colors and mixes are derived mostly from plants _ indigo, mangrove,
madder, Chinese strawberry and other exotica _ sometimes with
extraordinary labor. The colors reflect the Japanese love of nature
in all its manifestations _ sea, sky, earth and vegetation _ but
the most ubiquitous is indigo, the deep blue associated with Japan
since introduction of the plant from South China in the 8th
century. As Ms. McQuaid tells it in her catalog introduction, the
art of indigo dying had all but disappeared until a Tokyo-born
artisan, Hiroyki Shindo, revived it almost singlehandedly.
</P>
<P>
   His toilsome process involves adding lye, wheat bran, sake, lime
and a microorganism to dried indigo leaves in ceramic pots. Regular
stirring, heat and a 10-day fermentation period are part of the
technique. Shindo's most intense use of the dye is in his
``Shindigo Square Series 92-1'' (1992). A hanging of five narrow,
rough-surfaced hemp panels holds a square at its center, whose
light borders quickly segue into a deep midnight blue, the result
of dipping in the dye as many as 50 times.
</P>
<P>
   Several arresting textiles by Reiko Sudo in the ``printed''
category are stamped with patterns made by found objects. In
``Scrapyard (Nail)'' (1994), Ms. Sudo places rusty nails atop a
dampened rayon fabric to make a conventional two-dimensional
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be scanted are the textiles in the ``reflective''
category, in which a large role is played by polyester slit film,
metallicized on one side by a vacuum deposit of aluminum. Japan is
its biggest producer. A couple of stunning entries by Junichi Arai
employ this lustrous thread with ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to take in at one viewing the full impact of this
show, which seems ambitious to convey in short takes the entire
textile output of Japan. One problem is the fiber optic lighting,
said to enhance the colors and textures of the fabrics while
preserving them from heat damage. But the low illumination level
means you have to peer very closely at the work. Not a big problem;
whatever you do or do not know about textiles, this shows plays
forcefully on their appeal to your senses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Structure and Surface: Contemporary Japanese Textiles''
remains at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 W. 53rd St., through Jan.
26.

ON TV, STARR NO STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Today, our witness is Kenneth W. Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   With those words, House Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde
Thursday introduced to a national television audience the
independent counsel whose investigation of President Clinton has
convulsed the country, but who has been seen and heard little on
TV, the medium where lasting identities are forged in the heat of
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   There is an irresistible cultural momentum behind the
proposition that sooner or later, every player in a national
melodrama has to tell his or side of the story on television so the
citizenry can make up its mind. Monica Lewinsky agreed this week to
pour her heart out to Barbara Walters on ABC; Clinton's grand jury
testimony was televised in September; Thursday, it was time for a
Starr turn.
</P>
<P>
   Television can forgive anything but dullness. The Starr who
emerged on the TV screen during a full day of testimony and
question-answering was a rather mild, mostly imperturbable,
far-from-spellbinding figure who probably did little to change the
negative opinion that, polls show, much of the public has of him.
</P>
<P>
   While Starr bore little resemblance to the hot-eyed zealot White
House partisans have depicted him, he displayed little of the
savvily sympathetic TV presence that Clinton showed during his
televised grand-jury appearance, or the star-is-born panache Oliver
North demonstrated during the Iran-contra hearings.
</P>
<P>
   In an ironic similarity to Clinton, Starr tended toward
rambling, legalistic responses to uncomfortable questions about his
own tactics, frustrating the attempts of inquisitors to pin him
down. ``If you didn't do any of the leaking, why don't you just
tell us?'' demanded Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of
Massachusetts, after one circuitous response. Later, when Starr
gave the Clintonesque answer of ``It is not a date certain,'' Frank
shot back: ``I'll take a date ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Starr's less-than-blockbuster performance on
television would not matter if the impeachment inquiry was strictly
a legal and constitutional matter. As Jeff Greenfield observed
Thursday on CNN, ``insufficient charisma is an odd way to think
about so serious an event.'' Starr is a judge, not a TV
personality. But the reality is that the White House sex scandal
has mushroomed into a combination of legal issues, political
calculations, and public-relations jockeying. Television is often
the key variable in such equations.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has been the prime mover behind the story that
has consumed the media all year, Starr's previous TV appearances
had largely been confined to brief sound bites. For obvious
reasons, he had not joined the TV talk-show parade discussing the
impeachment inquiry. ``We go to court, and not on the talk-show
circuit,'' he said pointedly, adding that he and his prosecutors
``leave the polls to the politicians and the spin doctors.'' Later,
however, his words would be turned against him by Democratic
Representative Zoe Lofgren, who noted, ``This very morning, you
appeared on `Good Morning America.' ''
</P>
<P>
   All day Thursday, the camera's unblinking eye was on him. Starr
the prosecutor became Starr the defendant, as Democrats accused him
of an ``obsession'' with prying into Clinton's private life and
acting as a ``federally paid sex policeman.'' Starr remained
unflappable. In his uninflected tone, he maintained: ``It's about
lying under oath, obstruction of justice, misuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   If this were a prime-time drama like ``The Practice'' or ``Law &AMP;
Order,'' Starr's testimony would have been a pivotal moment that
resolved all lingering questions in explosive fashion. But instead,
it more closely resembled an episode of ``The X-Files,'' another
murky, meandering and inconclusive chapter in a seemingly endless
saga.

CLINTON HAILS JAPAN'S EFFORTS TO SOLVE FISCAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Launching &UR;  &LR; a five-day Asian trip, President Clinton
brought a message of hope to Japan about its crucial role in
resolving the Asian financial crisis Thursday, while escaping the
glare of the impeachment hearings back home.
</P>
<P>
   In marked contrast to the tough talk that pundits had expected _
and that Vice President Al Gore delivered at an Asian summit on
Monday _ the president praised Japanese leaders for new efforts to
stimulate the economy and to bail out sick banks, and refrained
from lecturing them on their failings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton specifically lauded Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi for
making ``difficult decisions to overcome your own economic
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The path back to growth and stability will require your
continued leadership, but we hope to work with you every step of
the way,'' the president said at a banquet in a baroque hall in
Akasaka Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has become a lightning rod for criticism from other Asian
nations in desperate need of a strong economy to lift them out of
recession. Tokyo bristles at the United States, which has berated
Japan publicly, saying it had not adequately addressed its economic
ills. The talks could have been doomed before they began had
Clinton set a harsher tone last night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's style highlights a good cop/bad cop approach to
relations with Asian nations that seems to have emerged within his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   At the Asian Pacific Economic Conference in Kuala Lumpur, Gore
played the hectoring enforcer, admonishing Asian leaders at a
dinner to end ``corruption and cronyism.'' And the US trade
representative, Charlene Barshefsky, accused Japan of trying to
bribe countries to scuttle a trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   But while his deputies talk tough about trade, human rights and
economic reform, aides say that Clinton uses his friendships with
leaders to apply discreet pressure. Even if the message is the
same, Clinton has a more palatable manner that disarmed even the
Chinese when he talked about human rights in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if these contrasting approaches produce
the desired results with Japan. Tokyo is under severe domestic
pressure to protect vested interests at the same time that it faces
a chorus of foreign voices demanding that it reshape its economic
system immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his focus on economic matters, Clinton could not flee
the scandal dogging him at home. In a televised ``town meeting,'' a
polite housewife from Osaka told Clinton she could not forgive her
husband if he had an affair. She asked the president how he
apologized to the First Lady and Chelsea _ and if they forgave him.
</P>
<P>
   Looking somber and pained, Clinton replied, ``Well, I did it in
a direct and straightforward manner and I believe they did, yes.
But that's really a question you could ask them better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   In this courteous society where one would never make a guest
uncomfortable, Clinton's questioner looked embarrassed and bowed
several times. The moderator cut away saying, ``Thank you very
much...Let's change the topic now.''
</P>
<P>
   The town meeting provided an opportunity for Clinton to take his
message of free trade directly to the Japanese public. Such a
format is unknown to Japanese, who are accustomed to stiff,
inaccessible politicians, and one that allows Clinton to exploit
his warmth and political gifts.
</P>
<P>
   As in a similar event in Beijing, where he fielded hostile
questions on human rights, Tibet and the future of Taiwan, Clinton
addressed issues sensitive to the Japanese such as trade
liberalization, the US military presence there, and the risks to
Japan of the closer relations between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   One man who was worried about American pressure to open Japanese
markets asked Clinton if he owns Japanese products. Clinton replied
that he owns some televisions made in Japan, and that the United
States is fighting protectionist sentiment to keep its markets
open.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's trade surplus with the US grew 32 percent last month
compared to a year earlier, according to the Japanese Finance
Ministry. It will rise even more as Japan exports more automobiles
to the US to offset lost sales in recession-hit Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Questioners were curious about everything from how often Clinton
dines with his wife (whenever they are both in town, or about four
times a week) to his favorite food (chicken enchiladas).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton buoyed a depressed Japanese public last night with more
hope about recovery than their own leaders have given them lately.
Clinton defended Obuchi, saying he has not been in office long
enough yet to effect change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret you have the present economic challenges you have,
but we don't think you should be too pessimistic about the
future,'' Clinton said. ``In the last 50 years, no country has
demonstrated the capacity to change more than Japan...So don't be
discouraged, but do be determined. That would be the advice of a
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials said new tax cuts were being considered that
would significantly increase a $196 billion stimulus package
announced Tuesday.

SOSA WINS NL MOST VALUABLE PLAYER AWARD  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa finally found a way to get ahead of Mark McGwire and
stay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   After losing out to McGwire in the historic race for the home
run record this past season, Sosa Thursday beat his friendly
adversary in the race for the National League Most Valuable Player
Award.
</P>
<P>
   The result brought a conclusion to the scintillating competition
between the two sluggers that raged throughout the summer and
captivated the American public. In their race to break Roger Maris'
record of 61 homers, Sosa held only two short-lived leads. McGwire,
the St. Louis first baseman, surpassed Maris first and finished
with 70 home runs. Sosa, the Chicago Cubs' outfielder, finished
with 66.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa was a one-sided winner in the balloting released
Thursday. He received 30 first-place votes and a total of 438
points to 2 and 272 for McGwire in the voting by a 32-member panel
of the Baseball Writers Association. Besides being overwhelmingly
one-sided, the result helped make history. With Juan Gonzalez of
Texas having won the American League award a day earlier, it marks
the first time Latin American players swept both MVP awards. In the
previous 67 years of the Baseball Writers MVP voting, Latin players
won eight times.
</P>
<P>
   A native and hero of the Dominican Republic, Sosa is only the
third Latino to win the NL award. Roberto Clemente won in 1966 and
Orlando Cepeda in 1967. George Bell, who was the American League
MVP in 1987, had been the only Dominican to win an MVP award.
</P>
<P>
   The one-sided nature of the vote is not likely to defuse the
debate that has raged and will continue to rage over the
appropriate choice for the award. McGwire supporters among fans,
baseball people and members of the news media believe he was the NL
MVP because he passed Maris first and finished with more home runs.
But Sosa supporters argue that there is a difference between player
of the year, which some concede McGwire might have been, and MVP.
In other MVP votes, the winner was not necessarily the player with
the best statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The voters clearly sided with the Sosa supporters, crediting the
Cubs' right fielder for sparking his team to a wild-card finish as
the second-place team in the NL Central Division. The St. Louis
Cardinals, McGwire's team, were never in the race despite his
unprecedented production.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs would have joined the Cardinals among the also-rans
without Sosa's 66 home runs, major-league-leading 158 runs batted
in and .308 batting average. McGwire drove in 147 runs, batted .299
and led the majors in walks (162), on-base percentage (.470) and
slugging percentage (.752).
</P>
<P>
   The McGwire-Sosa home run contest was credited with reviving
interest in major league baseball, which had still lagged from the
1994-95 strike. Their joint pursuit of Maris' record commanded
daily attention throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Because McGwire was the primary focus of that attention, some
people felt he should be rewarded for his value in helping bring
baseball's popularity back. But not to be overlooked was Sosa's
role in taking the interest to an even higher level and in
inspiring McGwire to what in August became his obviously greater
enjoyment of and appreciation for the impact he was making on fans
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their remarkably friendly rivalry, Sosa said again
and again that McGwire would be the one to break the record and
hold it at the end of the season. He was right on both counts. But
Sosa also said he had other priorities _ helping the Cubs reach the
playoffs and winning the MVP award. He achieved both.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who had never hit more than 40 home runs in a season, was
placed second on the two ballots on which he was not named first.
McGwire received 20 votes for second and the remaining 10 votes for
third through seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou of Houston, a fellow countryman of Sosa, finished
third in the balloting with 215 points and was the only other
player who was named on all 32 ballots. Greg Vaughn of San Diego
was fourth with 185 points, Craig Biggio of Houston fifth with 163
and Andres Galarraga of Atlanta sixth with 147. John Olerud and
Mike Piazza were the only members of the Mets who received votes.
Olerud placed 12th with 38 points, Piazza 14th with 15 points.
Sosa's victory earned him a $250,000 bonus, bringing his 1998
income to $8,325,000.

DEAD INFANT'S PARENTS ALLOWED TO SEEK DAMAGES FROM AU PAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The parents of the baby killed by British au pair
Louise Woodward will be allowed to seek punitive damages from
Woodward at a trial that is now scheduled for January.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge Thursday agreed with attorneys for Sunil and
Deborah Eappen that Woodward's 1997 conviction for involuntary
manslaughter entitles them to seek punitive damages, in addition to
compensatory damages, from Woodward in their wrongful death suit.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting the rationale advanced by the Eappens' lawyers, US
District Judge William G. Young agreed that the legal underpinnings
of a manslaughter conviction are equivalent to those alleged in the
civil suit, namely that Woodward engaged in ``willful, wanton, and
reckless conduct'' in shaking eight-month-old Matthew Eappen to
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such conduct is essential to that conviction,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Woodward had argued that the manslaughter conviction
did not encompass such conduct &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After Woodward was convicted of second-degree murder last
November, Middlesex Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel reduced the
charge to involuntary manslaughter. His action was later upheld by
the state Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court rules that punitive damages are warranted,'''' said
Young. ``But to say they're warranted does not mean that they are
awarded.''
</P>
<P>
   It will now likely be up to a jury to decide how much money to
which the Eappens are entitled. Although Young could decide the
issue without a jury, the Eappens' lawyer, Fredric L. Ellis, has
said he wants a jury and if either side wants one, then a jury will
decide the issue, Young noted.
</P>
<P>
   The judge issued a default in the case in July after Woodward
did not respond to the wrongful death suit filed by the Eappens in
June.
</P>
<P>
   She finally responded to the suit earlier this month after it
was determined that insurance coverage for the agency that placed
her with the Eappens would pay for a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Young denied a request by Woodward's attorney, John P.
Ryan, that he be given four months to conduct discovery in the
case. Ellis objected, saying that the trial was originally
scheduled for last month. He also requested that if Ryan is allowed
to depose the Eappens then he be allowed to depose Woodward, who is
now studying law in London.
</P>
<P>
   Young also warned the attorneys that he doesn't want to see them
on television discussing the case. ``I see no basis for attorneys
appearing on television for any reason...This case is not to be
tried in the press,'' he said.

LUBBOCK POLICE ADMIT `MISTAKEN IDENTITY' IN ARREST OF VIRGINIA
COACHES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lubbock, Texas, authorities Thursday admitted the controversial
arrest of two black Virginia college basketball coaches for
attempted theft resulted from ``mistaken identity'' and said no
charges would be filed.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came just hours after officials at Hampton
University _ one of the nation's most prestigious black schools _
confirmed that they had hired former O.J. Simpson defense attorney
Johnnie Cochran to investigate the Monday arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Police action also was criticized Thursday by Houston U.S.
District Judge Vanessa Gilmore, a Hampton graduate and a member of
the university's board of trustees, who called the arrests
``unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lubbock Police Chief Ken Walker expressed regret over the
arrests but insisted they had not been racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe they are guilty,'' he said of the former
suspects. ``We will not refer the case to the district attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Hampton women's basketball coach Patricia Bibbs,
48, her husband, Ezell Bibbs Jr., 46, and assistant basketball
coach Vanetta Robinson Kelso, 36, after a Lubbock woman, Elenita
Hester, reported the women had tried to engage her in a ``pigeon
drop'' scam at a Wal-Mart parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Such schemes, which often target the elderly, generally require
the victim to provide the perpetrators with cash in exchange for a
share in a fictitious found treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Lubbock city spokesman Tony Privett said the decision not to
pursue charges of attempted felony theft was made after police
reviewed security video tapes made at the Wal-Mart Supercenter.
Additionally, he said, Hester, who had positively identified Kelso
as one of the suspects, advised police Wednesday night that she was
no longer certain the coach had been involved in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Kelso, who is five months pregnant, began vomiting in the police
squad car after her arrest and was taken to a Lubbock hospital for
treatment before joining the Bibbs couple at police headquarters
for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches and Bibbs' husband were in Lubbock with members of
the Hampton, Va., university's women's basketball team for a
Tuesday game against 12th-ranked Texas Tech University. They told
authorities they had stopped at the store to buy supplies for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   The game was canceled after the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   After reports of the coaches' arrests were televised Monday
night, said Assistant District Attorney Clay Abbott, police
received a call from a second person who claimed to have been
victimized by a pigeon drop at another Wal-Mart earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   City spokesman Privett said interviews with that victim did not
incriminate the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Hampton University president William Harvey
criticized Lubbock police for failing to resolve the issue, either
by filing charges or dropping the case. He also complained that no
police reports had been filed.
</P>
<P>
   No one, he said, should be subjected to such ``degradation and
harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey said he had been in communication with Texas Tech
Chancellor John Montford about the case and that Montford had
expressed concern about the arrests. Montford was unavailable for
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Abbott said the second pigeon drop report complicated
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Police records show three officers' reports were filed within 13
hours of police receiving Hester's call.
</P>
<P>
   In the reports, Hester is quoted as saying she was accosted by
an African-American woman as she left the Wal-Mart shortly after 3
p.m. Monday. The woman showed her a purse and asked if she had lost
it.
</P>
<P>
   Hester responded she had not. A second black woman then joined
the group, and together they opened the purse to find an apparent
large sum of money and a note indicating that it had been illegally
obtained.
</P>
<P>
   As the black women suggested that the three of them split the
found money, Hester refused and drove home to summon police.
</P>
<P>
   Had the alleged pigeon drop been completed, police said, the
victim ultimately would have been encouraged to provide ``good
faith'' money until the found currency could be divided. The
thieves then would have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott admitted that the case might have been difficult to
prosecute because Hester departed before she was asked for money.
</P>
<P>
   Privett said police are continuing to look for suspects in the
two crimes.

CLINTON HAILS JAPAN'S EFFORTS TO SOLVE FISCAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Launching &UR;  &LR; a five-day Asian trip, President Clinton
brought a message of hope to Japan about its crucial role in
resolving the Asian financial crisis Thursday, while escaping the
glare of the impeachment hearings back home.
</P>
<P>
   In marked contrast to the tough talk that pundits had expected _
and that Vice President Al Gore delivered at an Asian summit on
Monday _ the president praised Japanese leaders for new efforts to
stimulate the economy and to bail out sick banks, and refrained
from lecturing them on their failings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton specifically lauded Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi for
making ``difficult decisions to overcome your own economic
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The path back to growth and stability will require your
continued leadership, but we hope to work with you every step of
the way,'' the president said at a banquet in a baroque hall in
Akasaka Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has become a lightning rod for criticism from other Asian
nations in desperate need of a strong economy to lift them out of
recession. Tokyo bristles at the United States, which has berated
Japan publicly, saying it had not adequately addressed its economic
ills. The talks could have been doomed before they began had
Clinton set a harsher tone last night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's style highlights a good cop/bad cop approach to
relations with Asian nations that seems to have emerged within his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   At the Asian Pacific Economic Conference in Kuala Lumpur, Gore
played the hectoring enforcer, admonishing Asian leaders at a
dinner to end ``corruption and cronyism.'' And the US trade
representative, Charlene Barshefsky, accused Japan of trying to
bribe countries to scuttle a trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   But while his deputies talk tough about trade, human rights and
economic reform, aides say that Clinton uses his friendships with
leaders to apply discreet pressure. Even if the message is the
same, Clinton has a more palatable manner that disarmed even the
Chinese when he talked about human rights in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if these contrasting approaches produce
the desired results with Japan. Tokyo is under severe domestic
pressure to protect vested interests at the same time that it faces
a chorus of foreign voices demanding that it reshape its economic
system immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his focus on economic matters, Clinton could not flee
the scandal dogging him at home. In a televised ``town meeting,'' a
polite housewife from Osaka told Clinton she could not forgive her
husband if he had an affair. She asked the president how he
apologized to the First Lady and Chelsea _ and if they forgave him.
</P>
<P>
   Looking somber and pained, Clinton replied, ``Well, I did it in
a direct and straightforward manner and I believe they did, yes.
But that's really a question you could ask them better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   In this courteous society where one would never make a guest
uncomfortable, Clinton's questioner looked embarrassed and bowed
several times. The moderator cut away saying, ``Thank you very
much...Let's change the topic now.''
</P>
<P>
   The town meeting provided an opportunity for Clinton to take his
message of free trade directly to the Japanese public. Such a
format is unknown to Japanese, who are accustomed to stiff,
inaccessible politicians, and one that allows Clinton to exploit
his warmth and political gifts.
</P>
<P>
   As in a similar event in Beijing, where he fielded hostile
questions on human rights, Tibet and the future of Taiwan, Clinton
addressed issues sensitive to the Japanese such as trade
liberalization, the US military presence there, and the risks to
Japan of the closer relations between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   One man who was worried about American pressure to open Japanese
markets asked Clinton if he owns Japanese products. Clinton replied
that he owns some televisions made in Japan, and that the United
States is fighting protectionist sentiment to keep its markets
open.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's trade surplus with the US grew 32 percent last month
compared to a year earlier, according to the Japanese Finance
Ministry. It will rise even more as Japan exports more automobiles
to the US to offset lost sales in recession-hit Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Questioners were curious about everything from how often Clinton
dines with his wife (whenever they are both in town, or about four
times a week) to his favorite food (chicken enchiladas).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton buoyed a depressed Japanese public last night with more
hope about recovery than their own leaders have given them lately.
Clinton defended Obuchi, saying he has not been in office long
enough yet to effect change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret you have the present economic challenges you have,
but we don't think you should be too pessimistic about the
future,'' Clinton said. ``In the last 50 years, no country has
demonstrated the capacity to change more than Japan...So don't be
discouraged, but do be determined. That would be the advice of a
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials said new tax cuts were being considered that
would significantly increase a $196 billion stimulus package
announced Tuesday.

JAPAN'S GOVERNING PARTY FORMS COALITION WITH RIVAL GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Politics took a turn to the usual here Thursday as the
governing Liberal Democratic Party opted for political expedience
and agreed to form a coalition government with its archenemy,
Ichiro Ozawa, and his Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance will strengthen the governing party's sway in
Parliament, mollify its restive hard-liners and give it sure
support in coming budget debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy that we have agreed to work together on various
policies with strong cooperation in the parliamentary session and
on the 1999 budget discussion,'' said Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi,
who signed the deal with Ozawa after three-and-a-half hours of
talks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement falls short of giving the Liberal Democrats a
majority in the upper house and may drive a wedge between the
conservative and liberal wings of the party.
</P>
<P>
   There was some concern that intra-party bickering might further
destabilize the already splintered Liberal Democrats and divert
their attention at a time when the country faces the most severe
downturn in the economy since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will simply complicate the political
decision-making process and waste time,'' said Takeshi Sasaki, a
political science professor at Tokyo University.
</P>
<P>
   The currency market, however, took the alliance as a sign that
government affairs would move more smoothly. The yen gained against
the dollar immediately after the alliance was announced.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Ozawa, the agreement is a stunning coup. A defector from the
governing party, he was threatened with political obscurity after
his second attempt to form an opposition party fell apart in
December.
</P>
<P>
   But he has maneuvered his way back into the spotlight and into
power. ``Ozawa is a player once again,'' said John Neuffer, a
senior analyst at the Mitsui Marine Research Center. ``The downside
is that if you look at other parties that have gotten close to the
LDP in recent years, they've not ended up in the best shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Naoto Kan, leader of the Democratic Party, Japan's largest
opposition party, declared the alliance a mortal blow to the
Liberal Party Ozawa headed. ``This shows the defeat of the Liberal
Party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Liberals had little to lose. Widely expected to lose
several seats in the next election, the fractious party will now
gain at least one Cabinet seat after the coming special session of
Parliament closes in December, and the governing party has agreed
to adopt many of its policies, although not its proposal to suspend
the unpopular national sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   What the Liberal Democrats win from the coalition, other than
the promise of Liberal Party support in the session of Parliament
scheduled to begin Nov. 27, is less obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democrats have been forced to govern by coalition
since Ozawa defected in 1993. It will now be able to count on 12
more votes in the upper house _ although that will still leave it
11 short of a majority _ and an additional 35 votes in the lower
house, where it already has a majority with 262 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond additional troops, the coalition will help rein in the
governing party's unruly right wing, led by Seiroku Kajiyama and
Shizuka Kamei, who have created a sort of outspoken internal
opposition in the party by splitting from their factions after
Obuchi became prime minister in August.
</P>
<P>
   The two have been pushing an alliance with Ozawa and Komeito,
another opposition party backed by a large lay Buddhist sect. The
governing party agreed to issue 700 billion yen ($5.8 billion)
worth of shopping coupons to win the cooperation of Komeito, which
has 24 seats in the upper house. Komeito's younger members refuse
to approve a full-fledged alliance with the Liberal Democrats, but
the shopping coupon plan is expected to help win their support in
Parliament if not at the electoral level.
</P>
<P>
   But as the coalition embraces the right-wing forces, it pushes
away other influential party members led by Koichi Kato, the former
secretary general of the party; Taku Yamasaki, the former chairman
of the party's Policy Research Council, and Junichiro Koizumi, the
former minister for health and welfare who ran against Obuchi and
Kajiyama for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Before he defected from the party, Ozawa was part of a faction
opposed to the one Kato belongs to. Kato and his allies evidently
fear that Obuchi's ascent will mean less power for them at a time
when Kato is seeking a greater leadership role in the party.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Thursday night Kato questioned whether the party's rank
and file would support the deal. ``They should have done it through
partywide discussions,'' he said. ``It was so abrupt.''

PARIS BOURSE TO JOIN MOVE TOWARD PAN-EUROPE STOCK MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALAN COWELL   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Struggling to avoid being sidelined in the
Continent-wide equities market promised by Europe's
soon-to-be-introduced single currency, French authorities said
Thursday that the Paris stock exchange would join an alliance
between London and Frankfurt that is seen as the precursor of a
pan-European market.
</P>
<P>
   The Bourse in Paris also announced that it would play host to a
meeting Nov. 27 of nine other European exchanges to discuss ``the
steps and conditions needed to create a unifying and competitive
pan-European equity market.''
</P>
<P>
   The two announcements show how the introduction of the currency,
the euro, is reshaping Europe's financial landscape, requiring
Europeans to think in Continental rather than national terms in
finance and business.
</P>
<P>
   And it suggested that exchange authorities in Paris, ruffled by
the announcement in July of a ``strategic alliance'' between the
London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt, had not
only abandoned an effort to set up a rival market but were also
seeking to gain the initiative by organizing the Nov. 27 gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Some doubt remained, however, about the timing and
technicalities of the French entry into the alliance. Foreign
Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, ``Paris is joining this
alliance with the creation from January 1999 of a joint company.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   However, officials in London and Frankfurt _ who welcomed the
idea in principle _ declined to say whether the timing and the
arrangements were as far advanced as Strauss-Kahn implied. ``I'm
afraid I can't confirm anything like that,'' a spokeswoman at the
London Stock Exchange said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appearances are well ahead of the reality at this point,''
said an American banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, the notion of a Europe-wide exchange raises
technical questions about the compatibility not just of trading
systems but also of the regulations governing stock market
operations in the countries that will use the euro beginning in
January. That has led some analysts to forecast that a pan-European
exchange could not be up and running before 2000. ``There are an
awful lot of issues to be resolved,'' the American banker said.
</P>
<P>
   The euro is to be introduced for electronic trading of equities,
bonds and futures and for intergovernmental transfers. Notes and
coins _ the pocket money that shoppers and travelers will carry _
will be introduced only in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the currency will group 11 European nations in a euro
zone, leaving Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece on the outside.
With its concentration of banking and trading, however, London is
expected to continue as the main market center.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect has heightened pressure for consolidation among
exchanges. Stock market officials in Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam and
Brussels have indicated they would be interested in joining the
London-Frankfurt alliance, which will initially create a single
point of liquidity for trading in British and German blue-chip
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The London exchange estimates that a pan-European stock exchange
would group together companies with a market capitalization of $5.5
trillion, compared with $8.7 trillion on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris Bourse, the third largest of the European exchanges
and the last major holdout toward a pan-European market, said that
it had also invited officials from exchanges in Zurich and
Stockholm to attend the Nov. 27 meeting. A spokeswoman said
officials from the London Stock Exchange would be at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the
International Petroleum Exchange here acknowledged that they were
considering a merger that would bring together the two biggest
energy futures markets. Discussions began in July, and the
exchanges have formed a working group to study a merger. They
already cooperate in the development of a system intended to
coordinate after-hours electronic trading.

PATRIOTS HAVE MIXED REACTION TO TEAM'S POTENTIAL MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ They came back to work Thursday, ready to
talk about whom they would be playing.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The question of the day concerned where they would be playing.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Dolphins visit Foxboro Stadium Monday night for a
crucial AFC East game, but that has been dwarfed by the prospect of
the Patriots leaving Foxboro Stadium for Hartford in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the announcement that owner Bob Kraft has reached
a tentative deal to relocate New England's NFL team to the
Connecticut capital, the general reaction of the players was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still the Patriots,'' said rookie fullback Chris Floyd.
``Our main goal is to win football games.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said Kraft's 2001 Space Odyssey was not the primary topic
in the morning meetings. ``The main focus of attention is on
winning a game right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the veterans, who had more of a sense of history
concerning the courtship involved in new stadium proposals, had a
different perspective. ``I'm not sure it's going to make a big
difference to me,'' said offensive tackle Bruce Armstrong. ``I've
got two more years left on my contract. By 2001, who knows where
I'll be?''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong did concede there would be a sense of loss if the
Patriots leave Greater Boston. ``You wonder what it takes to get
things done,'' he said during a lunch break. ``Look around at the
rest of the league. Take Tampa, for example. They're tearing down a
stadium that's better than the one we have now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that no one really takes things seriously until it's
too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the entire situation is an abstract to the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter,'' said quarterback Drew Bledsoe.
``Look, this move will have very little effect on a high percentage
on this team. The turnover rate in this league is so high, a large
percentage of guys on this team won't make the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen for a few years. So the only real
effect on this team will be answering the questions about it. We'll
deal with that and try to win some games.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said the news did not come as a huge surprise. ``We all
knew at some point something was going to happen,'' he said. ``It
became very obvious it wasn't going to happen here. So here we
go.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is the Patriots will be lame ducks in Foxboro
Stadium for two years, beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   How will the fans react?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an interesting question,'' said Armstrong. ``I'm not
really sure. I think if we're playing well, they'll still support
us. If we aren't, they won't.''

A HALLMARK EVENING OF FEAR AND FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for times and channels.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hallmark has it covered on Sunday, almost like having a
Christmas card and a birthday card in the same envelope.
</P>
<P>
   Its ``Hall of Fame'' franchise checks in for the holiday season
with ``Saint Maybe,'' a warm and typically low-concept movie on
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark Entertainment, the company's separate movie production
wing, goes high-concept on ABC with Christopher Reeve starring in a
remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 thriller ``Rear Window.''
</P>
<P>
   So Hallmark competes with itself. Someone got careless, a
Hallmark spokeswoman explained. It wasn't supposed to happen this
way.
</P>
<P>
   But the real upshot is that viewers are either well served by
two good TV movies or poorly served by the rarity of two decent
movies thrown against each other.
</P>
<P>
   At least they're different, and how.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rear Window'' is the bigger surprise because, (set
ital)goldurnit,(end ital) no one is supposed to improve on the
master. Sure enough, this TV version doesn't improve on the
Hitchcock original. But it doesn't disgrace itself, either.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Jeff Bleckner, the new ``Rear Window'' benefits from
lush production values and from a razor script by Eric Overmyer and
Larry Gross.
</P>
<P>
   One or both of the scriptwriters has an especially deft touch
for dialogue. It's smart and sardonic, fitting perfectly with
Reeve's take on the main character, Jason Kemp, an architect who's
a quadriplegic, paralyzed below the neck, as the result of a car
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve plays him as a sophisticated man with a wicked sense of
humor. When a willowy young architect (Daryl Hannah) begins to fall
for him, he tells her, ``I'm damaged goods. Contents broken during
handling and shipping.'' The line is at once sorrowful and barbed.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's Daryl Hannah in, more or less, the role Grace Kelly,
no less, played in the old movie. A more elegant actress, even if
lesser known, would have been better. But it's only a quibble.
</P>
<P>
   The story has been updated. Released from the hospital, Reeve
takes up quarters in a sort of high-tech gulch where brick offices
are topped by lofts.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he becomes what he calls ``Citizen Voyeur,'' spying from
his wheelchair on the loft dwellers across the way.
</P>
<P>
   One is a quarrelsome sculptor (Ritchie Coster) who is cheating
on his alcoholic wife. When suddenly there is no wife, Reeve's
character suspects murder and decides to trip up the killer.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hitchcock movie, Jimmy Stewart played a photographer
mending from a broken leg. This movie has something inherently more
suspenseful going for it; Jason Kemp can defend himself with only
his wits. That difference works to the advantage of the TV movie
until the cat-and-mouse game ends and the killer penetrates Kemp's
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The climax is, alas, a letdown, but not enough to wreck an
exceptionally well-made television movie.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, third billing goes to Robert Forster (``Medium
Cool,'' ``Jackie Brown''), who plays a sympathetic police
detective.
</P>
<P>
   And, 10 points for all who know what actor played the murderer
in the Hitchcock movie. (set ital)Bzzzz.(end ital) Time's up.
Raymond Burr.
</P>
<P>
   I liked ``Rear Window'' well enough to hope, ever so slightly,
that ``Saint Maybe'' would be a dud and the choice would be easy.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Saint Maybe,'' based on the Anne Tyler novel, is another
``Hall of Fame'' example of a life-affirming, cockle-warming movie
you can watch with three hankies and at least half a brain.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a chance to enjoy two delicious actresses. It's fun to
watch Mary-Louise Parker seduce the camera and Blythe Danner merge
gracefully with the camera. Two approaches, two delights.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in North Carolina, the movie begins in the mid-1960s and
dwells upon Ian Bedloe (Thomas McCarthy), a teenager whose older
brother Danny (Jeffrey Nordling) marries a mysterious divorcee
(Parker) with two children. Soon _ too soon, Ian notices _ a third
is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   After a set of tragedies, for which Ian blames himself, the
children are orphaned. And that prompts Ian, at the age of 19, to
make a decision that will alter his life.
</P>
<P>
   The exquisite Danner plays Bee Bedloe, mother of Ian and Danny,
and Edward Herrmann is his solid self as Doug Bedloe, Bee's husband
and the boys' father.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Michael Pressman from a script by Robert Lenski,
``Saint Maybe'' plays like an interesting blend of Anne Tyler and
Frank Capra.
</P>
<P>
   It's quirky, it's partly comedic, it meanders, and it's apt to
end at any time. Or maybe no time at all. Strangely enough, that's
just the type of movie that's been scoring rating points for
Hallmark and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   You won't feel the need to hose yourself off after watching
``Saint Maybe.'' Gosh, could that be why these movies succeed?

DEAD INFANT'S PARENTS ALLOWED TO SEEK DAMAGES FROM AU PAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The parents of the baby killed by British au pair
Louise Woodward will be allowed to seek punitive damages from
Woodward at a trial that is now scheduled for January.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge Thursday agreed with attorneys for Sunil and
Deborah Eappen that Woodward's 1997 conviction for involuntary
manslaughter entitles them to seek punitive damages, in addition to
compensatory damages, from Woodward in their wrongful death suit.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting the rationale advanced by the Eappens' lawyers, US
District Judge William G. Young agreed that the legal underpinnings
of a manslaughter conviction are equivalent to those alleged in the
civil suit, namely that Woodward engaged in ``willful, wanton, and
reckless conduct'' in shaking eight-month-old Matthew Eappen to
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such conduct is essential to that conviction,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Woodward had argued that the manslaughter conviction
did not encompass such conduct &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After Woodward was convicted of second-degree murder last
November, Middlesex Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel reduced the
charge to involuntary manslaughter. His action was later upheld by
the state Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court rules that punitive damages are warranted,'''' said
Young. ``But to say they're warranted does not mean that they are
awarded.''
</P>
<P>
   It will now likely be up to a jury to decide how much money to
which the Eappens are entitled. Although Young could decide the
issue without a jury, the Eappens' lawyer, Fredric L. Ellis, has
said he wants a jury and if either side wants one, then a jury will
decide the issue, Young noted.
</P>
<P>
   The judge issued a default in the case in July after Woodward
did not respond to the wrongful death suit filed by the Eappens in
June.
</P>
<P>
   She finally responded to the suit earlier this month after it
was determined that insurance coverage for the agency that placed
her with the Eappens would pay for a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Young denied a request by Woodward's attorney, John P.
Ryan, that he be given four months to conduct discovery in the
case. Ellis objected, saying that the trial was originally
scheduled for last month. He also requested that if Ryan is allowed
to depose the Eappens then he be allowed to depose Woodward, who is
now studying law in London.
</P>
<P>
   Young also warned the attorneys that he doesn't want to see them
on television discussing the case. ``I see no basis for attorneys
appearing on television for any reason...This case is not to be
tried in the press,'' he said.

A CONTEST AMONG TITANS, WITH NO SURE OUTCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a brisk November afternoon, the Week of the
Voices came to a close. Presidential consort Monica S. Lewinsky and
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr _ public figures and yet
figures of mystery _ finally have been heard.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Starr, demonized by his opponents as a zealot and
dismissed by the public as a voyeur, spoke for himself in the
solemn setting of a House impeachment hearing. In a tone that was
whispery, at a pace that was measured, in language that was
reasonable, he discussed the most incendiary charges against the
nation's chief executive _ diversion, deception, abuse of power,
misuse of government officials, lies and breach of trust _ in a
simple and powerful way.
</P>
<P>
   And after hours of lawyerly testimony and questioning by
lawmakers, he left the Congress with three sentences that define
the politics and public discussion of the last 10 months _ and the
conundrum the House faces as it races to complete the impeachment
process by year's end:
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's intimate relationship with a subordinate
employee was transformed. It was transformed into an unlawful
effort to thwart the judicial process. This was no longer an issue
of private conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   In a cramped hearing room, beneath 18-foot ceilings and under
the steady glare from an oversized portrait of Watergate hero Peter
J. Rodino, the ancient Constitutional process of impeachment
grinded into operation again Thursday for the first time in 24
years _ and as the gears creaked, it became increasingly clear that
this was a rare moment of awe and suspense in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Not because facts were unearthed. Not because a verdict seemed
near. Not because the strategies were new.
</P>
<P>
   But because in a city where almost every event is scripted,
every remark rehearsed and every outcome planned in advance, no one
involved in perhaps the somberest proceeding contemplated by the
Framers had even the slightest notion of how the Congress is going
to dispose of the yearlong drama of the president and the intern _
and of the Constitutional crisis their furtive friendship and
corridor trysts have prompted.
</P>
<P>
   This was a moment when lawmakers postured and preened, battled
and bickered _ and when it was impossible to suppress the thought
that the principals at the hearing, once so confident of their
roles and their resolve, were watching helplessly as the process
hurled out of their control.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this was no civics set-piece for the ages. For if the
frailty of the human will lies at the heart of the Lewinsky matter,
in 2138 Rayburn House Office Building the frailty of the human
condition was on full display.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most serious thing I've done here,'' said
Representative Bill Jenkins, the Tennessee Republican. ``It gets
beyond serious to somber.''
</P>
<P>
   On television, the proceedings may indeed have seemed grand and
grave. But in the chamber itself, the men and women gathered to
hear Starr and to rule on his findings seemed brittle in the face
of their burden. There was partisan predictability on both sides of
the dais; short speeches displaced sharp questions. And despite the
mountains of documents and evidence at their disposal _ and all of
ours _ almost no one had the stomache to fence about the facts.
</P>
<P>
   This was a day when the key actors seemed to grow smaller by the
hour, overshadowed by their historic mission. All save Starr _ who
may have grown a bit in public estimation with his show of
superhuman unflappability.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most unpopular figures in American life, Starr had
nowhere to go but up. For him, Thursday might have been the best
day of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   What was true of the actors, was also true of the stage they
were on. On television the chamber seemed cavernous, almost like a
coliseum built for the clash of warriors. Inside the wooden doors
the room seemed minute, almost like a small parish basement used
for community meetings where the familiar characters gather to
fight Wal-Mart from building at the interstate exit or to challenge
a saloonkeeper proposing to expand his parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   On television there appeared the tableau that seemed etched for
history: the solemn row of the president's men, the two banks of
lawmakers sitting behind their black nameplates, the kind of
slouches that in any other setting would be cited for bad posture
and bad manners, the elbow of the star witness held at a precise
90-degree angle. But in the hearing room there was no air of
majesty _ just a jumble of paper, a pasta pile of television cables
and a few rows of chairs that gave their occupants _ witnesses to
an interrogation of a witness _ the feel of being in the middle
seat of a transcontinental flight in coach.
</P>
<P>
   All day long the reluctant, the defiant and the ambivalent
battled, and though the day seemed more like a scene from Our Town
than a setting for Constitutional precedent, at the heart of the
proceedings were the perplexing questions of American civic life
that the Lewinsky affair brought to the surface: clashes about the
rights of privacy given to public people; questions about the
relationship between intimate acts and civic performance; disputes
about the responsibility of the most powerful to live by the rules
that apply to the merest; wrangles about whether the president
should set an example _ or be made an example of.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers and the independent counsel talked about the rules
of evidence and the meaning of precedent, but impeachment is a
political process and none of the evidence or precedents speak as
loudly election returns. This month the verdict of the election
returns was unmistakable, and now congressional leaders, working
offstage from the impeachment hearings, are struggling to find a
resolution short of impeaching a president who was elected twice by
the people and supported repeatedly by them in public-opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
   That very effort exposed the partisan tensions that have never
been far from the surface of the Clinton scandal. The proceedings
opened, in fact, with partisan wrangling over just how they should
be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided to do exactly what they decided to do in the
first place,'' said Representative Steven R. Rothman, a Democrat
from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   There were no surprises in the evidence offered, in the
arguments put forward, in the questions asked. The only surprise
was the mien and mettle of Starr himself. He hewed to his prepared
text, but not to the expectations. His report was fiery, but he was
cool. His critics paint him as a man who gallups to conclusions,
but even they were astonished at how slowly he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   So slowly, in fact, that Representative Barney Frank, the
Massachusetts Democrat, calculated that he had time to duck out of
the morning proceedings for a quick work-out in the House Gym.
There he encountered former Representative Sonny Montgomery, a
Mississippi Democrat whose leisurely speaking style is the stuff of
legend. ``I asked him if he was Starr's voice coach,'' Frank said.
``I've never heard a guy from the North talk like a Southern guy
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   And so now the plot enters its final phase. The voters have
spoken. Monica Lewinsky has spoken. Kenneth Starr has spoken. The
nation and history await the verdict of the House.

SMALLER STATE SURPLUS THAN EXPECTED MAY LIMIT BUSH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's campaign promises of $2
billion in property tax cuts plus $1.6 billion in public school
initiatives got a whole lot more difficult to accomplish Thursday
after the Legislative Budget Board said lawmakers would have only
about $2 billion total to fund new programs in 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have been fantasizing for months about having a
projected $6.3 billion in surplus funds and new money to spend next
session. That figure included a projected budget surplus of $3.7
billion plus additional revenues from a growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Key state officials still expect to see a surplus when the
budget cycle ends Aug. 31, 1999, and LBB members said economic
growth in 2000-01 would generate $44.6 billion, or $5.3 billion
more than the current budget cycle, in undedicated taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But essentially, because of state constitutional spending caps,
lawmakers are likely to have more money than they can legally
spend.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Rob Junell, D-San Angelo and chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, said that spending caps, plus projected
growth in required government spending, whittle the amount that
lawmakers will have for discretionary spending to $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This constitutional provision is there for a purpose,'' said
Junell, who also is a member of the budget board. ``This is one of
the few times _ the first time, I guess, since I've been in the
Legislature _ where we're in danger of busting the cap. I think it
shows this provision is doing what it's intended to do and that is,
even if you've got the money you can't go spend it all.''
</P>
<P>
   While the undedicated tax revenues, primarily from sales taxes,
represent about 65 percent of state revenue, most of the other
revenues are earmarked for specific state programs.
</P>
<P>
   Junell's comments came as the LBB began its biennial
budget-writing process by adopting Comptroller John Sharp's
projections that the Texas economy will grow by 13.4 percent in
2000-01.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a bouquet of roses out here, but there are some
thorns on the stems,'' said Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, who chairs the
LBB.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Constitution prohibits deficit spending and limits
increased spending to the same rate as the projected economic
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Including the projected surplus in the 2000-01 budget would
exceed the constitutional spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Junell said that $3.3 billion of the $5.3 billion in additional
undedicated tax revenues will be needed to pay for increased public
school enrollment, equalized school funding programs, operating
expenses for new prisons and tuition revenue bonds that will come
due in the next two-year budget cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said the governor
sees no difficulties with the Legislature being able to fund his
economic and education proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush's budget proposal is conservative, responsible and
balanced,'' Hughes said. ``It was designed to fit within the
constitutional spending limit and it does, unlike other
(politicians), who were making promises they could not fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Junell and state Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo and another LBB
member, said they would not rule out the possibility of tax relief,
but the spending cap will make it more difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of variables in here,'' Junell said. ``There's
lots of things you (could) restructure in here. The real issue is
... we're going to have to be clever in how we do (property tax
relief) or we're going to use up all the remaining dollars in doing
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proper question is can you do property tax relief and not
have it affect the constitutional spending limit,'' he added. ``The
answer is `yes,' but I don't know the details. We're going to have
to sit down and figure that out. We're going to have to be a little
more clever and creative than we were last session.''
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said one possibility is using tobacco lawsuit settlement
money to fund some programs, thereby freeing general revenue funds
for other uses. The settlement funds were the result of the state's
lawsuit against tobacco companies for reimbursement for health care
costs to treat smoking-related diseases. They are not subject to
the spending cap because they are not tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Junell, however, said he plans to file legislation to have most
of the tobacco funds placed in a permanent endowment, using the
interest off of the account to fund programs. Since the $17 billion
settlement is to be paid out over 25 years, Junell said it would
take a while for any endowment to produce a large amount of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic that we're still going to be able to accomplish
the initiative that the governor has laid out,'' Bivins said. ``As
you heard, the limitation that we have applies to about 65 percent
or 66 percent of the revenue stream that the state has. There are
other revenues that are not limited'' by the constitutional
spending limit.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. (Star) denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings
and running times are in parentheses. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing:
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN HISTORY X,' starring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.
Directed by Tony Kaye (R, 118 minutes). Flawed but gut-slugging,
renounced by its director yet still a showcase for his effective,
in-your-face style, this story of a neo-Nazi skinhead who develops
a heart of gold presses every possible hot button.
</P>
<P>
   And its toughest images stick even when its lurid
self-aggrandizing, presented in the ersatz poetic idiom of videos
and commercials, spins out of control. In a show of De Niro-like
fury and versatility, Norton plays a savage, racist killer who
learns the error of his ways through simple-minded but brutally
effective plot devices, and trying to protect his younger brother (
Furlong). Hotheaded and sensationalistic, but startlingly tough.
(Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) `BELOVED,' starring Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie
Newton and Kimberly Elise. Directed by Jonathan Demme (R, 172
minutes). A transfixing, deeply felt adaptation of Toni Morrison's
novel, with all the complexity (and occasional opacity) that
entails. Taking on the most enticing yet daunting job of literary
adaptation since ``The English Patient,'' Jonathan Demme succeeds
in bringing the novel's pulse to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Though it begins too slowly and literally, this daring effort
escalates into a gripping, imaginative film that mixes memories of
slavery with the occult and that isn't quite like any other. Its
linchpin, Ms. Winfrey, is more often a person acting than an
intuitive actress. But she plays her character, a onetime slave
literally haunted by her past, with enough presence to hold the
film together. The other major performances are extraordinary,
especially Ms. Newton's in the bizarre title role. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) `THE CELEBRATION,' directed by Thomas Vinterberg (R, 100
minutes). Working under a set of self-imposed restrictions that are
meant to return filmmaking to a fundamental honesty, this Danish
director shows off dazzling ingenuity. The story of a family
reunion that becomes a psyche-bashing blowout is told with a
hand-held camera, without any special lighting or props or sound,
and the effect is invigorating rather than austere.
</P>
<P>
   Imaginative angles, nimble editing and agile camera work keep
the film spinning as a large Danish cast makes the festivities seem
utterly real. The central drama is Shakespeare for the tell-all
age, as a patriarch is haunted by past sins and vengeful children.
``It is quite a job being toastmaster tonight,'' says one
partygoer, putting it mildly. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) `THE CRUISE,' starring Timothy (Speed) Levitch. Directed
and produced by Bennett Miller (not rated; 76 minutes). Levitch,
the loquacious subject of Miller's fascinating documentary, is a
Manhattan tour-bus guide who happens also to be a sidewalk
philosopher, improvisatory poet and walking encyclopedia of New
York City history. More than anything, he is a free spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Although he can be irritating at times, Levitch is a true
original, an erudite, intellectual version of a classic
motormouthed New York cabby. As he interweaves his personal story
between spiels about New York City landmarks, the city (beautifully
photographed in black and white) seems to come as alive as the man
describing it. (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) `DANCING AT LUGHNASA,' starring Meryl Streep, Brid
Brennan, Michael Gambon and Kathy Burke. Directed by Pat O'Connor
(PG, 94 minutes). Ms. Streep is grand, as are the other principals
here, in an actors' heyday of a film adapted from Brian Friel's
delicate play. And if O'Connor has lost some of the play's
intensity by opening it up so overwhelmingly, he's also gained a
good deal in the way of lovely Irish scenery and quaint rural
charm.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1936, the story presents a family of five unmarried
sisters on the brink of change and revolves around the return of
their gently eccentric brother from many years' missionary work in
Africa. Rather than major dramatic events, this beguilingly
atmospheric film observes the sea changes that alter these
characters' lives. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ELIZABETH,' starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey
Rush and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124
minutes). In this lurid costume drama depicting Queen Elizabeth I
as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms. Blanchett plays the monarch
as if her principal responsibilities were being bejeweled,
selecting consorts and saying ``Leave us!'' with a wave of the
hand.
</P>
<P>
   For all its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant
strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, it's historical drama for
those whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue. Intent on
spectacle, complete with burning at the stake and one dance scene
reminiscent of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' it winds up imagining the
queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern woman, afflicted by a
super-intense case of having it all. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) `GODS AND MONSTERS,' starring Ian McKellen and Brendan
Fraser. Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a
performance that well deserves to be remembered at the end of the
year, McKellen becomes the deliciously urbane James Whale, playing
the gay ``Frankenstein'' director late in life. Shaken by the
aftereffects of a mild stroke, this Whale finds his past coming
back to greet him just as the present offers new fascination, in
the Adonis-like form of the gardener (Fraser, also fine) whom Whale
finds mowing his lawn.
</P>
<P>
   This beautifully acted, witty and heart-tugging film, from a
Christopher Bram book, imagines what Whale's final days may have
been like while shaping a splendid character study and a droll
portrait of closeted gay Hollywood. Lynn Redgrave provides ballast
and comic relief as Whale's perpetually scandalized housekeeper.
(Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) `HAPPINESS,' starring Jane Adams and Dylan Baker.
Directed by Todd Solondz (not rated; 135 minutes). In a much bigger
film than his ``Welcome to the Doll House,'' this audacious,
deadpan filmmaker explores loneliness in his murderously funny
fashion. Outrageous touches _ none more so than its title _ come
easily to ``Happiness,'' and so do the dark secrets that would
surely have brought it an NC-17 rating.
</P>
<P>
   No point in cataloguing this film's perverse details: what
emerges most clearly is a ruthless yet tender portrait of suburban
characters seeking romance, captured with enough acid precision to
make this a ``Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice'' for totally
dysfunctional times. Ms. Adams plays the dartboard in a
three-sister family with hilarious tremulousness. Baker's gutsy
portrayal of a bland-seeming pederast who is also a respected
doctor and a loving father is impossible to forget. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,' directed by and starring Roberto
Benigni (PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to
find humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his
risk pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly
entertaining as its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido
who jokes his way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Daring also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks
with a more somber second act, Benigni avoids all traces of the
maudlin and effectively creates a situation in which comedy is
courage. In this unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines
as a father whose fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and
no fear. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `LIVING OUT LOUD,' starring Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito and Queen
Latifah. Directed by Richard LaGravenese (R, 102 minutes). Making
his directorial debut, this sensitive screenwriter remains very
much a writer, constructing a talky, introspective character study
laced with flights of musical fantasy. Ms. Hunter stiffly but
passionately plays a newly divorced woman trying to reinvent her
life. DeVito is warmly credible as a lonely elevator man who cares
for her. Queen Latifah is the film's most attention-getting figure,
in the small but glamorous role of a torchy nightclub singer.
Would-be Chekhovian touches abound in this story of lonely people,
but they don't make it jell. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MEET JOE BLACK,' starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Claire
Forlani. Directed by Martin Brest (PG-13, 170 minutes). Hopkins
zestily plays a noble tycoon in this otherwise somnolent,
emotion-free, nearly three-hour (!) weepie. And Pitt appears
blankly as Death with blond highlights, serving as a kind of
personal afterlife trainer to the tycoon, whose number is up. Ms.
Forlani plays the big man's beautiful daughter in a story based on
``Death Takes a Holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   In a suffocatingly lavish film that cries out for a trip to the
cutting room, virtually every character is allowed to overstay his
or her welcome, with Pitt especially diminished by the
watching-paint-dry pace. The story drags on so slowly that there's
room for a subplot about party planning, and several scenes
establish how much Death loves peanut butter. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PLEASANTVILLE,' starring Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan
Allen, William H. Macy and Jeff Daniels. Directed by Gary Ross
(PG-13, 116 minutes). This cleverly executed fantasy, with a
back-to-the-future trip into the small-town, squeaky-clean paradise
of a 1950s television show, tends toward the black and white,
visually and otherwise. The missionary zeal with which teen-agers
from the 90s try to awaken benighted 50s types from their slumber
is an attitude that wears thin.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime there are witty tricks integrating color
into black-and-white images, and nice little touches abound. The
cast is both poignant and amusing, with Ms. Allen especially
touching as a prefeminist housewife who's the prime recipient of
'90s hindsight. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIEGE,' starring Denzel Washington, Annette Bening and
Bruce Willis. Directed by Edward Zwick (R, 109 minutes). This
thriller about Arab terrorists in New York City starts out in
crisply efficient style, then evolves into a speechifying
consideration of civil liberties and constitutional rights. The FBI
( Washington, bringing teasing charm to an officious role), the CIA
(Ms. Bening as one brusque Mata Hari) and the military ( Willis,
sneering evilly) all lock horns in a story that eventually sees New
York under martial law. (Inexplicably, the city's mayor doesn't
weigh in about this.)
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay is talky and carefully evenhanded. It's much less
forceful than the film's salacious images of terrorism and Arab
villains. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) `VELVET GOLDMINE,' starring Ewan McGregor, Jonathan Rhys
Meyers, Christian Bale and Toni Collette. Directed by Todd Haynes
(R, 117 minutes). This dazzlingly surreal film reimagines the
glam-rock 70s as a brave new world of electrifying theatricality
and sexual possibility. And it offers a celestial ``Here's looking
at you, kid'' to the era's British pop flamboyance in general and
to David Bowie's chameleon heyday in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes (``Safe''), a deeply serious yet wildly experimental
stylist, draws on influences from Ken Russell to ``Citizen Kane''
to Fassbinder and winds up telling his neo-psychedelic story the
way operas do: blazing with exquisite yet abstract passions, and
with quite a lot to look at on the side. An interest in its subject
matter isn't a prerequisite for penetrating the nostalgic world of
``Velvet Goldmine,'' but it helps. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WATERBOY,' starring Adam Sandler, Kathy Bates and Fairuza
Balk. Directed by Frank Coraci (PG-13, 91 minutes). The team behind
``The Wedding Singer'' looks like honorary Farrelly brothers with a
comedy that, like ``There's Something About Mary,'' is both
cheerfully outlandish and genuinely endearing. Sandler plays an
``amazing 31-year-old freshman'' who morphs from ``water
distribution engineer'' to sports hero, and he succeeds in doing to
football whatever he did to golf in ``Happy Gilmore.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot more innocence to his happy-idiot antics here than
there is in many a film made for children. Ms. Bates is a great
hoot as the waterboy's overprotective mama, perfectly in tune with
the film's sneaky sense of fun. (Janet Maslin). &QL;

<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   RENE CLAIR IN FRANCE. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the
birth of the French filmmaker Rene Clair, the Museum of Modern Art
in New York City on Friday begins a retrospective series of 13 of
the 29 films he directed between 1923 and 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Their range extends from his earliest silent films, like the
Dadaist classic ``Entr'acte'' (1924), to his fantastical comedies,
his groundbreaking use of sound in ``Under the Roofs of Paris''
(1930) and post-World War II efforts like ``Man About Town,'' from
1947 (also known as ``Silence Is Golden''), and ``The Grand
Maneuver'' (1955), notable for its use of color.
</P>
<P>
   The series starts at 6 p.m. with a double bill of ``Entr'acte''
and ``Crazy Ray'' (1923), an early science-fiction comedy. At 8,
the feature is ``Man About Town,'' a homage to the early days of
moviemaking. Continuing through Dec. 13 at the museum, 11 West 53rd
Street, Manhattan, the series, with some films only in French, is
free with museum admission: $9.50 for adults, $6.50 for students
and people 65 or older; free for visitors under 16 accompanied by
an adult. Pay what you wish on Fridays from 4:30 to 8:30 p.m.
Information: (212) 708-9400. (Lawrence Van Gelder).

most powerfully is a new pragmatism, which puts the movement's

<HEADLINE>
U.S. IS URGED TO BAN VINYL TOYS FOR SMALL CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twelve consumer, environmental and religious
organizations asked the Consumer Product Safety Commission on
Thursday to ban vinyl toys for small children, four days after
Canadian officials advised parents of small children to throw away
vinyl teethers and rattles, because of possible kidney and liver
damage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 28 members of Congress signed a letter to President
Clinton asking whether the Commerce Department is lobbying to keep
European markets open to vinyl toys, and urging that the lobbying
stop if it was doing so. Several European countries have put
restrictions on the use of vinyl in toys, partly in response to a
sustained campaign by Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   Even though scientists do not agree on whether vinyl toys are
safe, some toymakers and marketers have stopped selling them. Toys
R Us said this week it had removed toys with vinyl that are
intended to be mouthed by infants.
</P>
<P>
   But toy manufacturers argued that the material was safe. As a
practical matter, manufacturers said, teethers and some other small
objects made by injection moulding can be made from vinyl-free
plastics; more complex shapes, like rubber ducks or teddy bears,
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The material at issue is polyvinylchloride, or PVC, which is
familiar to consumers as a material used for pipes and other rigid
parts, mixed with a ``plasticizer,'' to make it soft. Since the
mid-1980s, the industry has used a material called DINP, because a
material used up to that time, DEHP, was found to cause health
damage to rodents at high doses.
</P>
<P>
   More recent studies show that the substitute material produces
similar effects in rodents, but chemical manufacturers say that the
damage occurs by a mechanism that is not relevant to humans, and
that both materials are safe.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The CPSC, which brokered the deal in the mid-'80s that ended the
use of DEHP, said Thursday it was conducting research on how much
dose a toy could give a child, and reviewing the animal studies
that showed health damage, and hoped to make an announcement soon.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Thursday was made by the National Environmental
Trust, whose president, Philip Clapp, said it was unacceptable that
American parents would have to go to a Canadian web site to get
authoritative government advice on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   (Health Canada's advisory is available at
www.hcsc.gc.ca/advisory/index.htm).
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, even steps like the ones taken by the Canadian
government and Toys R Us were inadequate, because they only covered
items that were intended to go into a baby's mouth. ``Infants and
toddlers don't distinguish between toys intended for the mouth and
all other toys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Mattel, Inc., of El Segundo, Calif., said it would
phase out the plasticizers in teeth toys for children under 36
months. Thursday the National Environmental Trust listed two of its
products as having particularly high levels of DINP, but neither
was covered by the phase out. The toys were the arms of Rugrats
Tommy Pickles Ice Cream Face doll, and the shoes of Cabbage Patch
Kids Starr Rosie Doll.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel did not respond to a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   David Miller, a spokesman for the Toy Manufacturers of America,
an industry trade group based in New York, said that the
plasticizers had been thoroughly studied, used for years and
represented no risk. He said the Canadian authorities had grossly
overestimated the amount of dose a child could get from chewing on
such a toy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the product should be banned until proven safe, he
said, ``on that logic you can rule out half the products sold in
the United States today.''
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating the uncertainty, Dr. Cathey Falvo, a pediatrician
representing Physicians for Social Responsibility who spoke
Thursday in favor of a ban, said that some health effects might not
turn up for decades.

ANDREA MARCOVICCI: AT THE OAK ROOM, A SALUTE TO NOEL COWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the cabaret star Andrea Marcovicci flashes a
melting smile and flicks away the suggestion of a tear from eyes
that shine with a fervent nostalgia, pop music history opens up
like a treasured scrapbook full of pressed flowers and faded
photographs. Shopworn dreams of old-time Hollywood shed their
tarnish, and the fantasy of a lost and glorious show business past
materializes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marcovicci's conjuring powers have rarely been more
persuasive than in her new cabaret show at the Oak Room of the
Algonquin Hotel, where she is saluting Noel Coward through Jan. 2.
The rose-colored portrait she creates through songs, anecdotes and
excerpts from Coward's poetry is of a fellow romantic.
</P>
<P>
   In describing Coward's restless homosexual love life, she comes
up with a quotation in which he lamented being ``no good at love''
because of his need to imagine the bitter end of a relationship at
its outset. She tells us that ``Mad About the Boy'' was not written
about Cary Grant, as has been commonly supposed, but about James
Cagney.
</P>
<P>
   The ballad-oriented show is crammed with Coward chestnuts,
including ``I'll Follow My Secret Heart,'' ``Someday I'll Find
You,'' ``If Love Were All'' and ``I'll See You Again.'' Accompanied
on the piano by Shelly Markham at Tuesday's opening night show, Ms.
Marcovicci delivered them in her characteristically breathless
style, alternating among speech song, a grainy low alto and a thin
tremulous soprano.
</P>
<P>
   While she emphasized Coward's sentimentality, his witty patter
songs stood out as his finest. ``Why Must the Show Go On?'' and
``Why Do the Wrong People Travel?'' have crackling incisiveness
that matches the best of Ogden Nash and Cole Porter.

TEXANS TO BRING `ALAMO DIARY' TO LONE STAR STATE

<P>
   Having beaten their competitors in a high-dollar battle to
acquire a controversial memoir detailing the capture of the Alamo,
a pair of native Texans announced through their agent Thursday that
they plan to bring the document back to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are delighted to have the papers and to be able to ensure
that they will be in Texas,'' said Wendy Evans, the New York City
art consultant who represented the buyers at the Wednesday auction
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers _ their names a guarded secret _ paid $350,000 for
the memoir of Jose Enrique de la Pena, a junior officer in Santa
Anna's army during the battle of the Alamo in March 1836.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas dropped out of the bidding at $300,000.
The memoir and related documents _ about 700 pages in all _ had
been appraised at $200,000 to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The memoir, an English translation of which has been published
by Texas A&AMP;M University Press as ``With Santa Anna in Texas: A
Personal Narrative of the Revolution,'' challenges commonly
accepted versions of Davy Crockett's death.
</P>
<P>
   De la Pena reported that Crockett did not die in battle, but,
rather, was among Alamo defenders who were captured and executed.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who said she was hired by the men, in large part, to
ensure their anonymity, said the buyers would publicly announce
their plans for the papers in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they plan to give or loan them to a university or
library, she responded: ``I know, but I'm not allowed to say.''
</P>
<P>
   For about 20 years, the materials were part of the John Peace
Collection at the University of Texas at San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Peace, a UT regent and rare book collector, bought the documents
in Mexico 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They were put up for sale by Peace's widow, Ruby Peace, and
their son, John Peace III, a San Antonio rare book dealer.

HINDU PARTY FACES TEST AS PRICES ANGER INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Elections in New Delhi and three Indian
states next week have turned into a referendum on the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which has led India's shaky,
18-party coalition government for the last eight months.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, for state-level offices, has been dominated by the
voters' anger over the rising price of onions and other vegetables,
an issue that has put the national government on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalists, who have never before held power for a
sustained period since India gained its independence 51 years ago,
shocked the world in May when the government they lead exploded
nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
   But poll takers have found that the nuclear tests barely
register as an issue with voters, while rising food prices are the
number one concern for almost two-thirds of them.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Congress Party, which has governed India for most
of the past half century, has seized on the price increases to
attack the Hindu nationalists for failing to deliver more effective
government. They should have moved more quickly to halt the export
of onions and to remove duties on onion imports, Congress officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20 years ago, the Congress Party leader at the time,
Indira Gandhi, waving garlands of onions at political rallies,
roared back to power as prime minister by campaigning on the rising
price of this tasty ingredient of the Indian diet. Now another
member of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, her daughter-in-law Sonia
Gandhi, is doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent political rally in New Delhi in a park named for her
assassinated mother-in-law, Sonia Gandhi, who is now president of
the Congress Party, attacked the Hindu nationalists for letting the
prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes soar. While she spoke, a
giant onion-shaped hot air balloon hovered over the crowd of 30,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sisters cannot run their households,'' she declared.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who heads the Bharatiya
Janata Party, answered the onion charges at rallies here this week,
but his audiences have been a fraction of the size of Mrs. Gandhi's
and their responses tepid. He attributed the rising prices to
unseasonable rains that destroyed a portion of the crops and to the
the Congress Party's economic policies during their decades in
power.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation has translated into a strong anti-incumbent sentiment
in the three main battlegrounds of New Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya
Pradesh. The fourth, Mizoram, is one of India's smallest states.
The elections are to be held Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In New Delhi and Rajasthan, strongholds of the Hindu
nationalists, the Congress Party is gaining ground and may win,
poll takers say. But in Madhya Pradesh, the incumbent Congress
government is likely to be ousted, according to a survey of more
than 20,000 voters taken by the agency C-Voter and commissioned by
a magazine, The Week.
</P>
<P>
   The strong possibility that Congress will win in two of the
three most important elections this year has prompted speculation
about whether it will try to topple the current national
government.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee has charged that the Congress intends to grab power for
itself, even though it lost the last national election. Mrs. Gandhi
said she is content to let the Hindu nationalist coalition collapse
because of its own failures.
</P>
<P>
   And there are signs of trouble in the coalition on the price
rise issue. For example, Mamata Banerjee, who heads a regional
party based in West Bengal that is allied with the Hindu
nationalists, this week gave them a four-month ultimatum: improve
the situation or we will quit the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The rising cost of onions has played neatly into the Congress
Party's strategy of winning back the voter coalition that had
enabled it to monopolize the nation's politics in the past. At a
recent party retreat, Congress rededicated itself to championing
the poor, the lower castes and religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Gandhi spoke at a rally in a part of New Delhi that
is pocked by slums, Anil Kumar, 29, who sells fried rice and
curried chick peas from a pushcart, said he voted for the Bharatiya
Janata Party in the last election, but would cast his ballot for
Congress this time. He gave the BJP a chance, he said, and ``they
did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Congress will have to work hard to win back other voters,
who remember the corruption scandals and fumbling policies that
helped bring the party low in the first place. Kuldip Singh, a pump
operator for the Delhi Municipal Corp., said he remained undecided,
even after hearing Mrs. Gandhi speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether Congress or the BJP wins, the poor people will remain
poor,'' he said. ``And the prices will remain the same.''

STUDY SAYS SMOKING COULD KILL ONE IN THREE MEN IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By Elisabeth Rosenthal with Lawrence K. Altman   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ For the first time scientists have calculated the
devastating toll of cigarette smoking in China and declared the
country to be on the verge of a calamitous epidemic of
smoking-related deaths that may well kill one in three Chinese men.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where 70 percent of men smoke, there are now 2,000
smoking-related deaths a day, the researchers said. That number
will increase to 8,000 a day by the middle of the next century
unless public health measures are taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unprecedented epidemic of smoking deaths,'' Dr.
Chen Zhengming, a Chinese researcher now based at Oxford
University, told a news conference Thursday in Beijing. ``And China
is still in the early stages of the epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   In two papers being published on Saturday in the British Medical
Journal, researchers from China, Britain and the United States draw
the outlines of China' emerging epidemic with countless statistics.
</P>
<P>
   For example: In China, middle-aged smokers are three times more
likely to get lung cancer than nonsmokers. They are twice as likely
to die of tuberculosis. Today, more than 12 percent of deaths among
men are related to smoking and that number is increasing.
</P>
<P>
   The studies, which involved interviewing more than a million
people scattered across China, represent an impressive technical
achievement _ the largest epidemiologic study ever examining the
connection between cigarettes and death.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the Chinese government has started to
combat what was obviously a huge smoking problem. But it is a
fledgling effort in a long battle that primarily affects men, since
very few women in China smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The reports' authors, mostly doctors from China's prestigious
medical academies, hope their bleak and specific picture of the
devastating effect that cigarettes are having in their homeland
will energize China's anti-smoking campaign, much as the 1964
Surgeon's General's report opened Americans' eyes to the hazards.
</P>
<P>
   In China, ``Most people don't understand how dangerous smoking
is,'' said Dr. Yang Guanghua, an associate professor at the Chinese
Academy of Preventive Medicine and one of the papers' authors.
``Over 50 percent of Chinese people think smoking does little or no
harm and over 60 percent don't know it can lead to lung cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Chen: ``Policy-makers act on evidence and until now
there's been no evidence from China.''
</P>
<P>
   In much of China cigarettes are as much a tool of social
interaction as they are an addiction. The standard greeting between
men goes like this: ``Smoke?'' offering a pack in outstretched
hand.
</P>
<P>
   The only polite response is to take one, light up, draw and only
then to start the conversation. Those who demur are viewed as
slightly odd and lacking social graces.
</P>
<P>
   Selling cigarettes is a lucrative business in China, which
produces more tobacco than any other country on earth and where the
government owns an estimated 90 percent of tobacco companies.
Cigarette companies are the sponsors of many sports events catering
to young people, from the Marlboro Soccer League to the 555
motocross races. ``It's a problem,'' said Chen, with a sigh.

   Xscape Dfunct?
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Tamika Scott celebrated her 24th birthday Thursday,
word was seeping out that her R&AMP;B quartet, Xscape, has broken up.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta group's third recording, ``Traces of My Lipstick,''
has gone gold. And their current single, ``My Little Secret,'' is
in the top 10 of Billboard's R&AMP;B charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were thinking we might not be back together before we even
put out this album,'' said member Kandi Burruss. Burruss said the
group of five years _ which also included LaTocha Scott and Tameka
Cottle _ has wanted to work on individual projects for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Burruss and Cottle have produced a song for R&AMP;B trio TLC's
upcoming album and have put together a group called Kat. LaTocha
Scott is planning a solo R&AMP;B effort, while her sister Tamika, an
ordained minister at College Park's (Ga.) Christ Miracle Temple,
wants to pursue a gospel career.
</P>
<P>
   Musical billboard
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The city gets a couple of new billboards today,
hawking the virtues of...Yoel Levi?
</P>
<P>
   A grassroots group known as Atlanta for Levi has rented a
billboard above the Landmark Diner on Roswell Road and near
Piedmont Hospital on Peachtree Road to make its point.
</P>
<P>
   A.F.L. members don't want the departing Atlanta Symphony
Orchestra music director to pack his bags just yet. The group is
hoping the outdoor advertisements will encourage more folks to sign
its petition, which already includes more than 21,000 signatures.
</P>
<P>
   The signs state: ``21,286 Music Lovers Want Yoel Levi in
Atlanta. Call 404-223-LEVI. Add Your Name.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizer Gary Rowe told us: ``We feel that the process of
making important decisions about the city's orchestra should
include the audience.''

   Turner turns 60
</P>
<P>
   Even though we swore we wouldn't show up and pop out of a cake,
the folks over at Turner Broadcasting Corporate Affairs stayed mum
on their employer's birthday plans Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The only solid word on Ted Turner's 60th birthday celebration:
He planned on a small, quiet gathering.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe we'll buy the ``small'' part...

<P>
   Wolfe Watch
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tom Wolfe leaves today, and we at Buzz central are
preparing for a bout of postpartum depression.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we've learned that Atlanta architect David McCowen
was the first to get a signed copy of ``A Man in Full'' during the
author's visit.
</P>
<P>
   McCowen, at Hartsfield International Wednesday on business, was
waiting when Wolfe arrived for his Atlanta visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't normally do this kind of thing,'' McCowen explained.
``But I wanted to tell him how much my wife and I had enjoyed it.''
The author cheerfully consented to signing McCowen's book (which
just happened to be stashed inside his briefcase).
</P>
<P>
   Result: McCowen, a book collector, went home with a personalized
signed copy.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe isn't the only person signing copies of the novel. Wolfe
pal Mary Rose Taylor was spotted Thursday autographing a copy of
Wolfe's ``A Man in Full'' for one fan and a dog-eared paperback
copy of ``The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test'' for another.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the Atlanta Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau
breakfast for Wolfe and 200 of his closest business acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe's Atlanta schedule today:
</P>
<P>
   11 a.m. _ Signing at Waterstones at Hartsfield International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   1 p.m. _ Boards plane for Miami.

 &AMP; A-COX &HT;    'N Sync a pop blend with loads of cutes
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents, here's your chance to get in sync with your teenage
daughters. Name the five guys from Orlando who specialize in Spice
Girls pop blended, as best they can, with soul-brother
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the Backstreet Boys. They're so a minute ago.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking Lance Bass, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone Jr., Chris
Kirkpatrick and Justin Timberlake of 'N Sync, the latest in the
pack of moneymaking pinups doing their best imitation of the 1980s
New Kids on the Block (``The Right Stuff''). The New Kids were
really a more mainstream-digestible imitation of the R&AMP;B group New
Edition. New Edition was admittedly crafted after Motown pioneers
the Jackson Five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which means the formula that's working for 'N Sync is really
nothing new, and kind of simple,'' says Maurice Starr, the Svengali
who put together New Edition and New Kids on the Block and is now
working with the gospel group Five Young Men. ``Appeal to the
hormones. Find an act that the young girls want on their wall, on
their radio, on their video channel, who they'll spend all of their
allowance to see, hear or have a T-shirt with their face on it.
It's really just that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. Tell that to such similarly fashioned ``boy groups'' as
Five, 98 Degrees and Boyzone. Acts that would love to have the 3
million-selling Top 10 debut (`` 'N Sync''), a Christmas album
(``Home for Christmas'') and biography that make 'N Sync pretty
hard to discount.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, let band member Fatone explain what it takes to be
'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm sure you've heard all kinds of descriptions of your
music. How do you describe your music?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hmmm. The 'N Sync sound is . . . the chords are very
intricate. There's a lot of harmonies throughout. And we're not
like many people out there. We can give jazz chords. People who
have an ear for music can really hear what we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Rolling Stone magazine, your manager said the Backstreet
Boys were like (R and B pioneers) the Temptations and you guys were
the Four Tops. Does that kind of comparison take you aback?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of course people are going to compare us with the Backstreet
Boys. We do basically the same kind of music. And we can't deny
that we both call the same place home. But obviously our individual
personalities make us different. And if people see our shows, we're
high-energy all the time. We basically don't stop moving.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Actually, I meant the comparison to the Four Tops. Kind of
lofty, don't you think, being a new group?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, definitely. Certainly. I mean, we are _ I guess this is
another description _ pop/R&AMP;B.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was the last time you felt out of sync?
</P>
<P>
   A: This morning. Getting up is still rough. Don't let the group
name fool you. I don't always have it together.

 &HT;    Reeve sees hero role as a big step for TV
 &HT;    By Bob Longino and Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Viewers tuning in to watch Christopher Reeve in ABC's plywood
remake of Alfred Hitchcock's ``Rear Window'' (9 p.m. EST Sunday)
will witness a poignant, real-life moment for the disabled actor.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the film's more harrowing scenes, Reeve's ventilator
is made inoperable and he must speak briefly on his own. It is
something the actor has been unable to do since becoming paralyzed
after a 1995 riding accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally when I'm off the ventilator I can breathe but not
speak,'' Reeve says. ``The scene called for me to say a couple of
words. . . . I guess it's a Pavlovian response, but when the script
has me do something I try to rise to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for the first time since his accident, he mustered the
energy to speak while being off his ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the most exciting moments that I've had,''
Reeve says. And then he recounts a recent birthday party in which
he successfully blew out the candle on a little cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not sound like much to you, but to be able on my own to
blow out a candle is another step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeve's performance in ``Rear Window,'' in which he plays a
character quite different from that of Jimmy Stewart in Hitchcock's
vastly superior original murder mystery, is a big leap forward _
the disabled actor's first return to a starring role (he directed
HBO's ``In the Gloaming.'')
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he spoke with the nation's TV writers by phone in a
mass conference call.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On handling the workload: ``I work an eight-hour day. It was a
26-day shoot and I was never healthier. Much to my surprise, I was
energized by the whole project rather than being exhausted by it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On getting the part: ``ABC bought the rights from two
gentlemen who had bought it from the Hitchcock estate. I believe it
was ABC's idea to use me. I didn't know whether I could do
something like this or not, but ABC went out on a limb.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On how the film differs from Hitchcock's original: ``The main
purpose was to take the basic premise and raise the stakes to show
how somebody in much more difficult circumstances could survive. .
. . (`Rear Window' is) not holy scripture. We're not doing anything
defamatory. . . . In a way Jimmy Stewart was already a voyeur _ he
was a photographer and used to looking at people through a lens.
With my character (a severely injured architect), he's really drawn
to the window out of loneliness. . . . Some people have said that
that's actually more compelling than pure voyeurism.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On what he's learned about acting since the accident: ``I had
to be very economical in what I was doing. And true to what is
happening. The story is a lesson in close-up acting. The approach
is the same _ to be as real and truthful as you can be.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On whether portrayals of the disabled are changing:
``Unfortunately, severely disabled people have been cast as a
villain or shown as being very resentful. . . . What is unique
about this is to take someone and have them cast as the hero. I
think people will be surprised how much somebody in my condition
can do. . . . We've had equality for minorities and equality for
women _ and now we need equality for the disabled so they are
brought into the work force and the mainstream of society.''

   'Winchell' falls short
</P>
<P>
   Ex-tree! Ex-tree! Read all about it! HBO movie falls back on
oldest cliche in the book, tossing newspapers off a truck and then
showing the front page spinning around!
</P>
<P>
   Back when Geraldo Rivera was just little Jerry Rivers, there was
Walter Winchell, the prototype of the journalist who starts buying
his own puffery. Winchell's career spanned vaudeville, newspapers,
radio and television, and at the peak of his popularity, his radio
addresses and newspaper column, which veered from political
punditry (he saw the menace of Hitler before many Americans) to
Broadway gossip, made him one of the most powerful men in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winchell'' (8 p.m. EST Saturday on HBO), a dramatization of
his life, is so much like the man it even has his fatal flaws: a
self-importance and an inability to see the absurdity and irony of
his descent into hackdom and being a finger-pointing stooge for
Sen. Joseph McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Tucci, one of our most underappreciated actors (his work
on ``Murder One'' was some of the best acting of the '90s), has
Winchell nailed, particularly that telegraph-key radio delivery.
But he's working with minimal help from the script, which lurches
from stock scene to cliche.
</P>
<P>
   Winchell, who died in obscurity but turned out to have a
profound (if debatable) impact on journalism, deserved a biopic
that picked apart what made him tick. HBO, which generally makes
interesting movies, was the outfit to do it. But this isn't it.

   Leon takes center stage
</P>
<P>
   CNN turns a spotlight on the Alliance Theater's Kenny Leon on
Sunday's ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Time'' (10 p.m. EST). Anchor-reporter
Joie Chen credits Leon with taking the Alliance to ``center stage
in the American theater,'' even though Atlanta is ``a city many
still consider a cultural backwater.''
</P>
<P>
   The segment starts off dramatically, with Leon bellowing, ``I am
the bastard son of Richard Nixon, and I will rule the world!'' in
the current play ``Lonely Planet.'' It also shows him rehearsing
``A Christmas Carol'' and joking about his one vice, golf.

 BEIJING: a sigh.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government organizes anti-smoking campaigns, bans cigarette
advertising and forbids smoking in public places. But a study by
Dr. Niu Shiru found that once Chinese start smoking, generally at
about age 20, few ever give up _ except when they fall ill in later
life with a smoking related illness.
</P>
<P>
   Niu, another of the authors of the papers, who is vice secretary
general of the Chinese Association on Smoking and Health, said
young people tend to ignore anti-smoking campaigns. ``The risks
seem too distant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of the two papers, Dr. Liu Boqi, of China's
National Cancer Institute, directed a team of 500 workers who
fanned out across the country to interview the families of 700,000
Chinese who had died in 1990 of cancer, lung disease, stroke and
heart disease to learn about their deceased relative's smoking
habits. For a comparison they also studied the cases of 2 million
people who died of other causes.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the researchers found that about 70 percent of the men
smoked, a number that has remained fairly stable since the 1980s.
But the number of cigarettes smoked per person has climbed sharply,
from four a day 1980s to 10 in 1992 to 14 in 1995, they said. By
contrast, the number of women who start smoking has declined to 1
percent from 10 percent a decade ago, although the researchers said
they were uncertain why and cautioned that this number might again
rise.
</P>
<P>
   The studies found that smokers in China are more likely than
nonsmokers to die of any of a list of diseases, but that those
illnesses are somewhat different than those experienced by smokers
in the West. While American smokers are most likely to die from
heart attacks, the Chinese are far more likely to die from cancer,
emphysema or tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking kills people in China ``by making diseases that are
already fairly common, somewhat more so,'' the researchers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the second study, Niu and his colleagues interviewed a
quarter of a million randomly selected men over 40 years of age _
73 percent of whom were smokers. The researchers plan to follow
that population for several decades to track the progress of the
smoking epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time such an ambitious project has been
undertaken in China, though extensive studies like this one have
been done in the United States to learn about heart disease and
breast cancer. The studies in China were paid for in part by the
National Institutes of Health in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Peto of Oxford University, probably the world's
foremost expert on designing large complicated studies on human
disease, is a co-author of both papers. He said the research
constituted the largest study of the hazards of tobacco in the
world, and the first one in a developing country. Similar studies
are planned for other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``China now has 340 million men under 30 who smoke,'' said Niu,
``and their risk of death due to smoking will soon approach the
epidemic proportions we have seen in the West.'' He and others
noted that China's smoking problem is very similar to that
experienced in the United States and England 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen what effect the new information will have
in a country where the researchers estimate that 50 percent of
doctors and teachers smoke _ although the medical profession is
becoming increasingly vocal on the issue. And while there is little
support for smoking cessation, there is a great concern that the
next generation not head down the same path as their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen-age smoking is really a big problem in middle schools and
more education is needed,'' said Dr. Hu Yiji, chief of the
pulmonary department at the Beijing Children's Hospital. ``We
should not show leaders on TV smoking and teachers and doctors
should not smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The new studies do not even deal with the health fallout of
secondhand smoke, although Hu said that his young patients
certainly suffered from its effects in a country where families
live in rather cramped living spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents tend to worry about air pollution, but it's passive
smoking that is the big problem,'' he said. ``If a family member
smokes _ and so many do in China today _ their child is five times
more likely to have respiratory disease. This is the problem.''

 &HT;    SMALL COLOMBIAN FARMER REJECTS COCAINE CROP FOR BLACKBERRIES
 &HT;    910 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    For release Saturday, Nov. 21.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When drug traffickers approached Pedro Herrera
about using his small farm in southern Colombia to grow crops from
which cocaine and heroin could be produced, the offer was tempting.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-acre farm, more than 6,000 feet high in the Colombian
Andes, supported the families of Herrera, his three brothers and
their parents. Steep slopes made much of it inaccessible, and even
the fields where Herrera could plant corn, beans and coffee were
marginally productive, having been overfarmed and abandoned by a
previous owner.
</P>
<P>
   A damaging insect, the coffee borer, had reduced output from the
5 acres where he grew coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty and environmental degradation had caused other farmers
to join the Colombian guerilla movement, take up the ``money crop''
cultivation of coca and poppy for drug cartels or simply move to
the cities and look for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got an offer, and so did my brothers, to grow poppies,''
Herrera said. ``As the oldest brother, I called a family meeting.
We decided this would not be good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackberries were part of the reason Herrera and his brothers
were able to resist the temptation of drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the family moved to the farm, Herrera came up with
the idea of growing blackberries and selling them in a nearby
village market. He got seeds from a neighbor who had some growing
in his yard.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the berries have become a flourishing local crop for
Herrera and his neighbors, and plans are under way to export them
to a grocery chain in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   International development agencies, intrigued by Herrera's
initiative, brought him to Washington recently to lecture World
Bank officials on the advantages of involving the poor people in
planning and managing the programs that are established to assist
them.
</P>
<P>
   The International Center for Tropical Agriculture, part of a
worldwide network of research centers supported by the World Bank
and foreign aid agencies in the United States and other countries,
has set up local ``committees'' of farmers like Pedro Herrera to
help direct their own assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments by small Colombian farmers with new corn varieties
have increased production more than 10-fold in some areas. Others
have worked out ways of planting sugar cane or rows of thick
barrier grasses to stop erosion, and others are planting
insect-repelling border plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bottom-up approach,'' said Jose I. Sanz, director of
the center's Hillside Agroecosystems Project. ``Our focus is in
working with the farmers in the improvement of the poorer
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed during his trip to Washington, Herrera said he and
his brothers purchased their farm, about 40 miles from the southern
Colombia city of Cali, 10 years ago with $7,000 of savings and a
$1,000 loan.
</P>
<P>
   A previous owner had plowed furrows up and down the hillsides,
rather than across the slopes, and a lot of topsoil had washed
away, Herrera said. With advice from Sanz and others, Herrera
learned to use no-till farming and composting to rebuild his soil.
</P>
<P>
   As he expanded his blackberry operation, he saved enough money
to buy a 1971 Dodge pickup truck, which he now uses to haul
blackberries for himself and his neighbors to a supermarket chain
in Cali. (During his trip to Washington, Herrera took time to visit
automobile salvage yards, in search of a used carburetor.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides blackberries, the farmers also began marketing a local
fruit, lulo, which is related to tomatoes but sought for its
tangy-sweet juice.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because the farmers cannot afford chemical fertilizers
and pesticides, their fruit qualifies as ``organically grown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we are sitting on a gold mine with people like Pedro
Herrera,'' Sanz said. ``Over 40 percent of the food in Colombia is
produced on these small farms. When the agencies that support us
ask what we are accomplishing, we can point to this model as an
example of something that works and can be replicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The key turned out to be involving hillside farmers in the
planning and management of their own assistance programs. Wary of
outsiders, the farmers had little interest in the ideas of
agricultural researchers hundreds of miles away in Bogota, and
often, those ideas had little relevance to a farmer's needs.
</P>
<P>
   In one example of the new approach, farmers were taught ways to
experiment with new corn varieties and to improve the way they
selected and cared for seed they saved for future crops. This
involved such simple principles as knowing kernels taken from the
middle of an ear of corn make the best seed and that the tops
should be broken out of unusually tall _ and wind-vulnerable _
cornstalks to keep them from pollinating other plants and passing
on undesirable traits.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, yields have increased so that a farmer can expect to
harvest over a ton of corn from a 1-pound packet of seed, compared
with a harvest of about 200 pounds in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera's farm now includes a few cattle, a small flock of
layers and another flock of broilers. He composts his own
fertilizer. He has set aside 6 acres of woodland for watershed
protection.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when he was a small boy, ``we were so poor, I had
to work just to earn money to buy wood so that my mother could cook
our meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very proud to be a farmer,'' he added, ``and I think the
best inheritance I can leave my children is good soil. I would like
for my children to continue giving life to my farm.''

COMMENTARY: WHAT WE CAN'T DO 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   American voters can put any citizen in the presidency. But they
cannot make him a leader, not the kind a free country needs.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot make him brave and truthful, and straightforward
about the country's security needs and dangers. They cannot inject
him with the political and military wisdom to speak to them about
these things lucidly, so that together president and people can
meet the needs fully and face the dangers confidently.
</P>
<P>
   Truth _ diplomats tend to raise eyebrows, but without it
democracies stumble, sometimes fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the continuous crisis with Iraq, which will determine whether
unknowably large numbers of people live or go gasping to death, one
truth is that the decision to attack was not forced on President
Clinton only last month, as the administration tells us, when
Saddam Hussein ordered the U.N. weapons inspectors out.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he took office six years ago, Clinton had the
justification to attack Saddam for concealing his weapons of mass
destruction, and for harassing inspectors day in, day out.
</P>
<P>
   Justification became duty at least a year ago. And it became the
imperative 100 days before the planned strike and its cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   For 9 of the last 12 months, Saddam has imposed restrictions on
international inspections that made them largely ineffective; the
U.S. says so itself. The inspection teams were not allowed to make
``challenge'' weapons inspections _ suddenly visit places not
inspected before.
</P>
<P>
   Every day Saddam's most powerful and trusted secret detachment
moved documents and weaponry stockpiles of chemical, biological,
missile and nuclear weaponry out of sites that had been or might be
inspected. Then they took over houses, mosques, hospitals, farms,
any structure in Iraq as new hiding places _ a new national
concealment accomplished every 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 100 days Saddam shut down inspection, and on Oct. 31
he again ordered the teams out of the country. This time the order
led to the U.S. decision for a heavy air strike.
</P>
<P>
   I do not know whether Saddam was tipped off in time to avoid the
strike by announcing that inspectors could return. But it would be
real strange if he was not.
</P>
<P>
   He has a lot of friends at the U.N. Occasionally they will vote
for a resolution Saddam does not like. Then France, Russia, China
and other friends and beneficiaries pick up their full-time job of
trying to weaken inspection machinery. That is supposed to result
in clearing Saddam of hiding weaponry, so that business with
Baghdad can be resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Their foreign offices, delegations and diplomats appointed to
shadow the inspection teams in Iraq are, shall we say, not out of
touch with Saddam's apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan has made his distaste for the
inspectors startlingly obvious. Last February he signed a
sweetheart deal with Saddam. Saddam threw away the deal six months
later. Annan never had the courage to say oh what a fool I was; it
might repair his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam may be smart enough now to follow the urgent advice of
France, China, Russia and the Annan bureaucracy _ don't throw
inspectors out again and bring on missiles. In a year or so we will
kill inspection and speed up the end of sanctions so we can do
business again. Then Saddam will be free to continue his weapons
programs _ that need not be said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton never found time to make a full, detailed speech on
Saddam, what his threat was and what Americans should do about it.
Almost as an afterthought, Clinton says he would like to see the
end of the Saddam regime and will try to speed the day. Not a word
does he say that U.S. forces would have to give Iraqi resistance
protection from the air and probably the ground.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless he plans just to watch, as the U.S. and U.N. did
a few years ago when Saddam slaughtered resistance fighters like
desert rats.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating Saddam has always been and remains the only way to
end his threat of war and terrorism with weapons of hell. But if
Clinton does not, somehow, develop enough presidential backbone and
honesty to tell Americans, in enough time to get public support,
how we will rid the world of Saddam, he will deliver the slivered
but still alive Iraqi resistance to a desert Bay of Pigs, and
America with them.

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Under another golden dome 99 miles from Beacon
Hill, an emotional Robert Kraft Thursday signed a tentative
agreement with state officials to move the New England Patriots
football team, its corporate offices and practice facilities to a
new $350 million publicly financed stadium here.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Connecticut Legislature has to approve the
Memorandum of Understanding in a special session before Dec. 31, a
confident Governor John Rowland called the deal a ``turning point
that will propel this state into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   In an austere judiciary room at the state Capitol, Patriots
owner Kraft, with tears in his eyes and pen in hand, signed the
agreement with Rowland. There was a crush of reporters in front of
the two men _ said to have a warm relationship _ and a pack of
giddy legislators and business leaders at their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Having lawmakers smiling behind him was a symbol that did not
escape Kraft, who has sought approval for several stadium deals on
Beacon Hill in Boston over the last few years, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a sliver of skepticism in the Legislature here
about the extravagant terms of the agreement and some concern that
the state is nearing its financing limit, support is generally
strong and bipartisan, a stark contrast to many other high-profile
redevelopment projects Rowland has attempted to spearhead that were
rejected by the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do it before the end of the year,'' said
Democratic Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, a Republican keenly aware that he did not need another
public embarrassment, negotiated with the Patriots in secret for
several weeks, then quietly lobbied senators and representatives
one on one, winning their casual approval.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both sides sewed up the deal at about 1:45 a.m.
Thursday. A little more than 12 hours later, the Hartford Courant
issued an extra edition. ``Touchdown!'' its headline screamed.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has placed in an escrow account $2 million he would
forfeit if he negotiates with any other state while the Connecticut
House and Senate debate the measure. But neither Rhode Island nor
Massachusetts voiced interest in making other offers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one more cautious than I am,'' Rowland said at the
announcement. ``But let's seize the moment. Let's make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kraft: ``I signed an agreement. I'm going to live by it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Connecticut Legislature approves the terms by Dec. 31,
the 30-year lease deal is said to be binding.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kraft conceded that if lawmakers significantly alter
the understanding, the agreement would evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are material changes to the MOU we can't live with,
yes,'' Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci, who held a press
conference in New Orleans where he is attending the Republican
Governor's Association conference, said he was troubled his
homestate lawmakers could not compromise on bills that would have
kept the Patriots in their hometown of Foxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have been able to work it out,'' Cellucci said.
``But I would not have recommended the deal Connecticut was willing
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford deal would require Kraft to pay $50 million to
build, own, and operate a hotel to accompany a planned convention
center. He would also spend another $20 million to build and own an
NFL entertainment theme complex and $5 million for a downtown
wellness center, which would include sports rehabilitation services
with team doctors and an athletic facility open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Connecticut would issue bonds to build a $265 million
68,000-seat open-air stadium with 6,000 premium club seats and
between 125 and 150 luxury boxes. The state would also pay for
another $90 million in infrastructure, parking and transportation
improvements around the site which would also support a proposed
convention center.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is part of a $1 billion downtown revitalization
project known as Adriaen's Landing, which sits along the
Connecticut River at the crossroads of interstates 89 and 91.
</P>
<P>
   The state would pay for any cost overruns associated with time
delays in stadium construction; the team would pay for overruns
associated with design changes, according to Kraft's son, Jonathan.
</P>
<P>
   The 17,000 current season ticket holders are guaranteed first
options to renew at the new facility in the same general location
as their existing seats at Foxboro Stadium, one of the oldest
facilities in the NFL. And instead of aluminum bleachers, every
seat would have a chairback in the Hartford stadium, Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   The team would share the facility with the University of
Connecticut football team, upgrading its program to Division 1-A.
The Patriots would also provide coaching assistance to the Huskies,
under the terms of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland insists that the deal's 10 percent ticket tax on all
stadium events would primarily cover the debt service on the
football facility. The team also generates nearly $10 million a
year in Bay State taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft would keep all stadium revenue, including valuable
concessions and ticket proceeds, except for UConn or
state-sponsored events. He would receive naming rights, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said resolutely Thursday that he would not relocate
the San Jose Clash soccer team he just purchased, part of the
agreement calls for Kraft to study the feasibility of bringing
professional soccer to the proposed facility.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Revolution soccer team, which plays at Foxboro
Stadium, would remain there, Kraft said, along with concerts.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots and UConn would move to the stadium in late summer
of 2001. A year later, New England would relocate its practice
facilities to Connecticut. The team's summer training camp will
remain in Smithfield, R.I., at least for now, Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said he met with NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue in New
York Wednesday and was told the league would not try to block the
move, nor would another franchise be granted for the region.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Rowland said the young Republican governor
carefully planned his courting of Kraft. First, they say, Rowland
presented himself as the man in charge -- playing off of Kraft's
frustration with Cellucci, who was boxed in by House Speaker Thomas
M. Finneran, who almost single-handedly blocked stadium legislation
on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Rowland made Kraft believe that he could be part of the
revitalization of Hartford, a city with a boarded up office tower
in Constitution Plaza, as part of a grand civic gesture.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of downtown Thursday, residents expressed a sense
of ennui, having seen the Hartford Whalers hockey team leave the
city and the Patriots flirt with moving there before.
</P>
<P>
   But those inside the Capitol were jubilant, especially Rowland,
who wants the project to be his legacy. Kraft said his wish was not
to sell the team, but to keep it in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland and Kraft hit it off, successfully using each other to
fulfill those goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kraft seems to be someone who wants love and respect. So here
was this funny, attractive governor who says, `Come on over to the
mansion. You can be one of the people to bring this city back. This
is my legacy, and you can be a big part of it,' '' said Christopher
Healy, a Hartford lobbyist and an operative in the Connecticut
Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny part about it is, we've always thought of
Massachusetts as a one-party state where the leaders sit around a
table and do a deal. And here we took a page right out of the
Beacon Hill playbook, and beat them at it,'' Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   When Rowland introduced Kraft at the press conference, the team
owner received hoots and rousing applause from many in the room.
Kraft was clearly taken aback by the reception. His eyes welled
with tears. He looked over at his son, Jonathan, who was also
struggling with his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly bittersweet,'' the elder Kraft said. ``Getting
the greeting here that we got. You really overwhelm me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan later added: ``It's nice to feel wanted. There are some
people who don't believe a football team _ even with a
privately-financed stadium _ is worth having...People put aside
small, parochial issues to get this done.''

   The Modern Seeks Money
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gearing up for its major expansion, the Museum of
Modern Art announced this week that it had begun a $650 million
capital campaign drive. It is believed to be the largest
fund-raising effort by any museum in the country and possibly by
any U.S. cultural institution.
</P>
<P>
   So far about $300 million has been raised, including $65 million
from New York City, officials at the Modern said. Mayor Rudolph
Guiliani pledged that amount in April to be paid over the next
three years toward the new building, which is to rise on the site
of the Dorset Hotel and adjacent brownstones. On Wednesday the
mayor confirmed a first payment of $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion project has the city's enthusiastic support
because museum officials estimate that it will generate about $636
million a year for New York City in increased employment, tourism
and tax revenues. They also estimate that it will add about $72
million a year to state funds. The money from the campaign will be
used to buy the land and construct the building, and will also add
to the museum's endowment. The Modern already has a $300 million
endowment; when the campaign is completed it is expected to grow by
$150 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We begin this campaign with an incredibly strong foundation,''
said David Rockefeller, chairman emeritus of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The money raised so far has been a result of efforts spearheaded
by the museum's capital campaign committee, which includes the
museum's chairman, Ronald Lauder; its president, Agnes Gund, and
June Larkin, Rockefeller and Lewis Cullman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-four people have given us $5 million or more,'' said
Glenn Lowry, director of the Modern. One reason for the campaign's
early success, he said, is that ``unlike many other museums, we
haven't been in a perennial capital campaign mode.'' The museum's
last such campaign was about 20 years ago, when it was preparing
for its 1984 expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love this institution,'' Lowry added. ``It's this kind
of loyalty and commitment that allows us to tackle a number like
$650 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The new building, which will be designed by the Japanese
architect Yoshio Taniguchi, is expected to begin construction in
late 2000 and be completed in 2005. Taniguchi was awarded the job
after an international competition.
</P>
<P>
   As the museum continues to grow, so do its space problems. In
the three years since Lowry has been director, attendance has risen
to 1.7 million from 1.3 million, just enough to make the galleries
seem perpetually crowded. Its highly praised Jackson Pollock
retrospective is attracting about 4,000 visitors a day, which is
about all the museum's galleries can comfortably accommodate. Total
attendance at the museum is more than 6,000 daily, museum officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capacity to grow even more is there,'' said Lowry. In its
new home, the museum will have not only larger galleries in which
to show its collection and contemporary art, but also an expanded
film and video center, additional classroom and auditorium spaces,
space for teacher workshops and the technology for using the
Internet for education purposes. The sculpture garden is also to be
enlarged.
</P>
<P>
   After Auctions
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Top officials at Sotheby's were busily working the
phones after its sale of Impressionist and modern art on Monday
night. This was a $123.8 million sale that included 37 works from
the Reader's Digest Collection. The auction, which made less than
its $140 million low estimate, saw many important works go unsold.
But less than 24 hours after the sale, Sotheby's officials had
privately found buyers for four major works.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things that should have sold on Monday night that
didn't have now been sold,'' said Diana Brooks, Sotheby's chief
executive. And these did not go for fire-sale prices, she added.
The sale catalog's combined low estimates for the four works,
however, was $21 million; the auction house said its private sales
totaled $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among the works that have now found buyers are Brancusi's
``Muse'' (1918), a polished bronze head that was sold by the Judith
Rothschild Foundation; Bonnard's ``Still Life With Bottle'' (1942),
from the estate of Wendell Cherry, the chairman of Humana, who died
in 1991; Renoir's ``Woman in Blue'' (1877), from the Reader's
Digest Collection; and Cezanne's ``Bridge and the Barge at
Pontoise'' (1881).
</P>
<P>
   Guggenheim Grows
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Guggenheim's collection continues to grow with
both gifts and purchases. This week the museum announced two groups
of acquisitions. Eight drawings by Robert Rauschenberg were
acquired as a partial gift, partial purchase from the artist's
collection. The acquisition was a collaboration between the
Guggenheim and the Albertina in Vienna, which obtained five
drawings. All the drawings are from the 1950s and early '60s. Two
years ago the institutions mounted a joint show at the Guggenheim,
``From Durer to Rauschenberg.'' The Guggenheim brokered the deal
for both institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Drawings are one area that the Guggenheim wants to strengthen.
Another is photography, and this week the museum announced that an
anonymous donor had given it the Monroe Wheeler Collection of 531
works by the 20th-century photographer George Platt Lynes. The
works have been valued at $1.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim founded its photography program in 1992 with a $5
million gift from the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation. The addition
of the Lynes works gives a significant boost to its holdings of
20th-century photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler, director of exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art
from 1935-1965, was a friend of the Lynes family.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes portraits of cultural figures from the
middle years of this century, like W.H. Auden, Jean Cocteau, Thomas
Mann, W. Somerset Maugham and Igor Stravinsky, as well as
documentation of the New York City Ballet.

   Amazon Joins The Film Fray
</P>
<P>
   The Web wars heated up considerably this week among several
leading purveyors of tapes and digital video disks on the Internet.
On Tuesday Amazon.com entered the field, adding videos to its
books, music and other products. The merging of different goods
into a unified shopping source is a trend in so-called E-commerce.
For example, the former Videoserve.com this week became a part of a
diversified operation called Buy.com, which carries merchandise in
five categories.
</P>
<P>
   Defending its specialized field, the movies-only site Reel.com
has opened a ``holiday store,'' with sales pitched to fast and
efficient gift selection.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the Web-site battle is waged with selection, price
and delivery times. Amazon.com opens with 60,000 titles. Prices are
up to 30 percent off suggested retail prices and delivery is
promised usually in one or two days. Buy.com advertises an
inventory of 85,000 videos of all kinds, deep discounts and
delivery within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Reel.com claims the most titles, 100,000, all of them movies.
Prices are discounted roughly 15 percent to 30 percent. Delivery
ranges from one to five days.
</P>
<P>
   All the sites promise to underprice everybody else. Sometimes
discounts exceed 30 percent, and prices change rapidly. Take a hot
new title like ``Armageddon,'' which has a retail price of $26.99.
Amazon.com's price is $15.86, down from $16.09 the day before.
Buy.com lists the film at $15.35, Reel.com at $15.99.
</P>
<P>
   The three sites also prominently advertise digital video disks,
which movie enthusiasts are buying in large numbers. About 2,000
films are on DVD. Another site, Netflix.com, is devoted solely to
DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   Since mail order involves shipping and handling, prices for the
biggest new films are usually lower at Wal-Mart and other mass
merchandisers. But requiring no shelf space, the Internet sites are
particularly useful for stocking enormous numbers of older films
that can't be readily found in video stores. ``That's where they've
really been able to make a dent,'' said John Gaffney, a columnist
for Video Business magazine. ``That's why the studios like them.
That's their strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Buy.com's listings include relatively few particulars about
films. By contrast, Amazon.com and Reel.com offer extensive
editorial services ranging from complete production details,
consumers' and critics' reviews, and myriad other features.
Amazon.com links users to the huge Internet Movie Database, which
the company bought in April, with reams of information on about
120,000 films. Reel.com emphasizes matching movies to personal
interests and helping people identify films they might not be aware
of.
</P>
<P>
   Web companies have been criticized by the rest of the industry
for occasionally offering certain big films for extreme cut-rate
prices to attract buyers to their sites. For example, Reel.com
offered ``Titanic,'' priced at $29.99 retail, for $9.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of pricing alarms standard dealers offering tapes for,
say, slightly below retail. ``The preponderance of the industry is
fighting for $19.99, trying to maintain value,'' Gaffney said.
</P>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   `DR. DOLITTLE.' Because his father insisted he stop talking to
animals, the doctor (Eddie Murphy) treats only humans. But then he
accidentally injures a dog, which calls him a bonehead, and his
daughter's guinea pig sounds a lot like Chris Rock. In the delicate
position of conversing with animals while maintaining appearances
of normalcy, Dolittle necessarily gives the animals, portrayed by
Rock, Ossie Davis, Albert Brooks and others, the best lines. But
that's fine in Betty Thomas' film, which chalks up its appeal,
Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, in Murphy's ``ability to
play the straight man with hilarious aplomb.'' 1998. FoxNews Corp.
$19.98. 85 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   `CAN'T HARDLY WAIT.' Like most teen-age comedies, this one has
its hot couple (Peter Farinelli and Jennifer Love Hewitt), its nice
guy (Ethan Embry) who has always had a crush on the unattainable
girl and its down-to-earth friend (Lauren Ambrose) who coaches him
through the situation. Set during a wild high school graduation
party, Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan's film makes lively use of
stock characters from smug jock to nerdy valedictorian, tossing in
minor figures like the Girl Whose Party It Is (she screams a lot)
and the Reddi Whip Kid. If originality isn't its strong suit, this
movie recalls tenderhearted coming-of-age films from ``American
Graffiti'' onward, ``showing easygoing humor and the wisdom to
borrow well.'' (Janet Maslin) 1998. Columbia Tri-StarSony. $99.36.
101 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `TWENTYFOURSEVEN.' Alternately antic and maudlin, Shane Meadows'
ambitious first feature film is shot handsomely in black and white.
But the contrasts don't necessarily help a story about aimless
urban youth in the English Midlands and a saintly boxing coach
named Darcy (Bob Hoskins) who tries to give them purpose. After
extended scene-setting, the boys are put in the ring by Darcy, who
is something of a loner and a holy man. Railing against drugs and
violence, the coach allows some playful romps, which sometimes seem
out of step with the solemn look of a film that ``is as uneven as
it is inventive.'' (Janet Maslin) 1998. UniversalSeagram $89.98. 96
minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   `THE NEGOTIATOR.' When the police hostage negotiator Danny Roman
(Samuel L. Jackson) is accused of stealing from a disability fund,
he goes crazy like a fox and takes his own hostages in an effort to
clear himself. That leads to a standoff with Chris Sabian (Kevin
Spacey), the only negotiator who can deal with the negotiator.
Directed with brisk momentum by F. Gary Gray, the film suffers from
making its stars such bland nice guys. Flat dialogue doesn't help
either, nor does a script ``that doesn't leave much to the
imagination.'' (Janet Maslin) 1998. WarnerTime Warner. $107.37. 138
minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release or appeared on television:
</P>
<P>
   ``He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin'.'' In 1976, the New York City
Ballet dancer Jacques d'Amboise began exposing New York City
children to dance as one activity that could help keep them off the
streets. Here he takes 1,000 of them, and some New York City police
officers, in hand and trains them for a performance at Madison
Square Garden's Felt Forum. 1984. Fox Lorber. $19.98. 75 minutes.
Release date: Tuesday. Information: (800) 414-1690.
</P>
<P>
   ``Images of Life: Photographs that Changed the World.''
Memorable images from Life magazine chronicle half a century from
victorious Marines raising the American flag on Iwo Jima in World
War II to the student protests during the ill-fated democracy
movement in China's Tiananmen Square. 1996. CBS Video. $14.98. 60
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flesh'' (1968, 89 minutes), ``Trash'' (1970, 109 minutes),
``Women in Revolt'' (1971, 99 minutes), ``Heat'' (100 minutes,
1972). Three of these films by Paul Morrissey in collaboration with
Andy Warhol have been out of distribution for several years, and
the fourth, ``Women in Revolt,'' is on tape for the first time. For
the Warhol initiate, ``Heat,'' with Joe Dallesandro as a hunk whomoves in with an occasional game show contestant, portrayed by
Sylvia Miles, is a comparatively tame introduction. Seedy is the
word for ``Flesh,'' about a street hustler ( Dallesandro) and the
deviants he encounters. Not for the squeamish, ``Trash'' involves
an addict gone impotent and his lady protector (Holly Woodlawn). As
for ``Women in Revolt'' _ well, nymphomania, frigidity and incest
are central themes. . $19.98 each. None are rated.

AMERICAN AIRLINES TO BUY FLOUNDERING RENO AIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ American Airlines said Thursday that it had agreed to
acquire Reno Air, a struggling, low-fare company, for $124 million
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which could help bolster American's presence in
the West, provides for a cash tender offer for all the outstanding
Reno Air common stock at $7.75 a share. American will also make a
tender offer for outstanding preferred stock at $27.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Reno Air rose $1.125 cents Thursday, to $7.9375, while
shares of the AMR Corporation, the parent of American, fell $1.625,
to $63.125.
</P>
<P>
   The board of Reno Air has recommended that holders tender their
shares, American said, adding that it hoped to complete the
transaction in the first quarter of 1999. American said it would
integrate Reno Air into its operations, ending its status as a
low-fare airline, but would not discuss those plans until federal
regulators approved the deal.
</P>
<P>
   How fast, or even whether, the transaction is completed could
depend on the pilots' unions. Their dissatisfaction with proposed
work rules, pay or seniority has thwarted previous airline
agreements, most recently the proposed marketing agreement between
United Airlines and Delta Air Lines that unraveled after Delta
pilots objected.
</P>
<P>
   The Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 9,000
pilots, pointed out Thursday that the deal required negotiations
among its union, AMR and the Air Line Pilots Association, which
represents Reno Air's pilots. ``A transaction of this magnitude
clearly raises a host of complex issues and will likely take
several months before it is completed,'' the association said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Cox, a captain who is the spokesman for the Reno Air
pilots, said the outlook for the purchase ``looks favorable.'' But
he also said, ``Of course, we will carefully consider the potential
effects of the acquisition, if any, on our pilots' job security and
seniority.''
</P>
<P>
   Both airlines said there was almost no overlap on their routes.
Since 1993 they have had a marketing partnership that includes
making American's frequent-flier miles available to Reno Air
passengers. The partnership helped American maintain a stronger
presence on the West Coast after closing its hub in San Jose,
Calif., in 1993 in the face of stiff competition from the low-fare
Southwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Though American, which is based in Fort Worth, has a strong
East-West route system, it has relatively few North-South flights
in the West. By contrast, Reno Air's 16-city route system extends
largely from Oklahoma City to Anchorage and includes service to
Tucson, Ariz.; San Diego; Los Angeles; San Francisco; Portland,
Ore., and Seattle. It also serves San Jose, subleasing the gates
formerly operated by American. The airline, which owns two jets and
leases 25 aircraft, employs 2,000 workers. American expects to hire
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Carty, chairman of AMR, said the acquisition would
also strengthen American's global network by bolstering existing
foreign airline partners.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Air, which has gone through several reorganizations and
downsizings in its six-year history and lost $11.6 million last
year, has a joint marketing agreement with Canadian Airlines, which
is 33 percent owned by AMR. It also has code-share agreements with
Qantas and Hawaiian Airlines and an agreement with American Eagle,
AMR's regional carrier, to sell seats on each other's flights.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is optimistic about the proposed acquisition.

   ``American and Reno Air are both good airlines, but the purchase
doesn't make sense except for the shareholders of Reno,'' said
Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group, an aviation consulting
and research company in Evergreen, Colo. ``For less than $124
million, American could have filled that gap on its own. As it is,
it's getting low-yield routes that are dominated by Southwest and a
fleet that is modern but doesn't always match American's.''

POLITICAL RIFT ON SOCIAL SECURITY HIGHLIGHTED AT HOUSE HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (bl) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration and the Republican
leadership in Congress say they are ready to take on the complex
and politically sensitive job of reshaping the Social Security
system for the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, however, they cannot agree on how to begin, much less
on the substance of a deal. And their differences about how to
attack the issue, and who should control the agenda, were on full
display Thursday at a hearing convened by the House Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the chairman of the committee, said
President Clinton should make a detailed proposal for how to shore
up Social Security for the looming retirement of the baby boom
generation. Only with strong leadership by the president, Archer
said, could Congress put aside its fear of the political
consequences of revamping one of the nation's most successful and
popular government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If President Clinton believes he can get this done without his
leadership or without a specific plan, I believe he will be making
the biggest miscalculation of his presidency,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as only President Richard M. Nixon, a Republican, could
visit China and move toward a ``normalization'' of relations, ``you
alone as a Democrat can change the course of Social Security,''
Archer said in an appeal to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Archer also upbraided the administration for rebuffing his
request that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin appear at the hearing
and instead sending a lower-ranking official, David Wilcox,
assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic affairs. Rubin's
failure to attend, Archer said, ``begins the process on the wrong
note.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials bristled at Archer's implicit challenge to
their political courage. But the White House stuck to its position
that it would be counterproductive for the president to lay out a
plan now, saying that anything labeled as a Clinton plan would
inevitably draw partisan criticism and poison the debate before it
really got going.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, administration officials want to develop a bipartisan
negotiating process in the hope of drafting a proposal that could
win support from both parties in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been the president's judgment thus far that for us to
put out a plan would not have been helpful and could have served to
polarize the debate,'' Wilcox told the hearing. ``He will continue
to review on an ongoing basis whether proposing a specific plan
would help move the process forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been meeting regularly with his economic advisers in
recent weeks to review the complex array of options for making sure
that Social Security can weather the retirement of 76 million baby
boomers, starting in a little more than a decade. Without any
changes, the system will run short of the money to pay all promised
benefits in 2031.
</P>
<P>
   Two basic approaches are under consideration. One, favored by
most but not all Democrats, would keep intact the system used since
Social Security was created in 1935, under which current workers
pay the benefits for current retirees through payroll taxes. The
other, backed by most Republicans, would move toward a system in
which workers would invest part of their payroll taxes in
individual accounts to help pay for their own retirements.
</P>
<P>
   So far, administration officials said, Clinton has not settled
on either approach or the dozens of variants. The administration
plans to see how much common ground there might be in a White House
conference on the issue scheduled for Dec. 8 and 9, which will
include a day of closed-door negotiations between members of both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's statements Thursday seemed to reflect mounting
Republican frustration with the way the president has controlled
the Social Security debate so far.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's demand at the beginning of the year that Congress set
aside federal budget surpluses until Social Security has been fixed
thwarted Republican tax-cutting efforts and gave Democrats a potent
issue in the congressional election campaigns. Yet the president
has held himself above the fray as both Democrats and Republicans
debated specific options that could have painful political
repercussions.

PATRIOTS OWNER SIGNS TENTATIVE AGREEMENT WITH CONNECTICUT

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Under another golden dome 99 miles from Beacon
Hill, an emotional Robert Kraft Thursday signed a tentative
agreement with state officials to move the New England Patriots
football team, its corporate offices and practice facilities to a
new $350 million publicly financed stadium here.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Connecticut Legislature has to approve the
Memorandum of Understanding in a special session before Dec. 31, a
confident Governor John Rowland called the deal a ``turning point
that will propel this state into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   In an austere judiciary room at the state Capitol, Patriots
owner Kraft, with tears in his eyes and pen in hand, signed the
agreement with Rowland. There was a crush of reporters in front of
the two men _ said to have a warm relationship _ and a pack of
giddy legislators and business leaders at their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Having lawmakers smiling behind him was a symbol that did not
escape Kraft, who has sought approval for several stadium deals on
Beacon Hill in Boston over the last few years, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a sliver of skepticism in the Legislature here
about the extravagant terms of the agreement and some concern that
the state is nearing its financing limit, support is generally
strong and bipartisan, a stark contrast to many other high-profile
redevelopment projects Rowland has attempted to spearhead that were
rejected by the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do it before the end of the year,'' said
Democratic Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, a Republican keenly aware that he did not need another
public embarrassment, negotiated with the Patriots in secret for
several weeks, then quietly lobbied senators and representatives
one on one, winning their casual approval.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both sides sewed up the deal at about 1:45 a.m.
Thursday. A little more than 12 hours later, the Hartford Courant
issued an extra edition. ``Touchdown!'' its headline screamed.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has placed in an escrow account $2 million he would
forfeit if he negotiates with any other state while the Connecticut
House and Senate debate the measure. But neither Rhode Island nor
Massachusetts voiced interest in making other offers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one more cautious than I am,'' Rowland said at the
announcement. ``But let's seize the moment. Let's make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kraft: ``I signed an agreement. I'm going to live by it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Connecticut Legislature approves the terms by Dec. 31,
the 30-year lease deal is said to be binding.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kraft conceded that if lawmakers significantly alter
the understanding, the agreement would evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are material changes to the MOU we can't live with,
yes,'' Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci, who held a press
conference in New Orleans where he is attending the Republican
Governor's Association conference, said he was troubled his
homestate lawmakers could not compromise on bills that would have
kept the Patriots in their hometown of Foxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have been able to work it out,'' Cellucci said.
``But I would not have recommended the deal Connecticut was willing
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford deal would require Kraft to pay $50 million to
build, own, and operate a hotel to accompany a planned convention
center. He would also spend another $20 million to build and own an
NFL entertainment theme complex and $5 million for a downtown
wellness center, which would include sports rehabilitation services
with team doctors and an athletic facility open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Connecticut would issue bonds to build a $265 million
68,000-seat open-air stadium with 6,000 premium club seats and
between 125 and 150 luxury boxes. The state would also pay for
another $90 million in infrastructure, parking and transportation
improvements around the site which would also support a proposed
convention center.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is part of a $1 billion downtown revitalization
project known as Adriaen's Landing, which sits along the
Connecticut River at the crossroads of interstates 89 and 91.
</P>
<P>
   The state would pay for any cost overruns associated with time
delays in stadium construction; the team would pay for overruns
associated with design changes, according to Kraft's son, Jonathan.
</P>
<P>
   The 17,000 current season ticket holders are guaranteed first
options to renew at the new facility in the same general location
as their existing seats at Foxboro Stadium, one of the oldest
facilities in the NFL. And instead of aluminum bleachers, every
seat would have a chairback in the Hartford stadium, Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   The team would share the facility with the University of
Connecticut football team, upgrading its program to Division 1-A.
The Patriots would also provide coaching assistance to the Huskies,
under the terms of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland insists that the deal's 10 percent ticket tax on all
stadium events would primarily cover the debt service on the
football facility. The team also generates nearly $10 million a
year in Bay State taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft would keep all stadium revenue, including valuable
concessions and ticket proceeds, except for UConn or
state-sponsored events. He would receive naming rights, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said resolutely Thursday that he would not relocate
the San Jose Clash soccer team he just purchased, part of the
agreement calls for Kraft to study the feasibility of bringing
professional soccer to the proposed facility.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Revolution soccer team, which plays at Foxboro
Stadium, would remain there, Kraft said, along with concerts.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots and UConn would move to the stadium in late summer
of 2001. A year later, New England would relocate its practice
facilities to Connecticut. The team's summer training camp will
remain in Smithfield, R.I., at least for now, Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said he met with NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue in New
York Wednesday and was told the league would not try to block the
move, nor would another franchise be granted for the region.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Rowland said the young Republican governor
carefully planned his courting of Kraft. First, they say, Rowland
presented himself as the man in charge -- playing off of Kraft's
frustration with Cellucci, who was boxed in by House Speaker Thomas
M. Finneran, who almost single-handedly blocked stadium legislation
on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Rowland made Kraft believe that he could be part of the
revitalization of Hartford, a city with a boarded up office tower
in Constitution Plaza, as part of a grand civic gesture.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of downtown Thursday, residents expressed a sense
of ennui, having seen the Hartford Whalers hockey team leave the
city and the Patriots flirt with moving there before.
</P>
<P>
   But those inside the Capitol were jubilant, especially Rowland,
who wants the project to be his legacy. Kraft said his wish was not
to sell the team, but to keep it in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland and Kraft hit it off, successfully using each other to
fulfill those goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kraft seems to be someone who wants love and respect. So here
was this funny, attractive governor who says, `Come on over to the
mansion. You can be one of the people to bring this city back. This
is my legacy, and you can be a big part of it,' '' said Christopher
Healy, a Hartford lobbyist and an operative in the Connecticut
Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny part about it is, we've always thought of
Massachusetts as a one-party state where the leaders sit around a
table and do a deal. And here we took a page right out of the
Beacon Hill playbook, and beat them at it,'' Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   When Rowland introduced Kraft at the press conference, the team
owner received hoots and rousing applause from many in the room.
Kraft was clearly taken aback by the reception. His eyes welled
with tears. He looked over at his son, Jonathan, who was also
struggling with his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly bittersweet,'' the elder Kraft said. ``Getting
the greeting here that we got. You really overwhelm me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan later added: ``It's nice to feel wanted. There are some
people who don't believe a football team _ even with a
privately-financed stadium _ is worth having...People put aside
small, parochial issues to get this done.''

   JERUSALEM _ Israel is to start transferring 200 square miles of
the northern West Bank to Palestinian control by early Friday
morning, in line with a Cabinet decision Thursday giving final
clearance to the first of three pullbacks under the new peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army is preparing to withdraw from 7 percent of the
West Bank now under joint control and to transfer another 2 percent
to Palestinian civil control. The territory is mostly rural land
between Jenin and Nablus, sparsely populated by about 30 villages
and towns.
</P>
<P>
   In Qabatiya, one of two large towns there, Mayor Muhammad
Ibrahim Abu Rab said there were no specific plans yet for a
celebration. No one knew what would happen and when it would
happen, he said. The town of 17,000 residents is already under
Palestinian civil control, but the Israelis will turn security
control over to the Palestinian police. Since they do not operate a
base there, though, there will be no visible withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be able to tell that we are liberated until we get a
call from the Palestinian authorities,'' Abu Rab said. ``When we
get the instructions, then we will hold a rally and decorate the
town. Everyone is waiting for this, waiting to be free of the
Israelis. The troops have made their last raids here, their last
arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor of the Jenin region, Zuhair Manasra, said Israeli
and Palestinian officials would tour the area together Friday,
marking borders and deciding where checkpoints will be placed.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal will be Israel's first from the West Bank since
it pulled out of most of the now divided town of Hebron in early
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet's go-ahead presented a clear sign that the
implementation of the peace plan was under way after weeks of delay
and bellicose statements.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cabinet ministers granted only lukewarm backing to the
first withdrawal, the latest indication of Netanyahu's tenuous
control over his government. They voted 7-5 to start the land
transfer with three abstentions _ including Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky, who helped negotiate the U.S.-brokered agreement _ and
two absences.
</P>
<P>
   In authorizing the transfer, the Cabinet accepted generally that
the Palestinians had lived up to their security commitments to
date, among them the broadcast of decrees outlawing incitement and
ordering the surrender of illegal weapons to the authorities. Also,
an executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization has
reaffirmed the annulment of clauses in the Palestinian covenant
calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But some ministers said there was insufficient evidence of the
Palestinian assertion that they had arrested more than a dozen
fugitives wanted by the Israelis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Cabinet also approved the opening of the Palestinian airport
in Gaza, which is expected by Sunday, when Royal Air Maroc is
scheduled to make the inaugural landing with a planeload of
Moroccan officials.
</P>
<P>
   And it authorized the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners from
Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been complicated negotiations with the
Palestinians over the individual prisoners to be released. Israel
said it would free only those ``without blood on their hands.'' It
plans to include 150 common criminals in the first group, against
the Palestinians' protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think Yasser Arafat went to Wye Plantation to free car
thieves?'' said Ahmed Tibi, a senior aide to Arafat, the
Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have refused the list, but the Israelis plan to
drop off the released prisoners at military checkpoints between
Israel and the Palestinian territories Friday morning, said Hisham
Abdul Raza, the Palestinian minister of prisoner affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky said he had abstained from voting _ surprising
Netanyahu _ because he preferred to wait until the issue of the
prisoners had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to wait for 12 or 24 more hours,'' Sharansky said
on Israeli radio. ``If tomorrow we release 250 prisoners and Arafat
says he can't accept them, what then?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If now, during the easy part, we don't close the gaps, every
gap we don't close now will become an explosive that will blast the
entire agreement,'' Sharansky said.

 &HT;    TEXANS ON JUDICIARY PANEL VARY ON WATERGATE COMPARISONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Both Texans on the House Judiciary Committee
offered comparisons to the 1974 impeachment proceedings against
President Nixon, but they took predictably divergent tacks Thursday
in their dealings with independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Lamar Smith of San Antonio quoted Watergate
special counsel Leon Jaworski in giving Starr an opportunity to
bolster his charges that President Clinton abused his executive
privilege. Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston cited the
unlimited time given Nixon's attorneys to rebut the impeachment
allegations and said Clinton's lawyers were ``bound and gag(ged)''
with their limit of 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With only five minutes allotted to each committee member for
questioning Starr, neither Texan, nor any other representative, was
able to make a rhetorical splash Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee tried twice, in the midst of Starr's testimony, to
stop his references to the Whitewater land deal and other matters
that he has probed during his 4 1/2 years as independent counsel.
None of those other matters, including the firing of the White
House travel office and the collection of FBI background files on
the staff of former President Bush, led to charges of impeachable
offenses by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this testimony is inappropriate,'' Jackson Lee said as
Starr began to describe his investigations. ``I do not have before
me a referral from Mr. Starr or any of his deputies on the question
of Whitewater, Filegate or Travelgate. ...This testimony is not
germane, and it is a denial of due process.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee was overruled by committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., who reminded her that the impeachment inquiry authorized by
the House had a ``wide-open range.''
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Starr referred to the other investigations to
bolster his contention that Clinton and his lawyers engaged in a
pattern of obstruction, including frivolous claims of executive
privilege on behalf of White House employees.
</P>
<P>
   Smith seized on the alleged abuses of executive privilege,
asserting that Clinton and his lawyers ``knew that their claims of
executive privilege were not legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith went on to ask Starr about a passage in Jaworski's book,
``The Right and the Power,'' in which the Watergate prosecutor
described evidence that Nixon conspired with others to commit
perjury, including encouraging false testimony by his aides: ``For
the No. 1 law enforcement officer of the country, it was, in my
opinion, as demeaning an act as could be imagined,'' Jaworski
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Smith then asked Starr, ``Do you think that passage ... has
application to the case at hand?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' Starr said, pausing to say the final judgment belongs
to the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that Mr. Jaworski, were he alive today, would say:
If lying to the American people is grounds for impeachment _ as he
thought it was, I believe _ he would say lying under oath is as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``But again,'' Starr said to the members of the Judiciary
Committee, ``it's your judgment.''

WHITE HOUSE ASSAILS IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House Thursday unleashed a stinging
critique of the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearings,
calling them ``bitterly partisan'' and ``profoundly unfair,'' and
the allegations unworthy of spurring a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton's personal and White House lawyers
traveled to Capitol Hill to watch as he became only the third US
president in history to face impeachment hearings, Clinton was
asleep a continent and many times zones away in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   He slept through most of the daylong hearings, but caught a
snippet of it when he awoke, said Nanda Chitre, a White House
spokeswoman. ``He was watching CNN International and it was
obviously part of their news. He saw a clip on it. That's as much
of it as he saw,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The president, on the start of a five-day trip to Asia focusing
on the world economic crisis, left it to his lawyers to knock down
the case for impeachment laid out by independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr before the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers ridiculed Starr's two-hour opening statement,
describing it as a rehash of the 400-plus-page referral he sent to
Congress in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been more theatrics and partisan than substance or of
historical consequence,'' said White House lawyer and spokesman
James Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He offered no new evidence, no new information, and no new
explanations for his tactics,'' said White House special counsel
Gregory Craig.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process, unfortunately, remains bitterly partisan and, in
our view, profoundly unfair to the president,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's senior adviser Paul Begala said White House aides were
relying on the public to conclude, as they had, that the hearings
were unfair and the allegations surrounding the president's
relationship with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky
unworthy of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Democrats controlled the Congress and a Republican
president was being investigated, the impeachment proceeding was
remarkable for its bipartisanship,'' Begala said. ``But these
hearings, these preceedings the Republicans have carried on have
been remarkably partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would point out that in the past, secret grand jury material
was not released to the press,'' he said. ``In the past, the
president's attorneys had a chance to review allegations and
documents and to cross-examine witnesses. None of that is the case
in these proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   But White House aides made much of the fact that Starr concluded
he found no evidence of wrongdoing by the president in his original
probe of the Whitewater land deal or the White House acquisition of
the FBI files of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only new thing that he offered is, finally and belatedly,
he cleared the president and the first lady with respect to two of
his investigations,'' Craig said. ``This should have been done
many, many months ago, if not years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The start of the hearings marked another step toward the
impeachment of the president, a step that many White Houses aides
hoped would never happen, but always knew it would. ``I would not
characterize it as a day of dread. Frankly, it doesn't rise to that
level of concern,'' Kennedy said. ``It's a very serious matter, but
it's also been a very partisan matter.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been his modus operandi during the 11 months of the
unfolding Lewinsky scandal, Clinton was far away from Washington
Thursday. It is a familiar story. After testifying via videotape to
the Starr grand jury, leaving for vacation on Martha's Vineyard and
other than a brief return to Washington after the US bombed
Afghanistan and the Sudan staying away with travel to Russia and
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was in Florida for Democratic fundraising on Sept. 9,
the day Starr delivered his referral to Congress. When his
videotaped testimony to the Starr jury was released Sept. 21, he
was in New York addressing the United Nations. And Oct. 2, when the
House Judiciary Committee released a three-book volume of
supplemental material to the Starr report, Clinton was in Cleveland
and Philadelphia raising money for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And, just hours before the start of the impeachment hearings he
landed in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a long schedule of his events, and the
president is just doing his job, and that's what he American people
want him to do,'' Kennedy said, explaining Clinton's travels.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clinton slept through the beginning of the hearings, he
was briefed on it through his aides back in Washington, because
aides accompanying him in Tokyo had themselves slept through them.
</P>
<P>
   And even there, he could not get away from the trouble his
relationship with Lewinsky has caused. At a town hall style meeting
Thursday, a Japanese housewife said she would never be able to
forgive her husband for doing what Clinton did with Lewinsky. She
asked the president how did he apologize to Mrs. Clinton and
Chelsea and did they forgive him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I did it in a direct and straightforward manner, and I
believe they did, yes,'' Clinton responded. ``But that's really a
question you could ask them better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the pressures of his job at another point in the
meeting, Clinton offered: ``Of course, sometimes you want to get
away from it.''

<P>
   TOKYO _ Not even in Japan could President Clinton escape a
Monica Lewinsky question.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-something Osaka housewife participating via video in a
nationally televised town hall meeting Thursday with Clinton asked
a question many a spouse on both sides of the world might raise.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of two greeted Clinton politely enough: ``So nice to
meet you, or talk to you. I have a question regarding Miss Monica
Lewinsky. How did you apologize to Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea?''
</P>
<P>
   And she also added her own thoughts: ``And I feel I would never
be able to forgive my husband for doing that, but did they really
forgive you, Mr. President?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared to listen carefully and answer slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I did it in a direct and straightforward manner, and I
believe they did, yes,'' Clinton said, as the studio audience at
the Tokyo Broadcasting Systems laughed aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's really a question you could ask them better than
me,'' he said referring to his wife and daughter. First lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton did not accompany the president on his
five-day tour of Japan, South Korea and Guam. She's in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   The television host jumped in quickly, ``Let's change the topic
now. Now our bilateral relations is the most important of all ...
''
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky question was the most pointed of the 60-minute
session with Clinton. The first question from the host was whether
Clinton received good grades as a child.
</P>
<P>
   That softball was followed by a question of how involved Clinton
was in raising Chelsea, a request for tips about public speaking
and just how he motivates himself to work so hard.
</P>
<P>
   A businessman also wondered, ``Out of all the dishes that your
wife cooks, what do you like best, and how much do you eat with
your family a month? How many times do you eat with your family a
month?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he and the first lady always have dinner together
when they are both in town. (He did not correct the businessman's
perception that perhaps the first lady, and not the team of White
House chefs, prepares the meals.) Clinton said his favorite food
was chicken enchiladas ``although I like sushi, too.''

STADIUM SAGA PITTED PRINCIPLE, NFL ECONOMICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Should carry analysis slug)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the final analysis, the saga of the New England
Patriots was a contest between House Speaker Thomas Finneran's
principles and NFL economics.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it's no surprise the Patriots will move to Hartford. Simply
put, though Finneran always treated Patriots owner Robert Kraft's
flirtation with other cities as a bluff, it was never an empty
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Basic laws of supply and demand dictated that. Football
franchises are in short supply, while the desire for teams has
never been greater.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doubted that Kraft had other options need only have
cast a glance at the game of musical cities the NFL has become in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Or at incredibly generous stadium deals like the one Denver
voters approved two weeks ago, in which taxpayers will pick up $270
million of the $360 million cost of a new stadium for the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Yet from the beginning, Finneran treated Kraft as a
four-flusher.
</P>
<P>
   His message to the Patriots chief was not only blunt, but
occasionally tinged with antagonism: Here's my best offer, take it
or leave it.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Kraft left it.
</P>
<P>
   And why shouldn't he? For those watching the celebratory
announcement of the Patriot's prospective relocation to Hartford,
it quickly became obvious Connecticut and its capital city offered
Kraft something he never really got in Massachusetts:
</P>
<P>
   1) A heartfelt welcome.
</P>
<P>
   2) A political leadership united in its desire to help the team.
</P>
<P>
   3) A business community willing to use its muscle to make a deal
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kraft was widely hailed as a hero when he brought the
Patriots four years ago, none of those conditions were ever truly
obtained here.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, both Governor Cellucci, away at the Republican
Governors Association Conference in New Orleans, and Senate
President Thomas Birmingham both pointed at the House as the
deal-breaker, and properly so.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci and Birmingham both brokered agreements that would have
kept the Patriots in Massachusetts, if only the House had agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Further, according to Birmingham, the Senate package would only
have cost the state $100,000 more per year than the House's offer.
</P>
<P>
   And for a net of $2.3 million in state assistance per year for
20 years, the Patriots would have built a $200 million stadium --
the largest private development project since International Place.
</P>
<P>
   The deal made even better sense, Birmingham said Thursday, when
once considers that the Patriots generate about $10 million yearly
in gross tax revenues for Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   For all Finneran's talk of priorities, it's not as if state
policy-makers face an anguished tug-of-war over each dollar of tax
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the state is awash in money, so much that lawmakers
have struggled to find way to spend it all. Even after a state
budget that grew by 6.5 percent this year, the limits of what
fiscal experts say is affordable, lawmakers were still able to
plunk an additional $200 million into the state's rainy-day fund _
and then offer a cool $1 billion in tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   There was still so much cash left over that the Legislature
rushed through $400 million in one-time spending on new pet capital
projects, $200 million of which Cellucci deemed ill-founded enough
to veto.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, an additional $100,000 a year to work a
stadium deal seems like short dollars to keep an NFl franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire Thursday, Finneran took aim both at Kraft and the NFL
economics. The Speaker thinks owners are greedy and disloyal to the
fans who support them, that salaries are vastly inflated, and that
tickets are out of range of the average family.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt much of that is true. But it's also the reality of
today's NFL.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how stinging his critique, Finneran can no more
change those forces than King Canute could command the tides.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Canute understood as much. Thursday, it
was still not clear Finneran does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league should change their rules before they expect
Massachusetts taxpayers to subsidize irrational economic
decisions,'' Finneran said. ``That's what it comes down to.''
</P>
<P>
   That, certainly, is the Mass-o-centric view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But what it really comes down to is this: The NFL is a franchise
owner's market, which means that, like it or not, a state has to
pay to play.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Finneran chose to cling to his principles, saying
that to do otherwise would be to set a precedent that would require
the state to build a new home for the Red Sox, and to bail out any
other business that applies.
</P>
<P>
   But as they look at what might have been, voters may well ask
whether one man's political principle should loom so large --
particularly when the fiscal principal seemed so small.

this article follows the main story.) 
(bl) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A reviewer tends to write as if he's the only member
of the audience at a musical performance. But, of course, he's not.
</P>
<P>
   As Christopher Small points out in ``Musicking: The Meanings of
Performing and Listening,'' a new book that's fantastically useful
for anyone who has ever wondered why a fan should go to a concert
instead of just hearing records at home, ``Music is not a thing at
all but an activity.''
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't agree more. The wonderful thing about so many
performances is the two-way ritual, which begins as soon as an
audience member arrives at the theater or club and the musician
arrives on stage, and it includes everything that happens in the
room that evening. Both audience and performers, in Small's term,
are ``musicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the interaction is the show, as it is at the quickly
growing number of D.J. performances in which a top-name disk jockey
spends the evening segueing other people's records together, with a
few of his own recorded sounds mixed in. Other times, the audience
offers inspiration or instant criticism. And sometimes the scene
itself is as much an event as the music.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, is a random sampling of recent events in downtown
Manhattan clubs, with a focus on the audience, the scene, the vibe,
the mood in the room, rather than on just the music and players.
</P>
<P>
   The Basement Club
</P>
<P>
   At Zinc Bar, on Houston Street, the wine-red space is so small _
about the size of a school bus _ that two things are guaranteed:
The club is always crowded and the music always sounds vivid. Zinc
is the closest I've come to hearing live music as if it's on
headphones, though the environment does not feel sealed-off or
churchlike.
</P>
<P>
   Guitarist Ron Affif has begun the first of three sets with his
trio at 11 every Monday night for nearly three years. I'm sitting
at the corner of the bar, a foot and a half away from Jeff Watts'
crash cymbal; across Watts' head and 10 feet on the other side,
peering through a wall opening that looks as if it once was a
window, is the alert face of the trumpeter Roy Hargrove, who's
there to take in the music.
</P>
<P>
   Each time I return to Zinc, whose bookings run heavily toward
jazz guitarists and Brazilian singers, it strikes me that the music
feels workshoplike; since the crowd is more or less in the
musicians' laps and comes to socialize, there's a feeling that
nothing can go wrong, and this infects the performance in all sorts
of positive ways. Music loses its shell here; it never sounds like
what the same musicians play on records. There are experiments,
too. During one visit, three guitarists take the floor at the same
time, playing Sonny Rollins' ``Pent-Up House'' in three-part
harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Affif turns toward the musicians to play, as if he's rehearsing,
not performing. James Genus, the bassist, sits down for the sets;
Watts, a loud and transfixing drummer, fouls up an elaborate fill
in an exploded version of the Irving Berlin song ``Cheek to
Cheek,'' but laughs it off, rolling his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd _ a mixture of Houston Street habitues and middle-aged
music lovers who you don't see in other clubs _ talks to the
musicians, not just in between sets but in between songs as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Abstract Vibe
</P>
<P>
   At Orchard Bar, one of the long, skinny rooms lining Orchard
Street on the Lower East Side, I'm struck at first by the reverse
of the normal setup. DJ Firehorse is spinning records a few feet in
from the door; a line of listeners, snaking toward the back of the
bar, stand in place, eyes focused nowhere in particular, listening
to the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick around,'' says Howard Goldkrand, the organizer of the
bar's Tuesday night attraction, Abstract Future Lounge. ``I just
got back from doing a show at the Ludwig Museum in Cologne, and I
got a bunch of weird records in editions of, like, 200. I'm going
to be playing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Abstract Future Lounge is one arm of the DJ collective known as
Cultural Alchemy, dedicated to fomenting all sorts of ambient sound
experiences all over New York. It offers experimental music that
buzzes, crackles and yawns, and it converges disparate sounds _
everything but proceeding in a straight line of funky beats, though
it does some of that, too. When one of its events becomes too
associated with one club, the vibe is gone; Abstract Future Lounge
is looking to chase the vibe westward, possibly to Tribeca.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Orchard Bar is crowded, music is a solitary
experience here, with the audience focusing on the music, not on
each other. The Cultural Alchemy DJs take their own bass speaker to
clubs, and for tonight they have positioned it in the back of the
bar, where the comfortable chairs are; if you're not standing by
the bar, listening intently, you're in the back, letting the thick
bass rattle your sternum.
</P>
<P>
   The VIP Room
</P>
<P>
   At Life, on Bleecker Street, a very different notion of a party
is taking place. The main dance floor is pounding with strobes and
house music. Beyond that are a series of crowded lounges, each a
little more exclusive than the last.
</P>
<P>
   But the small VIP room is the highest level. Music is an
integral part of the experience there, though nobody remembers the
music. It's a private nook for fashion models; chatting at their
tables, they display a sense of giddiness, as if they are hiding
from the world, in a way rarely seen except in the faces of
children going out to their clubhouse in the backyard after dinner.
</P>
<P>
   It's midnight on a Tuesday, and the party is just trickling
together. The lights are on just enough so that the colors of your
outfit can be appreciated; an empty champagne ice-bucket stands by
all of the couches and coffee tables that line the walls, and
Grandmaster Flash is playing old disco records while the guests
file in. Nobody takes the tables close to the stage. Each table
seems to have a male mascot, dressed in Savile Row fop clothes or
the exaggerated, outdated B-boy chic of Kangol hats and warm-up
suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's watching me,'' sings Michael Jackson from the
turntables, like a sly subtext to the peacocking. Grandmaster Flash
scratches a record in double-strokes a couple of times to jolt the
crowd _ chucka chucka _ and something happens, a few bodies stir.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the most attractive men and women _ none of whom seem
like couples _ get up to dance in front in tightly controlled
movements with their arms in the air. They're not more than a few
feet away from their tables. As she has been doing all night, the
hostess walks up and down the dance floor, patrolling for unused
tables, waiting for the call to come from the front door that Naomi
or Puff has arrived. The red light on her walkie-talkie keeps
flickering at the side of one's vision like a firefly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Amateur Satire
</P>
<P>
   There's an impressive buzz around town about karaoke night at
the Elbow Room, on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village. It's a new
place where baby celebrities and rock musicians hang out to be
goofy, a post-nightclub culture kind of thing. Housed in the old
Bleecker Street Cinema, it's a high-ceilinged beer hall with the
old-pine-and-popcorn smell common to Bleecker Street bars.
</P>
<P>
   As I walk in, Jake Fogelnest, the former host of MTV's ``Squirt
TV,'' takes the stage and performs a version of Lisa Loeb's
``Stay'' but turns it from a cute wry song into heavy rock
catharsis, jumping off risers and getting down on his knees. What's
charming about the crowd is that it politely pays attention _ but
only as much as the performance merits and no more.
</P>
<P>
   Karaoke here provokes a deep desire: Performance! In front of
the Right People! And though many of the performances are
flamboyant, involving guitar solos on broomsticks and mad
screeching, they are easy to ignore. The visuals behind the words
on screen, often the kind of dull nature scenes that pass as segue
material in pornography, are astonishingly easy to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   The master of ceremonies, Russell, a perpetually animated funny
man, turns out to be more of a star than any of the performers I
saw in an hour's stretch. Suddenly, a spectator leaps up _ alas,
it's somebody I know _ and the video jukebox starts Guns 'n' Roses'
``Welcome to the Jungle.'' The pinnacle of the performance is a
mock-sexual routine.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this extraordinary display, the atmosphere hasn't
been altered at all; everyone is thinking about the next performer,
whom they look at for about 10 seconds before going back to beer
and conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban Catharsis
</P>
<P>
   On the night of my visit, the second American performance of NG
La Banda, which is the best dance band in Cuba, if not the world,
takes place at S.O.B.'s. It is more than usual a Cuban audience;
the concert hasn't been publicized, and even the New York-based
record company that distributes the band's latest album hasn't been
alerted to it.
</P>
<P>
   A row of home-tapers with video cameras lines up in front of the
stage, and the perimeters of the club are alive with couples
dancing. The main throng fills the dance floor, and choruses are
chanted in unison. This is a performance where solos are events,
not formalities; the band forms columns around the soloist and
claps in time. It is an intensely social scene, but the music
strongly dictates when you can talk. Sung verses are chatting
moments, but when the band's stunning montuno section kicks in,
there is nothing to do but watch and move.
</P>
<P>
   In lightning-fast patter, the bandleader, Jose Luis Cortes,
looks for audience members from Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican
Republic. And when the band starts ``Santa Palabra,'' a song urging
you to throw away bad energy, the crowd follows all the body
language of the singers. At this point, a blind man, trailed by his
female companion, circles the floor, shaking his walking stick in
the air; as everyone gets a glimpse of him, he becomes part of the
kaleidoscopic performance.
</P>
<P>
   A Cubanophile friend turns to me and gives the nod. ``Now we're
in Havana,'' he says. Only a beloved institution can set off an
environment this urgently joyous; the members of the audience have
gone there to be, in the deepest sense, who they are.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian Heat
</P>
<P>
   Less of a grab-you-by-the-throat experience but equally
high-spirited is the Monday night scene at Cafe Wha? on Macdougal
Street. It's Brazil Night, powered by a regular house band of
Brazilians living in New York. The band backs the singer Vanessa
Falabella when she's in town; otherwise, the singers include the
trombone-playing bandleader, Darci, and the singers Barbara Mendes
and Marianne Ebert.
</P>
<P>
   Inhibitions are lost here; the only code is to do what you want
to do, and there's a lazily licentious feeling in the air. At 1:30,
a couple snogs passionately in the narrow space between a
distinguished-looking Brazilian gentleman, sitting at a table, and
the short stage. Others are dancing, eating, passively watching the
show on wall-mounted television monitors. Singing backup behind
Darci on Carlinhos Brown's spitfire-rapping song
``Pandeiro-Deiro,'' Ms. Mendes is thrashing her body, dancing
harder than a musician ought to on a weekly gig in a small bar.
</P>
<P>
   Last-Stop Jazz
</P>
<P>
   If I'm in the mood to wander about, the last stop of the night
is often Smalls, on West 10th Street, where the cigarette smoke is
as condensed as an astronaut's meal, and the lights are so dim that
being there feels like the first stage of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps drawing me back is the old-fashioned sense of
correctness that prevails among the young jazz performers. The
Smalls ethic involves regular microphone breaks to identify tunes
and musicians, and from these performances you can always get a
sense of the esthetic ramparts the bandleaders are climbing this
minute; though more and more, Smalls regulars have been signed to
major labels, performances at the club never feel tied to product.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Rosenwinkel, a guitarist who's soon to issue his first
record on the Impulse label, has wound up his last set at 2:30.
There's a sweet, womblike feeling in the place. A few students have
fallen asleep and lie curled up in corners, while others sit around
bottles of wine in Eskimo hats and Patagonia jackets. Some watchers
move forward and talk shop with Rosenwinkel while the drummer, Tim
Pleasant, meticulously takes apart his drum set. Someone puts a
tape on the house PA; it's Charlie Parker. Two jazz students to my
right jerk awake and sing Parker's wild, fragmented solo, then
shake their heads, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bird played some weird stuff,'' one says.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr's testimony Thursday had two purposes
_ to restore his once shiny professional reputation and to revive
an impeachment inquiry that has lost momentum. On his reputation,
he probably did himself some good. On impeachment there was little
sign he moved anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, the independent counsel had the opportunity to
redeem the prestige he once enjoyed as a persuasive solicitor
general with sterling legal credentials.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing Thursday, Starr went out of his way to speak in
lawyerly, measured tones. His dignified demeanor, which at times
bordered on the pedantic, recalled the days when he argued the
government's cases before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   This Ken Starr was strikingly at odds with the caricature the
White House and its allies have drawn of an overzealous,
sex-obsessed prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Until the hearing, Starr had maintained a subdued silence.
``Second to Monica, he's been the unheard voice in all of this,''
said Bradford A. Berenson, a Washington lawyer who is acquainted
with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   According to Berenson and other friends, the prosecutor had been
looking forward to the hearing as a ``liberating'' moment, a chance
to introduce himself to the public and counter what he sees as an
unfair White House campaign to demonize him.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's personal chore of restoring his professional image was
difficult enough, but the goal committee Republicans set for him
was even harder to achieve. They had hoped that his testimony would
provide fresh grounds and new energy to drive the president from
office. In this mission, Starr seems to have failed. His testimony
offered no new evidence of impeachable offenses by Clinton and even
exonerated him on issues that some Republicans had hoped to pursue,
such as the dismissals of White House travel employees and the
allegations of misuse of the FBI files of government employees.
</P>
<P>
   His long-awaited testimony lacked the electric impact of star
witnesses at past congressional hearings. John Dean, Oliver North
and Clarence Thomas, have been able to shape the public mood with
their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike North, who arrived in uniform and talked in macho terms
about ``being the fall guy'' in the Iran-contra scandal, Starr
talked about Nexis searches and his ``primary factual
investigation.'' There were no dramatic phrases, such as Thomas'
memorable accusation during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing
that the Senate was conducting ``a high-tech lynching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken doesn't talk in sound bites,'' explained Barbara Olson, a
friend and former prosecutor's.
</P>
<P>
   But according to lawyers familiar with his preparation for the
hearing Thursday, Starr had set two goals for his appearance. The
first was to lay out, as clearly and compellingly as possible, the
evidence and factual basis for his legal findings against the
president. The second was to blunt criticisms that his original
impeachment report on the Monica Lewinsky matter, which the
independent counsel sent to Congress on Sept. 9, was too graphic,
too focused on sex.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was at least partly successful. He spent two hours
offering a highly detailed account of the evidence his
investigation has uncovered, shifting the emphasis from sex to
lying. In the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit, Starr said his
evidence suggested that President Clinton had been deliberately
evasive both in his testimony in the lawsuit and before Starr's
grand jury last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also outlined evidence of stonewalling and evasion in
other branches of his investigation, including the Whitewater
matter and alleged efforts by the president's allies to win the
silence of the former Justice Department official Webster Hubbell
by helping him get lucrative retainers after he was forced to
resign from the Justice Department in disgrace. Last week, Starr
indicted Hubbell for a third time and chairman Henry Hyde has
indicated that his committee will delve further into the Hubbell
matter.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence Starr recited did not do much to move his case
beyond perjury, and even some Republicans on the Judiciary panel
seemed unpersuaded that the president's unsuccessful citing of
executive privilege or attorney-client privilege amounted to an
abuse of power.

 WASHINGTON: of power. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As for introducing himself to the public on a more favorable
note, Starr had nowhere to go but up. He went into the hearing
Thursday with a dim, 18 percent public approval rating, according
to a national poll taken a few days ago by CBS News. In the face of
attacks from the White House and leading Democrats, Starr has
maintained a stoic silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken felt he had to make a deliberate choice, not to engage in
the public debate,'' said Terrence B. Adamson, a Democrat and
lawyer who has been close to Starr for almost 30 years. ``It might
not be the right political decision, but it was the right
professional one.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at some points during the long day of testimony, Starr,
whose career has been rooted in the decorum of the law, found
himself the unlikely center of a political rumble.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat down to begin his testimony, he was greeted by
Democrats scrapping with Hyde over how much time Clinton's lawyer
should be granted to question the independent counsel. As Democrats
hurled loaded words such as ``railroad'' and ``gagged'' at Hyde,
Starr sat unblinking, looking slightly out of place.
</P>
<P>
   He remained outwardly unruffled as Democratic counsel Abbe
Lowell grilled him about his office's treatment of Ms. Lewinsky,
although sometimes he seemed evasive. He mostly sidestepped a
barrage of questions from Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., over alleged
leaks to the media from the independent counsel's office. Starr
defended the propriety of his office's conduct, remaining utterly
unemotional and offering few specifics, since there is a pending
investigation of leaks being conducted by a federal special master.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Starr called one of Frank's questions unfair.
``You're the expert on unfair questions,'' Frank retorted.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats used the hearing to question both the fairness of
Starr's investigation and of the Judiciary Committee's impeachment
investigation. Zoe Lofgren, D.-Calif., called the impeachment
proceedings ``embarrassing,'' and other Democrats, including
Lowell, pointedly compared the partisan rancor that has
characterized the investigation of Clinton with the Watergate
inquiry, which proceeded with bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the criticisms of Starr raised by Democrats, including
allegations of leaks, collusion with the lawyers for Mrs. Jones,
and rough treatment of Ms. Lewinsky, were not new.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his two-hour opening statement, the
prosecutor, who once considered a bid for the Republican Senate
nomination in Virginia, claimed that he is not suited for the
political high wire. ``I am not a man of polls, public relations or
politics _ which I suppose is obvious at this point,'' he said. ``I
am not experienced in political campaigns.''

BISHOP URGES POLITICAL SOLUTION TO END EMBARGO AGAINST IRAQ 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The outgoing president of the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops urged Thursday that the world find a way to end
the embargo of Iraq and pursue political, not military solutions to
ongoing tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the conference's 280 prelates, Bishop Anthony M.
Pilla of Cleveland said ``fresh efforts are needed to ease and end
the continuing, unmerited suffering of innocent Iraqi civilians
under U.N. sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's actions are the main cause of the current crisis, Pilla
said in a statement to be circulated to the State Department and
other government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has repeatedly attacked its neighbors and its own people,
has relentlessly pursued _ and used _ weapons of mass destruction,
has consistently defied legitimate U.N. resolutions, and has failed
to use available resources to feed the Iraqi people,'' he said.
Iraq should end internal repression, quit threatening Mideast peace
and accept the United Nations' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest crisis _ ``played out with bombers in the air and
a last-minute response'' _ worries the bishops. While welcoming
Iraq's decision last weekend to accept U.N. inspections and the
United States' suspension of planned air attacks, the bishops
decried the ongoing conflict, reiterating their plea that the
embargo be ``reshaped, reduced and ended quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   They repeatedly have deplored the massive suffering and death of
average Iraqis while trying not to appear politically naive or to
downplay Iraq's role. The conference has issued at least 11 related
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, they have been among human
rights groups reporting that hundreds of thousands of Iraqis,
including children and the elderly, have died of disease and
malnutrition. Such suffering results from the blockade to punish
Iraq for not disarming, a move which has prevented food and medical
supplies from getting to ordinary citizens, the bishops have said.
</P>
<P>
   Their Iraq statement is this week's second clear signal the
bishops would retain an influential voice in public policy. Before
closing their fall session Thursday, the prelates decried racism
and passed a major statement asking that elected officials
experience ``a change of heart'' and stop supporting abortion,
euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Targeting elected Catholic leaders, the bishops' plea raises
their profile in the politically charged abortion debate, outlining
their role as moral leaders called to ``persuade, correct and
admonish'' politicians deviating from church teaching. The
statement directs priests, lay people and the bishops themselves to
speak out in voting and other political arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The conference's newly elected president, Bishop Joseph Fiorenza
of Houston, said both Iraq and the abortion debate have moral
dimensions. ``We feel that it's part of our responsibility as
teachers of the gospel to try to apply the values of the gospel to
these situations.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first speech as president, Fiorenza called for the
bishops, top policy-makers for 60 million American Catholics, to be
examples of ``a dynamic and evangelizing church, committed to the
poor, the immigrant and the oppressed and to the elimination of
racial prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks struck a conciliatory, authoritative note,
emphasizing racial justice, a theme of his 14 years leading more
than 1 million Catholics in the Diocese of Galveston-Houston.
Despite differences, the bishops should work as colleagues, always
loyal to the Vatican, he urged.
</P>
<P>
   As the year 2000 nears, reconciliation and outreach must be
primary goals to ``realize the new springtime of Christianity''
envisioned by Pope John Paul II, Fiorenza said. The pope wants
Catholics worldwide to approach the next millennium with repentance
and renewal, adhering to church teaching, but bridging cultural and
religious differences.

OLD WASHINGTON AND NEW, IN STARK RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
  (Also see IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-ASSESS, IMPEACH-VOICES,
IMPEACH-MEDIA, IMPEACH-WHITEWATER, IMPEACH-SCENE, IMPEACH-SCHUMER,

 By R.W. APPLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was an accident of timing: two events,
coinciding by merest chance, each of which threw the other into
relief.
</P>
<P>
   A little past 10 o'clock Thursday morning on Capitol Hill, with
snarls of hostility worthy of a jungle clearing, Republicans and
Democrats began hearings into possibly impeachable offenses by
President Clinton _ only the third such proceedings in American
history. The hearings were conducted by the House Judiciary
Committee, but their tone was not always judicious. Members
referred to each other as gentlemen, but their language was not
always gentlemanly.
</P>
<P>
   At almost the same moment at the Washington National Cathedral,
a soprano named Ann Gordon stepped into view and began singing the
soaring hymn ``Amazing Grace.'' It was the opening moment of a
memorial service for Clark Clifford, lawyer and adviser to
presidents in a more genteel era in the capital, when a few wise
men like Clifford discreetly ran the show, though not always
wisely, and bipartisanship in the face of powerful enemies abroad
prevailed more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasts were unmistakable _ between the old, cozy
Washington and the new, noisy Washington, between a Washington
where foreign relations mattered most and one where public
relations preoccupies everyone, between a Washington where
compromise was an art form and one where gridlock is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   In the big hearing room in the Rayburn House Office Building,
named for the late House speaker, Sam Rayburn of Texas, a Clifford
friend of long standing, Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
was the protagonist of the impeachment drama. It was rendered
somewhat limp by this month's election results and by the release
on Wednesday evening of his prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Starr cast himself as the moral avenger, the honorable outsider
called in to untangle a web of deceit spun by President Clinton and
his staff.
</P>
<P>
   It is a role that Clifford, for all his acting skills, which
were often praised by professionals, would never have assayed. He
was always Mr. Inside, in fact if not in title, who fixed things
before they became public, before people outside the inner circle
knew that there was anything to fix.
</P>
<P>
   When Clifford came to Washington from St. Louis 53 years ago,
World War II was in its final months. He worked first at the side
of his fellow Missourian, Harry Truman, helping to formulate the
Truman Doctrine, integrate the armed forces and plot the strategy
that led to Truman's memorable upset victory of 1948. He headed the
transition team for President John Kennedy in 1960 and 1961, the
first such group ever assembled. He served as secretary of defense
under President Lyndon Johnson and helped convince him that the
Vietnam War could not be won.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, who delivered one of the tributes to
Clifford, called him ``the single most powerful and effective
catalyst for change'' in the long national debate over Vietnam and
described his success in persuading Johnson to break off the
bombing campaign in North Vietnam as ``one of the great individual
performances in recent American history.''
</P>
<P>
   But all of that came before this city and the nation became
obsessed with round-the-clock radio and television talk shows,
before the culture of investigation flourished here and before
courtliness fled town.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford the lawyer prided himself on his powers of persuasion,
exercised in an office overlooking the White House, far from the
prying eye of the camera. It counted for little whether the person
who needed persuading was a Republican or a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Today cameras wait on the doorstep, and partisan lines are not
only drawn but chiseled. Starr lacks Clifford's persuasive powers.
His speaking style is prissy where Clifford's was magniloquent; his
voice is reedy and sing-song where Clifford's was a deep,
near-hypnotic near-whisper.
</P>
<P>
   That did not much matter, though, because by every indication,
every Republican and every Democrat on the committee had made up
his or her mind long before Starr began to testify. They were not
there to be persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington was a different place 50 years ago, smaller in size
but larger in imagination,'' said Sander Vanocur, the broadcaster,
who gave another of the tributes, ``a place where dreams could be
fashioned into reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The quality that defined Clark Clifford and made his fortune,
the carefully projected aura of prudent deliberation, has gone out
of style on Capitol Hill and in Washington. He pondered;
end-of-century Washington shouts.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, ambassador-designate to the United Nations
and co-author of Clifford's memoirs, spoke of another of the
lawyer's qualities _ ``the most absolute self-control and
self-assurance of anyone I have ever met.'' That preternatural calm
survived even his involvement in a banking scandal late in life.
Robert Bennett, Clifford's lawyer at that time, one of Clinton's
now, recalled recently that in more than 200 meetings to discuss
his defense, Clifford ``never spoke in anything but perfect
sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he lived so long _ he died on Oct. 10 at age 91 _
Clifford outlasted many famous friends and colleagues. That and the
lure of the televised Judiciary Committee hearings, which
fascinated the capital if not the nation at large, kept the crowd
relatively small for a memorial to so famous a man. And a few in
Washington stayed away, if truth be told, because they thought
Clifford had acted unethically if not illegally in the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International episode in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But there were plenty of old associates on hand. George Elsey,
who welcomed him to the White House staff in July 1945, was there,
as was Paul Nitze, the Cold War strategist and diplomat, whose
career also began in the Truman administration.
</P>
<P>
   From the Kennedy era, in addition to Edward Kennedy, came Frank
Mankiewicz, Robert Kennedy's spokesman; from the era of Lyndon
Johnson came Lloyd Hand, a member of the White House staff, and
Barry Zorthian, the American spokesman in Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said there could have been no New Frontier without
Clifford. Holbrooke said there would never be another like him.
</P>
<P>
   The cathedral's dean, the Very Rev. Nathan Baxter, began his
homily by remarking that he had been a private in Vietnam when
Clifford was working to change Johnson's mind. Vice President Al
Gore recalled in his, the fourth of the tributes, that he had met
Clifford for the first time at 12, when his father, the late Sen.
Albert Gore Sr., met regularly at the family apartment with
Clifford and others to plot strategy for John Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an age when America became the indispensable nation,'' the
vice president said, ``Clark Clifford became the indispensable
man.''

COMMENTARY: DON'T BELIEVE IT, KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RUSSELL BAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We will soon be inundated with nonsense about how wonderful it
is to be old. The baby-boom generation, now becoming long in the
tooth, thick in the middle and sparse on the scalp, will demand it.
</P>
<P>
   And who has ever been foolish enough to deny this vast army of
demanders anything it calls for?
</P>
<P>
   Now that it is becoming an army of old crocks, everyone will be
forbidden to say ``old crocks.'' Saying ``old crocks'' will be
politically incorrect and punishable by social exile, just as these
new arrivals in the land of Old Crockdom once exiled their elders
for being ``over 30.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``dotage'' will be stricken from the language when
discussing people who have trouble remembering other people's
names, and sometimes their own.
</P>
<P>
   What a pity. The land of Old Crockdom has surprising
compensations, one of which is the right to say that being in your
dotage excuses you from the obligation to remember who Brad Pitt
is, or to care.
</P>
<P>
   The last attempt to gussy up the language about old age produced
the embarrassingly insincere ``senior citizen.'' This was cooked up
during the 1950s when advertising men were still perfecting the
political art of using words to fool most of the people most of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   A politician referring to the murderous old-crock vote as
``senior citizens'' sounds as insincere as a Junior Chamber of
Commerce striver praising the dignity of labor. I make it a point
always to vote against politicians who do it. Why does no one ever
talk about ``freshmen citizens,'' ``sophomore citizens,'' ``junior
citizens,'' ``postgraduate citizens''?
</P>
<P>
   Lately there has been an intense advertising campaign declaring
that this is ``a great time to be silver.'' This is obviously meant
to assure aging boomers that senility's onset will do wonders for
their appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The silver of the ad slogan is not clearly defined, but I take
it to refer to gray hair. The product being advertised _ what is
it? a vitamin pill? _ obviously works wonders.
</P>
<P>
   The actors who are having a great time being silver look to be
of middle age. I think we are meant to believe that though they may
still look young enough to run the Boston Marathon and finish with
a fast game of squash, they are actually, like Dorian Gray, far
into the Social Security years.
</P>
<P>
   As one who still thinks of baby boomers as ``kids,'' I don't
want them marching into the new century under the delusion that old
age is wonderful. It's not half as bad as it's cracked up to be,
but wonderful it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Check the network news shows right away before advertisers
revise everything to prove that senility is glorious. Since the
news, barring Monica froth, is watched exclusively by graybeards
nowadays, news-show commercials are aimed at selling real-life old
crocks the stuff that helps them make it through the day.
</P>
<P>
   And what are they offered? Nostrums for relieving diarrhea,
constipation, insomnia and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.
Adhesives for keeping dentures in place. Diapers for coping with
incontinence.
</P>
<P>
   Well, every stage of life has its drawbacks. Childhood, which to
a great extent is a prison existence, is ridiculously romanticized
by adults who have been there and ought to know better.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with old age, adolescence is pure horror: pimples,
sexual panic, fear of unpopularity . . . a nightmare. Then 20 years
of keeping up with the Joneses, impressing the boss, being
untrusted by kids because you're over 30. Call that wonderful?
</P>
<P>
   Then on to midlife with its famous crisis, despair,
disappointment, suspicion that life has been wasted.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many rewards for making it to the top of Mount Dotage
is the fresh angle of vision that comes from standing up there on
the top. (Or, more sensibly, sitting on it.)
</P>
<P>
   Crockhood means no longer having to do most of the things you
never really wanted to do when you still thought that doing them
could make each stage of life wonderful at last.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Davis Jr. used to sing ``I've Got to Be Me,'' and Frank
Sinatra musically boasted, ``I Did It My Way.'' Only big shots
could afford to live that way. Old age, however, licenses all of us
to behave just as outrageously as Sammy and Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody annoying you? Just tell him, ``Be off or I'll kick you
downstairs.'' In dotage, you can get away with a lot.

   BOSTON _ Saying that diversity should not be defined strictly by
race, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday that the Boston public
schools' use of race in admissions to the prestigious Latin School
is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic opinion that throws out two decades of race-based
admissions policies at the exam schools, the court ruled that the
school department failed to prove the educational value of
diversity, and that past discrimination is not reason enough to
admit students to the school today based on race. The 2-1 strongly
worded decision immediately called for the case's plaintiff,
10th-grader Sarah Wessmann, who is white, to be admitted to Latin.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston School Department declined to say if it would appeal
the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not appeal, the decision almost certainly means the
overhaul of the admission policy of Boston's three exam schools,
under which currently half of students are admitted based strictly
on scores, the other half based on both race and scores.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also could have implications for the city's entire
student assignment process, and others around the country, because
it uses race in deciding where children go to school. In recent
years, federal courts have increasingly overturned racial quotas,
including several private sector employment and college admission
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed with the result but I am not discouraged
about the strong efforts we made,'' said Boston School
Superintendent Thomas Payzant at a press conference Thursday. ``The
court recognized the values that the school committee and I endorse
_ the commitment to diversity _ that these are noble ends. But the
court was clear no matter how noble the ends, constitutionally
impermissible means do not justify the ends.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a lower court decision six months ago by
U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Tauro that upheld the Latin
admission policy. Tauro had declared that schools have a ``unique''
mission to ensure diversity; that ``diversity in the classroom is
the most effective of all weapons challenging stereotypical
preconceptions.'' Tauro had also agreed with the School Department
that some preferences based on race were needed to counter
lingering effects of past discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision, however, brings Boston's 24-year tumultuous
desegregation history full circle: Then, a federal court ordered
the city to desegregate its exam schools partly because the school
department failed to show that the schools' racial imbalance was
not due to racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the federal court ruled against the school department
because it was unable to show that racial imbalances were a result
of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling caps a three-year long reverse discrimination battle
at the Boston Latin School that involved two admission policies and
two white students, each claiming they were unfairly denied
entrance because they are white. The plaintiff in the first case,
Julia McLaughlin, was admitted two years ago after successfully
challenging an admission policy that automatically set aside 35
percent of all seats for blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The school then revised its policy, admitting half of students
on merit alone and the other half on merit and race. Wessmann, a
close friend of Julia's, challenged this policy after she was
denied entrance as a ninth-grader last year, even though she scored
better than ten minorities who were admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the jubilant lawyer for Wessmann, Julia's father
Michael McLaughlin, said it was time for the school department to
focus on education rather than ``placating groups or being
politically correct'' by admitting students to the exam schools
based on race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is victory number two, but I just hope we stop going down
this road,'' said McLaughlin.``This is something we should not be
fighting. It's clear what the law is.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen when Wessmann, now at Boston Latin Academy
in Roxbury, will enter Boston Latin in the Fenway. School officials
said she could start Friday, but her father, Henry Wessmann, said
he may wait until he can ensure a smooth transition for his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only in this battle for my daughter, and that is still
my goal,'' said Wessmann, an architect from Dorchester. Wessmann
said his daughter was eager to go to Latin School but would miss
her friends and teachers from Latin Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is never easy...I can't help but feel a little sad that
one and a half years is gone for her'' since the case was first
brought, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling Thursday, the appeals court did not dispute the
opinion in Tauro's lower court ruling that diversity can be as
important as academic rigor in preparing students.
</P>
<P>
   Majority judges Michael Boudin and Bruce Selya said that based
on an abstract definition, ``few would gainsay the attractiveness
of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encounters between students of varied backgrounds facilitate a
vigorous exchange of ideas that not only nourishes the intellect
but also furthers mutal understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   But the court said that the School Department did not prove that
simply admitting students based on race achieves these values.
</P>
<P>
   ``The School Committee has provided absolutely no competent
evidence'' that the policy ``is in anyway tied to a vigorous
exchange of ideas,'' the 121-page ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the court indicated the school's definition of
diversity was flawed because it ``focused exclusively on racial and
ethnic diversity'' and took ``into account only five groups _
blacks, whites, Hipanics, Asians and Native Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it did not specify what characteristics about an
applicant should be used to attain diversity, such as income or
gender. It said the School Department has confused ``racial
balancing'' with ``diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also said the school department failed to show
that the exam school admission policy was needed to combat
lingering effects of past discrimination. While an achievement gap
between white and minority students may exist, the court ruled, and
teachers may have lower expectations of minority students, the
School Department gave no concrete evidence that this was because
of past racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting judge Kermit Lipez said while he has doubts about the
School Department's diversity argument, he had ``none about its
remedial argument,'' and favored the admission policy as it stands.
</P>
<P>
   Lipez said that while the majority judges found the combination
of achievement gap statistics and anecdotal evidence the School
Department offered as evidence of the lingering effects of past
discrimination ``unacceptable,'' other courts have accepted similar
evidence as adequate.

U.S. TOBACCO INDUSTRY LOOKS LONGINGLY BUT IN VAIN AT CHINESE
MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (With CHINA-SMOKE)  
(smw) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   As cigarette sales threaten to decline precipitously in the
United States, American tobacco companies are counting on China as
a land of extraordinary potential for growth, business analysts
say. But the American companies' plans are being thwarted by
China's government monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the opportunity for multinational companies is
staggering. ``China is the largest tobacco market in the world,''
said Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst for Salomon Smith Barney,
who estimated that China accounts for 1.75 trillion of the 5
trillion cigarettes sold annually in the world. That's about a
third of global consumption.
</P>
<P>
   But the government tobacco monopoly, the China National Tobacco
Corp., ``is the most profitable corporation in the world,
accounting for 12 percent of the revenue of the Chinese
government,'' said David J. Adelman, a tobacco analyst for Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``It is a highly protected asset that is very
important to the Chinese government.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Adelman said, the tax rate on foreign cigarettes is
230 percent. No more than 40 billion cigarettes, or 2 percent of
those sold in China, come from outside China, according to
analysts' estimates. Of those, most are smuggled into the country,
largely through Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chinese government estimates, only 500 million
foreign cigarettes are legally sold in China; the most popular
brands are State Express 555, made by the British American Tobacco
Co., and the Marlboro brand of Philip Morris Cos.
</P>
<P>
   That corporation, the world's largest cigarette maker, has a won
permission to grow some tobacco and to produce Marlboros for local
sale. And the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., America's second-largest
producer, has a joint venture with the China National Tobacco Corp.
to produce 2.5 billion cigarettes, including its Winston, Camel and
Salem brands.
</P>
<P>
   But experts see little chance for American companies to expand
their operations soon. These companies ``are hoping for the day
when the government liberalizes the market, but that day could well
be more than five years away,'' Feldman said. ``The government has
shown every indication that it wants to keep industry profits to
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, American companies are spending a relatively small
amount, ``in the tens of millions,'' he said, to market their
products to an upscale Chinese clientele using posters, billboards
and music-event and sports sponsorships, including Marlboro's
support of soccer leagues.
</P>
<P>
   American companies are also putting neon advertising signs in
bars and nightclubs. ``Their strategy is to create awareness of the
foreign brands and create demand for them,'' Adelman said.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts are likely to be aggressively pursued, analysts
say, because American companies' need to enter the Chinese market
is growing, since sales in the United States have been declining
modestly. Feldman caused a something of a stir in the tobacco world
Thursday with a prediction that American sales will fall at least
10 percent in 1999 because of price increases brought about by the
anticipated settlement of more than 20 state lawsuits, at a cost to
the companies of $206 billion.

IN JAPAN, CLINTON ANSWERS CITIZENS' QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ President Clinton arrived in Japan on Thursday to push
its leaders for a plan to fix their battered economy. But in a
town-hall-style discussion televised nationwide late Thursday
night, he found himself pressed to justify his own policies on
trade, land mines and Iraq _ and to explain how he apologized to
his wife and daughter for his affair with a former intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I would never be able to forgive my husband for doing
that,'' said his brightly smiling questioner, who identified
herself as a housewife and mother of two from Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's face compressed into a slight frown as the woman,
whose image towered over him on a giant video screen, asked the
question. But he began to smile, if tightly, as he replied that he
had apologized to his family ``in a direct and straightforward
manner,'' and his smile broadened as he added that he believed they
had forgiven him.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, still a giant presence via a live video hookup from
Osaka, smiled even more brightly and repeatedly bowed as the
president answered. ``Let's change the topic now,'' the moderator
suggested briskly.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides insisted that the president had expected such
a question and was not distressed by it. But coming just hours
before the House Judiciary Committee was to open its impeachment
inquiry, the extraordinary moment in video diplomacy suggested that
interest in his predicament remains more widespread than the White
House likes to argue.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, reporters who cover the White House and not residents
of the country the president is visiting raise such matters on
trips abroad, and the president's aides dismiss their inquiries as
irrelevant to the concerns of ``real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, noted that only
one of the 24 questions during the hourlong program dealt with the
scandal. ``You can twist this any way you want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the name Monica Lewinsky crashed like an unmoored klieg
light into the television studio, the president handled queries
about whether he got good grades at school (``mostly''), why he
could speak so easily before large audiences (``the microphone is
your friend'') and how he coped with pressure (``a balanced
life'').
</P>
<P>
   He adroitly navigated an inquiry about his favorite meal among
``the dishes that your wife cooks,'' by saying that he adored
chicken enchiladas, without specifying a chef. ``I like sushi
too,'' he added, sensitive as ever to his immediate constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Seated on a tall, swiveling stool, Clinton taped the forum
Thursday evening, for broadcast Thursday night. He was encircled by
an audience of about 90 people, identified as housewives,
professionals, university students, small-business owners and
others. A few dozen more people participated from Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that the network, Tokyo Broadcasting
Systems, picked the audience and the questions, some of which were
read by the moderator from faxes and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who met with Japan's Emperor Akihito and Empress
Michiko on Thursday afternoon before a dinner in his honor at
night, hoped to use the forum to explain directly to the Japanese
people why he is urging their government to open its markets and
stimulate consumer demand, administration officials said. Seven of
the questions gave him a chance to do that.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton noted the rising U.S. trade deficit with Japan, he
seemed to suggest that some Japanese industries were engaging in
dumping, the illegal trade practice of selling goods in foreign
markets at prices below cost. He pointed out that U.S. imports of
Japanese hot-rolled steel had increased fivefold over the last
year. ``No one quite believes that that's just because of the
economic problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts at an economic conference in Malaysia last weekend to
further liberalize trade foundered on Japan's insistence on
protecting its fishing and timber industries. On Thursday night,
Clinton did not specifically address those negotiations. But he
said that United States had discovered that it had increased jobs
by deregulating its airline and telecommunications industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say I never consciously asked Japan or any other
country to do something that is good only for the United States,''
he said. ``My belief is that our country is strengthened if Japan
is very strong, because if Japan is very strong, that brings back
Asia.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One man, who identified himself as a farmer raising rice and
flowers, lectured Clinton on the dangers of free trade to the
Japanese family farm, arguing that it did not take into account
``culture and social values and human values.'' Such family
farming, he said, ``is losing, losing out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gently pointing out that family farms in North Dakota were
suffering because Asian countries could no longer afford their
wheat, Clinton argued that governments could find ways to help such
farmers. ``In my country,'' he said, ``we have tried to push for
more open markets and a policy to keep family farmers in
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton found himself in the unexpected position of defending
the government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi against a questioner
who said the Japanese leadership ``is not as good as we would like
it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that ``the big things that have been done
here are essentially moving in the right direction,'' citing
banking reforms and fiscal stimulus. Give it time, he said, in an
argument that Japanese officials have tried unsuccessfully on the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in brief closing remarks, Clinton urged the Japanese to
be optimistic, because ``these things run in waves over time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind, 10 years ago a lot of people said America's best
days were behind it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president was also asked why, given his stated opposition to
land mines, the United States had not signed an international
treaty banning them. Clinton said that the treaty unfairly banned
U.S. anti-tank mines while permitting those of other nations, and
that it would interfere with the defense of South Korea. Somewhat
indignantly, he said, ``Let me assure you all: I was the first
world leader to call for a ban on land mines.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many Iraqis would have died if Clinton had proceeded
with the assault planned for last weekend, he said that ``large
numbers'' would have been killed. He said he was pleased that an
attack proved unnecessary. ``Peace is always better than war,'' he
said, ``if you can do it consistent with the long-term security and
freedom of the people. So I feel good about that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton is to speak to American business leaders and
meet with the prime minister before going to South Korea.

FINNERAN STICKS TO HIS GUNS IN PATRIOTS STAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Boston sports world may have demonized him and the
sports talk show hosts are all but calling for his public hanging,
but House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran Thursday was not backing down.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the media frenzy head-on, Finneran made no apologies to
his critics' charge that his uncompromsing stance on a Foxborough
stadium package for Patriot's owner Robert Kraft drove the football
franchise out of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Finneran laid the blame on Kraft and what he said is
the owner's decision to snub fan loyalty in his pursuit of greater
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought all along there would be some reciprocity of
loyality,'' Finneran told reporters just after Kraft appeared at
the Hartford press conference to sign an agreement with Connecticut
officials. ``In this case, it looks as if the Patriots decision is
to go with the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran did concede that he is concerned that Kraft's decision
hurts the state's reputation as business-friendly but he brushed
aside suggestions that the loss of the franchise would cost the
state serious prestige.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a legitimate concern,'' Finneran said of the immediate
economic impact. ``But I am more concerned about the psychological
impact on the economy. This runs contrary to everything we have
worked to do over the past 7 and 8 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The House leader also all but closed the door on going back to
the bargaining table. In fact, he said any effort to accommodate
Kraft now would be to succumb to blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you begin to do that quite clearly you have sent a signal
-- that the Massachusetts House at least can be highjacked and can
be bullied and will flinch in the face of economic bullying and
economic pressure,'' Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   On television live-shots and interviews with reporters, Finneran
again hit on his themes that the players' salaries and the
``irrational economic'' decisions by franchise owners like Kraft
were at fault in this case, not his or his House colleagues'
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said the taxpayers are not going to be a no-cost bank
for any individual or any business, particularly a profitable
business,'' Finneran said. ``The taxpayers of Massachusetts don't
get help when the roof on their house has to be replaced or the
boiler or the furnace goes.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Finneran tried to paint himself as the defender of
sport fans who he said are facing huge hikes in ticket prices to
pay the mega-salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been priced out and they're dismayed at the salaries
that owners are paying and now someone has made the connection for
them,'' Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   But still it was clear Finneran was standing alone Thursday amid
the rubble of the Patriot's franchise, while other Beacon Hill
leaders were not shy about laying the blame on him for costing
Boston the lose of a football franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always understood where he's coming from,'' said Senate
President Thomas F. Birmingham, who has worked closely for nearly
eight years with Finneran on thorny fiscal and policy issues. ``But
I honestly do not understand this.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Glenn Cartwright stood before the cash register with
his lips pursed, unable to decide between a Lightning Hopkins and a
Clifton Chenier C.D., but he was certain of one thing: When he got
home, he was not going to turn the House Judiciary Committee's
impeachment hearing back on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched it for a while this morning, but it was all the same
stuff we'd heard before,'' said Cartwright, a 27-year-old Houston
graduate student. ``It was like a remake of a movie you didn't like
in the first place. I'd rather watch an infomercial about a new
mop.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was because the hearing took place on a weekday, when
the children were in school and most of the country was going about
its hectic business. Perhaps it was because it was intruding into
the realm of afternoon talk shows and soap operas. But there were
further signs today that the long-running Monica Lewinsky
television series was continuing to lose its grip on the American
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just bored with the whole thing,'' said Deborah Shely, a
35-year-old legal secretary in Miami. ``I just think it should be
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Kirby, a banker, said that he had missed the opening of
the hearing because he had been on an airplane to Miami and that it
did not come up at all when he and several colleagues had lunch
together. ``I think the public has lost interest,'' Kirby said.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for a bus in Denver, walking along the sidewalk in Coral
Gables, stuck in traffic on a Los Angeles freeway, sipping a glass
of wine at a sidewalk cafe in Houston, sitting at home sick in
Brooklyn, people voiced sentiments that were pretty much the same:
Enough already.
</P>
<P>
   And the spectacle of Kenneth Starr's delivering his testimony,
alternately bolstered by Republicans on the committee and hectored
by Democrats, did not seem to do much to change the minds of the
testimony-weary members of this particular out-of-focus group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested,'' said Linda Holmquist, 58, of Hollywood.
``I have a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people who had already come to the conclusion that
President Clinton should be impeached said Starr's arguments had
only strengthened that opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked Ken Starr, I liked his demeanor,'' said Sean Elias, a
22-year-old business student at the University of Miami. ``He's
just trying to do his job. He doesn't have anything against the
president personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who had already put Starr in the role of the villain also
found their judgment reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's slimy,'' said Kerry Hardin, 39, of La Crescenta, Calif.
``He definitely has an agenda. He's out to get the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, said they had been pleasantly surprised by the
reasoned tone and apparent thoroughness of Starr's testimony. But
just as many said they had not even bothered to watch, having made
a conscious decision to tune the whole thing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really take too much interest in the president's
personal life,'' said Vanessa Creech, a 27-year-old computer
technician in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   That apathy extended even to those convinced of presidential
wrongdoing. ``The fact that he lied is most bothersome to me,'' Ms.
Creech said.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment of Norm Chiles, a 62-year-old Denver office
manager, was even harsher. ``He's been a disgrace to the office of
president,'' Chiles said. ``I was watching the Veterans Day parade
last week, and I'm ashamed of him. Sure, the economy is going, but
him and Nixon are both a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Campbell was trying to read the headlines through the
window in a downtown Denver newspaper box while on a break from her
job as a federal administrative assistant. ``I'm following the
hearings on the radio at my office, but I'm against them,'' she
said. ``I don't think he needs to be impeached. My 21-year-old
daughter agrees with me. She said, `Let it go, and let him finish
his term.' My fourth grader asks, `Why are they mean to the
president?' I mean, he did do something wrong, but don't leave it
hanging out there until the end of his term.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Catanzaro, 29, was at home sick in Brooklyn and had the
hearings turned on. ``It's my one day off,'' she said, ``and I
can't watch my soap operas because of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The network she chose, ABC, was broadcasting the hearing live
while running, underneath, a written synopsis of what had been said
earlier. It reminded her of watching a foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The content of the inquiry is totally partisan,'' said Marie
Lovrod, a 38-year-old adjunct professor of women's studies at
Hunter College in New York, who was home sick, too. ``I wanted to
watch the opening, but then Starr started repeating himself. I'm
sick of hearing the same details over and over again.''

<P>
   Denise McKinney, a 26-year-old legal assistant on a coffee break
at a subterranean cafe in the network of tunnels beneath downtown
Houston, said she found the whole exercise a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel he's just wasting our time trying to impeach this
man,'' she said of Starr. ``Clinton's not married to the whole
United States, so he doesn't have to answer to us for what he does.
He has to answer to his wife. So as long as he's running the
country, fine, I don't have anything against him. I do think what
he did was wrong, but I don't think it's grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few people continued to try to follow the plot, hoping
for an epiphany or at least some sense of clarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of want to see if this all begins to make sense, if it
validates all the time and attention given to this by the
independent prosecutor,'' said Steve Haggerty, 32, of Brooklyn.
``If they can prove abuse of power, then let them do it.''

<P>
   It's the law of the political jungle: spin or be spun. And
throughout the 11 months of the Lewinsky investigation, Kenneth
Starr's spin has been that he has none. He has portrayed himself as
the image of rectitude, comparing himself to Joe Friday in his
devotion to just the facts.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday viewers who knew him only as the man with the
inappropriate grin walking to his car each day finally saw what
those who have watched him in court had suggested: he can calmly
talk circles around his questioners. And while that's not a bad
quality in a lawyer, it makes for bland television, the primary
arena in which the impeachment process is being played out.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's daylong televised testimony before the House Judiciary
Committee forms a natural bookend to President Clinton's four-hour
videotaped deposition. It was a battle between Clinton, a master of
image making, and Starr, whose own supporters concede him to be one
of the least adept practitioners of the art of spin; after all, Joe
Friday is a camp figure of fun, and choosing him as a role model
reveals how out-of-touch the Starr approach to public relations has
been.
</P>
<P>
   Far from abandoning his passive-aggressive approach to spin
Thursday, Starr emphasized it in his prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a man of politics, of public relations, or of polls _
which I suppose is patently obvious by now,'' he said, reinforcing
his image as a man of no glitz, yet ignoring some harsh facts. He
is, of course, caught up in a fierce political and public relations
war. As for polls, someone must have told him that in the drumbeat
leading up to Thursday's meeting, commentators were wondering
whether his appearance could boost his ``single-digit ratings,'' as
the catch-phrase for his approval numbers became.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to court and not on the talk show circuit,'' Starr also
said in his statement, though his spokesman, Charles Bakaly III,
was all over the talk show circuit the night before. During the
committee meeting, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., reminded Starr that
he himself had appeared on ``Good Morning America'' that day.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, of course, that Starr has largely avoided public
comments, and the flaws in his no-spin spin have been obvious. In
the pithy phrase of NBC News' Lisa Myers, Starr's task Thursday was
to prove that he was not ``the sex-crazed, out-of-control
prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   And though no one really expected to see a red tail poking out
from beneath the witness chair, Starr's opponents probably took
heart from the opening minutes of the session. While the Democrats
complained about the fairness of the process, the cameras stayed on
Starr, who looked pale, dour, close-mouthed, almost spooky in his
sternness.
</P>
<P>
   That demonic impression passed quickly as he read his two-hour
statement, repeating his original report to the House in an
uninflected manner. Even when the language gave him an opportunity
to create fireworks, he didn't. ``That was untrue,'' he said of the
president's statements several times, creating a refrain. But in
Starr's quiet voice it came out sing-songy, not commanding or
dramatic. (Imagine what a fiery Jesse Jackson or even a dignified
Henry Hyde might have done with the same chant.)
</P>
<P>
   But if he didn't do himself much good, Starr did not do himself
serious damage, either. When it was time for the committee members
to question him, the meeting came nowhere near the
all-but-chair-throwing brawl some commentators had predicted. The
limit of five minutes for each member's questions turned many of
the Democrats into speed-talkers.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most pointed hostile questions (and most were
alarmingly unfocused) gave Starr a chance to repeat his evidence
and conclusions. He politely said ``You may disagree'' and ``You
may have another judgment'' while defending his office, and like a
true politician he sometimes answered a different question from the
one that had been asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did your office violate the law?'' Rep. Jerrold Nadler,
D-N.Y., asked Starr about the treatment of Monica Lewinsky when she
was first questioned. Ms. Lewinsky has said she was discouraged
from calling a lawyer; Starr said she wasn't. Did anyone expect him
to say anything else?
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, offer a new defense of his office's stern
treatment of her. ``She had committed felonies,'' he said several
times when asked similar questions, referring to Ms. Lewinsky's
affidavit in the Paula Jones case, denying a sexual relationship
with the president. It was one of the few examples of Starr's
familiar tone-deafness to his public pronouncements, likely to
boomerang against him.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, in a statement about the committee process that
quickly became a favorite sound bite, Rep. Maxine Waters said, ``If
it goes on the way it's going now, it will be great theater, but it
will have nothing to do with a fair process of trying to get the
truth.'' But the choice is not either-or, theater or fairness. The
theatrical component has become inescapable, however much Starr
pretends to ignore that.
</P>
<P>
   His appearance Thursday was dull theater, but it was revealing.
The 24-hour cable channels, offering straightforward, unobtrusive
coverage, allowed viewers to see the wheels of the process
spinning. And spinning and spinning and going nowhere much, except
to prove that Joe Friday's days as a television hero have passed.

IN KLAN CASE, RACE IS AN ISSUE ON EVERY LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two men could not be more different _ racially,
politically, philosophically. Yet Barry Elton Black, a white member
of the Ku Klux Klan, and David Baugh, the black lawyer who is
defending him in a Virginia court, are united these days in a
defense over what they see as the constitutional right of free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh, a Richmond lawyer who volunteered to take the case for
the American Civil Liberties Union after Black contacted the group,
is arguing that a Virginia law making it illegal to burn a cross
abridges Black's First Amendment right to express his views _ no
matter how racist those views may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government can gag Mr. Black, they can gag the Jewish
Defense League or the Knights of Columbus,'' Baugh said in a
telephone interview. ``If you can gag one group, you can gag
another.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has drawn attention, not only because of the
constitutional questions it raises, but also because of the irony
of an African-American's defending a white supremacist who, if he
had his way, would oppress his lawyer because of his race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unusual case and has unusual aspects all the way
around,'' said Gregory Goad, the district attorney for Carroll
County, Va., who is prosecuting Black for burning a cross at a
demonstration in August.
</P>
<P>
   Although Baugh believes the case is about bedrock principle,
that does not mean he harbors no doubts. In the interview, he
fretted that the incongruity of a black lawyer's defending a
Klansman was drawing public and media attention away from the
case's First Amendment issues, and he wondered whether it would be
better for him to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as he spoke of his concerns, Baugh seemed to talk
himself back into believing that his race allowed more of a
discussion of the legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reconvincing myself that this is a positive thing because
it gets people talking about the Constitution,'' he said. ``If a
white lawyer from a local jurisdiction were to take this case he
would be the subject of all sorts of questions about `Now we know
how old Charlie really feels about things.' With me, there are no
questions about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Black is charged with violating a state law passed in the 1930s
as part of a package of statutes to curb Klan activity. The statute
makes it illegal for anyone with the ``intent of intimidating''
another to burn a cross on another person's property or on a
highway or in a public place, which includes private property that
can be viewed by the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the public-place issue that we're defending here,'' said
Kent Willis, executive director of the Virginia ACLU ``We're not
defending the right to burn a cross on somebody else's property.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a preliminary hearing last Friday, Judge Edward Turner
III of the General District Court in Hillsville, Va., rejected a
defense motion that the state cross-burning law was
unconstitutional. Turner ruled that because the statute covered
conduct and not speech it did not violate the First Amendment. He
then found there was probable cause to refer Black's case to a
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Black, a leader of a branch of the Klan in Pennsylvania, was
arrested on Aug. 22 after a rally in rural Carroll County, about 60
miles southwest of Roanoke, near the North Carolina border. Though
the owner of the property had given the Klan permission to hold the
rally on his land, testimony at Friday's hearing indicated that the
burning cross was about 30 feet tall and was clearly visible from a
state highway.
</P>
<P>
   Local law-enforcement officers testified that the sight of the
burning cross caused a car with black occupants to flee the area
and some white local residents to seek protection from sheriff's
deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh, a director on the Virginia ACLU board, has a history of
taking cases involving First Amendment issues. He defended a
Vietnamese owner of a small video outlet in Prince William County,
Va., who was arrested for renting adult videos. He also defended a
county fair in Shenandoah County that included a tent featuring
nude dancing. Baugh won both cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``David is not only an adamant defender of free speech,'' Willis
said, ``he is an adamant practitioner of free speech. He has had
more than one contempt citation because of things he has said to
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh's efforts on behalf of a Klansman engaged in cross burning
have split opinion among some blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Salim Khalfani, acting executive director of the Virginia State
Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, said: ``We think it's really an aberration for a
person of African descent to represent a Ku Klux Klan person, in
particular for burning a cross, which we don't consider a
free-speech issue. This is an act that has been used historically
to terrorize and intimidate African people. So I don't see it in
the light of the First Amendment. This is bigger than the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, chairman of the board of the NAACP, said he
disagreed with Khalfani's contention. ``The First Amendment defense
this guy is mounting ought to be precious to all black Americans,''
he said in an interview. ``These are precisely the defenses that we
have used and will use to advance our cause.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that for blacks, Black presents an
odious figure to rally around.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials testified Friday that after he was
arrested, Black asked a police officer, ``When is the white man
going to stand up to the blacks and the Mexicans in this
neighborhood?''

SOSA WINS NL MOST VALUABLE PLAYER AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (REPEATING for all needing.)  
(JT) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa finally found a way to get ahead of Mark McGwire and
stay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   After losing out to McGwire in the historic race for the home
run record this past season, Sosa Thursday beat his friendly
adversary in the race for the National League Most Valuable Player
Award.
</P>
<P>
   The result brought a conclusion to the scintillating competition
between the two sluggers that raged throughout the summer and
captivated the American public. In their race to break Roger Maris'
record of 61 homers, Sosa held only two short-lived leads. McGwire,
the St. Louis first baseman, surpassed Maris first and finished
with 70 home runs. Sosa, the Chicago Cubs' outfielder, finished
with 66.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa was a one-sided winner in the balloting released
Thursday. He received 30 first-place votes and a total of 438
points to 2 and 272 for McGwire in the voting by a 32-member panel
of the Baseball Writers Association. Besides being overwhelmingly
one-sided, the result helped make history. With Juan Gonzalez of
Texas having won the American League award a day earlier, it marks
the first time Latin American players swept both MVP awards. In the
previous 67 years of the Baseball Writers MVP voting, Latin players
won eight times.
</P>
<P>
   A native and hero of the Dominican Republic, Sosa is only the
third Latino to win the NL award. Roberto Clemente won in 1966 and
Orlando Cepeda in 1967. George Bell, who was the American League
MVP in 1987, had been the only Dominican to win an MVP award.
</P>
<P>
   The one-sided nature of the vote is not likely to defuse the
debate that has raged and will continue to rage over the
appropriate choice for the award. McGwire supporters among fans,
baseball people and members of the news media believe he was the NL
MVP because he passed Maris first and finished with more home runs.
But Sosa supporters argue that there is a difference between player
of the year, which some concede McGwire might have been, and MVP.
In other MVP votes, the winner was not necessarily the player with
the best statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The voters clearly sided with the Sosa supporters, crediting the
Cubs' right fielder for sparking his team to a wild-card finish as
the second-place team in the NL Central Division. The St. Louis
Cardinals, McGwire's team, were never in the race despite his
unprecedented production.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs would have joined the Cardinals among the also-rans
without Sosa's 66 home runs, major-league-leading 158 runs batted
in and .308 batting average. McGwire drove in 147 runs, batted .299
and led the majors in walks (162), on-base percentage (.470) and
slugging percentage (.752).
</P>
<P>
   The McGwire-Sosa home run contest was credited with reviving
interest in major league baseball, which had still lagged from the
1994-95 strike. Their joint pursuit of Maris' record commanded
daily attention throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Because McGwire was the primary focus of that attention, some
people felt he should be rewarded for his value in helping bring
baseball's popularity back. But not to be overlooked was Sosa's
role in taking the interest to an even higher level and in
inspiring McGwire to what in August became his obviously greater
enjoyment of and appreciation for the impact he was making on fans
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their remarkably friendly rivalry, Sosa said again
and again that McGwire would be the one to break the record and
hold it at the end of the season. He was right on both counts. But
Sosa also said he had other priorities _ helping the Cubs reach the
playoffs and winning the MVP award. He achieved both.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who had never hit more than 40 home runs in a season, was
placed second on the two ballots on which he was not named first.
McGwire received 20 votes for second and the remaining 10 votes for
third through seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou of Houston, a fellow countryman of Sosa, finished
third in the balloting with 215 points and was the only other
player who was named on all 32 ballots. Greg Vaughn of San Diego
was fourth with 185 points, Craig Biggio of Houston fifth with 163
and Andres Galarraga of Atlanta sixth with 147. John Olerud and
Mike Piazza were the only members of the Mets who received votes.
Olerud placed 12th with 38 points, Piazza 14th with 15 points.
Sosa's victory earned him a $250,000 bonus, bringing his 1998
income to $8,325,000.

LIVINGSTON HOPES INQUIRY WILL END BEFORE DEC. 31

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bob Livingston, the presumptive speaker of the
House, said Thursday that he wants the impeachment inquiry into
President Clinton to be over by the end of the year _ before he
actually becomes speaker.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston, who previously had been cautious and equivocal
in his comments on the impeachment proceedings and what he would
like to see happen, also said that it will be difficult to wrap
things up as long as Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr keeps
``shoveling'' information to Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ken Starr still shoveling stuff over to him, it makes it
very difficult for any investigation to be complete if you haven't
gotten all the information,'' Livingston, a former federal
prosecutor himself, said in a brief interview. ``I want a fair and
full appraisal. That being said, if it could be done this year,
that'd be my preference. But I don't know that it could be done.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments, coming a day after he was officially nominated by
House Republicans as the next speaker and as Hyde conducted
impeachment hearings in an adjacent office building, offered the
first hint of his impatience with the process.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hyde said Thursday that he, too, hopes to end the
impeachment inquiry by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me repeat my New Year's resolution: It is my fervent hope
that we will be able to conclude this inquiry before the New Year
turns,'' Hyde said after gaveling Thursday's hearing to order. ``I
am hopeful that all members will bear that in mind as we conduct
this search for the truth with all deliberate speed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde has called additional witnesses. And with only three
full work weeks remaining in the legislative year, someone would
have to make a decision soon if Republicans want to end the process
by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is technically not Livingston's responsibility until
he steps into the speaker's chair on Jan. 6. And some of his
political allies say they hope it never becomes his responsibility,
so that Livingston can begin his tenure without being weighted down
by the issue, which some blame for the Republicans' poor showing in
this year's midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we can be certain of is that Bob wants to get on
with his agenda,'' said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who is one of
Livingston's closest colleagues in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But Newt Gingrich, the current speaker, has left town on
vacation, and many in Washington are starting to turn to Livingston
for a sign on which way he wants to go and whether the curtain
might drop soon on this long-running drama.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt met with Livingston on
Monday to discuss reorganization of the House and briefly talked
about wrapping up the impeachment procedings, according to Laura
Nichols, a Gephardt aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some agreement that once we got passed these
leadership elections and these initial hearings today and tomorrow
that maybe we could have a further conversation,'' Ms. Nichols
said. ``It's important and significant that both leaders agree on
the timetable for getting this wrapped up by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said: ``Different sets of people are
exploring a way out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston has acknowledged that the public does not see
Clinton's behavior as impeachable. But nor has he closed the door
on some sort of punishment. ``The president still has to answer to
the American people for the charges,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the House also want the process finished by the end of
the year, not because it has become an embarrassment but because
they worry that the chances of punishing the president are better
with the current Congress than with the next one. Republicans now
outnumber Democrats, 228-206. Next year their advantage will
shrink, with 223 Republicans and 211 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if the House votes out any articles of impeachment,
the Senate does not appear inclined to convict the president. And
already, several House Republicans have started to indicate that
they would vote against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   This complicates the picture for Livingston. But he insisted
Thursday that he had not flagged any signals to Hyde, denying in
particular a report that Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., had conveyed
a message from him to Hyde to kill the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of false reports going on,'' Livingston said.
``I sympathize with my friend Newt _ all of a sudden there are
reports of stuff that never happened. I have never talked to David
Dreier about meeting with Henry Hyde. I don't know anything about
that report.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Dreier, the incoming chairman of the Rules
Committee, said that the congressman wanted the House to end the
inquiry quickly but that he had not acted as a conduit or messenger
for Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston has generally refrained from moralizing about the
president, providing a sharp contrast to Gingrich, who at one point
said that Republicans should condemn the president's behavior in
every speech and poured millions of dollars into reviving the
matter in commercials just before the Nov. 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
   But a week ago, Livingston did convey some outrage about
Clinton. ``The president of the United States has a responsibility
to the American people to live by the laws, to obey the laws,'' he
said on the Imus radio program.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if it's proven that he did not, he's either going to have
to be dealt with or he should voluntarily recognize that he's got a
problem,'' he said. ``So far, I haven't heard any singular
recognition of his problem. So we'll just have to let the processes
move forward.''

NO SURPISE IN SOSA'S SELECTION AS MVP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, it can be said. Sammy Sosa is ``The Man.'' Mark McGwire
may be baseball's home run king. But the Chicago Cubs star is
officially the Most Valuable Player in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Few would argue with the choice made Thursday by all but two
members of the 32 voters from the Baseball Writers Association of
America. Sosa, who lost the home run derby to the St. Louis
slugger, was first or second on every ballot and amassed 438
points. McGwire, who shattered Rogere Maris's 37-year-old record
with 70 homers, was next with 272 points. Only Rick Hummel and Mike
Eisenbath of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch made McGwire No. 1 and
listed Sosa second.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's selection was a just reward for several reasons. With a
.318 average, 66 home runs, and 158 RBIs, he led the Cubs to a
wild-card playoff berth. The Cardinals failed to qualify. His bid
to overtake McGwire in September made the 1998 season one of the
most exciting in history. He also led the majors with 132 runs and
414 total bases, so he certainly earned the $250,000 bonus he gets
as MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Moises Alou was third with 215 points, followed by San
Diego's Greg Vaughn, who hit 50 homers and wound up with 185
points. Houston's Craig Biggio was fifth with 163 points.
</P>
<P>
   It was the eighth time a Cubs player won the MVP, the first
since Andre Dawson in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank God for giving me an opportunity to be in this
situation,'' said Sosa in a teleconference from Chicago. ``I hope
to be able to continue to do my job as well as be able to do good
for people. I believe in God, and when you do, good things can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who continually referred to McGwire as ``The Man'' as the
two approached Maris's mark of 61 homers, made a lot of things
happen on and off the field. He erupted onto the home run scene by
hitting a record 20 in June and ouhomered McGwire, 57-46, from May
23 to the end of the season. After being tied at 66, McGwire pulled
away on the final weekend. Sosa didn't care because his team had
made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for someone to hit 70 and not win the MVP,'' said
Sosa, a Dominican Republic native whose award came the day after
Puerto Rico's Juan Gonzalez was named the American League MVP.
``Mark's been a great player. But I took my team to the playoffs,
and that counts a lot. The decision that was made by the people
(writers) was great. But if they had voted for him, I'd happy, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody recognized the job I did in the field. The way that
I've been with the media helped. If we didn't get to the playoffs,
maybe I would have won it, maybe not. I don't know. All I can say
is I got it and I'm going to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire expressed his happiness for Sosa in a statement from
Australia, where he is vacationing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a great job of carrying the Cubbies back to the
playoffs,'' McGwire said. ``I am proud of what this year meant for
the sport of baseball, reaffirming its position as America's
pasttime and passion. To put it in his words, today Sammy is `The
Man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa probably did benefit from more positive media coverage,
which is not to say McGwire was ignored. Not by a long shot. But
each night, millions of fans watching the Cubs right fielder's
exploits would hear mention of the Sammy Sosa Foundation, and many
responded with cash donations to the charity. Sosa's ability to
lift his teammates and fill ballparks began to make him ``The Man''
in the eyes of many. Because of this, Sosa became an MVP candidate
even though McGwire was still getting the lion's share of the
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it the way it should have been taken,'' said Sosa. ``I
said all year long that if I have a good year, maybe I'll have the
MVP. And if I do it one time, then I have the ability to do it
again. I believe in myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I hit 66 home runs next year? I don't know. But I feel I
am capable of getting it because I have the ability and
opportunity. I'm a human being and I believe in God. When you do
that, you're never going to have any problems in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa had a hard time pinpointing the highlights of his season.
There were so many, ranging from his 20-homer month to a postseason
tour of Japan where, while earning the MVP title in the eight-game
series he found time to arrange for the shipment of 1,000 prefab
homes to the hurricane-ravaged Dominican. He is flying home today
to personally supervise the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in my country is tough,'' said Sosa. ``That's
why I'm going there so soon. They know about the MVP. They are
ready to celebrate. I won't do that much. I need time to see what
things look like for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Sosa means that for the first time in history,
both the NL and American League MVP awards go to Latin-born
players. Sosa is from Santo Domingo. Texas outfielder Juan
Gonzalez, named the American League winner Wednesday, was born in
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor,'' said Sosa. ``Only one player in each league
can win the MVP, and a lot of people had great years, too. I'm just
glad what happened to me happened to Gonzalez. We played together
for Texas in the minors. It's a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a great year for Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget the 1998 season,'' he said. The month of
June. My three grand slams. I hadn't hit any before. Hitting No 62
was big for me. So was Sammy Sosa Day with my family here. I
promise to work hard next year. But I will continue to be the same
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still respect Mark McGwire. If I had a vote, I would have
voted for McGwire. But I didn't, so thank you all for voting for
me.''

`RAGA: IN SEARCH OF FEMININITY': A HOVERING SELF, NOT MAN OR
WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An encounter between two bare-chested men is defined
by embraces in slow motion and the wordless commentary of five
other performers _ four women and another man: that is the ruling
image in ``Raga: In Search of Femininity,'' a 90-minute work by the
Indian choreographer Chandralekha.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave
Festival, received a warm reception from the audience on Wednesday
night at the Majestic Theater (651 Fulton St., Fort Greene), where
it is being performed through Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, what you see is what you get, and what you get is
an awkward effort to put theory into unrealized practice. The
promotional verbiage around ``Raga'' suggests that it is about
``subconscious areas of male-femaleness in the body'' and ``an
exploration of the transformational area of femininity in the
bodies of men and women.'' There is more: femininity is ``the
actual act of becoming, the slippage from the state of fluidity and
harmony'' and associated with ``in between'' physical spaces.
</P>
<P>
   To be a victim of one's publicity is not the worst fate that can
befall an artist. That philosophical concepts lie behind
Chandralekha's work is not in doubt. But what one actually sees in
her ``Raga'' is physical action too simplified to carry the burden
of a viable esthetic.
</P>
<P>
   Originally schooled in Bharata Natyam, the best-known style of
classical dance in India, Chandralekha, 69, is not the first
choreographer there to use tradition as a springboard for a
creative approach. Pioneers like Ram Gopal and Uday Shanker opted
for hybrid theatrical spectacles, and hip young choreographers from
India today weave the idiom of classical dance into the texture of
Western post-modern ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Western modern-dance choreographers who usually
depart from previous codified dance vocabularies, Indian
choreographers, like modern flamenco choreographers, refer at least
occasionally to idioms identified with their national dance
traditions. In ``Raga,'' core movements of Bharata Natyam recur in
the choreography for the four women and for a young man who
suggests a youthful dancing god. Variations of yoga exercises,
especially visible in the beginning, are incorporated not for their
occasional contortionist shape but for their images of meditation.
Martial arts are visible in the formalized combat between the two
male leads at the end of their prolonged love encounter.
</P>
<P>
   A program note quotes from a 10th-century text of a poet, Devara
Dasimayya. Rather than defining men and women by physical
characteristics, he urges a deeper look: ``The self that hovers in
between is neither man nor woman.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of this is translated onstage, where the too-plain
choreography lacks the stylization of metaphoric resonance. The
problem is not what Chandralekha does with traditionally derived
movement but what she doesn't do with her own brand of movement.
</P>
<P>
   The young women who come rushing in periodically to stamp their
way through the piece function as a chorus, although they could
have been contemporary versions of the dancing angels in temple
sculpture. Their stance is rigid, robbed of variety. Nor does a
woman who plops down between two men on the floor suggest ``the
self that hovers in between.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement, not its symbolism, comes to the fore. Shaji John
and V.A. Sunny, the two men who execute the male duet, which
follows an introductory women's ensemble, do not seem to be
professional dancers like the others in the cast. But they are
admirably concentrated performers. They are often kept close to the
floor as they arch into sphinxlike poses, wrap around each other
with chaste caresses, entangle their interlocking limbs or bounce
along the stage in a push-up position. That one man hugs the knee
of another may suggest that every part of the body is worth
adoration from a lover, but when one man hugs the other's rump,
poetry no longer hovers in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The cast included Ramachandra Das, Janaki Meera Krishnamurthy,
Kalpana Krishnamurthy, R. Rajalakshmi and N. Yagnaprabha. T.H.
Subash Chandran led the percussion ensemble, which included N.
Ganesh Kumar and N. Ramakrishnan. The singer was G. Srikanth.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orson Welles' last laugh must be heartier than ever,
now that ``Citizen Kane'' shines bright at the brand-new United
Artists Union Square 14 and ``A Touch of Evil'' continues its hit
run at the Film Forum. Anyone familiar with Welles' 1958 film noir
landmark knows that it could just as well have been called ``A
Truckload of Evil,'' and that its crazily sinister plot turns and
breathtaking camera work remain astonishingly fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Touch of Evil'' is, among so many things, the other film to
find Janet Leigh at a lonely motel under strangely menacing
management, and the one in which Welles gave one of his most droll,
swaggering performances as a corrupt police captain in an American
town on the Mexican border. As visually thrilling as it is
sin-soaked, this artfully reconstructed version of ``A Touch of
Evil'' remains one of the brightest lights on the cinematic
landscape this season.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the United Artists Union Square 14, at 13th Street
and Broadway, is $9; $5.50 for children 3 to 11 and the elderly.
Screening schedule and information: (212) 253-2225. Admission to
the Film Forum, 209 W. Houston St., South Village, is $8.50; $4.50
for members. Screening schedule and other information: (212)

STARR DEFENDS LEWINSKY PROBE AT IMPEACHMENT HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Complete writethru _ adds quotes, updates throughout)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr defended his
probe of President Clinton Thursday, telling lawmakers that he
never passed judgment on the president's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky but instead focused on Clinton's coverup of their affair _
conduct Starr said ``may constitute grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   By itself, Starr told members of the House Judiciary Committee,
the Clinton-Lewinsky sexual relationship was not a ``high crime or
misdemeanor,'' what the Constitution defines as impeachable
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, his report saying that grounds exist to
impeach Clinton is based on issues of obstruction of justice, lying
under oath and witness tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was attempting to deflate a Democratic charge that the
Lewinsky investigation was little more than a morality-tinged probe
of an illicit sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old independent counsel spent over 10 hours at the
witness table in the same room where the Judiciary Committee held
impeachment hearings against President Richard Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's marathon impeachment hearing was the only one
scheduled so far in a bitterly partisan process that has
Republicans trudging forward amid polls and election results
suggesting public disinterest in impeachment, and Democrats lobbing
grenades and trying to make Starr _ rather than Clinton _ the focus
of public debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is not above the law, Mr. Starr, and neither are
you,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., as the hearing moved into
its ninth hour.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic committee members attacked the independent counsel's
credibility and motives, rarely touching on the allegations of
Clinton's innocence or guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., accused Starr of bullying Lewinsky
into testifying against the president. He said lawyers from the
independent counsel's office had not allowed Lewinsky to call her
attorney when FBI agents first confronted and questioned the former
White House intern on Jan. 16 outside Washington. ``Why did your
office break the law?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Unruffled, Starr answered that the federal judge with
jurisdiction the case, Judge Norma H. Johnson, had cleared his
office of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., focused on Starr's announcement that
the president had been cleared in the so-called Filegate and
Travelgate investigations, saying that it ``disturbed him greatly''
that independent counsel had waited until after the Nov. 3 election
to release the information favorable to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the barrage of Democratic criticism, Starr remained
calm, often gently staring at attacking committee members or
quietly taking notes. On several occasions he told lawmakers that
he was merely the gatherer of facts, and that Congress alone judges
whether any of it constitutes grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Washington lawyer Theodore Olson, a close friend of the
independent counsel, described the testimony as vintage Starr. ``He
certainly demonstrated himself to be capable of not letting people
get under his skin,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans split their time between defending
Starr and trying to refocus attention on the allegations of perjury
and obstruction of justice against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady of Florida voiced a common theme among the
Republican members when he said, ``I think what we are seeing here
is a desperate attempt to get away from the facts of the case
against the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledged the country's fatigue with Lewinsky
affair, Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., defended Starr and his
investigation against the country's desire to ``just drop this
whole impeachment thing, because everybody lies about sex and the
president ought to have the opportunity to lie about sex just like
everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that allowing the president to commit perjury would make
most sexual harassment and domestic violence cases ``less
meaningful'' and ``in many cases unenforceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., tried to open
Thursday's proceedings on a nonpartisan note. The hearing, he said,
``is not a trial nor is it White House versus Ken Starr, or
Republican versus Democrat. Rather, the hearing today is another
step in our attempt to carry out our constitutional duty.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get very far. Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass., made a
motion to allow Clinton lawyer David Kendall two hours to question
Starr, instead of the 30 minutes allotted by Hyde. Republicans
defeated the motion 21-16 on a party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
   Before questioning Starr about his allegations against Clinton,
Kendall told the Judiciary Committee that ``nothing in this
overkill of investigation amounts to justification for impeachment
of the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats on the committee seemed intent on making the most
of their first _ and possibly last _ opportunity to grill Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a federally-paid sex policeman spending millions
of dollars to trap an unfaithful spouse ... would have been
unthinkable prior to the Starr investigation,'' said the
committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan. ``Let
there be no mistake, it is not now acceptable in America to
investigate a person's private sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In a professorial voice, Starr read his 58-page statement in
about two hours. He told lawmakers the investigation of Clinton's
efforts to conceal his 18-month affair with the former White House
intern ``caused all of us considerable dismay _ and continues to do
so,'' Starr told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ``I am proud of what we did,'' he added. ``We were
assigned a difficult job. We have done it to the very best of our
abilities. We have tried to be fair and thorough.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's statement contained few surprises, going over much of
the same ground covered in his 450-page report to Congress Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's intimate relationship with a subordinate
employee was transformed into an unlawful effort to thwart the
judicial process,'' Starr said. ``This was no longer an issue of
private conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said Clinton lied under oath about Lewinsky in his Jan.
17, 1998, deposition in the Jones civil lawsuit, and also lied that
same month to his Cabinet and at a televised public event.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, he added, also pressured his personal secretary, Betty
Currie, into agreeing with him that he and Lewinsky were never
alone, and that Currie could ``see and hear everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also lied in his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony by
claiming his Jan. 17 denial of a sexual relationship with Lewinsky
was legally accurate, Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr zeroed in on instances in which he claimed that Clinton
had stalled the legal process in the Lewinsky matter by refusing
for seven months to testify before the grand jury and trying to
prevent White House lawyer Bruce Lindsey and Secret Service
personnel from testifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president used the machinery of government and the power
of his office to conceal his relationship with Monica Lewinsky,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr disclosed that his office considered recommending that the
House undertake an impeachment investigation on the original
Whitewater allegations, but ultimately he declined to send the
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the Whitewater case was Clinton's testimony that he
didn't know about a fraudulent $300,000 loan and a second loan from
Madison Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan which was owned by the president's
former business partners, James and Susan McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also told lawmakers he found no evidence of impeachable
offenses in his separate investigations of White House possession
of FBI files on Republicans _ Filegate _ or in the firing of career
White House travel office workers and their replacement by
employees close to Clinton _ Travelgate.

<P>
   Starr served in the Justice Department in the Reagan
administration and was appointed to the federal appeals court in
Washington by Reagan in 1983. During the Bush administration, he
was the U.S. solicitor general, the government's chief advocate
before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   With such a Republican pedigree, Starr made a point of defending
the Lewinsky probe as one staffed by career federal prosecutors and
FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a bright line between law and politics, between
courts and polls,'' Starr said. ``It leaves the polls to the
politicians and spin doctors. We are officers of the court who live
in the world of the law.''

BERLIN DEBATES SPIELBERG'S OFFER FOR HOLOCAUST VIDEO MEMORIAL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ As the debate intensifies over how to recall Hitler's
destruction of European Jewry in the emerging new center of Berlin,
the Jewish Museum here has begun talks with Steven Spielberg over
the possibility of housing his vast video history of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, to open in 2000, said in a statement Thursday that
its director, former Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal, had
recently discussed the plan in Los Angeles with Michael Berenbaum,
president of Spielberg's Survivors of the Shoah Visual History
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In September, officials said, the assistant museum director, Tom
Freudenheim, discussed the possibility with Spielberg when he was
awarded Germany's highest honor, the Federal Cross of Merit.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are being conducted during the debate over what place
to give the remembrance of the Holocaust in the heart of this city
that is busy reinventing itself before the government moves here
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion has intensified in recent months, after sharp
criticism of a proposed Holocaust memorial by Michael Naumann, the
state culture minister in the new Social Democratic government.
Naumann, who recently moved back here from a senior publishing job
in New York, said in July that a favored plan that would build
4,000 pillars near the Brandenburg Gate amounted to a ``political
institution for wreath laying'' and was depressing.
</P>
<P>
   He has modified his remarks somewhat, suggesting last month that
Spielberg's history might form a central element of the memorial, a
distinct project from the Jewish Museum. The museum, already built,
was designed by Daniel Libeskind, the American architect.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Thursday about the discussions to send the
history, with its more than 40,000 interviews with Holocaust
survivors, to the museum suggested that the idea of making it part
of the separate memorial had receded.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this goes ahead,'' said a person familiar with the talks,
``then the question of the Holocaust memorial will be entirely open
once again. Naumann's suggestion was rather different.''
</P>
<P>
   Naumann could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week with the weekly magazine Stern
Spielberg said a Holocaust memorial should be built here. ``But
whether it is a Holocaust museum, an obelisk or a symbolic work of
art is something that Germany should decide alone. Germans should
make their own decision according to their own conscience, without
worrying what people abroad will think.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government has said Parliament
will vote next year on the labyrinth of pillars designed by the
architect Peter Eisenman, of New York, the project previously
favored for the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   If, as seems quite likely, that plan is rejected, the whole
question of how, if at all, to recall the Holocaust will reopen, a
decade after the debate on it began. Many residents oppose a large
memorial.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It took 60 seconds for civility to vanish in a
whirl of acrimony Thursday as Republicans and Democrats on the
House Judiciary Committee faced President Clinton's accuser for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are disrupting the continuity of this meeting with these
adversarial _'' said Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the committee's
chairman, groping for the right word to cap his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disrupting a railroad, it seems like, Mr. Chairman,''
said Rep. Melvin Watt, D-N.C., hunching over his microphone.
``That's what we're disrupting here.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went. Known as the most fiercely polarized panel on
Capitol Hill, the Judiciary Committee did not disappoint on
Thursday. During a full day of testimony, Democrats and Republicans
sparred repeatedly as they tried to either savage or laud the
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, the committee's leadoff witness
and the man who spearheaded Thursday's impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Relishing Starr's appearance, Democrats tried to paint a picture
of Starr as the biased ringleader in a Republican vendetta to
destroy Clinton. They interrupted Hyde throughout the day,
challenging his fairness as chairman, attempting to throw him off
balance right off the bat when they requested two hours of rebuttal
time for Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot have the defense in a courtroom sitting gagged and
bound without any opportunity to refute the accused's overwhelming
opportunity to talk and talk and talk,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson
Lee, D-Texas, who played a starring role in objecting to the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chair would like to suggest to the gentlelady, with
respect, the chair doesn't intend to bind and gag anybody,'' Hyde
replied, bristling at the hearing's rocky start. Indeed, Hyde
granted Abbe Lowell, the Democrats' investigative counsel, 70
minutes to question Starr, more than twice Lowell's original
allotment.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans fought back by accusing Democrats of
buffoonery in the face of history and of stoking partisan animosity
before Thursday's proceedings even began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a couple of hours of parliamentary haggling relative to
the procedure of today's hearings I think denigrates the dignity of
this hearing,'' said Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis. He added,
``The people over on the other side of the aisle, I think, are
saying that this is going to be railroaded before the whistle even
blows and the train leaves the station.''
</P>
<P>
   During one of the breaks, Sensenbrenner added, ``Democrats ought
to be ashamed of themselves for turning this into a political
circus.''
</P>
<P>
   In a kind of dress rehearsal for Thursday's hearing, Ms. Jackson
Lee took to the microphones Thursday morning in a news conference
with two people who said they had been persecuted by Starr in his
zeal to chase wrongdoing. It was a prelude to the stinging attacks
she would make throughout the day at the hearing, objecting to
Starr's tactics and motives and to Hyde's handling of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A point of order,'' she said several times, setting off a
small firestorm in the midst of Starr's statement.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides differed sharply in their approach to the
proceedings and toward Starr, but members, most of them lawyers,
clearly reveled in the type of courtroom theatrics they had left
behind when they came to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans seemed to savor using phrases like ``rule of law''
and ``a historical first.'' They addressed Starr with deference,
calling him ``judge,'' and described his presentation as
``convincing,'' ``forceful'' and ``honorable'' during hearing
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Starr's office has been treated like a pinata,'' said
Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif. ``He has been beaten up every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Their questions were tailored to help Starr defend himself, his
investigation and his charges in person after four years of virtual
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president was asked had he ever been given any gifts by
Ms. Lewinsky,'' said Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Calif. ``Does evidence
gathered indicate that the president gave false or misleading
testimony when he answered `I don't recall'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Starr replied, adding that it ``defied credulity.'' The
president, he said, ``is blessed with one of the most powerful
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, on the other hand, stayed loyal to the course they
have pursued since Starr's report was unloaded from a couple of
minivans on Capitol Hill: They took off the blindfold and throttled
the pinata. Seldom did they mention Clinton's behavior or his
central role in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the
committee, set the tone in his opening statement, calling Starr's
report ``tawdry, salacious and unnecessarily graphic'' and
portraying him as an obsessed Inspector Javert.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a federally paid sex policeman spending millions
of dollars to trap an unfaithful spouse or to police civil
litigation would have been unthinkable prior to the Starr
investigation,'' Conyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let there be no mistake,'' he continued. ``It is not now
acceptable in America to investigate a person's private sexual
activity. It is not acceptable to force mothers to testify against
their daughters, to make lawyers testify against the people they
protect or to make bookstores tell what books people read.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also zeroed in on the fact that Starr did not announce
until Thursday that he had exonerated Clinton in the firing of
employees in the White House travel office and in the White House's
mishandling of FBI files.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you withhold that before the elections when you were
sending us a referral?'' Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., asked Starr.
``In other words, you don't have anything to say unless you have
something bad to say.''
</P>
<P>
   And they questioned him about his office's treatment of Monica
Lewinsky, who they believe was dissuaded from calling her lawyer
during her initial conversations with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, stirred into action by the offensive, came to
Starr's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the law and the facts are against you, just argue like the
devil,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., repeating ``something
that lawyers said 2,000 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the punch line on that is beat up the lawyer,'' Hyde
chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   The facts, Canady continued, indicate there is ``a pattern of
calculated'' misconduct by Clinton. ``What we're hearing here is a
grab bag of anything that occurs to try to undermine your
credibility and, of course, this committee's process has been
attacked in the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The partisanship appeared to be infectious. Outside, protesters
gathered to shout slurs against Starr or Clinton. Documentary
filmmakers scurried about collecting footage. At one point, an
actor dressed as Thomas Jefferson, a white wig on his head, his
oversized belly bursting out of his frock, interrupted a Republican
news conference and shouted: ``I had an affair. Impeach me, too.''
The police hustled him away.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, the proceedings took on a somewhat lighter
tone at times. Hyde became more jovial, accommodating Democrats on
a routine basis. Democrats, too, eased up a bit, their adrenalin
dropping off as the hours ticked away.
</P>
<P>
   Even the biting remarks carried a few strains of levity. ``I
hope the seating arrangement is OK,'' Hyde said with a smirk in one
of his trademark asides to Conyers, his seat mate. ``That's about
all you haven't complained about.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither side lightened up in its questioning of Starr. Rep.
Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., challenged him several times to tell the
truth under oath, particularly on whether he had first heard of a
tape recording about a woman's sexual conduct with Clinton as early
as November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The question clearly rattled Starr, who said he did not know but
would check his records. During the hearing and at a break a few
minutes later, Ms. Lofgren offered no new evidence to support her
query. ``It's just an innocent question, and that's all I'm going
to say about it,'' Ms. Lofgren said.

NATO WARNS TIME IS SHORT FOR TALKS ON KOSOVO  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM WEINER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As deadly tension appears to be building again in
Kosovo, where 385,000 civilians remain uprooted, NATO officials
warned Thursday that a shaky cease-fire might soon dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   An unarmed international force intended to monitor the
cease-fire is weeks, perhaps months, from taking shape, and the
U.N. Security Council Thursday urged its speedy deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The supreme NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, has said Serbian
security forces and armed Kosovo rebels have a window of a few
months to begin serious talks. If they do not, the killing will
resume, the general warned, adding that both sides appear ready to
do battle.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, when the Serbian authorities in Belgrade revoked the
autonomous status for the Province of Kosovo, the ethnic Albanian
people have been asking for greater independence from Serbia. But
their efforts have met violence and repression.
</P>
<P>
   The repression erupted in killing, burning and looting this
year, as Serbian security forces rampaged from village to village.
In response an armed resistance of ethnic Albanians, calling itself
the Kosovo Liberation Army, has fought back, killing and capturing
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Thursday that both sides were responsible
for a sharp increase in tensions in recent weeks. The statement
said incidents of violence ``risk creating a dangerous cycle of
provocation and response.''
</P>
<P>
   If the violence continues, NATO warned, it ``could destabilize
the cease-fire, reverse the recent improvement in the humanitarian
situation'' and disrupt plans for an international monitoring force
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That may have already occurred. ``The cease-fire is being
breached on a daily basis, intimidation continues, roadblocks are
being erected, and still people are being killed,'' said Bronislaw
Geremek, chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is supposed to send 2,000 unarmed observers to
verify Serbian compliance with U.N. resolutions, in particular the
withdrawal of Serbian troops from Kosovo and the return of ethnic
Albanian refugees. It is unclear how that force could accomplish
anything beyond reporting acts of violence by the 25,000 or so
Serbian soldiers and security forces in the region and the smaller
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors will not be able to intercede if fighting erupts.
``If we are told there is a battle up front, we will not go to see
the bullets flying,'' said the American leader of the Kosovo
Verification Mission, William Walker. ``We will report back that
there is a reported battle ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said Thursday that
the situation had ``not spun out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO has plans to create a 1,700-member ``rapid reaction'' force
to defend the monitors' safety.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has succeeded only in ``dampening and containing the
crisis,'' General Clark told the NATO parliamentary assembly last
week. ``At this very time both the KLA and the Serbs are re-arming
and preparing for confrontation again. If even more destructive
fighting is not to occur we must turn off the engines driving this
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the talks had a window of two to four months.
</P>
<P>
   Last month NATO threatened to bomb Serbian military targets to
stop the killing in Kosovo. It lifted the threat after President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia agreed to withdraw some troops
from Kosovo. That promise has not been fully kept.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, beaten badly in the Serbian summer
offensive, has bounced back, and it may be as strong or stronger
than before, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach a political settlement have been going
nowhere. Some U.S. officials and intelligence analysts said they
feared that if fighting broke out and the international mission
fell apart the resulting battles could lead to long-term Western
intervention in Kosovo, not unlike the case in Bosnia.

APPEALS COURT STRIKES DOWN RACIAL PREFERENCE POLICY IN BOSTON
PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Mass., N.H., R.I., Puerto Rico)   By TAMAR LEWIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first federal appeals court ruling on racial preferences
in public school admissions, a three-judge panel in Boston on
Thursday struck down the affirmative-action policy at Boston Latin
School, the city's most prestigious public high school.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to Boston Latin, brought by Henry Robert Wessman,
the father of a white student who was not admitted, moves the
highly charged debate over affirmative action in education from the
college and professional-school level down to the public school
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in a case involving the University of Texas law
school, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals barred the use of
race in university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   But the constitutionality of racial preferences in admissions to
prestigious public high schools is more complicated _ and more
amorphous _ since so many districts, like Boston, have been under
court order to desegregate. Indeed, many districts have created
magnet schools specifically to promote integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are very different in public schools, where every
child will get a placement, than in the professional school
context, where a person who doesn't get into law or medical school
may not have access to that career,'' said Patricia Brannan, a
lawyer working on a similar case involving a magnet school in
Arlington, Va. ``At this point, it's not clear exactly what's
allowed. There are several cases rattling their way through the
courts, and I think it's an area where we're going to see a lot
more court rulings.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Thursday's ruling is binding only on Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico, it is
likely to draw intense interest in many school districts that are
race-conscious in admissions to their most competitive schools.
While most school districts have abandoned strict racial quotas,
many magnet schools still consider race in their admission
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Latin selects half its students solely on entrance
examination scores and grades, and admissions for the other half
are weighted by race, so that if 27 percent of the remaining
qualified applicants, those from the top half of their class, are
African-American, 27 percent of those admitted must be
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's 2-to-1 decision overturning a May ruling by the
district court upholding that policy, Judge Bruce Selya of the 1st
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Boston Latin to admit
15-year-old Sarah Wessman, a white student who complained that she
had been illegally denied admission in favor of less qualified
minorities. Sarah ranked 91st among the applicants for the 1997
ninth-grade class. To fill the first 45 seats, the school went
through the top 47 students on the list; for the other 45, the
policy required allocation to 13 blacks, 18 whites, nine
Asian-Americans and five students of Hispanic descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts a further stake in the heart of the diversity
rationale,'' said Terence Pell, senior counsel at Center for
Individual Rights in Washington, which brought the Texas case.
``People might have thought that if the diversity rationale would
survive at all it would be in the elementary and secondary school
context, but the court said, no, the legal standard is the same and
there is no more compelling interest in racial balancing that
elementary and secondary level.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a press conference Thursday, Dr. Elizabeth Reilinger, chair
fo the Boston School Committee, said that the committee would
comply with the decision _ and would schedule a special meeting to
decide whether to appeal the decision or change its policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read the decision yet, but I'm very concerned that
it could lead to racial isolation, resegregation and less
educational opportunity for minority children,'' said Jeff
Simering, director of legislation at the Council of the Great City
Schools, a Washington, D.C., organization of the nation's largest
urban school districts, adding that many of his group's members are
still under desegregation orders, and using race-conscious policies
to integrate their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the four specialized high schools admit
students strictly on the basis of an entrance test and do not use
race as a factor. The makeup of the two top schools, Stuyvesant
High School and Bronx High School of Science, is predominantly
Asian and white. At Stuyvesant, for example, African-Americans
account for 4.1 percent of the student body, Hispanics 3.7 percent,
47.7 percent Asian and 45.5 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, rioting broke out in Boston when a U.S. District Court
ordered widespread busing to end segregation of schools. The
following year, because of the low number of African-American
students at Boston Latin, the court required the school to set
aside at least 35 percent of each entering class for
African-American and Hispanic students, a plan the appeals court
affirmed in 1976. Although the court removed that mandate in 1987,
the Boston schools continued that policy until 1995, when it was
challenged by Michael McLaughlin, the lawyer-father of another
rejected white applicant.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin's case was dismissed last year, and his daughter
admitted, after the city agreed to change from the 35 percent
set-aside to the new half-and-half approach.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin, however, sued again, on behalf of Sarah Wessman,
charging that the new system was still an illegal quota masked by
``high-minded and amorphous terms'' of diversity and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Selya's opinion said the policy making race ``a determining
factor in the admission of a subset of each year's incoming
classes, offend's the Constitution's guarantee of equal
protection.''

<P>
   FRENCHGLEN, Ore. _ In some ways, the high-desert region known as
the Malheur has never had any problem attracting visitors. Hundreds
of thousands of them gather in the spring and fall along the
Pacific Flyway, turning the sagebrush country of Oregon's Outback
into a Serengeti of sorts, with an astounding collection of
wildlife: songbirds, sandhill cranes, trumpeter swans, pelicans,
bufflehead ducks, pronghorn antelopes and coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   But as the name that French Canadian trappers gave the area
suggests, many people have found the area less hospitable. Malheur
(pronounced MAL-yur) means ``misfortune'' in French, and landmarks
in the vast region _ Starvation Spring, Skull Creek, Lonesome
Cliff, Deadman's Bedground _ evoke the decided lack of success of
those who have sought to civilize the area.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if this hamlet with a population of 9 has any future at
all, it most likely lies in tourism. Situated in the Malheur
National Wildlife Refuge and just up the road from the Hart
Mountain National Antelope Refuge, Frenchglen is surrounded by
stark and striking terrain.
</P>
<P>
   There is a problem, though, one with both comic and troubling
undertones that evoke the tensions between the ranching-oriented
economy of Frenchglen's past and the likely direction of its
future. People here seem to have a hard time agreeing on whether
and how to go about marketing the area, and on whom they want to
come here.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is evident even within Frenchglen's tiny business
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appeals to bait fishermen, we appeal to fly fishermen,''
said Missy Litchy, who has transformed the local general store into
an upscale tourist shop and a bed and breakfast, in explaining her
problems with Josh Warburton, who runs an RV park a few miles up
the Steens Mountain Road. ``He wanted to have a Coors
Lite-sponsored hunting contest, and while I wouldn't say I'm
adamantly opposed to hunting, I'm not really a hunter.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Mrs. Litchy added, ``Coors Lite in general is not our
demographic _ we sell dramatically more microbrews than Coors
Lite.''
</P>
<P>
   Warburton, a retired district manager for the Federal Bureau of
Land Management, proudly says there are no microbrews for sale at
the RV park he calls the Steens Mountain Resort. He faults Mrs.
Litchy for discontinuing the sale of useful things like canned
goods, and turning instead to ``curios and jewelry and all that
kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's kind of got a historical museum kind of
environment over there,'' Warburton said late in the afternoon as
the sun set, casting soft colors in the desert sky. ``I think a lot
of the people who come and stay with her would rather not see
ranchers at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranching is still an important activity in the area, although
most people here agree that the industry is on a long, slow
decline, in part because of successful lawsuits by conservationists
who sought to remove cattle from federal wildlife lands. They said
the cattle were competing with antelope and other animals for
forage. In logbooks at the refuges, many visitors have noted the
change approvingly: ``Looks better without the cows,'' one entry
reads.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ranchers here literally will not set foot in Mrs.
Litchey's store, the Mercantile, and unsettling conflicts have
arisen in the last year that led the school board to cut off the
water supply to the store and the longtime postmistress to move the
post office out of the store and into a pink-and-white trailer down
the street.
</P>
<P>
   More tensions arose a few years ago over a scheduling conflict
in which Mrs. Litchy and her husband had a champagne brunch at the
same time as Warburton's annual Labor Day pancake breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions here are nowhere as pronounced as they were 101 years
ago, when the rancher who founded Frenchglen took a fatal bullet in
the forehead from an angry homesteader. But in a town of just nine
people, those kinds of conflicts can wreak havoc with community
good will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place is changing, the types of tourists have changed,''
says Malena Konek, the postmistress, who is also from a ranching
family. ``I think they want to change the way we think and the way
we live. They have less appreciation for the way of life here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Litchy, who grew up in the Portland area and bought the
store three years ago, says many of her customers have a profound
regard for the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appreciate the wildlife, the astounding beauty,'' Mrs.
Litchy said. ``Some of the local people, they don't want tourists
at all _ they abhor tourists, frankly. To them, the tourists that
tend to come here are urban people by nature, and they see urban
people as responsible for their plight in terms of environmental
regulations, stream-quality regulations and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   With only about 1 percent of Oregon's population living in the
entire southeastern corner of the state, the Malheur may well have
room to attract more tourists. The annual numbers of visitors
counted by the Bureau of Land Management to the Steens Mountain
area near here has remained steady, from 40,000 to 50,000, in most
of the last dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   John Ross, the manager of the eight-room Frenchglen Hotel, which
was built in 1924, says the real issue is not so much in getting
people interested in the spectacular beauty of the area, but in
getting some of the local residents to view them in less
threatening terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is that the ranchers are leery of tourists, mainly
because they have this feeling that they might be hard-core
environmentalists,'' Ross said. ``That's their big fear. They feel
that the tourists are coming here and they're all trying to figure
out ways to get the cattle off the range.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflicts here, in many ways, are simply another example of
the ongoing clash between the Old West and the New West. Catherine
Fine, who has lived in or around Frenchglen for nearly all of her
76 years, is friendly with just about everyone in town and with the
30 or so people who live in the ``suburbs,'' the name jokingly
given to the ranching and desert area in a roughly 40-mile radius
around Frenchglen.
</P>
<P>
   But she said: ``There are cattle people, and then there is a
different breed of people. And all I can say is, they really don't
see the world the same way at all.''

IN COURT, DIVERSITY FACES STRICT LEGAL TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Should have analysis slug.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the end, Boston Latin's affirmative action
admissions policy was a lofty educational ideal that crashed into
the stricter structures of the law.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, educators, like the Boston School Committee,
have based their arguments for affirmative action on the idea that
racial diversity was good for minorities and for whites, that
students become better citizens when they learn in classrooms with
a rainbow of faces.
</P>
<P>
   But while this argument works in politics _ where Bill Clinton
vowed a cabinet ``that looks like America'' _ it no longer works in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Racial diversity might mean, as studies have shown, a more
tolerant citizenry, greater minority participation in charitable
activities, the ascension of blacks to the middle class. These
might be legitimate social goals. But in court, what matters is
whether they are ``compelling'' governmental interests.
</P>
<P>
   So far, defenders of affirmative action have answered this
question only in what the court ruled ``abstract'' _ what critics
would call nebulous _ terms. Even proponents admit they have long
simply taken it as an article of faith that diversity is a good
thing, up there with motherhood and apple pie.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Thursday's and other recent rulings, the
challenge for Boston, as for so many other schools and universities
where teaching diversity has become as much a goal as teaching
literacy, is now in proving the value of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask people who believe in affirmative action, `Why do
you believe?' I think most of them will say, `Because we'll be a
better society in the future if we have a well-educated population
that reflects the diversity of America,''' said Richard Fallon, a
professor at Harvard Law School. ``That's the argument that ought
to be the strongest argument, but when you get into court, it gets
filtered through these legal categories. The court doesn't allow
you to argue that we want to have a classroom that looks like the
city of Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   In the landmark 1978 Bakke case, the Supreme Court said
diversity in university admissions was a worthwhile goal, but said
admissions could not be based solely on race; it could be but one
factor in considering who to admit. As an ideal, that decision
upheld Harvard's admissions procedures, where the College selects
candidates for a class with a range of diversity _ geographic,
economic, artistic and athletic, as well as race.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, the US Court of Appeals in Texas ruled in the
Hopwood case against the University of Texas, saying that diversity
in education is not a compelling government interest.
</P>
<P>
   Upholding the Latin School policy in May, Massachusetts Judge
Joseph L. Tauro ruled diversity was ``an important factor
contributing to students' intellectual and moral development.''
</P>
<P>
   But a federal appeals court panel overruled that decision
Thursday. The judges left open the question of whether diversity
should be a compelling interest of government, but they were clear
in saying that the value of diversity must be shown concretely and
specifically. It is too abstract to say diversity ``nourishes the
intellect,'' or ``furthers mutual understanding and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An inquiring court cannot content itself with abstractions,''
the judges wrote. ``To persuade us that diversity may serve as a
justification ... the School Committee must do more than ask us
blindly to accept its judgment. It must give substance to the
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Even critics of affirmative action acknowledge there is a test
gap in scores between black and white students in Boston, as there
is gap in the SAT scores of blacks and whites nationally. But there
is little proof, if any, that a diverse classroom can bridge that
gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``To look at that gap and say it's the result of discrimination,
or the results of lowered expectations, it's a calumny,'' said
Stephan Thernstrom, professor of government at Harvard, and an
expert witness for the Wessman family. ``You really shouldn't say
that without some demonstrated effort to document it. They have a
lot of money, but they didn't spend one cent to investigate or
document it.''
</P>
<P>
   For years after the Bakke decision, supporters based their
support for affirmative action on little more than emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, there has been little hard evidence to confirm the
belief of educators in the value of diversity,'' admit two
proponents of affirmative action, former Harvard president Derek
Bok and former Princeton president William Bowen, in their
widely-cited recent book, ``The Shape of the River,'' which
examines racial preference programs.
</P>
<P>
   But when courts began dismantling such programs in the early
1990s, researchers began a flurry of study projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people in the legal world believe institutions will be on
more solid legal grounds if they can ... argue that all their
strategies on diversity are important to achieving educational
goals,'' said Debra Humphreys of the Ford Foundation's Campus
Diversity Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The Bok/Bowen book's data shows that a large proportion of
blacks who benefited from affirmative action in the 1970s went on
to become doctors, lawyers and community leaders in above-average
numbers. And their average salary was $71,000.
</P>
<P>
   But leaving it to the courts to decide whether these are
``compelling'' interests for government has some educators wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts are moving into a domain that previously educators
were considered to be the experts on,'' Humphreys said. ``It is
breaking with a precedent.''

 &HT;    Priest has high hopes for Benning protest
 &HT;    By Virginia Anderson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the 1,500 or so nights that the Rev. Roy Bourgeois
spent in prison, when the banging chatter of the inmates stopped
and the loneliness raced out of his mind to taunt him, one thought
sustained him: This will help close the School of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, the protests didn't even attract enough people
to pack a potluck supper.
</P>
<P>
   But Bourgeois thinks Sunday's scheduled protest with an expected
4,000 demonstrators outside the gates of Fort Benning outside
Columbus is evidence his prayers to close the school may soon be
answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel this deep joy,'' Bourgeois said of this weekend's
expected crowd. ``Each year, it's really grown. It's reached a
point where people feel they must stand up for the poor of Latin
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army, which operates the training program for Latin American
soldiers, insists that the school will remain open, no matter how
many protesters show up and no matter how many go to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations started with a dozen people following the
Nov. 16, 1989, murder of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and
her 15-year-old daughter in El Salvador. Nineteen graduates of the
School of the Americas were among those charged with the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders of the school say it helps keep peace in an
unstable region and that only a small number of the more than
50,000 graduates have been linked to atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's demonstrations could include actor Martin Sheen,
500 Jesuit priests, busloads of nuns and hundreds of college
students, retirees and homemakers. Demonstrators from as far away
as Washington state are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 Native Americans are traveling by bus from South Dakota,
even though they don't have money for a motel room and plan to
sleep on the floor of a restaurant that will close for the night to
accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois, a 59-year-old decorated Vietnam veteran whose
experiences there steered him to become a missionary priest, has
said his protest movement would gain momentum with time.
Eventually, Congress will take away funding for the school and
force the Army to close it, he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew this, that you can send us to prison, but you
cannot silence the truth,'' Bourgeois said from his one-room
apartment across the street from the main gate of Fort Benning.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois and 14 others were released from federal prisons
across the country in September after serving time for crossing the
line at the base last Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
   While 601 demonstrators were arrested that day, only those who
had been sent letters by the base banning them from the property
for their involvement in previous protests were sentenced to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits political speech on military bases, but
Bourgeois and the other protesters contend the law is applied
inconsistently. The protesters claim that favorable political
speech, such as when senators visit the base, is allowed and that
dissident speech should also be.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Robert Elliott has repeatedly disagreed with
the protesters. Last January, after sentencing them to prison, he
fined them $3,000 to reinforce his point.
</P>
<P>
   In response to this weekend's protest plans, the Army is holding
an open house for reporters, inviting them to meet faculty and to
monitor classes. Capt. Kevin McIver, school spokesman, said
representatives from 20 countries, including Canada, were at the
school last week for discussions on diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois said he does not plan to cross the line at the base
Sunday because he has a hectic speaking schedule awaiting him this
winter and spring. He expects Sheen, currently filming a
documentary in Mexico and expected to arrive in Columbus on
Saturday, to cross the line with 1,000 or so other protesters.
Bourgeois said Sheen had received a letter from the base asking him
to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan Marianne Buckley and her husband, Ferd are among those
who may cross the line. They have begun to feel they must do more
than sit in church and pray, Marianne Buckley said. ``If we don't
do anything about it, then we're not living the Gospels,'' she
said.

 &HT;    University of Dayton students expect to be arrested at protest
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The two ledgers on the blackboard are labeled
``A'' and ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The students get a laugh out of that, but the letters stand for
a decision that's anything but frivolous. The ``A'' list represents
the University of Dayton students who have decided to get arrested
at this weekend's massive protest against the School of the
Americas at Fort Benning in Columbus, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen students and three UD faculty are leaving this morning
to join what promises to be the largest demonstration ever against
the American-run school that trains Latin American soldiers and
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   At this meeting Tuesday night in campus ministry offices, more
than half the students _ the ``chain gang,'' as one wag called them
_ said they intend to risk almost certain arrest by crossing the
line into government property.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently no one alerted them they are the generation supposed
to be consumed by resumes and landing the big-bucks job after
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the least I can do for the people of Central America
who are scraping to get by,'' said student T.J. Meyer, who made a
service trip to Haiti in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The students will join an expected 6,000 protesters at a Sunday
vigil, with 1,000 _ including actor Martin Sheen _ expected to
cross the line into government property. (In past years, first-time
offenders have been arrested, but not charged or prosecuted.)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 2,000 protesters attended the annual vigil sponsored
by the School of the Americas Watch, timed to commemorate the 1989
murder of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador. Many of the school's
graduates _ including 19 the soldiers incriminated in the killings
of the Jesuits _ have been linked to murders and other human rights
violations throughout Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The students, in other words, couldn't have picked a better
cause.
</P>
<P>
   If the 6,000 prediction seems inflated, consider the Dayton
contingent: Last year only four area residents went to Fort
Benning. This year that number has jumped to nearly 60, including
the UD contingent, 20 students from Antioch College, and nearly 20
other Daytonians.
</P>
<P>
   Why the groundswell? It could be the narrow defeat in September
_ by a margin of 212 to 201 _ of an amendment in Congress to cut
off funds to the School of the Americas. It could be the publicity
surrounding cases like that of Sister Marge Eilerman, a Fort
Loramie native currently serving a jail sentence for vandalism at
the school in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The UD students seem to be heeding no other drummer than their
own consciences. ``It's really a student movement,'' said senior
Rachel Hellman. ``The energy is here because the students want
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I need to go down there,'' said student Greg Luczak.
``But to get arrested could close a lot of doors in the future. I
might want to join the Peace Corps, and you can't do that with an
arrest record for civil disobedience.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the university courting the wrath of parents, or future
recriminations by the students themselves, by allowing its campus
ministry to sponsor the trip?
</P>
<P>
   UD president Brother Raymond Fitz said ``protesting is one
thing, getting arrested is another act. We wanted to make sure the
students saw through the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend a lot of time to get students socially aware, and
aware of what's going on around the globe,'' Fitz added. ``While
getting arrested might not be something I would have done, I have
respect for students who have thought through it. It's a
complicated issue, and they could have ignored it.''
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't. So much for the generation that doesn't care.

MAGICAL EVOCATION OF PARIS BALLET 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 12-year-old student at the Paris Opera Ballet
school fears that her idol, the company's star, will be replaced by
a Russian ballerina, and she causes an accident that ends the
visiting rival's performing career.
</P>
<P>
   This brief synopsis carries only a hint of the magic and depth
of ``La Mort du Cygne,'' the legendary 1937 film starring Yvette
Chauvire (then 20 years old), Janine Charrat (then 12) and Mia
Slavenska (then 23), which the French Institute/Alliance Francaise
has made the centerpiece of a blockbuster screening of French dance
films. The series begins on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Living legends will be on hand. Ms. Chauvire, who gave her
farewell performance at the Paris Opera Ballet in 1972, is one of
France's greatest ballerinas, and Ms. Charrat, one of the most
interesting French choreographers, was a leading dancer in the
1940s and '50s. Both will join a panel moderated by the critic
Robert Greskovic at 8 p.m. on Monday between two screenings of ``La
Mort du Cygne,'' at 6:30 and 9 p.m. at Florence Gould Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Slavenska, the Yugoslav-American ballerina who starred in
the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and later in her own
Slavenska-Franklin Ballet, will participate by conference call from
Los Angeles, where she teaches.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Benoit-Levy, the film's director, was already known in the
United States when ``Cygne'' was released here in 1938 under the
title ``Ballerina.'' American critics raved about the film,
recognizing its exquisite quality from the start. Rightly ignoring
its surface sentimentality, they were clearly unnerved and
impressed by Benoit-Levy's psychological insight into childhood
innocence gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   Today the film is priceless in its haunting evocation of the
Paris Opera on the eve of World War II. This is the ballet troupe
of Serge Lifar, whose choreography dominates the performance
scenes. The title ballet, not to be confused with Fokine's famous
solo ``The Dying Swan,'' looks downright silly, but elsewhere
Lifar's choreography is firmly grounded in the classical idiom.
</P>
<P>
   Lifar and Paul Morand, whose novella inspired the script, would
run into trouble after World War II for their association with the
Germans. Benoit-Levy, very much in the other camp, took refuge
during the war in New York, where he helped found a French
university in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of war hangs over the film; Ms. Charrat even worries that
Ms. Slavenska's character, Nathalie Karine, is an alien agent sent
to France to help start a war. Karine is a foreigner, as noted by
everyone from Mlle. Beaupre, the ballerina portrayed by Ms.
Chauvire, to the ballet school director. Xenophobia reigns in a
theater once dominated by Italians, but tradition reigns, too.
Child pupils are called ``little rats,'' and the heroine's name,
used with a straight face, is Rose Souris (Rose Mouse).
</P>
<P>
   Class distinctions abound. Rich admirers in white ties still
court ballerinas like Mlle. Beaupre in Degas' Foyer de la Danse. By
contrast, the children come from modest homes. Madame Souris, a
dressmaker, cannot understand why her daughter wants to dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is there besides dance?'' Rose asks in shock when her
idol, Mlle. Beaupre, prefers marriage. To say that Rose has
unintentionally committed a crime for nothing would be to see
``Cygne'' as melodrama. In its surprise ending, related to the
unexpected bond between the disabled rival and the child, the film
becomes instead testimony to the power of dance as art.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Charrat, as a child performer, and the two ballerinas are
extraordinary. No wonder the film inspired an American remake,
``The Unfinished Dance,'' in 1947 with the pigtailed Margaret
O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   The series begins earlier with two documentaries by the French
filmmaker Dominique Delouche. On Sunday, Delouche and Ms. Chauvire
will present ``Yvette Chauvire: A Star for Example'' (1988) which
gives a more contemporary view of the great ballerina's style and
coaching (4:30 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   ``Serge Peretti, the Last Italian'' (1998), the other film, is a
revealing look at the last male star at the Paris Opera Ballet to
embody a true mix of Italian and French training (6:30 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus, Patrick Bensard, director of the dance cinematheque
in Paris, will present archival films at the Tinker Auditorium of
the French Institute (Sunday, 9 p.m.; Monday at 9:30 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Admission at Florence Gould Hall (55 E. 59th St.) is $8 and at
Tinker Auditorium (22 E. 60th St., Manhattan), $5. Information:
(212) 355-6100.

 &HT;    States expected to accept $206 billion tobacco deal
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By today's noon deadline, a majority of states are
expected to accept a $206 billion settlement from the nation's
biggest cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers nationwide already are debating how to spend the
money, and Georgia's Thurbert Baker is one of dozens of state
attorneys general who have scheduled news conferences to accept the
offer at the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, which stands to collect about $4.8 billion over the
next 25 years, was expected to be joined by South Carolina,
Louisiana and Virginia today in making endorsement of the deal
unanimous among Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   But in Alabama, a lame-duck Gov. Fob James has persisted in
battling one of his political appointees in an attempt to get a
better deal. Attorney General Bill Pryor, appointed by James in
1997, already has signed the documents that could deliver Alabama
$3.2 billion over the next 25 years. In the tobacco-heavy South,
James stood alone in his reluctance to accept the national
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Tennessee, and Kentucky claimed their share. North
Carolina and Arkansas joined earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the settlement, Georgia would receive annual
payments of $150 million to $200 million most years, through 2024.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in separate deals, Florida, Mississippi, Texas and
Minnesota negotiated settlements totaling $40 billion over 25
years. Negotiators hoped that at least three-fourths of the
remaining 46 states would endorse the latest agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the national settlement, the tobacco
companies would curtail advertising and fund an anti-smoking
campaign worth $1.5 billion. Tobacco-growing states pressed the
nation's largest tobacco companies _ Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds,
Brown &AMP; Williamson and Lorillard _ to put a dollar figure on their
pledge to help farmers make up lost income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco farmers have a right to be heard, and they need to be
treated fairly,'' Tennessee Attorney General Knox Walkup said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the states' leaders, Alabama's Gov. James wanted
more time to wade through the extensive settlement document but a
circuit court judge denied his request for an extension Thursday.
Pryor warned James the national settlement would become reality
without him.

STARR FINALLY SPEAKS, WITH ANTICLIMATIC CALMNESS 
</HEADLINE>

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr's measured, unflappably academic
performance before the Judiciary Committee resounded with
anticlimax after all the long months of salacious news and
sensational accusations that have put President Clinton at risk of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel so long out of public sight except for
his morning taking-out-the-garbage photo opportunities finally
stepped forth to speak in defense of his case before a skittish
Congress and apprehensive nation.
</P>
<P>
   But, far from offering another lengthy narrative on DNA results
and lurid Oval Office behavior, Starr chose to beam judiciousness
itself as he hid any rancor and faced Democrats aching to wrestle
him into the dock in substitution of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did your office violate the law?'' one Democrat finally
snapped at him in the sixth hour of a day iron-hard with
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr did not rise openly to the bait as the Democrats
barbed their questions with everything from mockery to irony. He
responded in phrases of high professionalism and supreme regard for
the law, arguing that his proposed case against the president was
rooted not in political bias, but rather in ``the sanctity, yes the
sanctity, of the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, this left Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., fairly
gagging in the hallway during a break. ``Pathetic! Pathetic!'' he
declared of Starr, asking how such proclaimed standards of sanctity
squared with Starr's continued private lawyering in the corporate
sector even as he pursued the president, or his renunciation of the
news leaks that have buoyed the case against the president for the
past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more political than I thought he was,'' Meehan said
as the Democrats warily took their first up-close measure of the
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   It is something of a Capitol Hill tradition that witnesses often
gain the status of victim during a grueling hearing. As the
Democrats peppered Starr into the night with some shouted salvos of
``Do you affirm or deny'' questions, the independent counsel, as if
mindful of that tradition, was far from complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Starr wanted to indicate his special position,
according to committee staffers, by being allowed to stand and
speak before the Judiciary Committee at a lectern, as he did before
the Supreme Court when he was solicitor general. But Republican
majority members decided it best he make his case seated at a
table, like any other witness.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats took their opening shots at him frontally,
denouncing him as the nation's ``sex policeman.'' ``Mr. Starr has
crossed the line into obsession,'' declared a scowling Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., the ranking minority member, reviewing Starr's
four years of investigating a half dozen presidential portfolios,
from Whitewater to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Neither harried nor hurried, Starr used every minute of his two
hour opening statement to restate his case against Clinton in slow
emphatic tones. ``Few have ventured that the president told the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,'' he declared,
savoring the word ``truth'' and the court oath. This became his
rhetorical device at various times in accusing the president of
gravely violating that oath in the sex-and-mendacity scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats aimed to make their points before the watching
national audience. But, still, some seem frustrated in seeking a
promising handhold on Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look like a terrible, horrible person,'' said Rep.
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., smilingly conceded during a break. ``He
looked like a lawyer reading a boring, monotonous speech.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After Starr disowned any personal talent or partisan experience
in the world of politics, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., asked a
series of skeptical questions. ``Why did you withhold that before
the election,'' he asked, referring to the exoneration of the
president that Starr suddenly announced Thursday in several areas
of his investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, patiently, Starr denied all partisan machinations. When
Frank asked about leaks from the Starr investigation, Starr, a
former judge, gently objected: ``That is an unfair question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell me it's an unfair question, why I'll withdraw
it,'' Frank shot back in mock reverence at Starr's demeanor of
judiciousness.
</P>
<P>
   There was a genuine moment of bipartisan, inside-the-Beltway
laughter when Starr defended an early press release that made no
mention of threats that Ms. Lewinsky claimed were made by the
independent counsel's office. ``Let me explain what press
statements are designed to do,'' he responded and laughter rolled
across the room in general acknowledgment of the capital's
mendacious habits. Starr had to grin. Later, news workers could be
seen openly grinning, in turn, as Starr, quite professorial in
tone, declined to release from pledges of confidentiality the
squads of reporters gifted across the months with leaks in the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr testified into the committee's long night, Rep. Bob
Barr, R-Ga., praised him for tolerating the ``nonsense'' of critics
and offered him a lawyerly hypothetical. ``Let's presume that
Monica is an oversexed blabbermouth,'' Barr began, presuming
further ``the vast right wing conspiracy'' is true, along with
other contentions from critics. Would that change the basic
conclusion that the president deserved impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not change it,'' Starr responded, his tone and meter
as judicious at the ninth hour as it was in the morning. ``The
facts have a real power to them.''

   Despite the latest wave of mostly sports media-driven hysteria,
a ``deal'' between Connecticut officials and Patriots owner Robert
Kraft is far from done.
</P>
<P>
   What was announced Thursday is a memorandum of understanding
that provides for an exclusive period of negotiation between Kraft
and the state of Connecticut. It spells out a set of legislative
and economic conditions that would bring the Patriots to a new
downtown Hartford stadium in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone still needs time to digest the fine print. But chances
are, even if Connecticut Governor John Rowland says there's no
wiggle room, there's plenty of weasel room for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   From Kraft's perspective, why sign anything in front of TV
cameras, anyway, if not to start drumming up yet another
save-the-Patriots outcry on Boston talk radio? He could have signed
the thing in private, and in 45 days, backed up the trucks to
Foxboro Stadium to drive Drew and the boys down to Nowheresville,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the odds seem strong that the Patriots will end up in
Hartford. On paper, a $350 million publicly financed stadium
project sounds like a very good business opportunity, quite
possibly too good to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   How much do we really care? Does Massachusetts without the Pats
really become Tupelo without Elvis as a legendary native son?
</P>
<P>
   A loud gaggle of media and business people will argue
passionately that we are on our way to turning into Dubuque without
the Patriots. The argument ignores the fact that the Patriots left
Boston more than 20 years ago and, far from being dead, the city is
more vibrant than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Polls consistently show a majority in this state does not care
enough about losing the team to spend public money to keep them
here. There's almost a Monica Lewinsky dynamic going on here. The
public yawns, while the media insist the common man or woman is
just too stupid to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe they do get it. Maybe they do understand the
Kraft-Patriots saga is all about money, ego, and leverage and has
little or nothing to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   And the matter of ego, by the way, applies to Kraft and his
nemesis, House Speaker Thomas Finneran. The speaker really should
stop arguing this as a matter of principle, when he is making it so
very personal with his comments about ``fat-ass millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kraft takes the Hartford deal, he is making a clear,
bottom-line business decision. The status quo _ being the leader of
a Foxborough-based Patriots Nation _ is unacceptable because he is
a businessman and he wants to make more money. He can do it two
ways: by selling the Patriots; or, if he wants to retain ownership,
he can make money by bringing in more revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the way to maximize revenue is to get someone else to
pay for a bigger stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran says he won't go higher than $57 million for
infrastructure, versus the $72 million offered by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Both numbers are very far away from the amount Hartford is
willing to put up.
</P>
<P>
   They are so far away it seems unlikely Kraft would turn down the
Hartford deal _ as long as he keeps emotion out of the equation and
doesn't start to imagine how it will feel to ride a golf cart onto
the 50 yard line and be closer to Waterbury, Conn., than to
Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Kraft, we, too, should take the emotion out of the
equation. We can like football and think a professional football
franchise is nice to have. But we can still think of it as an
amenity, not a necessity. We can believe Boston is a terrific city
without the Patriots and that Hartford will be a better city, but
far from a terrific one, even with them.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand: if Kraft leaves, the Patriots are gone.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a psychic loss to some and an economic one to
others, at least until the land around Foxboro stadium produced
revenue from future development.
</P>
<P>
   It would mean nothing to most everyone else.

 &HT;    Barr calls for bribery charges against Clinton
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Georgia's Rep. Bob Barr used his latest five
minutes in the national limelight Thursday to try to saddle
President Clinton with an additional impeachable act: bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Barr was one of at least two Republicans on the House Judiciary
Committee who said Clinton's efforts to find Monica Lewinsky a job
amounted to a bribe for her silence or favorable testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could very legitimately make the case,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   But independent counsel Kenneth Starr, whose report did not
allege bribery, would not agree with Barr or Rep. Bill McCollum of
Florida, who put forth the same argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to join in a particular judgment beyond that
which we set forth in the referral,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, tell the Republicans: ``It's a fair issue.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, who first raised the bribery issue, contended the
facts were quite strong. ``It seems pretty darn clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One probable explanation for the new interest in alleging
bribery is that the crime is one of only two the Constitution
specifically mentions as grounds for impeaching a president. The
other is treason.
</P>
<P>
   Making a bribery case against Clinton would end the debate about
whether his actions are sufficiently serious to warrant
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Barr waited more than 8 1/2 hours for his five minutes of
questioning Starr. Like all the Republicans on the panel, he was
extremely complimentary of the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I commend you for standing up to this nonsense,'' Barr said,
referring to often biting questions from committee Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Barr sought to strengthen Starr's conclusions by asking him to
assume a set of facts that would put many of the president's
accusers in a harshly negative light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's presume,'' Barr began, that Linda Tripp is a ``nasty
person,'' that literary agent Lucianne Goldberg is a
``maniuplator,'' that Lewinsky is ``an oversexed blabbermouth,''
that Paula Jones was interested in nothing but money and that there
really is a vast right-wing conspiracy, as first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton has alleged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would any of that change the conclusions contained in your
referral?'' Barr asked.
</P>
<P>
   Both grateful and ready for the friendly question, Starr
replied: ``It would not change it. The facts have a real power to
them. It was Justice Brandeis who said, 'Facts, facts, facts. Give
me facts.'''

STARR'S GOOD NEWS: NO WRONGDOING IN WHITEWATER AND SOME OTHER
MATTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Also see IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-CLIFFORD, IMPEACH-ASSESS,
IMPEACH-VOICES, IMPEACH-MEDIA, IMPEACH-SCENE, IMPEACH-SCHUMER,
IMPEACH-MEMBERS, IMPEACH-LIVINGSTON and JAPAN-CLINTON) (smw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr on Thursday provided the public with
a wide-ranging portrait of his four-year, $40 million
investigation, announcing that he had not found any evidence of
impeachable wrongdoing by President Clinton on the Whitewater,
Filegate and Travelgate matters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee immediately seized on
the disclosure, repeatedly challenging Starr, the independent
counsel, and wondering, as Rep. Barney Frank did, why Starr did not
share the good news until after the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   Frank criticized Starr for failing to exonerate the president on
Filegate and Travelgate in September when he sent Congress the
445-page impeachment referral related to Clinton's affair with
Monica Lewinsky. ``In other words,'' he told Starr, ``you don't
have anything to say unless you have something bad to say.''
</P>
<P>
   While providing committee members with the most comprehensive
accounting of his office's many-tentacled inquiry, Starr devoted
one-fourth of his opening statement to matters other than the
Lewinsky case. In doing so, he announced that late last year he
secretly drafted an impeachment report for Congress that focused on
President Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater real estate
venture, the prosecutor's original investigative mission.
</P>
<P>
   But after intense debate within his office, Starr said, he
decided not to send the Whitewater referral to the House of
Representatives. He concluded that he could not be certain of the
truthfulness of two major witnesses, both of whom accused the
president of criminal wrongdoing but were convicted felons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded that it would be inconsistent with the statutory
standard because of the difficulty of establishing the truth with a
sufficient degree of confidence,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   That decision, Starr seemed to argue Thursday, was an example of
his caution and restraint, a self-portrait that is at odds with the
Democrats' critical refrain that the independent counsel is an
overzealous, politically motivated prosecutor obsessed with trying
to destroy the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr acknowledged that he had not found sufficient evidence to
accuse the president of criminal conduct in the Whitewater matter,
even though he insisted that he had not concluded his investigation
of the matter. He did not address whether the role of Hillary
Rodham Clinton was still under investigation, even though the grand
jury in Little Rock., Ark., that was reviewing the matter expired
last May.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also exonerated Clinton of wrongdoing in several other
continuing investigations, including the dismissal of the White
House travel office and the administration's improper gathering of
900 FBI files on former Republican officials.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, special counsel to the president, criticized
Starr's statement, saying that ``no new evidence'' was offered by
the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally and belatedly, he cleared the president and the first
lady with respect to two of his investigations,'' Craig said.
``This should have been done many, many months ago, if not years
ago. But we're grateful to learn of the news today.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr clearly had another, overarching motive Thursday. He tried
to draw parallels between the evasions he accused Clinton and the
White House of in the Lewinsky matter and the roadblocks that his
prosecutors had confronted in trying to determine whether there had
been an effort to obscure the Clintons' involvement in the failed
Whitewater land deal and its connection to the failed Madison
Guaranty Savings and Loan Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pattern of obstruction of justice, false statements and
misuse of executive authority in the Lewinsky investigation did not
occur in a vacuum,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Starr cited the missing billing records of Mrs.
Clinton's law practice, which his office had subpoenaed and ``were
finally produced under unusual circumstances.'' They were found in
the residential quarters of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a thorough investigation,'' Starr continued, ``we have
found no explanation how the billing records got where they were or
why they were not discovered and produced earlier. It remains a
mystery to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison was run by the Clintons' Whitewater business partners,
James McDougal and his wife at the time, Susan. Starr's original
mandate had been to determine whether money from Madison had been
used illegally to help business and political figures in Arkansas,
including Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and Clinton at the time he was
governor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Starr invested months investigating a $300,000 loan that went to
what he called Ms. McDougal's ``make-believe company.'' Starr said
that $50,000 of that loan benefited the Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
   Both McDougal and Tucker were indicted. But in testifying on
videotape as a defense witness at their trial in 1996, the
president said that he did not know about the loan to Ms. McDougal,
nor had he discussed it with McDougal or another Arkansas
businessman, David Hale. The president also said that he had never
received a loan from Madison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was important testimony,'' Starr said today. ``Its truth
_ or falsity _ went to the core issue of our investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996, McDougal, Ms. McDougal and Tucker were convicted.
While Ms. McDougal was later jailed for contempt for refusing to
answer Starr's questions about the testimony the president had
given in her trial, both McDougal and Tucker later cooperated with
Starr's inquiry, and they accused the President of having received
a loan from Madison. In one of his first meetings with prosecutors,
McDougal said that Clinton's trial testimony was ``at variance with
the truth,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   It was in late 1997 that Starr's prosecutors debated whether
this evidence justified the sending of an impeachment referral to
Congress. But Starr said that they had not been absolutely
confident in the accounts of Hale, who pleaded guilty to charges of
conspiring to defraud the Small Business Administration, and
McDougal. And, he said, they still wanted to hear from two other
witnesses who could either corroborate or contract their accounts:
Tucker and Ms. McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Starr acknowledged that Tucker had little
knowledge of the loan to Ms. McDougal's company and the president's
possible role in it.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Ms. McDougal, who is still awaiting a trial by
Starr's prosecutors next year in Little Rock. But Starr again
Thursday angrily repeated a longstanding complaint that Clinton
``sided with a convicted felon'' _ Ms. McDougal _ in an interview
after she had been cited for contempt. In that interview, on PBS,
the president said there was a lot of evidence to support Ms.
McDougal's criticisms of Starr's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far as we are aware, no sitting president has ever publicly
indicated his agreement with a convicted felon's stated reason for
refusing to obey a Federal court order to testify,'' Starr said
angrily to committee members.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also said that his investigation was stymied by the lack
of cooperation of Webster L. Hubbell, who was indicted by Starr for
a third time last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Without commenting on the indictment, Starr said that Hubbell
may have additional information about the Whitewater matter.

 &HT;    Prankster Moore ambushes Barr for film on Starr
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), one of the impeachment
standard bearers, was fresh off his first television interview of
the morning Thursday when he ran into a camera lens he would have
sooner not seen.
</P>
<P>
   Producer/prankster Michael Moore, marauding Capitol Hill to
gather material for a satire on Independent Counsel Ken Starr,
ambushed Barr after an early morning interview on CBS' This Morning
to pepper him with questions about impeachment, marijuana and whip
cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting great stuff,'' exalted Moore after the
encounter. ``Some of our greatest stuff was with Bob Barr.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Moore, the Georgia Republican paused long enough to
explain why President Clinton's conduct was more than just sex and
why he opposed the District of Columbia voting on the use of
marijuana for medical purposes. Moore also said he asked Barr to
explain an incident in which Barr licked whipped cream off the
chest of a woman at a 1992 Cobb County fund-raiser for leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the whip cream incident has weighed heavily on his
mind,'' said Moore, wearing his trademark baseball cap. ``I asked
him why it was moral for him to sit in judgment of the president
when he has been married three times and licked whip cream off the
breast of a beauty contestant.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore hinted that he might have simulated the whip cream
incident for the benefit of the camera, but Barr spokesman Brad
Alexander said Moore played no tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Barr himself was mostly mum about the morning encounter, saying
in response to Moore's suggestion that the whip cream incident
weighed on Barr's conscience, ``Apparently, it was on his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who produced Roger &AMP; Me, his satirical account of General
Motors and GM plant closings in Flint, Mich., has been busy filming
a documentary on Starr for his cable show, ``The Awful Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his recent antics include appearing outside Starr's
Washington house with a band of actors dressed as Colonial-era
Puritans.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he brought an overweight actor dressed as President
Thomas Jefferson who interrupted a GOP press conference shouting,
``Impeach me, impeach me. I had an affair and I've been lying about
it for 200 years.'' The man was promptly hauled off by police.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he was surprised that Barr was willing to joust with
him, noting that most members of Congress would have blown him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, OK, (Clinton) lied, but he lied about sex,'' Moore
said to told Barr. ``I said, `Come on, we're guys! Guys lie about
sex. Some of us can only get sex if we lie.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barr's response, Moore said, was ``Yes, but he lied, he lied, he
lied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very funny, I'll say that for him,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I should take that as a compliment,'' Barr said.

 &HT;    Starr testimony packs few dramatic punches
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cirque du Soleil can rest easy. Despite concerns _ or
perhaps in some quarters, secret hopes _ that Thursday's televised
impeachment hearings might have a whiff of greasepaint and the slap
of large floppy shoes, it was a pretty circumspect affair.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's Bruce Morton likened independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
demeanor to ``sort of like your high school Latin teacher,'' and
Greta Van Susteren said Starr's two hours of testimony was ``a
verbal Cliffs Notes (of his full report) for members of Congress.''
Two more reasons for believing real life is like high school, only
with less flamboyant clothes and higher stakes.
</P>
<P>
   And what a contrast to the last 10 months of media madness, what
CNN's Jeff Greenfield called ``this maelstrom of semi-informed and
uninformed windbaggery and totally partisan posturing on both
sides.'' He's obviously been sneaking over to CNBC to watch
``Geraldo Live,'' the World Wrestling Federation of
Clinton-Lewinsky coverage.
</P>
<P>
   There was a consensus among network analysts _ the partisan
posturers aside _ that nothing anyone said Thursday changed any
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anything happening that will cause any kind of
groundswell,'' said NBC's Lisa Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Taylor, a conservative PBS analyst who's been friendly to
Starr, noted Thursday that the prosecutor had a problem ``giving
direct, simple answers to direct, simple questions. My reaction is,
`Come on, get to the point.''' But ABC legal analyst Jeffrey
Toobin, who has been critical of Starr's investigation, praised the
independent counsel for his answers to pointed questioning from
House Judiciary Committee Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with television at full attention, dress grays,
shoes spit-shined. CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC, all anchored down and
ready for business. Fox, Court TV, PBS, C-SPAN and MSNBC. But
slowly they started peeling away.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Fox affiliate, WAGA, was the first defector, switching
to ``Judge Judy'' after Starr had barely begun. ``I have a truth
detector back here,'' Judge Judy admonished some miscreant before
her. Would that she had shared it with the country sometime during
the last 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   By the afternoon, the major networks had slouched back to their
soaps, leaving the grown-ups _ CNN, PBS, C-SPAN _ to soldier on,
even though there were long, long stretches that seemed like going
through the motions.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Greenfield nailed it. ``What the process has gained in
immediacy it seems to have lost in majesty,'' he said. ``We chew
over this debate day after day, night after night on 100 different
outlets. When we get to the formal proceedings, this hearing,
everyone knows their parts. We can almost recite along with
everybody what their lines are.''
</P>
<P>
   We _ all of us, the viewers, the voters, the politicians, the
spinmeisters, the talk show hosts _ had already chewed it all over
so thoroughly, for so long, that there was nothing left to chew.

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening a bitterly partisan House impeachment
hearing, Kenneth Starr Thursday mounted a vigorous daylong defense
of his office and his impeachment report to Congress, and said that
perjury is an impeachable crime no matter what the subject of the
lies.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance that began the public phase of the nation's
third impeachment inquiry into a president, the prosecutor who has
come to be detested by the American public coolly and in a quiet
monotone described himself as a fervent believer in the law. Starr
spoke for hours in a patient voice that had rarely been heard in
public, replying at length to questions ranging from details of the
Monica Lewinsky matter to how the investigation had changed his
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a man of politics,'' Starr told the 37 members of the
House Judiciary Committee. Instead, he described himself as a man
with ``unyielding faith in our court system _ our system of
judicial review, the independence of our judges, our jury system,
the integrity of the oath and the sanctity, yes, the sanctity of
the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   The day began with a quick display of the sometimes rancorous
partisanship that has come to characterize the ideologically
polarized committee presiding over the impeachment inquiry into
President Clinton. On a party line vote, the Republican-controlled
committee rejected an attempt by Democrats to give the president's
lawyers two hours to question Starr, who had been granted two hours
to deliver his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a grave disservice at a grave constitutional moment,''
said Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass., who had called for more time
for Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the committee chairman, offered Clinton
``unlimited time'' if he ever chose to give his version of events
to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting strategies of the two parties _ reflected time
and again throughout the day _ were underscored almost immediately.
``Do we still have a government of laws and not of men?'' asked
Hyde, R-Ill., as he opened the hearing. ``Does the law apply to
some people with force and ferocity while the powerful are immune?
Do we have one set of laws for the officer and another for the
enlisted?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers, Jr., the ranking Democrat, sought to put
Starr himself on trial, accusing him of crossing the ``line into
obsession'' in his four-year investigation of Clinton. ``The idea
of a federally paid sex policeman spending millions of dollars to
trap an unfaithful spouse, or to police civil litigation would have
been unthinkable prior to the Starr investigation,'' the Michigan
Democrat said. ``Let there be no mistake, it is now acceptable in
America to investigate a person's private sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his wife were both out of the country as the
Judiciary Committee held the first impeachment hearings against a
president since the Watergate inquiry of Richard M. Nixon 24 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was the first witness called before the committee,
although Hyde said Thursday there would be others. Across the next
two weeks, the Republicans also plan to take closed-door
depositions from four other figures, including Robert Bennett, one
of Clinton's lawyers and Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White House
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   After Starr's morning statement, the White House said he had not
shed light on his investigation. ``He offered no new evidence, no
new information, and no new explanations for his tactics,'' said
Gregory Craig, a White House special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Starr calmly testified and answered sometimes hostile questions
across a marathon day that began at 10 a.m. and stretched well into
the night. He rarely seemed rattled, only once or twice became
acerbic, and did not raise his voice. He defended himself and his
office against accusations of prosecutorial overkill and he agreed
to provide the committee with a list of clients from his former law
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Starr sought to dispel the argument that his case against
Clinton concerned the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
rather than the question of whether he lied under oath in the
sexual harassment case brought by Paula Jones and then lied again
before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual harassment cases are often he-said-she said disputes,''
Starr said. ``Evidence reflecting the behavior of both parties can
be critical _ including the defendant's relationships with other
employees in the workplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such questions can be uncomfortable, but they occur every day
in courts and law offices across the country. Individuals in these
cases take an oath to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth. And no one is entitled to lie under oath simply
because he or she does not like the questions or because he
believes the case is frivolous or that it is financially motivated
or that it is politically motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice during his two-hour morning presentation as he mentioned
his other investigations including Whitewater, Rep. Sheila
Jackson-Lee, D.-Texas, interrupted to ask that Starr be limited to
the Lewinsky matter. She was overruled.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr had finished, Abbe Lowell, the Democrats' senior
investigative counsel, cross-examined Starr about his ties to
lawyers associated with Ms. Jones and about his office's early
contacts with both Ms. Lewinsky and with Linda Tripp, the woman who
set off the year-long investigation by bringing prosecutors
tape-recordings of her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell contrasted Starr's report with that of the Watergate
prosecutor Leon Jaworski who had presented Congress with facts but
no conclusions. Starr replied that he was the first to submit a
presidential impeachment report under the independent counsel
statute, which he felt required him to make judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tool,'' he said of his report. ``This is only a tool
for you to use as you see fit. But I don't think it's fair to
criticize my office for not following a pattern that was not
governed by a statute.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment
hearings into President Clinton on Thursday, one member, Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., found himself in a position to do
something unique in U.S. history: vote on an impeachment proceeding
in committee, on the House floor and in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer is one of three members of the House to be elected to
the Senate this fall. (Rep. Michael Crapo, R-Idaho, and Rep. Jim
Bunning, R-Ky., are the others.) But he is the only one of the
three who sits on the Judiciary Committee, which must decide
whether to send the matter to the full House.
</P>
<P>
   And he is the only one of the three who has said that if the
House approves an article of impeachment against Clinton, he will
probably vote on the issue in the Senate next year. Crapo is still
studying the matter, his aides said, while Bunning's office did not
return calls seeking comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has been a vocal supporter of Clinton, who, along with
his wife and Vice President Gore, campaigned for him repeatedly
this fall. Since early October, Schumer has said that Clinton's
behavior in the Monica Lewinsky scandal did not rise to the level
of an impeachable offense. But he has said that he will support a
lesser punishment, like censure.
</P>
<P>
   As the Judiciary Committee began its questioning of independent
counsel Kenneth Starr on Thursday afternoon, Schumer told his
Republican colleagues that they were losing ``the hearts and minds
of the American people'' by continuing their investigation into
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should hang a sign outside the Judiciary Committee
that says, `Out to lunch, gone fishing''' Schumer said. ``We were
out to lunch because we're so far afield of what the American
people want us to do. We've gone fishing because despite a
five-year fishing expedition which has yielded nothing more than
allegations revolving around a tawdry sex scandal, this committee
is still trying to bait the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday evening, Schumer said that if
impeachment went to the Senate, he was ``leaning toward'' voting
because he did not want to deprive New Yorkers of a say on a
crucial matter. There are no Senate rules barring a member from
voting twice on a bill of impeachment, and the Constitution is
silent on the matter. But only one senator of the nine who have
been in the same situation exercised his right to vote twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt,'' Schumer said, ``the founding fathers
understood the process would not be entirely a judicial one, but a
quasi-judicial and a quasi-legislative one, which means partly
political. On a regular jury, you have substitutes. But you don't
in the Senate. So if I were to recuse myself in the Senate, the
voters of New York would have half the representation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he did not expect the House to vote to impeach
Clinton because of the Republicans' weak showing in the midterm
elections two weeks ago and because he thought his colleagues would
find the evidence ``flimsy.''
</P>
<P>
   The House will serve as a grand jury in the proceedings,
determining whether the charges against the president are serious
and well-documented enough to warrant a trial. That trial would be
held in the Senate, where the 100 members would serve as the jury,
with the power to remove Clinton if they found him guilty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There have been only three times that members of Congress have
been in a position to vote in both houses on the same bill of
impeachment, said Donald Ritchie, one of the Senate's official
historians. All but one of the nine senators involved in those
three cases gave up their votes in the Senate on cases they had
considered in the House the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie said the only exception was in 1804 in the case of John
Pickering, a federal judge from New Hampshire who was accused of
drunkenness and mental instability. Over the objections of Sen.
John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts, Sen. Samuel Smith of Maryland
voted to remove Pickering, after having voted the year before to
impeach him in the House. Two other House members who were elected
to the Senate in the same year excused themselves from voting in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, Rep. John Overton, D-La., and Rep. Augustine Lonergan,
D-Conn., declined to vote on a bill of impeachment against a
federal judge, Harold Louderback, because they had participated in
the House impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent case, four Republican members of the House
were elected to the Senate after the House voted to impeach a
federal judge, Alcee Hastings of Florida, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   All four _ Trent Lott of Mississippi, Connie Mack of Florida,
Dan Coats of Indiana and James Jeffords of Vermont _ excused
themselves from voting in the Senate. Hastings was found guilty by
the Senate and removed from the bench. He is now a Democratic
congressman from the Fort Lauderdale area.

ADVERTISING: PAINE WEBBER BRINGS BACK CLASSIC CATCH PHRASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fans of advertising slogans that develop into catch
phrases and enter the vernacular can gratefully start saying
``Thank you Paine Webber'' again. The reason? Paine Webber Group
Inc. is bringing back that familiar theme after an 11-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   The New York office of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, the longtime Paine
Webber agency, is reviving the gratitude attitude in a television
and print campaign that begins this week, promoting what Paine
Webber describes as its strong heritage of customized investment
advice. Plans call for a budget of more than $20 million, the
largest in the 119-year history of Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback for the well-known phrase is emblematic of the
efforts being made by investment firms to attract the attention of
consumers in an increasingly crowded and competitive category. That
task is complicated by the recent rapid fluctuations in the stock
market, which have left many Americans feeling less like bulls or
bears and more, perhaps, like chickens.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seek customized advice when they're anxious about their
money,'' said Marten Hoekstra, executive vice president and
marketing director for the Paine Webber Private Client Group in New
York, the firm's retail business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ads have been in the works since late spring,'' he added,
``and neither the strategy nor the execution has been changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The return of ``Thank you Paine Webber,'' which replaces a
campaign called ``Invest with more intelligence,'' comes as two
other Wall Street firms, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and John Nuveen &AMP; Co.,
are changing agencies. At the same time, financial service
marketers like Fidelity Investments are stepping up their
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a request from Paine Webber to just bring back
`Thank you,' '' said Craig Miller, executive vice president and
executive creative director at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi. ``It had to mean
something _ and this time, it's about the advice.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial run of ``Thank you,'' from 1975 to 1987, was
``focused on `Thank you for the success, the material rewards,' ''
said Miller, an art director who worked on the campaign with Doug
Pippin, a creative director and copywriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time for that,'' Miller said, ``because
customers now are more sophisticated,'' wanting to save for college
tuition or comfortable retirement rather than wine cellars or
yachts.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market turmoil in the fall of 1987 led Paine Webber
and Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi to replace ``Thank you'' with ads labeled
``Special reports,'' in a straightforward, news-style format.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as investments went at that point,'' Hoekstra said,
``people weren't thankful in general, much less to Paine Webber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though our strategists did a good job when the crash
came,'' he added, ``we didn't feel the `Thank you' tag line fit.''
The next theme, ``We invest in relationships,'' was introduced in
1990, followed by ``Invest with more intelligence'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to refocus on investment advice is underlined in
the commercials as the words ``for the advice'' are superimposed
along with ``Thank you Paine Webber.''
</P>
<P>
   Four spots, to run on broadcast and cable networks, show groups
of people in everyday settings _ at a children's soccer game, in an
airport, aboard a train, riding bicycles on a country road _ who
are pondering investment options.
</P>
<P>
   Through interior monologues, viewers hear a cacophony of
conflicting opinions until the end of each commercial, when a
satisfied Paine Webber client is heard thinking ``Thank you Paine
Webber'' with a calm smile on his or her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The abundant supply of excellent financial information, rather
than leading people to feel more confident, has led to a higher
level of confusion,'' Hoekstra said. ``That gives customized advice
unique value.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials offer some humorous touches atypical for a Wall
Street pitch. In the airport spot, a youngster playing a video game
is heard thinking ``My portfolio should be invested in game
companies.'' In the cycling spot, a farmer watching the riders is
heard thinking ``Titanium bikes are overrated.''
</P>
<P>
   In the soccer spot, a dog is heard thinking: ``Did that kid just
drop a pretzel? I like pretzels. I really like pretzels!'' And in
the train spot, a man with a portable stereo is heard listening to
``For the Love of Money'' by the O'Jays.
</P>
<P>
   The print ads, in magazines and newspapers, take a different
tack because the interior monologue device would be difficult to
illustrate short of placing cartoon-like thought balloons over
investors' heads.
</P>
<P>
   Each print ad begins with a nugget of conventional wisdom such
as ``They say retirement means the end of your working years.''
Then comes advice from Paine Webber under the headline ``We say.''
Each ad ends by asserting ``You'll say `Thank you Paine Webber.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now that ``Thank you Paine Webber'' is here again, how long
before someone finds a way to bring back ``My broker is E.F.
Hutton. And E.F. Hutton says . . .''?

MARKET PLACE: EDS AND NIKE SEEKING FINANCE CHIEFS FOR MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SHARON R. KING   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A company that goes for some time without a chief financial
officer may be raising a red flag for investors.
</P>
<P>
   The average search for a chief financial officer takes three to
four months, according to Lee Pomeroy, a consultant at Egon Zehnder
International, an executive search firm. A quest that drags on
longer than that can indicate that things are ``structurally
wrong'' within the company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for a corporation's top financial job, of course, may
balk for any number of reasons. They may be dissatisfied with the
compensation, the degree of authority or the chain of command. But
sometimes the issues are ones that also concern investors:
management's corporate strategy, the abilities of the chief
executive or the strength of the company's business.
</P>
<P>
   That's why some analysts have been looking somewhat warily at
Electronic Data Systems and Nike, two companies that have been
without chief financial officers for more than seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have struggled as the global financial turmoil
saps their revenues, and the price of both their stocks have
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of EDS are down more than 11 percent for the year.
Thursday, they closed at $38.9375. Class B shares of Nike are up 7
percent for the year, but down more than 20 percent since July.
They closed at $41.8125 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   EDS says its search for a finance chief has been put on hold
until a new chief executive is found. Nike is now on its second
search firm for a chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while the business slowdowns are investors' primary
concern, the continued absence of finance chiefs does not help
foster confidence in the two companies, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Gieber, senior equity analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman,
said that EDS needed stronger internal financial controls and a
finance chief who would enact them quickly, enabling the company to
improve its ability to forecast earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the earnings surprises were surprises to senior
management as well,'' Gieber said. ``One thing I want to hear a CFO
saying is, `We now have our internal reporting structure under
control.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments reflect the rising importance of chief financial
officers as their role has grown in recent years: they help
orchestrate turnarounds of troubled companies, identify and
negotiate mergers and acquisitions and plan spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief financial officer is the second most important
person'' in a company, said Randall Peterson, an assistant
professor of organizational behavior at Cornell University's
Johnson Graduate School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive is primarily responsible for setting a
company's strategic direction, but the chief financial officer is
usually responsible for the day-to-day financial activities and can
play a major role in communicating corporate strategies and
progress to shareholders, said Stephen Gates, a principal
researcher for the Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a Conference Board study of the stock performance of 300
companies in the last three years found that at companies whose
stocks outperformed those of their rivals the chief financial
officer usually spent more than 20 percent of his or her time
assisting executives with forming business strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Hopkins, who was named as the new chief financial
officer at Boeing Co. on Monday, is a good example of the finance
chief many companies now seek. Ms. Hopkins, formerly the finance
chief of European operations for General Motors Corp., has overseen
risk-management programs and developed programs that aided GM's
international growth. Prior to that, she helped turn around the
troubled Unisys Corp. Before Boeing's announcement, Ms. Hopkins had
been considered a top candidate to fill the post at EDS.
</P>
<P>
   As demand for top finance executives rises, so does their
compensation. Last year, the average compensation of chief
financial officers, including the value of stock options, rose to
more than $4 million, up 83 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The star power of some finance chiefs is sometimes illustrated
by how the market reacts to their departures or arrivals. Jerome B.
York earned such a strong reputation for his cost-cutting ways as
chief financial officer of IBM that when he left in September 1995,
the company's shares tumbled nearly 2 percent in a session in which
other computer stocks rose.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Nike, the world's largest athletic footwear
company, Robert Falcone, who had held the post for six years,
resigned in January. Nike has suffered from declining sales in the
United States and abroad. Hiring a chief financial officer,
analysts say, could indicate that Nike is serious about making
changes and improving its profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crucial role, especially in a turnaround,'' Faye
Landes, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Nike's expenses and inventory controls might get
more attention from a chief financial officer. ``Many people would
like Nike to take a very strong look at expenses,'' she said. ``The
company has always been able to grow into expenses, but it's
dealing with a much smaller growth rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Nike's problems in recent months can be traced to
swollen inventory, caused by a sales slowdown in Asia and waning
popularity of some styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might also be prudent for the company to look at how it
forecasts,'' Ms. Landes said. ``They forecast better than anybody
in the industry, but it might not be good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cava, Nike's vice president for global human resources,
conceded that the search had ``certainly taken longer than we had
hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Nike had had the greatest difficulty in attracting
candidates whose families were willing to relocate to its corporate
headquarters in Beaverton, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a special company with a special culture and fit is as
important as the technical qualifications,'' Cava said. ``Our
process is probably a little more rigorous.''

CHIEFS COLLAPSE UNDER WEIGHT OF CHARACTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More and more, you hear it. More and more, you question how much
of it is lip service. But there is a movement under way in the jock
kingdom _ character does count, and characters don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get it,'' Jerry Jones has said about 10 dozen times since
January. What Jones ``got'' was a pointed message from his team's
fans. Clean up the Cowboys, or else.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry has made more than an effort. It's now his crusade. The
crusade continues. It hasn't been perfect, but it's been effective.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Atlanta coach Dan Reeves never mentioned offensive
expertise when he explained why Chan Gailey was a perfect fit as
the new coach of the Cowboys. ``Chan has morals,'' said Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   From June Jones, interim coach at San Diego, on last week's
benching of rookie quarterback Ryan Leaf: ``You've got to
constantly work with him about being professional and having
class.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers mortgaged their franchise future with draft-pick
giveaways to draft Leaf. Isn't it a bit late to be concerned about
class and character? Where was the homework before the draft? When
a ``franchise receiver'' named Randy Moss was sliding rapidly
through the first round of last April's NFL draft, Minnesota landed
this bargain with the 20th pick.
</P>
<P>
   Moss has thus far been trouble-free and a rookie sensation. Did
the Vikings know something? Did they outfox those other 19 teams,
including the Cowboys, that passed up Moss because of his
reputation?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said a Cowboys scout. ``The Vikings could take the
gamble because they didn't have an owner at the time.'' Excellent
point.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Davis left the Cowboys' coaching staff to take over at the
University of Miami, then considered the ``death row'' of college
football.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' No. 1 rule on recruiting to his staff of assistants is
this:
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be fired for a mistake on talent. You can be fired
for a mistake on character.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Miami fans think Davis should be fired, period. Who cares
about image and character? They want national championships.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, the Rangers cleaned out their clubhouse several
years ago, which management says resulted in two divisional titles
in three years. It didn't help against the Yankees in the playoffs,
but both times those were ``good character'' New York teams that
went on to win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above is a small sampling of a much larger picture.
The movement is real, and it's widespread.
</P>
<P>
   But, from the other side comes the strangest story of the NFL
season. This involves the collapse of the Kansas City Chiefs and
the possible firing of 10-year head coach Marty Schottenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   As former Chiefs player Mark Collins said, ``Marty decided he
wanted a bunch of thugs, and that's what he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins uttered that quote before Monday's night game in Kansas
City against the Denver Broncos. Almost on cue, the Chiefs'
performance made Collins the Psychic Hotline NFL player of the
year. And it had nothing to do with the Chiefs being drilled on the
field by Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Schottenheimer said he was ``embarrassed, humiliated and angry''
after his team committed five personal-foul penalties on the
Broncos' final drive of the game. The coach clearly lost control of
his team.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday morning, Schottenheimer was the talk of the NFL, but
what was being said had nothing to do with the respect usually
afforded Schottenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   This is a veteran coach who screwed up severely by bringing in
characters for this season, while character went out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's Neil Smith was a longtime star in Kansas City. After
the Monday night game, he said, ``In all my years with the Chiefs,
Marty used to always say that's why the Raiders would never win
again and that we could never be like them. Now that's what they've
become.''
</P>
<P>
   One theory is Schottenheimer had success last season when
receiver Andre Rison made a contribution for the Chiefs without his
usual disruptions. So this season, he added more players with
Rison-like reputations. Schottenheimer thought he had the answer to
handling problem players. Instead, KC is 4-6, and a team in total
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Did Marty figure he could be a thug-tamer like Jimmy Johnson?
``Jimmy still can get away with it because any bad apple he brings
in has a contract that is easily dumped,'' said one NFL head coach.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Schottenheimer now serves as the poster boy for
the jock-world movement known as ``Character Counts.'' Don't be
like Marty.

TEXAS TEAM FULL OF FAMILY TIES OFF TO A PERFECT 11-0 RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 AFFAIR-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAULA CABALLERO 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EULESS, Texas _ If a family atmosphere is mandatory for team
success, then Trinity (Texas) High School's 11-0 football team has
more than met its prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having a team-wide chemistry every coach brags
about come playoff time, the Trojans also boast five sets of
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Julius and Kuna Maumalanga are starters and stars of
the team, and have their biggest fan on the sideline in first
cousin Tommy Fonua, a junior on the scout team.
</P>
<P>
   Senior cousins Joe and George Heimuli line up one behind the
other on defense. Junior identical twins Brian and Brandon Hall are
role players, aspiring full-time starters.
</P>
<P>
   Team trainer Mike ``Doc'' Pruitt is joined on the sidelines by
his son, junior Mitch Pruitt, a backup quarterback. Assistant coach
Chuck Caniford sends the running backs into battle and his cousin
Cori Menegay, a senior student trainer, patches them up afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Their ties are tight, and they say the result fuses the team
closer together. Whether that means more relatives in the stands to
cheer on the Trojans or personal inspiration to make the big play,
having family on the field makes the extra effort easy to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``We push each other harder, which helps us and it helps the
team,'' Brandon Hall said. ``Having a lot of family on the team is
good. We're not scared to get under each other's skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Each relationship is distinctive, bringing different motivations
and advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Doc Pruitt has been bringing Mitch to games since he was 3 or 4.
When Mitch was 6, he started as ball boy. Now, he's suited up on
the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people call him Doc, but I call him Dad,'' Mitch Pruitt
said. ``I like it because some kids don't get to see their dad
hardly at all, but I get to see my dad at work every day when I'm
at school.''
</P>
<P>
   George and Joe Heimuli grew up in San Bruno, Calif. They moved
to Texas for seventh grade when their parents were transferred, and
began playing tackle football.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two are starters on a successful defense, with George at
linebacker and Joe at defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pump each other up,'' George said. ``If I miss a tackle, he
gets my back. And if he misses a tackle, I get his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're family, it gives us a little magic, a little
power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maumalangas feel their brother connection gives them magic,
too _ and that magic is evident. Senior linebacker Julius leads the
defense with 110 tackles, including five for losses. Junior
flanker/defensive back Kuna has scored touchdowns receiving,
rushing and on defense.
</P>
<P>
   But the brothers will play their last game together sometime in
the next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to make this season good for him \RJulius\S because
it's his last year,'' Kuna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to enjoy it,'' Julius said. ``I'd like to enjoy it
by going to state together. And I hope we can continue to play
together past high school.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall twins have one more year together. Maybe next year
their on-field performances will help separate the look-alikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in practice on second defense together and Brian got
yelled at and they took me out,'' Brandon Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then my brother misses his block and I got yelled at,'' Brian
said. ``It goes both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   As reserve players, the Halls savor their playing time,
particularly in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's most special when we're on the field together,''
Brian said. ``We're both usually in there on special teams. I don't
think about it as much if I'm in there by myself, but \RBrandon\S
will be the first to give me a head-butt when I get off the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Cori Menegay, in her third year as a trainer, and cousin Chuck
Caniford, in his first year as an assistant, say they're more like
brother and sister. The two grew up together in Trinity territory,
the two families' homes just blocks apart.
</P>
<P>
   And with both of them on the field, their families have become
even bigger Trojans fans than they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps get both of our families involved,'' Caniford said.
``We have 12 to 20 relatives in the stands on a given night. We
even had a game where grandparents came from Ohio to support us.''
</P>
<P>
   The families within the Trinity football family have helped keep
the team united, powerful and perfect. And no one acknowledges that
more than head coach Ed Hickman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working together, forgiving each other and supporting each
other,'' Hickman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is team? It is family.''

MICROSOFT ACCUSED OF KEEPING PRICES HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY and STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. has kept the price of personal
computer software ``significantly'' higher than would be expected
if the company faced real competition, an economic consultant
testified Thursday in the Microsoft trial.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Warren-Boulton, an economist and government witness,
did not estimate precisely how much higher Microsoft has kept
prices because of its monopoly power, but he asserted that it was
``significantly above 5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Warren-Boulton said he had been told about new data
that the Justice Department had recently received from Microsoft in
response to a subpoena showing that the price the company charged
computer makers for the Windows operating system had ``increased
substantially over the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier witnesses called Microsoft a monopoly and testified that
it used its market muscle with abandon. But most of them were
industry executives who said they were victims of anti-competitive
behavior by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   And while several mentioned in passing that they thought
consumers as well as competitors would benefit if Microsoft's power
were curbed, Warren-Boulton said he had researched the matter in an
effort to measure any harm to consumers from Microsoft's business
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer damage is a tricky issue for both sides _ potentially
damaging for Microsoft but difficult for the government to prove.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have concluded that Microsoft has kept software
prices higher than they would be if there were more competition in
the markets that Microsoft dominates. For example, two consumer
groups, the Consumer Federation of America and the Media Access
Project, issued a report last month asserting that the price of
Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system was more
than double what it would be in a competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   Such studies, however, are inherently speculative, in part
because they often compare Microsoft's software prices with price
trends in hardware, which tend toward steady decline. Microsoft
counters that it is constantly adding new features to its products
so that on a performance-adjusted basis, the company has kept its
software prices quite low.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's economic expert, Richard Schmalensee, a professor at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, will testify to that
effect later in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Warren-Boulton testified that every software company has to add
new features to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of the government's expert witnesses, like
Warren-Boulton, is mainly to provide context for the case. The
government is not contending that Microsoft's monopoly in the
operating system market is illegal. But the government must
convince the court that Microsoft is a monopoly before it can argue
that it is illegally abusing monopoly power.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Microsoft fiercely denies that it is a monopoly, though more
than 90 percent of personal computers sold today run its Windows
operating system, which controls the basic operations of a personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   In Thurday's cross-examination of Warren-Boulton, Michael
Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer, attacked the assertion that Microsoft
was a monopoly. His questions were designed to get Warren-Boulton
to concede that the company had to keep coming out with new
products and innovations to satisfy customers if it was to retain
its market share.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the company's Redmond, Wash., campus, the belief is
that a potentially deadly competitor is always just around the
corner _ an attitude common to many big companies in the computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Warren-Boulton agreed that Microsoft had to move fast. But, he
added, ``Every monopolist faces competition and potential
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara asked if Linux, the free Unix operating system whose
core was written by a University of Helsinki student eight years
ago, did not pose a potential threat to Windows because several of
Microsoft's chief competitors are writing software to run on it.
</P>
<P>
   While Linux has several million devotees around the world, it
holds a minuscule share of the operating-system market, and
Warren-Boulton fairly laughed at the proposition that it threatened
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever role Linux may have, it is not expected to constrain
the monopoly power of Microsoft,'' he said. ``If you truly believe
this product is going to constrain Microsoft's market share, then
run, don't walk, to your broker and sell Microsoft stock short.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara then asked Warren-Boulton if in January 1995, he would
have predicted that Netscape Communications might pose a threat to
Microsoft. The witness responded that at that time, he would not
have known what Netscape was.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in court Thursday, a Justice Department lawyer
raised the issue of an interview given by Microsoft's chairman,
Bill Gates, to The Associated Press. Gates was quoted as saying
that the Justice Department's repeated showing at the trial of
excerpts from his videotaped deposition last August was ``more
about government PR than the substance of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   During the deposition, Gates said, he was constantly fending off
government lawyers who were trying to ``put words in my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer, said
that Gates ``seems to be indicating more and more that he wants to
come'' to testify at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The government could have called Gates as a witness but chose
not to do so. Thursday, Boies challenged Microsoft's legal team to
call Gates as a defense witness.

HANDSHAKE SEALS DEAL TO MOVE PATRIOTS TO HARTFORD

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ A team owner spurned at home and an eager
governor next door shook hands Thursday, promising the National
Football League's New England Patriots a new home in downtown
Hartford and infusing Connecticut's blighted capital with
big-league cachet.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Rowland agreed to build a $350 million stadium for the
Patriots' owner, Robert Kraft, who said he felt the Massachusetts
Legislature had been too stingy with him.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has been under way behind the scenes for months but
arrived with almost no public prelude, adding to the sense of
unreality among Hartford officials, who have sought and lost so
many smaller projects.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 of Hartford's business and government leaders packed
into the stained-glass splendor of a ceremonial hall at the
Connecticut Capitol, applauding their coup with a sustained rhythm
that sounded like rowdy fans when their team is first-and-goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what it means to me to get that kind of warm
reception from a community,'' Kraft said, in a pointed reference to
political battles in Boston as he tried and failed to win a huge
state subsidy for a new stadium near the Patriots' current home in
Foxboro, Mass. That stadium, built 27 years ago, is considered to
be inaccessible and unattractive and lacks many of the amenities of
a modern park.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Kraft joked that he drove from Boston to Hartford
in the same time it took him to get out of the parking lot at
Foxboro Stadium. And later, he apologized for choking up as the
crowd erupted in yet another wave of cheers. ``You really
overwhelmed me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal _ which would be financed by bonds and paid off through
stadium revenues _ must be approved by the Connecticut Legislature.
But leaders of both houses took the podium Thursday to promise
quick passage. As part of the 30-page agreement, Kraft agreed not
to negotiate with any other state between now and Dec. 31. Kraft
was required to deposit $2 million in escrow, which he would
forfeit if he began negotiations with another state.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who has failed to close several other major deals he
has championed publicly, said he insisted on the escrow payment and
exclusive negotiating window in an effort to avoid being used as
leverage in Kraft's negotiations with Massachusetts lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts said he spoke
with Kraft late Wednesday night, and said he did not see any way to
prevent the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Patriots belong in Massachusetts,'' Cellucci
said in an interview in New Orleans, where he is attending the
Republican Governors Association meeting. ``However, there was a
difference of opinion in the Legislature on this point, and it
appears that that difference is insurmountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The 68,000-seat stadium will be part of a $1 billion development
on the Connecticut River that is to include a convention center, a
hotel and sports stores. The site is now home to parking lots,
blocky buildings, a steam plant and a dike that blocks the city's
view of the river.
</P>
<P>
   The team, which has played in the Boston area since 1960, is
scheduled to move to Hartford in the fall of 2001, and Kraft has
committed to staying for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium is to include 125 to 150 luxury boxes and 6,000 club
seats, and is envisioned as the centerpiece of Adrien's Landing, a
redevelopment project that was already planned near the
intersection of Interstates 84 and 91. The complex was to include a
35,000-seat stadium for the University of Connecticut. Under the
deal announced Thursday, UConn will play in the proposed stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland billed Kraft as ``a partner'' in Hartford's renewal.
Under the agreement, the Patriots are to invest $75 million in
downtown, including $50 million for a hotel for the convention
center, $20 million for a retail and entertainment pavilion and $5
million for a fitness center. The team will move its headquarters
to Connecticut and, within one year of the stadium's opening, will
move its practice field to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Michael Peters of Hartford hailed the team's plans, but
said some people still have reservations about whether the city is
being used to force the hand of Massachusetts lawmakers. ``Two
million dollars is nothing _ it doesn't lock anybody in,'' he said.
``But I think Kraft is very sincere about coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the euphoria that greeted the news here, some experts
were skeptical about the wisdom of abandoning Boston for the
nation's 27th-largest television market, 28th-largest state and
37th-largest metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rosentraub, a professor of public affairs at Indiana
University who specializes in sports economics, said the plan posed
``a grave risk'' for Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   He said many Connecticut residents were fans of the New York
Giants, and said he questioned how many current Patriots fans would
drive down from the Boston area year after year _ especially if
some are bitter about the team's departure, or if the team or the
economy slumps. ``Connecticut is too small, and already has split
loyalties,'' he said. ``It all rests on the Boston market accepting
the move.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic legislators also raised questions about the
administration's projections for attendance and revenue. The
revenue projections were based on the assumption that home games
would be consistent sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, George Jepsen, acknowledged that
some members think ``the numbers may not quite be there,'' but said
the expected impact on the region would lead most members to
support the proposal. ``An NFL team is one of the very things that
overnight will turn around the image of Hartford as a city in
decline,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state would finance the stadium by selling bonds, which
would be paid back through a 10 percent tax on tickets, snacks and
parking revenue from the stadium. Although officials emphasized
that taxes would not rise to finance the stadium, taxpayers could
ultimately be liable if revenues fall short.

</P>
<P>
   As the two sat side by side behind a long table as if
contemplating a peace treaty, Rowland went first and then glanced
back at the document after Kraft signed. ``Just double-checking,''
Rowland said with a chuckle. Kraft handed him a football
autographed by the team.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside a color drawing of the proposed stadium, Rowland
said that with Thursday's announcement, the state would talk about
redeveloping the worn core of Hartford and start doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A state is defined by its capital city, and today we have a
chance to define ourselves,'' Rowland said. ``Twenty-four million
people per year drive by and drive through Hartford. The idea here
is to get some of them to stop. We want to be more than a mile
marker between Boston and New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said he turned to Connecticut in frustration after years
of unsuccessful effort to win the subsidies he wanted from the
Massachusetts Legislature for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He reached an agreement with the state Senate that would have
required him to spend $200 million with the state kicking in $72
million. But House leaders would approve only $57 million, which
Kraft said killed the deal. ``Massachusetts has had over 35 years
to try to solve this problem and has been able to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, he looked into the 24 television cameras
arrayed in front of him and addressed his 17,000 season-ticket
holders, whom he twice referred to as ``accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of you might be uncomfortable with this move,'' he said.
``We had no opportunity to solve our problem in the near term. If
the city of Hartford and the people of this state had not gotten
together and come up with this, our family would have to put this
team up for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that for viewers and fans, ``Nothing changes _ the New
England Patriots will be able to stay in this region _ please, God
_ for the next 30 years, and we're going to bring a championship
home.''
</P>
<P>
   He later said he was confident that he would retain many of his
current fans, in part because 40 percent of Patriots season-ticket
holders live outside Massachusetts _ most of them in Rhode Island,
Connecticut and the Albany, N.Y., area.
</P>
<P>
   Boston television reporters trailed Kraft through the Capitol,
asking him repeatedly if there were any way the team would remain
in Boston. ``We're not considering other options now,'' he said
flatly. He noted that Connecticut had until the end of the year to
begin implementing its part of the agreement. ``If they do it,'' he
said, ``we're coming here.''

SOME DIGITAL SERVICES FACE 5 PERCENT U.S. TAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adopting a middle ground between the industry and
consumer groups, the federal government Thursday imposed a 5
percent fee on some of the money that commercial television
broadcasters may someday generate from the new digital spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   As they slowly convert to digital programming, broadcasters hope
that viewers will one day be able to use their television sets in
the same ways they use computers that can gain access to the
Internet _ doing everything from ordering sports tickets and buying
clothes to retrieving stock quotes and sending pages of text.
</P>
<P>
   It is these ancillary services, as well as special subscriptions
and pay-per-view that the rule adopted Thursday by the Federal
Communications Commission will tax.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials said that the new rule offered simplicity and
certainty and would recover for taxpayers part of the commercial
value of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were really tough issues because we are being asked to
lay the framework for an industry that doesn't exist yet,'' said
William Kennard, the commission's chairman. ``We did not want to
create a disincentive for the development of the field. We also
wanted to do something that was relatively simple'' to administer.
</P>
<P>
   But the new rule was immediately criticized by the industry,
which said the fee was too high and would discourage innovation. It
was also attacked by some consumer groups, which contended that the
FCC had written the rule so narrowly that it would effectively
permit the broadcasters to use the spectrum, which is considered a
public resource, for many commercial purposes without adequately
compensating the government.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, industry executives and analysts said, the digital
spectrum is in so early a state of development that there is little
expectation broadcasters will be profiting and paying fees in the
near term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have yet to hear of any broadcaster who has a definite
business plan,'' said Dennis Wharton, a spokesman for the National
Association of Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   The association had recommended that broadcasters pay just 2
percent on gross revenues and said Thursday that the lower fee
``would have provided greater incentives for broadcasters to offer
these types of competitive services.''

   All of the nation's television stations are in the process of
converting their analog programming to digital broadcasting as part
of a transition that is not expected to be completed before 2007.
By the end of this month, some 42 stations are expected to be
transmitting digital signals as well as on their analog spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   The digital spectrum will produce significantly clearer and
sharper television pictures. It is also expected to enrich the
medium by equipping televisions to handle many of the same online
functions as personal computers do.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups had sought a 10 percent levy on the ancillary
uses of the digital spectrum. They also wanted to require such fees
for programming like infomercials, home shopping and direct
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The commission rejected that proposal after finding that those
programs were in line with the traditional commercial ventures that
are not now taxed on the analog broadcast spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission buckled to the broadcasters and will not be
giving the public a darned thing,'' said Gigi B. Sohn, executive
director of the Media Access Project, a law firm that represents
consumer interests. ``By finding that fees do not apply to home
shopping, infomercials or direct marketing, they will be applying
this fee to very few services. The result is that the public will
not be compensated for giving broadcasters billions of dollars of
free public spectrum and broadcasters will be unjustly enriched.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's rule was a byproduct of Congress' overhaul of the
nation's telecommunications law in 1996. Though the government had
traditionally held auctions to sell portions of the broadcast
spectrum, the new law awarded each broadcast station an extra
channel to use during the decadelong transition to digital
television.
</P>
<P>
   Following an outcry that the government had given away a
valuable public resource, Congress instructed the regulators to
devise new rules and a payment schedule for those broadcasters that
plan to use the digital spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also proposed a rule Thursday that would permit
public TV stations to use the digital spectrum for
advertiser-supported services. The agency asked for comment about
whether there should be limits on commercial activities by public
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   It also asked whether public broadcasters should be exempt from
the 5 percent fee imposed on the commercial stations.

MIDEAST NEIGHBORS HAVE FIRST DISCUSSION OF CROSS-BORDER TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication notice: also filed in category `f') 
(smw) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel's chilly trade relationship with Jordan and
the Palestinian Authority warmed slightly this week as the three
neighbors held their first face-to-face discussions of import
barriers, border customs disputes and obstacles to regional
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense that it is easier for Jordan to sell to
France than to the West Bank, and easier for Israel to sell to
Great Britain than to Jordan,'' U.S. Secretary of Commerce William
Daley, who convened the three-party talks, told a gathering of
Palestinian business leaders in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   From the Jordanian and Palestinian perspective, the overarching
regional trade issue is Israeli interference with the free movement
of goods in and out of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Israel,
which conducts about 95 percent of its trade with countries outside
the Middle East, maintains that time-consuming inspections of
overland shipments and repeated closings of border crossings are
necessary precautions against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis also point out that the Palestinians still tacitly
support the boycott of Israeli products in Persian Gulf nations and
elsewhere in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of reinforcing the peace process it brokered, the
United States has been encouraging cross-border business
partnerships as a counterweight to opponents of the
land-for-security plan. But these new private-sector ties must be
threaded through a matrix of competing property claims, political
and cultural antagonisms, differing legal systems and unabating
security pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Trade among the Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians has been
stagnant or in decline even as Israel's overall foreign trade has
soared above $50 billion a year. Trade between Jordan and Israel
has averaged less than $20 million, despite a recent agreement by
Israel to streamline border customs procedures and import up to
50,000 tons of Jordanian produce duty-free. Jordan's trade with the
Palestinian West Bank and Gaza is estimated at less than $40
million yearly, down from $120 million in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   As State Department convoys sped back and forth this week
between Israeli and Palestinian peace negotiators, Daley and his
aides steered their fleet of bulletproof Chevrolet Suburbans to
business meetings in Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and both banks of
the Jordan River. Instead of prisoner releases and troop
withdrawals, the Americans' meetings centered on customs protocols,
rules of origin, nontariff barriers, transparent investment
regulations and other matters typical of international trade talks.
In the polarized environment of the Middle East, though, such
bread-and-butter economic discussion is rarer than cease-fire
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The trade ministers of Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian
Authority met together for the first time _ even though all have
often complained about regional trade obstacles and professed their
desires for a joint free trade area. In three hours of informal
closed-door discussions, the officials debated Palestinian market
access and delved into such minutiae as rules for package labeling
and hours for truck crossing on Jordan River bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said later that he had been struck by the profound
``mistrust among the parties,'' even though their discussions were
cordial and constructively specific. Mohammed Hurani, Jordan's
trade minister, noted in the meeting that it was his first visit to
Jerusalem in three decades _ since Israel annexed the formerly
Jordanian eastern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the central dispute over Israeli security procedures, the
regional trading relationship is riven by other prickly conflicts.
Maher al-Masri, the Palestinian Authority's top trade official, has
strongly protested the Israeli export of goods from Jewish
settlements in the territories. He has succeeded in getting the
European Union to deny duty-free access to these products unless
they are labeled as originating in the West Bank, prompting
complaints from Israel that Brussels is pre-emptively assigning
Palestinian sovereignty to lands that remain in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, in the meantime, asked for U.S. support of its pleas to
Israel to ease access for Jordanian exports to the West Bank and
Gaza, and Palestinian officials strongly backed Jordan's request.
Two days after their meeting here, the Israeli trade and industry
minister, Natan Sharansky, met again with Masri and announced that
Israel would soon allow more Jordanian goods into Palestinian
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Palestinians note that Jordan imposes strict limits on
imports of Palestinian produce, their biggest export earner. And
there is potential friction between the Palestinians and
Jordanians, who both hope that the peace process will provide
unfettered access to the $100 billion Israeli market _ often for
directly competing agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, while appealing for American intervention with
Israel, have some trade issues of their own with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Washington extended the same duty-free treatment
Israeli goods have long enjoyed to products from Gaza and the West
Bank _ an initiative enthusiastically welcomed by Palestinian
exporters, who anticipated a breakthrough into a huge American
market. Yet despite this trade status, Palestinian sales to the
United States still average a negligible $1 million yearly, while
imports from the United States barely reach $2 million, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians blame a pattern of border inspection delays and
import permit denials by Israel, which controls land, air and sea
access to the Palestinian market. Some U.S. government trade
specialists report complaints of Israeli blockage of shipments of
consumer goods destined for the Palestinians from U.S.
multinational subsidiaries in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   A West Bank businessman appealed to Daley to protest these
practices, not ``as a friend of the Palestinians'' or a promoter of
the peace process, but as a defender of the ``legitimate commercial
interests'' of U.S. business. Daley said Washington's view is that
these trade conflicts can ultimately be resolved only through the
land-for-security talks between Israel and the Palestinians, which,
it is hoped, will soon lead to direct new road and air cargo routes
for trade with the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

OFFERMAN JOINS RED SOX, WITH AN EYE ON SECOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jose Offerman will wear No. 30 for the Red Sox, even
though the back of the team jersey he was presented Thursday by
general manager Dan Duquette at Fenway Park was blank.
</P>
<P>
   And Offerman figures to play second base for the Sox, even
though the official line is that the blank will be filled during
spring training on that one, too. ``There's no question that's
where I'd like to play,'' said Offerman, who spoke with manager
Jimy Williams by phone Thursday morning for the first time since
agreeing to a four-year, $26 million contract with Boston.
</P>
<P>
   There is little mystery about where Offerman _ the free agent
who primarily played second last season for the Kansas City Royals
but also has been mentioned as a candidate to play first base, the
outfield, or DH with Boston _ will bat, not when Duquette refers to
him as the ``best on-base and speed man in the league, maybe in the
business.'' He'll be the leadoff man in a lineup that is still
looking for the player, or players, who will fill the void left by
the apparent departure of Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette would not say whether he has made an offer to left
fielder Albert Belle. Nor would Belle's agent, Arn Tellem, though
there were indications that the Red Sox had at least made steps in
that direction Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yankees, the other players in the Belle
sweepstakes, were preparing to make an offer to their incumbent
center fielder, Bernie Williams, whom Duquette said will be in
Boston next week for a visit. The Yankees are believed to be
planning to offer Williams a five-year deal in the $55 million
range, far less than the seven-year, $100 million figure attributed
in the past to Williams's agent, Scott Boras.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were at a standstill with free agent first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro, who was reassured at a dinner Wednesday with
Orioles owner Peter Angelos and GM Frank Wren that Baltimore wants
him back but has yet to accept the offer to return.
</P>
<P>
   The sides remained apart on a deal, but the Red Sox have not
followed up on their original proposals, believed to be a
three-year package with an option for a fourth year, and were not
in contact with Palmeiro's agents Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like Dan wants to have an oar in the water with
Palmeiro,'' said a source familiar with Palmeiro's negotiations,
``but it's not like he's trying to race across the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been eight days since the Red Sox said they were breaking
off talks with Vaughn, and he has yet to accept the six-year, $72
million proposal made by the Anaheim Angels. In some baseball
circles, there is speculation that perhaps Vaughn and the Red Sox
are not finished, a scenario alluded to last week by Vaughn's
closest friend on the Sox, John Valentin, who said he hoped a
window might still be open.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, that would seem to be a ridiculous
supposition, given the chasm that is believed to exist between
Vaughn and the Sox, but this market is beginning to baffle even
some veteran participants. The Dodgers, for example, have been
mentioned as potential bidders for Vaughn, but at the moment, their
attention seems to be focused on lefthanded pitcher Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Sox attention is on pitching, too, according to Duquette, who
said he hopes to add a starter and a reliever before Thanksgiving.
He refused to mention names, but the Sox are known to have talked
to the agents for righthanders Tim Belcher and Armando Reynoso.
Veteran Bob Tewksbury, a New Hampshire native, also has expressed a
desire to return here, but his agent, Joe Bick, said there have
been no recent discussions with the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had been in the running for lefthanded reliever Scott
Radinsky, but he signed Thursday with the St. Louis Cardinals. The
best lefthanded relievers still on the market are Mark Guthrie, who
last season pitched for the Dodgers, and Jim Poole, who finished
last season with the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday the deadline for setting 40-man rosters, the Sox
made a nunber of moves. Placed on the 40-man roster were catchers
Shea Hillenbrand and Steve Lomasney, third basemen Cole Liniak and
Wilton Veras, righthanded pitchers Juan Pena and Jack Cressend, and
lefthander Robert Ramsay.
</P>
<P>
   Taken off the 40-man roster and outrighted to Pawtucket were
second baseman Jim Chamblee and infielder Chris Snopek. Five
players were designated for assignment, the most prominent of whom
was reliever Rich Garces, who is recovering from elbow surgery.
Also slated for assignment were DH Billy Ashley, outfielder Jimmy
Hurst, catcher Mandy Romero, and pitcher Carlos Valdez. Those
players will be traded, released, or placed on waivers within 10
days.

A YEAR LATER, BANKAMERICA SELLS MUTUAL FUND COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BankAmerica Corp., the newly merged banking giant, has sold a
mutual fund company it bought only a year ago to its managers.
</P>
<P>
   Senior managers of Robertson Stephens Investment Management, the
asset-management arm of the old Robertson, Stephens &AMP; Co., teamed
up to buy the company from BankAmerica. The company, based in San
Francisco, manages $4 billion in assets, including $2 billion in
mutual funds, and specializes in investing in young, fast-growing
companies. Terms of the sale were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Just before its merger with Nationsbank last spring, BankAmerica
bought Robertson, Stephens &AMP; Co. to bolster its securities and
mutual fund operations. But the business overlapped with the
operations of Nationsbank, based in Charlotte, N.C. The merged
company, also called BankAmerica, sold the investment-banking arm
of Robertson Stephens to the BankBoston Corp. in August for $800
million and said it would sell the investment-management division
separately.
</P>
<P>
   G. Randy Hecht, a founder of Robertson Stephens Investment
Management who is its chief executive and president, will be the
chairman and chief executive of the new entity, to be called RS
Funds when the sale is completed in the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pursued this management buyout because we strongly believe
that returning to our roots as a private company with the same
leadership team that founded the company in 1984 is the ideal
ownership structure for our mutual fund shareholders,'' Hecht said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The sale will not materially affect the earnings of BankAmerica,
the company said in a statement. The sale does not include other
asset-management units of BankAmerica, including its Wealth
Management Group, Nations Funds or the Pacific Horizon, Time
Horizon and World Horizon mutual funds. The Wealth Management Group
manages more than $203 billion in assets.

SOME HELP FROM CHINA SEEN IN CURBING BEETLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ After weeks of resistance, China has begun efforts to
comply with the coming U.S. ban on imports containing untreated
wood-packing material, a visiting U.S. agriculture official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The ban, intended to protect American trees from the Asian
long-horned beetle, which crosses the Pacific in raw wood, will
affect shipments that use wood pallets or crates _ 25 percent to 50
percent of all exports to the United States from China. If Chinese
companies do not change materials or begin treating wood with
pesticides or heat by Dec. 17, a flow of goods worth $63 billion
could be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   When the rule was first announced in September, China's
government-guided media attacked the ban as a devious trade weapon
and suggested that it might be negotiable. Later, the Chinese
sought a 90-day extension, which was denied.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, officials here began confronting the problem,
notifying shippers of the new requirements. But U.S. officials said
they did not know how many Chinese shippers had taken adequate
steps, such as arranging for anti-pest treatments or finding new
packing materials.
</P>
<P>
   If there appear to be widespread violations next month, then
traders can expect long delays at U.S. States ports as many more
cargoes are subjected to inspections, warned the visiting official,
Isi Siddiqui, a deputy assistant secretary of agriculture.

FED FEARED MIXED MESSAGE FROM RATE CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve decided to limit its interest
rate cut on Sept. 29 to a quarter of a percentage point because it
was worried that a bigger reduction might exaggerate its concerns
about the risks of an economic slowdown, according to minutes of
the deliberations released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But just more than two weeks later, the central bank cut rates
again by another quarter of a point after its policy-setting
committee decided during a conference call that conditions in the
financial markets were deteriorating and that business confidence
was eroding, the minutes said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to cut rates a second time on Oct. 15 was made
despite continued concern among some members of the Federal Open
Market Committee that the move would be interpreted in the markets
as a signal that the central bank saw bad news on the horizon,
according to the minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some members were concerned that a policy move so soon after
the late September action might be misread as indicative of a
degree of concern about prospective developments in financial
markets or the economic outlook that did not represent the
committee's thinking,'' the minutes said. ``However, the members
generally concluded that the risk of adverse market reactions was
worth taking and that the easing actions under consideration were
more likely to help settle volatile financial markets and cushion
the effects of more restrictive financial conditions on the ongoing
expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oct. 15 rate cut did prompt some speculation in the markets
that the Fed was concerned about an undisclosed financial problem
along the lines of the problems encountered this summer by
Long-Term Capital Management LP, a large investment fund. But no
such problem emerged, and for the most part the Oct. 15 decision
had the effect the Fed intended, helping to calm the markets.
</P>
<P>
   The minutes show that the vote on Sept. 29 for the first of the
interest rate moves was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Though a rate cut ``was warranted to provide some insurance
against undesirably tight domestic financial conditions, many
members saw the need for a cautious policy action,'' the minutes
said. ``A more sizable policy move at this point might convey an
exaggerated impression of the committee's current thinking
regarding the extent of downside risks in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   No vote was taken during the conference call about the second
rate decrease, which was enacted on Greenspan's authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed cut rates a third time on Tuesday, reducing the federal
funds target rate on overnight loans between banks by a
quarter-point, to 4.75 percent, and the discount rate on loans to
banks from the Federal Reserve system by a quarter-point, to 4.5
percent. The minutes of Tuesday's meeting will be released on Dec.
24.
</P>
<P>
   Although the vote to cut rates on Sept. 29 was unanimous, there
was disagreement among the committee's 11 voting members about
whether to adopt a formal bias toward further rate cuts, a signal
that its next move would likely be another rate reduction. Although
only a ``small majority'' of the committee's members favored a bias
toward further cuts, the entire committee eventually went along.

FLEET TO REPORTEDLY BUY UNIT OF SANWA 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sanwa Bank Ltd., a Japanese financial giant mired in billions of
dollars in bad loans, will in the next week announce the sale of a
large U.S. lending unit to the Fleet Financial Group for about $700
million, executives close to the talks said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale price is significantly less than the $2 billion that
Sanwa originally sought for the unit, Sanwa Business Credit, and is
a measure of how much the merger environment has cooled in recent
months. The sale also reflects how Japanese banks, dangerously
weakened, are continuing to withdraw from the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, a Boston concern that is the ninth-largest bank in the
country, and Sanwa, which is based in Osaka, both declined to
comment on the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Sanwa and Daiwa Bank Ltd., another large Japanese institution,
said Thursday that they would both post losses this year and
together need about $7.4 billion in financial aid from the Japanese
government to avoid collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements were the first in what is expected to be a
series of similar statements by Japanese banks confronting a
stalled economy and huge piles of nonperforming loans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Japan is in the middle of its most severe recession in decades,
which is likely to make it even harder for Japanese businesses,
already short of cash, to repay loans _ making the outlook for
Japanese banks even bleaker.
</P>
<P>
   Sanwa, which said it needed about $5 billion in government aid,
said it would report an annual loss this year around $4.2 billion
and write off $6.6 billion in bad loans _ enormous amounts that
would be difficult for a bank of almost any size to absorb. Daiwa,
Japan's 12th-largest bank, is seeking $2.4 billion in government
aid and said it expects to report a loss of $1.5 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sanwa's and Daiwa's financial problems are part of a swift and
humbling comedown for most Japanese banks, which several years ago
wielded such financial might that many here raised alarms over what
they saw as Japan's economic colonization of America.
</P>
<P>
   It is now clear that the lending and buying spree that Japanese
banks and businesses engaged in here was part of a speculative
bubble that has long since burst. Japan, its critics argue, has
prolonged the economic pain by refusing to tackle its banking
problem aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Troubles at home have only exacerbated the problems Japanese
banks face doing business in this country. The Japanese need to
borrow from other banks to help finance loans here because they
have limited deposit bases they can tap. But Japanese banks have
been forced to pay higher interest rates to borrow _ the so-called
Japanese premium _ because of their weakening positions and lower
credit ratings. That has put a crimp on their business activities
here.
</P>
<P>
   Sanwa is not the first Japanese bank to sell part of its U.S.
operation. Fuji Bank and Sumitomo Bank have also unloaded
operations in the last year, as Japanese banks shuttered offices
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Just Thursday, the huge Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi said it planned
to sell $750 million of its $4.38 billion majority stake in
Unionbancal Corp., which will help the money-losing Japanese bank
raise cash. The sale will cut the Japanese bank's ownership in that
bank to somewhere between 62 and 70 percent, from 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sanwa, which said it would cut its work force about 10 percent,
or 1,300 people, over the next two years, said in July that it
would close Sanwa Securities U.S.A., a dealer in securities issued
by the United States government.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Tokyo barred Sanwa from selling mutual funds for a
year due to charges that the bank bribed representatives of the
Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan for information about
interest-rate changes and bank inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Sanwa still has a presence here. Its biggest U.S. unit, and its
largest overseas subsidiary, is Sanwa Bank California. Sanwa has
repeatedly said that the California unit, based in Los Angeles with
about $8.4 billion in assets, is not for sale.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanwa Business Credit, a Chicago company that specializes in
lending to small and mid-sized businesses and has about $6.5
billion in assets, will soon be sold to Fleet, possibly as early as
Friday. Analysts said the Chicago unit has many troubled loans on
its books and the asking price for the company has come steadily
down since it was first put on the block about two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet has grown from its origins in Rhode Island through a
series of acquisitions that have included the Bank of New England
and Shawmut National. More recently, it has purchased the credit
card business of Advanta Corp. and Quick &AMP; Reilly, a discount stock
brokerage firm. Even with those acquisitions, analysts believe,
Fleet may still not be large enough to remain competitive with
other leading U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
   Sanwa's adviser in the transaction is Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., and
Fleet's adviser is Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.

STARR DEFENDS IMPEACHMENT EFFORT IN 10-HOUR GRILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his conduct and credibility under siege,
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr Thursday coolly defended his
landmark case against President Clinton, as the first impeachment
inquiry in a generation unfolded under the nation's gaze.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, fully exposed to criticism for the first time in his
four-year investigation of the president, insisted during more than
10 hours of questioning by Clinton's lawyer, hostile Democrats and
friendly Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, that he
violated no ethical, legal, or moral code in his controversial
probe of the president's sexual affair with the former White House
intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand by this referral,'' Starr told the committee, holding
up his 445-page report that contains allegations Clinton may have
committed 11 impeachable offenses. ``I stand by each word in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyer, David E. Kendall, echoed many of Starr's
critics in denouncing Starr's allegations as elaborate
exaggerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in this overkill of an investigation amounts to a
justification for the impeachment of the president of the United
States,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   The only major witness in the House impeachment drama, Starr
made no breakthrough disclosure that would have provided fresh
momentum for advocates of removing Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the former judge laid out a scathing review of the
Lewinsky scandal, renewing his charges that Clinton betrayed the
national trust and power of his office by engaging in a pattern of
perjury, witness tampering, and obstruction of justice in trying to
cover up his sexual trysts in the White House with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Under the hot lights of the same, packed hearing room where
impeachment proceedings led to President Nixon's resignation in
1974, Starr raised the possibility that Clinton could be prosecuted
for perjury after he leaves office, regardless of whether Congress
impeaches him.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also disclosed that he has found no evidence that would
warrant a criminal charge or impeachment allegation against Clinton
stemming from his office's separate inquiries into Arkansas real
estate transactions, the use of FBI files by White House political
operatives, and the firing of White House travel office workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the former judge spent most of his historic appearance
before the bitterly divided committee parrying verbal attacks from
Democrats on a vast range of topics, from the most minute details
of his prosecutorial techniques to the nature of his investigation
into the Lewinsky matter. Committee Republicans generally praised
Starr's record and his report and criticized Democrats for unfairly
maligning him and his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a federally paid sex policeman spending millions
of dollars to trap an unfaithful spouse would have been unthinkable
prior to the Starr investigation,'' said Representative John
Conyers Jr., of Michigan, the highest ranking Democrat on the
Judiciary Committee, jabbing his finger in the air at the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The president's supporters made virtually no attempt to defend
his admitted lies about the Lewinsky affair and his alleged coverup
of the relationship, and only rarely did they address the substance
of Starr's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But they spared little effort in trying to skewer Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The fiercest attacks on Starr focused on allegations that his
office repeatedly leaked secret grand-jury evidence damaging to
Clinton and that Starr's staff violated Lewinsky's due process
rights when they detained her for more than 10 hours at a
Ritz-Carlton Hotel outside Washington in an effort to gain her
cooperation in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is not above the law, and neither are you,''
Representative Robert Wexler, a Florida Democrat, shouted at Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people do not approve, Mr. Starr,'' Wexler said.
``They know fairness when they see it. They know justice when they
feel it. They know hypocrisy when they smell it. ... In their gut,
they have figured this thing out.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, accused
Starr of being an ``expert on unfair questions'' and adhering to
the policy that ``you don't have anything to say unless you have
something bad to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank also asked Starr why he waited until after the elections
to report the findings of his separate investigations when the
findings could have been released before the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in a lilting voice and with a scholarly tone, remained
unruffled throughout the grilling, calmly describing himself as an
unbiased arbiter who is unschooled ``in politics, public relations,
and polls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We conducted ourselves properly and lawfully,'' Starr said of
his staff on various occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing unfolded amid increasing reluctance in Congress to
impeach Clinton and recent polls that show broad disapproval for
the way Starr and the House Judiciary Committee have handled the
case. Starr's appearance was seen as one of the last opportunities
for him to rehabilitate his image and reenergize the impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Starr has set forth a clear, documented, compelling case
against the president,'' Judiciary Chairman Henry J. Hyde said
after Starr's two-hour presentation of his prepared testimony,
which had been made public the night before. ``He has provided a
road map for us to see how and when the president chose deception
rather than truth at many important crossroads in the judicial
system's search for the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But committee Democrats said Starr had said almost nothing he
had said before and had failed to score a public-relations victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's no Ollie North in terms of presentation,'' said
Representative William D. Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat, who
lashed out at Starr for engaging in ``unprofessional conduct'' in
the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt was referring to Oliver North, a key figure in the
Iran-Contra hearings, who won broad public support after his
performance in a congressional hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is one of the lowest ranking Democrats on the
37-member committee, Delahunt played a prominent role in
challenging Hyde's decision to limit Clinton's lawyer, David E.
Kendall, to 30 minutes to question Starr. Delahunt asked that
Kendall be given two hours, a motion that was defeated along party
lines, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about one of the gravest constitutional events in our
national history,'' Delahunt told reporters after the vote. ``We're
not talking about the dredging of Boston Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat,
questioned Starr about numerous allegations of conflict of
interest, including his contacts with lawyers for Paula Corbin
Jones, whose sexual-harassment lawsuit against Clinton was
instrumental in the disclosure of the president's affair with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan told Starr he cited the conflicts because ``if your
credibility is tainted by bias or poor judgment on your part, this
committee and the American people must at the very least treat the
many inferences that you draw in your referral with extreme caution
and must question whether your referral is, indeed, the whole
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats repeatedly protested Hyde's decision to limit each
committee member's cross-examination of Starr to five minutes. And
Hyde, seated beneath a portrait of former Representative Peter
Rodino, the Democratic chairman of the Nixon impeachment hearings,
grew increasinly exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're disrupting the continuity of these proceedings,'' Hyde
replied at one point to a protest from Representative Mel Watt, a
North Carolina Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disrupting a railroad,'' Watt retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as the partisan rancor continued to roil, Hyde turned to
the committee Democrats and said: ``I hope the seating arrangement
suits you. That's about all that hasn't been complained about
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several committee Republicans were disappointed in
Starr's evaluation of the findings in all his investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bob Barr of Georgia, one of the first lawmakers
to call for impeachment hearings, said he did not believe Starr
fully investigated the use of confidential FBI files by White House
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Starr determined that only two low-level operatives had access
to the files and did not misuse them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my understanding that there are a number of people that
have not yet been deposed or fully deposed in that case,'' Barr
said. ``I really would appreciate it if you would check on that and
so we don't completely close the door on that.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several Republicans seized on Starr's suggestion
that Clinton's alleged efforts to help Lewinsky find a job at a
time when she falsing denying her relationship with him to Jones's
lawyers may constitute an additional charge of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, the committee was scheduled to hold a
close-door meeting to consider Hyde's request for staff lawyers to
take private depositions from four other individuals, including
Bruce R. Lindsey, Clinton's deputy counsel and trusted personal
adviser, and Robert Bennett, Clinton's lawyer in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also wants depositions from two individuals familiar with
former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey: Democratic
fund-raiser Nathan Landow and Willey's lawyer, Daniel Gecker.
</P>
<P>
   Willey has accused Clinton of groping her near the Oval Office
in 1995.

ALAN J. PAKULA: A SAVVY VISION OF THE PUBLIC WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICK LaSALLE  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Alan J. Pakula died Thursday in an incident as bizarre
as a scene from a movie _ but not one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   He was driving on the Long Island Expressway, 30 miles east of
Manhattan, when a metal bar smashed through the windshield of his
car and hit him in the head, causing him to crash into a fence. The
metal bar apparently had been struck by a vehicle ahead of him and
sent flying through the air.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-year-old director of ``All the President's Men'' leaves a
legacy of more than a dozen pictures, some great, some merely good,
but virtually all infused with his intelligence and worthy of sober
appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   While other directors might have specialized in probing emotions
and inner conflicts, Pakula concerned himself with the workings of
the exterior world, particularly social issues, the law and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although his main artistic interest was the world of masculine
conflict, he could be a superb director of women, and his films
were far from emotionally tepid or pitched on one note.
</P>
<P>
   He guided Jane Fonda and Meryl Streep in their wrenching and
complex Oscar-winning performances in ``Klute'' (1971) and
``Sophie's Choice'' (1982), respectively. In those films and
others, powerful emotions were presented against a background of
social, legal or political events.
</P>
<P>
   In the thriller ``The Parallax View'' (1974), Warren Beatty
played a reporter investigating the assassination of a senator. Two
years later Pakula told the story of Watergate in the style of a
political thriller, in ``All the President's Men.''
</P>
<P>
   He guided Liza Minnelli to one of her best performances in ``The
Sterile Cuckoo'' (1969; his debut as a director). Bonnie Bedelia
shined in ``Presumed Innocent'' (1990). Pakula did not have as much
luck with Julia Roberts in ``The Pelican Brief'' (1993).
</P>
<P>
   Before turning to directing, at age 41, he was a producer of
such high-quality films as ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' (1962), ``Love
With the Proper Stranger'' (1963) and ``Inside Daisy Clover''
(1965).
</P>
<P>
   Pakula's last film, ``The Devil's Own'' (1997), was not one of
his best, but it was vintage Pakula, with political issues having
direct personal consequences. In that one, Harrison Ford portrayed
an Irish New York cop and Brad Pitt played an Irish terrorist.

EXPERTS: IRAQ HAS NETWORK OF OUTSIDE HELP ON ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq is using an outside network of front
companies and smugglers to supply centers around the country with
parts for illegal weapons systems, arms control experts said this
week. Iraq has also made efforts to produce some components abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The well-disguised centers inside Iraq are not considered likely
to be accessible to U.N. arms inspectors now back in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that evidence may be fragmentary, but that as Saddam
Hussein and those who watch him shift their focus to Iraq's ability
to rearm in the future it is apparent that Iraq has access to vital
components _ ready-made or built to specifications _ for weapons
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Khidhir Hamza, a former director of Iraq's program to devise a
nuclear weapon who defected in 1994, said in an interview on
Wednesday that in the nuclear area there was ``general planning for
removal outside Iraq of some sensitive work or possibly work that
requires some imports.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to do it outside and bring the thing back home,''
he said of Iraqi plans either to produce nuclear components abroad,
among them devices to trigger nuclear reactions in warheads, or to
import crucial parts to make arms in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza, who arrived in the United States in 1995, said that at
the time he left Iraq a friend of his was importing electronic
parts for the military from a front company in Jordan that bought
the equipment in Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of these companies in Jordan,'' he said.
``They have a whole system of runners in ordinary cars.'' He said
that Iraq repaired its radar after the Gulf War by smuggling in
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza and others say that there are front companies as far
afield as Southeast Asia and overseas bank accounts from the
Persian Gulf region to Latin America to draw on to pay for
purchases. Smugglers pack valuable pieces in personal luggage.
Circuit boards in foam-padded bags cross the border from Jordan for
a small bribe, perhaps a bottle of whiskey, he said. Plastic bags
stuffed with goods are stored in the empty tanks of returning oil
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   And that is a monitored border.
</P>
<P>
   At the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, Anthony H. Cordesman, a co-director and an expert on
the Middle East, said that far more material was smuggled in on
trucks through Turkey, where a more porous border abuts the
semiautonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq. Imports are
scattered around the country to a network of small centers working
to reconstitute arms. The centers are protected by Hussein's most
trusted security forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scattered throughout the country,'' Cordesman said. ``Not
only do you have small centers and duplicative efforts, but you
have groups that are now dedicated to using civilian covers to hide
and maneuver what they have left around.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has tried in the past to put private civilian property
off-limits to the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly governments help when Saddam needs offshore research or
perhaps production centers, Iraqi exiles and some U.S. experts say,
although they disagree about the importance of projects in
countries like Yemen, the Sudan, Libya and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear experts were recently surprised to learn that the
director general of Iraq's nuclear research center, which Baghdad
insists is not developing arms, has been visiting India's leading
nuclear research laboratory. The previously unreported presence of
the Iraqi, Abdulkadir Abdulrahman Ahmed, was discovered when a
computer hacker got into the Indian center's files, Hamza said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that over the years Iraq had nurtured a ``deep and
multilayered cooperation'' with India that seemed to have cooled in
recent years. ``But it seems to be back now.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential for offshore work was highlighted when the United
States bombed a factory in the Sudan that U.S. intelligence had
concluded may have been making chemical warfare components for
Iraq. Although the evidence for that charge has been challenged,
the fact remains that there is broad cooperation between Iraq and
Sudan, some arms experts and diplomats in Baghdad say.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Duelfer, deputy executive chairman of UNSCOM, which is
charged with disarming Iraq and ensuring that the Iraqis cannot
rebuild prohibited weapons, said that vigilance by the commission
and the cooperation of countries dealing with Iraq, or through
which Iraqis may be shipping goods, was essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offshore work is more difficult to investigate,'' Duelfer
said. ``We have seen what happened in the past. Iraq set up front
companies in the 1980s and it is reasonable to suspect a
continuation. We have to monitor this very carefully.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Full cooperation, however, has not always been forthcoming,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists published an
article written jointly by an American and a Russian _ William C.
Potter, director of the Monterey Center for Nonproliferation
Studies, and Valdimir Orlov of the PIR Center for Policy Studies in
Moscow _ documenting how Iraq was able to buy gyroscopes for
missile-guidance systems from Russian stocks in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington,
Joseph Cirincione, director of the nonproliferation program, said
Iraq might also be shopping for scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``A senior Ukrainian told me just last month that he personally
knew of a couple of scientists from Ukraine who had given up hopes
of working there and had gone to Baghdad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, however, caution restraint on seeing too much
danger from former Soviet-bloc scientists.
</P>
<P>
   David Albright, president of the independent Institute for
Science and International Security in Washington, said that while
the Iraqis would ``take whatever they can get, that they can get
away with, they don't want spies, and they will be hypersensitive
that outsiders would be spies.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, a nuclear expert who has worked in Iraq for the
International Atomic Energy Agency, said the Iraqis were also able
to go it alone in critical areas.
</P>
<P>
   Spurgeon Keeny, a former government arms official who is now
president of the private Arms Control Association, also in
Washington, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would make the cautioning point that foreigners stand out in
a situation like that and would probably come to the attention of
Unscom or reporters in Iraq unless they were totally isolated,'' he
said. He added that outsiders would also not be as easy to control
as Iraqis, who live in a state of terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hired guns would be free to come and go,'' Keeny said.
``Saddam Hussein doesn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that there was no specific evidence of significant
work being done abroad on behalf of Iraq, again at least in part
because the Iraqis would not trust scientists abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza, the Iraqi nuclear expert, said that a few years ago an
Iraqi scientist sent to work on a project in Yemen, where there was
``large-scale cooperation,'' defected to Sweden, exposing the plan.
Libya has been less cooperative with Iraq, Hamza said, although
many Iraqis live and work there.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudan, he said, is suspect as a partner because of its
Islamic militancy. The Sudan has been cooperative in turning over
or expelling suspected terrorists in order to improve its relations
with the West, and may be regarded as unreliable. Money is no
barrier, Hamza said. He said the Iraqi government sent out
relatives of officials, merchants, even phony defectors to set up
bank accounts abroad, sometimes laundering money through small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   These couriers always knew that their families or colleagues
were virtual hostages in Iraq and would be harmed if they did not
carry out orders, Hamza said.

   A federal judge Thursday temporarily blocked a new federal law
intended to shield children from online pornography. Free-speech
advocates had asserted that enforcement of the measure, which was
to have gone into effect Friday, could violate the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Lowell A. Reed Jr. of U.S. District Court in
Philadelphia, issued a temporary restraining order blocking the law
for 10 days, until Dec. 4. Full hearings on the matter are
scheduled for Dec. 8 and 9. Reed is likely to extend the order
until the hearings are held, said Ann Beeson, a lawyer for the
American Civil Liberties Union, which is fighting the law.
</P>
<P>
   The law, the Child On-Line Protection Act, would make it a crime
for operators of commercial Web sites to make certain types of
graphic material available to those under 17.
</P>
<P>
   The suit challenging the act was filed on Oct. 22, hours after
it was signed into law by President Clinton. The case is being
brought by 17 online publishers, retailers and other organizations.

 As Investment Bankers Turn, Layoffs Hit Volpe, Brown, Whelan  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Just in time for the holidays, another Bay Area investment bank is
lowering the ax _ and not, unfortunately, on the trunks of
Christmas firs.
</P>
<P>
   In what is fast becoming a trend from Wall Street to Montgomery
Street, San Francisco's Volpe Brown Whelan is laying off about 30
employees, or 17 percent of its workforce, confirms James Feuille,
the boutique firm's head of investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to size the firm to be lean, mean and
efficient,'' says Feuille. ``We wanted to be in a good position (in
the event of) a sustained down market.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's never a good time to deliver this kind of
news, but getting a pink slip a month before Christmas is worse
than finding coal in your stocking. And While Volpe is spreading
the layoffs from top to bottom (many coming on Friday the 13th, no
less), some of the trimming is still coming off the top of the
tree. Two Volpe managing directors (who are akin to being partners
at the limited liability corporation) were given their walking
papers, Feuille says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the bottom line is that Volpe is slashing costs.
While the market has rebounded sharply, deal flow has slackened and
market uncertainty abounds. Volpe is a niche player with
aspirations of becoming a formidable regional bank. Or so it says.
But for now, it relies on small companies, which were slammed last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Volpe isn't alone. BancBoston Robertson Stephens, J.P.
Morgan, Merrill Lynch and many other firms have announced job cuts,
too. And there are more from whence they came. 1999 is expected to
be a tumultuous year for investment banks and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   While massive layoffs aren't likely _ such as those that
succeeded the crash of 1987 _ firms will continue to notch their
belts while high-paid bankers, analysts and brokers scurry to find
more stable situations, says Don Putnam, president of Putnam,
Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP; Thornton, a San Francisco investment
boutique.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brokerage world is going to be an increased world of
chaos. Many people will find themselves in new jobs by the end of
1999,'' predicts Putnam.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, things change. It was just a few months ago that
Feuille was trumpeting his plans to help build Volpe into a
regional power.
</P>
<P>
   So what has come of those ambitious aspirations?
</P>
<P>
   Not a thing, says Feuille, who was head of technology banking
before leaving Robertson Stephens in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to think that we have an incredible opportunity
(to grow) in technology and health care,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some doubting Thomases in the investment banking world
wonder if Volpe isn't just dressing up the business with intentions
to sell. Could that be so?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not, there is still a huge opportunity for us (to
grow). If we sell the firm, we take that opportunity off of the
table,'' Feuille says.
</P>
<P>
   However, for the time being, Volpe will be taking food off some
of its former employees' tables.
</P>
<P>
   MBO FOR ROBBIE FUNDS: The principals of Robertson Stephens
Investment Management finally found a suitable buyer: themselves.
</P>
<P>
   After dancing with a number of prospective suitors, BankAmerica
announced it has reached a definitive deal to sell the Robbie fund
unit to a group of investors led by senior management of RSIM,
including RSIM chief executive Randy Hecht.
</P>
<P>
   No price was disclosed, but analysts pegged its value as high as
$100 million. Robbie investment management, which was founded in
1984, has about $4 billion under management, including $2 billion
in its mutual fund complex.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is how many of the group's high-profile fund
managers are pumping their own nickels into the proposed management
buyout, which is slated to close during the first quarter of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   While it is presumed that most, or all, of them are in the deal,
neither the buyer nor the seller is saying. Hecht was unavailable
for comment. A BofA spokesman would only say that there are
retention agreements with the portfolio managers in place, and the
new owners hope to forge new agreements with the money managers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, let's hope so. The primary asset being acquired is the
stock-picking talent. However, some of their picking hasn't been as
stellar as in the past.
</P>
<P>
   BofA put the Robbie fund group on the block in June after BofA
sold the fund group's sister investment banking unit to BankBoston.
BofA talked to numerous financial concerns before finally opting to
sell the unit to management.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, BofA was in serious talks to sell RSIM to
BankBoston_ the same buyer of the Robbie investment banking unit.
The two sides were close to reaching agreement, but the deal fell
apart largely because selected portfolio managers refused to work
for BankBoston, banking sources say.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners are changing the name of the company (yet again)
to RSIM, and the fund complex will be called RS Funds. It looks
like BankBoston will get sole control of the Robertson Stephens
moniker, after all. But the BofA spokesman was unable to confirm
that as well.

NOTHING RIVALS THIS SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regional rivalries are what make Saturday's
dawn-til-well-past-dusk college football menu in many ways more
delicious than New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 1 games might mean more, but these MEAN more. Which
means even with more than a dozen games available on over-the-air
and cable TV Saturday, there's room for even MORE.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:30 p.m., while No. 3 UCLA and USC face off in these parts
on ABC and top-ranked Tennessee meets Kentucky on CBS, No. 2 Kansas
State is playing Missouri and No. 4 Florida is taking on rival No.
5 Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Again, that's all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully for those who happen to be out of their region of
interest but have addressable cable, ESPN GamePlan, that
pay-per-view service that some predicted would lead to all major
games taken off free TV, has stretched itself over the last few
years.
</P>
<P>
   For $11.95, viewers can embrace both K-State-Missouri and
Florida-Florida State during the USC-UCLA broadcast, in addition to
the North Carolina-Duke game at 9 a.m. and the Arkansas-Mississippi
State game (the winner of which faces Tennessee for the SEC title)
at 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   When the pay service started up eight years ago as an
experiment, Showtime Entertainment Television (SET) helped ABC find
a way to charge $8.95 to anyone who wanted one of the other games
that the network was already televising. That game depended on
whichever one the cable system decided to put on from the four
choices.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there have been as many as 10 games available for
pay-per-viewers on Saturdays, whether they bought the season
package or individual weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Two dramatic things have happened, according to ESPN's Skip
Desjardin, who's run the station's pay-per-view games the last four
years. Cable systems are devoting as many five additional channels
to pay-per-view, and small-dish sales with DirecTV, PrimeStar,
EchoStar and Dish Network are rising.
</P>
<P>
   And as digital cable becomes more common, there will be even
more pay channels on cable systems, opening the choices to far more
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Although cable itself has increased from about 50 percent of all
TV homes eight years ago to about 70 percent today, the addressable
cable (that which the viewer can call in and order pay-per-view)
has nearly doubled from 15 million to about 28 million. Add in the
dish systems and there are 38 million homes capable of ordering
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the story is that there are more games into more homes
and nothing has been taken away,'' said Desjardin. ``All we did was
add more choices. It's a no-lose situation for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   A system that not long ago seemed tenuous has paved the way for
more additional pay-per-view services. The NFL on DirecTV's
``Sunday Ticket'' has about 700,000 subscribers kicking in $159 a
season. ESPN's ``FullCourt'' expands college basketball coverage.
Recently, DirecTV struck a deal with CBS to air out-of-region games
during the NCAA basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It has also paved the way for the major-league baseball, NBA and
NHL national season pay packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved in this business it can be done technically and
there is an appetite for it with sports,'' said Desjardin.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that cable systems like Time-Warner in the West
Valley are even offering games beyond the ESPN ``GamePlan.'' When
the upstart Military Channel offered (for free) the Oct. 10
Navy-Air Force game, Time-Warner picked it up. The channel is
offering Saturday's SMU-Navy game to some cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   For advertisers who feared the pay games would siphon viewers
away, Desjardin said the numbers have not impacted viewership of
national games.
</P>
<P>
   About the only dent in this system is that not all cable
companies pick up the same games. You could live on one street and
be offered one or two games, while across the street, your neighbor
could have an entirely different selection of games, depending on
the cable system's capacity as well as who at the office is
determining what to funnel in. As a result, it's been up to cable
operators to get the word out on what games are available, and not
all do the same marketing job.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, Desjardin said as pay cable expands, there might
be less confusion about kickoff times, which are now at the whim of
network programmers. More games can have a 12:30 p.m. kickoff, like
Saturday's bunch, without fear of overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Or that could be done on purpose to make viewers buy the games. &QL; 
THE RADIO SHUFFLE
</P>
<P>
   No official lineup changes have been announced at all-sports
KXTA-AM (1150), but program director Mike Thompson could be in the
position to do so as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Word on the Internet has been circulating about changes that
could affect every time slot except the syndicated Jim Rome and
Scott Ferrall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to conclude this is the time of the year when stuff
happens,'' Thompson said Thursday. ``Everyone's under evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also said it wasn't fair to categorize the moves as a
change in philosophy from a ``sports talk'' format to ``guy talk,''
which several stations have tried after deciding that L.A. is not
as hard-core about its sports as other markets.
</P>
<P>
   The morning team of John Ireland and Steve Mason are all but
gone but by their choice. Ireland's workload at KCAL-Channel 9 will
increase with the departure of Tom Murray to Fox Sports News at the
first of the year, while Mason has other projects lined up. The
rumored replacement is a non-sports-driven show from Brian Whitman,
Rick Dees' sidekick on sister station KIIS-FM.
</P>
<P>
   A less active role for Vic Jacobs and the departure of long-time
L.A. sports-talk personality Joe McDonnell, who has been with the
station since June '97 in the afternoon-drive slot, has also been
tossed around.
</P>
<P>
   Will McDonnell have work at the station next week?
</P>
<P>
   ``After a week, probably; after a month, I don't know,''
McDonnell said after a meeting with Thompson on Thursday. ``All I
know is it's not fun seeing my name associated with being fired,
and I'm not the only one in that category.'' &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
__ Afternoon delight: Nationally, the ratings indicate ABC's
``Monday Night Football'' could reach an all-time low. But it won't
be on Los Angeles' account. Through last week's game, ``MNF'' has a
13.8 national rating, which would be an all-time low. But L.A.,
adjusting to the 5:20 p.m. kickoff, has been doing a 15.2 to date,
and the game is usually the highest-rated sports show of the week.
One reason for the overall drop might be the average victory margin
has been 17 points a game, with five games decided by 20 or more.
That doesn't include the Pittsburgh-Green Bay game, in which the
Steelers led 27-0 in the fourth quarter before it ended up 27-20. &QL; 
__ Point/counterpoint: Tonight at 7 p.m. on his KIEV-AM (870) show,
Irv Kaze brings on USC and UCLA alums to pump you up for Saturday's
game. The guests include Anthony Davis, Ron Mix, Craig Fertig, Mike
Garrett and !bold!Paul McDonald on one side and Tom Ramsey, Gaston
Green, David Norrie, Ken Norton Jr. and J.J. Stokes on the other.
Later, KTTV-Channel 11's Rich Garcia has a half-hour preview of the
game (10:30 p.m.), and on Saturday, KCOP-Channel 13's Newy Scruggs
has a half-hour wrapup (10:30 p.m.). &QL; 
__ Morning affirmation with Karl Malone Imitations from KROQ-FM's
Jimmy ``The Sports Guy'' Kimmel. They're simply Karl-rific. &QL; 
__ Your tax dollars at work: KLCS-Channel 58 has, for the first
time, the L.A. City volleyball championships tonight. The
Taft-Fremont match at 5:30 p.m., followed by Palisades-Narbonne at
8 p.m., will have Randy Rosenbloom in the mandatory play-by-play
chair with former UCLA star Liz Masakayan doing color and Geoff
Nathansen as the show's host. &QL; 
__ Big name, but does he back it up?: Fox Sports News landed NHL
Hall of Famer and recently deposed Tampa Bay GM Phil Esposito as
the studio analyst, starting early next month. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
__ Fox baseball guys Joe Buck and Tim McCarver have been relishing
the fact they can be heard in the background of the scandalous
Linda Tripp taped phone recordings of Monica Lewinsky that were
unnecessarily released to the drooling public Tuesday. Apparently,
Fox's Yankees-Indians Game 5 broadcast from Oct. 6 can be heard in
the background on Tripp's end of a conversation. ``That's
hilarious,'' McCarver told USA Today. ``If that's not a sign that
baseball's back, nothing is.'' And if that's not a sign that Tripp
purposely put something on TV that wouldn't distract her while she
tried to entrap a friend, nothing does. &QL; 
__ Unemployed sneaker salesman Shaquille O'Neal, another person
with too much time on his hands, bench-pressed Regis Philbin during
an episode of ``Live with Regis and Kathie Lee'' this week. Then,
when they played a game of one-on-one, Shaq lifted Regis up so he
could dunk. Philbin, who referred to Shaq ``a very hot rap

 Switching From Big to Small Firms  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I'm trying to find work as director of information
systems for a small to midsized company. I have a lot of experience
working at Fortune 500 firms, and I also have run a small
consulting business. Although I have contacts in most of the large
corporations in my area, I'm having trouble using my ``network'' to
find opportunities in small firms. Any ideas?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer:  &LR; You've got a two-part challenge here _ making contacts
in the small-business world and then convincing those contacts that
you'd be a good fit with their organization.
</P>
<P>
   Where to make contacts? Marcelle Bolding, a human resources
consultant in Oakland, suggests starting with local civic groups
that are gathering places for small-businesspeople, such as the
chamber of commerce or Rotary Club.
</P>
<P>
   Seek out local recruiting or staffing firms that cater to the
small-business market, and get your name into their Rolodexes. And
scan the media _ both the local business press and national
magazines like Inc. and Entrepreneur _ for names of up-and-coming
small companies in your area.
</P>
<P>
   Small companies may be justifiably skeptical about hiring
someone whose life has been spent on the relatively cushy campuses
of Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Small firms need people who can do a lot with limited funds.
They need people who are comfortable working without much
structure. And they need people who can wear multiple hats _ not
just running the computer network, for instance, but helping out
with marketing, sales or even answering the phones.
</P>
<P>
   Tailor your resume and interview responses to show that you can
do all this. Play up the entrepreneurial experience you got as a
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first questions they'll ask is, `You worked for all
these big companies: Why do you want to work for a small one? And
why would you be successful?''' said Linda Surrell, counseling
manager at the Career Action Center in Cupertino. ``You need to
have a good answer for that.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: I work for a company with fewer than 10 employees. My
employer has decided to close the office on certain days during the
holiday season, such as the day after Thanksgiving and the day
before Christmas. In order to be paid for those days, we've been
told we must use our vacation time. Is this legal?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Companies have the right to set whatever holiday schedules
they want, giving as much paid or unpaid time off as they feel
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies that shut down for Christmas Eve or the day after
Thanksgiving treat those days as paid holidays, according to Brain
Ashe, an employment lawyer with Seyfarth Shaw Fairweather &AMP;
Geraldson in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like yours, shut their doors during the holidays without
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, for instance, will shut down without pay for an
entire week between Christmas and New Year's as a way to trim
costs.
</P>
<P>
   That's completely legal.
</P>
<P>
   What  &LR; wouldn't  &LR; be legal would be telling employees that they
must take their accrued vacation at a particular time. ``Vacation
connotes that people can take the time off on their own
timetable,'' Ashe said.
</P>
<P>
   Your company's doing the correct thing _ giving you the option
of using vacation time but not forcing you to do so.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be generous, but it's completely legal.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: I'm a participant in an employee stock plan that requires
vesting over a period of several years. Is there any law requiring
the company to count my time off on maternity leave toward vesting?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: The Family &AMP; Medical Leave Act and similar state laws
require employers to continue your health insurance when you're on
leave with a new baby.
</P>
<P>
   But those laws don't require companies to maintain other
benefits for you or to count your leave time toward vesting in a
stock plan.
</P>
<P>
   There is one circumstance in which part of your maternity leave
might have to be counted for vesting _ if your company allows
employees to count time off for other medical conditions.
</P>
<P>
   California law says employers must treat pregnancy the same as
other medical disabilities. So if your firm counts time off for
heart surgery toward vesting, it should count your pregnancy
disability leave toward vesting, too.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The question you're asking has caught the attention of
people in Washington, too. Last month, President Clinton asked
Congress to pass a law allowing people to count FMLA time off
toward vesting in retirement plans. Want to make your opinion known
on the issue? Call or write your representative.
</P>
<P>
   Send your work and career questions to Ilana DeBare, Workways,
San Francisco Chronicle, 901 Mission St., San Francisco 94103. Or
send e-mail to workways(at sign)sfgate.com. &LR;   &LR; Or call (415)

 Candescent Builds Flat-Panel Plant in San Jose  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
In a high-stakes effort to win back the flat-panel computer display
market from Asian competitors, Candescent Technologies Corp. said
yesterday that it has begun construction of a $400 million
production plant in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, almost 95 percent of flat-panel displays are
manufactured in the Far East,'' said Harry Marshall, CEO of the San
Jose firm. ``This marks a serious manufacturing effort to bring a
market approaching $20 billion in annual sales back to the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Although the technology was developed here, Japan, Korea and
more recently Taiwan have taken over the market because of lower
production costs than in America. Candescent hopes to change the
economic equation by creating a totally automated production line
outfitted with robots and automated, guided vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Candescent's bright idea has been a long time coming _ and
expensive. Since 1991, it has raised $450 million to develop a new
class of flat-panel displays from several hundred investors
including venture capital firms, banks and insurance companies and
high-tech giants such as Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer. Two
weeks ago, Japan's Sony Corp. agreed to invest $50 million as part
of a joint development project.
</P>
<P>
   Candescent's proprietary ``Thin CRT'' product combines
conventional cathode ray tube (CRT) technology associated with TV
screens and conventional computer monitors, with advances in
semiconductor, disk drive and flat-panel manufacturing processes.
The product is expected to offer full-motion, true-color video
image quality, while using little power.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 340,000-square-foot plant at Hellyer Avenue and
Branham Lane in San Jose's Edenvale Redevelopment Project area
marks the first advanced fab facility built in Silicon Valley in
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is expected to be completed late next summer.
Sample production is slated by the beginning of 2000. At full
production, the facility is expected to have 500 employees and
produce up to 1.2 million 14.1-inch displays per year for portable
and desktop computers. Annual sales could approach $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company will begin shipping 5.3-inch displays from its $40
million development fab facility in San Jose in the first quarter
of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the largest venture-backed companies, and it
has the opportunity to win some of a multibillion-dollar market
back to America,'' said Jack Wilson, editorial director of
ComputerLetter.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson was worried about the Candescent's timing. ``There
could be a problem; the flat-panel market appears over-saturated.''
</P>
<P>
   Display industry analyst David Mentley of Stanford Resources
notes that Asian manufacturers overbuilt capacity for 12-inch
displays and that with threatened overcapacity of more than 2
million units, prices have plummeted to about $250 per unit from
$1,000 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Candescent's Marshall doesn't deny that it looked like a
``meltdown'' six months ago as the Asian economic crisis took its
toll and companies shelved plans to invest in new plants. But he
believes that ``the market is slowly coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the excess of conventional flat-panel displays this
year, Marshall expects supply and demand will be in balance next
year and that there could be a shortage of 3 million or more units
in 2000, when Candescent starts production.

 Low-Fare Reno Air Acquired  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
American Airlines said yesterday it will buy discounter Reno Air
Inc. in a $124 million deal that will boost American's West Coast
presence, but kill Reno's low-cost pricing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Reno by American, the nation's No.2 airline,
will have the biggest impact on travelers flying in and out of San
Jose International Airport, where Reno is the No. 2 airline with 39
daily departures behind No.1 Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Reno burst into the discount air business six years ago and
constantly sought out routes where it thought it could make a
splash and a buck. But it abandoned routes almost as fast as it
created them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in and out of 39 city combinations in the last five
years,'' said Reno spokeswoman Joanne Smith. ``We were an airline
without much of a niche or a long-term strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Reno serves 14 cities in the West plus Oklahoma City
and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   If American maintains Reno's flights out of San Jose, as
expected, it will inherit the No. 2 position at that airport.
</P>
<P>
   Reno ranks a distant No. 31 at San Francisco International
Airport, with just three daily departures. It does not serve
Oakland International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reno Air has been very important to California travelers
because it's been a low-priced airline with pretty good service,''
said Ed Perkins, an Ashland, Ore., travel writer and former editor
of the Consumer Reports Travel Letter in San Francisco. ``As far as
I can see, this news is all bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reno airline said it had little choice but to find a merger
partner. It lost $12 million on revenues of $384 million last year.
Although it posted a profit of $7.3 million for the first nine
months of 1998 on sales of $294 million, it still was flying with
too many empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   Its planes generally fly with 65 percent of its seats full. That
compares with around 70 percent for American, and American's seats
are higher priced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected to be profitable for the year,'' said Reno Air's
Smith. ``But we had too small a market presence to do well in the
event of a downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno and American have had a cooperative relationship for
several years. Reno has leased airport gates from American in San
Jose and it has extended American AAdvantage frequent flier miles
for all of its flights.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose Airport spokesman Jim Peterson said he does not expect
any Bay Area flight cancellations after American assumes control of
Reno in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``American has been building its presence, east to west, out of
San Jose by adding flights,'' said Peterson. ``Obviously they find
Reno appealing to help them reposition themselves up and down the
coast.''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase will mark the second time that American has
acquired a West Coast discounter. In 1986, it bought AirCal, one of
the first discounters born following deregulation of the airline
industry in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   American of Fort Worth, Texas, made it clear yesterday that it
will leverage its east-west prowess with more north-south
connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acquiring Reno will give our customers the benefits of a more
comprehensive travel network throughout the U.S. and around the
globe,'' said Don Carty, American's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   American has one of the industry's best ``yield management''
systems, which uses complex computer systems based on past
experience and demand forecasts to extract the maximum price for
each seat.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for an airline trying to maximize profit but a
mixed blessing for consumers, depending on how desperately they
need to fly.
</P>
<P>
   American is offering $7.75 for each share of Reno stock, a 5
percent premium to Reno's closing price yesterday. American also
will buy Reno's preferred stock at $27.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Reno shares rose 13 cents to $7.38 yesterday after doubling in
the past six weeks amid takeover speculation. Shares in AMR,
American's parent company, fell $1.63 to $63.13.

`PRINCE' TO GET ROYAL-SIZED RECEPTION ON WORLD'S SCREENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Size really does matter for biblical epics.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks SKG will open ``The Prince of Egypt'' on 8,000 to
10,000 screens in 40 countries and in two dozen languages between
Dec. 16 and 26 in what's believed to be the widest simultaneous
worldwide rollout ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a stupendous number,'' said film industry analyst Tim
Baskerville. ``It shows that the world has become a lot more
integrated in terms of marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest single market debut for the $80 million project, an
animated version of the story of Moses, will come Dec. 18 in the
United States with more than 2,500 theaters. Belgium, France,
Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, the Netherlands and Singapore will
have already opened ``Prince'' by then.
</P>
<P>
   Major studio releases typically begin showing in foreign markets
a month or two after their U.S. opening to allow time for dubbing,
testing of marketing strategies and reusing prints from the
domestic run.
</P>
<P>
   But DreamWorks executives believe the holiday season is the
prime time for starting ``Prince of Egypt.'' ``It's the same
holiday around the world, so it makes sense to take advantage of
that on the international release pattern,'' said distribution head
James Tharp.
</P>
<P>
   Early buzz has been positive, particularly since performance by
``Antz,'' DreamWorks' first animated film, has beaten expectations.
Seven-week domestic grosses for ``Antz'' have passed $81 million
while its foreign take has topped $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   Baskerville noted that the gap between domestic and foreign
start dates has been narrowing due to growing worldwide interest in
entertainment. ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' and ``Titanic'' saw
particularly quick foreign rollouts last December.
</P>
<P>
   Four-year-old DreamWorks does not have a foreign distribution
arm. UIP, a Paramount-Universal-MGM joint venture, is handling
``Prince'' overseas. &QL;

FINAL RESPECTS PAID AS KENTUCKY GRIEVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl) 
By JOE DRAPE and MICHAEL A. LINDENBERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The quarterback, Tim Couch, served as a pallbearer for his best
friend and former teammate, Christopher Scott Brock. The starting
center, Jason Watts, has been charged with second-degree
manslaughter and drunken driving in connection with Brock's death
and the death of another teammate, Arthur Steinmetz.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a heart-wrenching week for the University of
Kentucky Wildcats _ bus rides to funerals, football practices at
night, tearful sessions with ministers and bereavement counselors.
Breaking down film for their biggest game of the season _ against
the border rival and the nation's No. 1-ranked team, the Tennessee
Volunteers _ could wait. The grieving could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still disbelief and shock,'' Gabe Smith, a junior
wide receiver, said earlier this week. ``Especially when you have
seven wins and you think you are invincible. This brings you back
to earth and makes you realize what is important. There were two
lives lost. Bowl games aren't as important as that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a somber group of friends, the entire Kentucky team who
filed out of St. Pius X Catholic Church on Thursday in the small
northern Kentucky town of Edgewood. They were here to say farewell
to Steinmetz, 19, a defensive lineman who had transferred to
Kentucky, in Lexington, from Michigan State and was sitting out the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, many mourners who had attended Steinmetz's funeral
had traveled to Thousandsticks in Eastern Kentucky for the
21-year-old Brock's services. Brock, who was known as Scott,
attended Eastern Kentucky University, about 20 miles south of
Lexington, but grew up with Couch in Hyden, Ky., and was close to
many of the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   A festive week on campus in anticipation of playing the Vols
(9-0), in which Couch, a Heisman Trophy candidate, would be
showcased on national television, took a harrowing turn early
Sunday when a pickup truck driven by Watts veered off a rural
highway 60 miles south of Lexington, rolled over and threw Watts,
Brock and Steinmetz from the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, Kentucky (7-3) had beaten Vanderbilt, 55-17,
in the last game of the season at Commonwealth Stadium _ a
milestone for seniors like Watts, a three-year starter. They were
en route to a farm to hunt deer. Watts, 21, had a blood-alcohol
content of 0.15 percent _ the legal limit is 0.10 percent. _
according to the Pulaski County sheriff's office, which filed two
felony manslaughter charges and a drunken-driving charge against
Watts.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second time in 16 months that Watts had been charged
in an alcohol-related incident. Last year, he paid a fine after
shooting a teammate, Omar Smith, in the buttocks as they handled a
rifle outside the house they shared in Lexington. A police report
on the incident said that Watts' blood-alcohol content was 0.129
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Watts was initially charged with first-degree assault, but that
later was reduced to unlawful discharge of a weapon, a violation of
a city ordinance, in part because Smith refused to file a criminal
complaint or testify against Watts.
</P>
<P>
   News that Sunday's accident may have been alcohol related roiled
already raw emotions within the University of Kentucky community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a class postponed for about 45 minutes today to discuss
it,'' Brian Riddell, 21, a political science and psychology major
and the president of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, said
Thursday. ``Reaction was sort of mixed. At first people were upset
and really found it to be tragic. When we found out alcohol was
involved, some of the sympathy and compassion has turned a little
bit to anger.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kentucky coach Hal Mumme does not know how his team will handle
the ordeal when it finally takes the field Thursday in Knoxville.
He said he had asked Mississippi State coach Jackie Sherrill for
advice. Last year, the Bulldogs' Keffer McGee drowned in an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Mumme has spent time at the hospital with Watts, who remains at
the University of Kentucky Medical Center after surgery for an arm
injury. Mumme and his staff have been available to their players.
The practices at night under the lights of Commonwealth Stadium are
perhaps more comforting than effective preparation for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not going to be a lot of emotion,'' said Mumme, a
second-year coach at Kentucky. ``Let's face it, it is not going to
be easy to get emotional about football this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The week has been especially traumatic for Couch. His friendship
with Brock began as toddlers in day care whose walkers had to be
tied to separate ends of a sofa to keep them from fighting each
other. They went to school together, spent the night at each
other's house and played football together in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't quit thinking about all the stuff we've done,''
Couch said earlier this week. ``Every song that comes on the radio,
I remember just things me and him would think about ... so it's ...
you know ...'' Couch then broke down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   At a subdued practice Wednesday night, Couch took a single snap
so as not to aggravate a slight bruise to his upper arm. The early
part of the week he had spent with Brock's family. Now he sought
comfort in Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking at it as the biggest game in my life,'' said
Couch, who was highly recruited by Tennessee. ``I always circle the
Tennessee game every year on the calendar. I love playing against
Tennessee. It is a big rivalry and it means a lot to me and it
means a lot to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too convincingly. Not this week. &QL;

 Leadership Lessons From the Legends  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
So you've devoured every book by Tom Peters, Peter Drucker and
Stephen Covey in your ceaseless quest to uncover the secrets of
business success.
</P>
<P>
   Who ya gonna call?
</P>
<P>
   How about Winston Churchill or Ulysses S. Grant?
</P>
<P>
   Or Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Ronald Reagan, Jesus,
Aristotle, Sun Tzu, Captain Jean-Luc Picard or Attila the Hun?
</P>
<P>
   American publishers are spewing forth an unprecedented stream of
books claiming to offer management lessons from the lives of dead,
fictional and otherwise unlikely figures.
</P>
<P>
   This year's offerings alone have ranged from ``Cigars, Whiskey &AMP;
Winning: Leadership Lessons of Ulysses S. Grant'' to ``Reagan on
Leadership: Executive Lessons from the Great Communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   Such titles amount to only a tiny sliver of the 1,700 or so
books about business published each year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But they're a sliver that didn't even exist 10 years ago. And
the numbers are growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a trend,'' said Herb Addison, vice president
for business books &LR;   &LR; at Oxford University Press, which published
``Sun Tzu and the Art of Business'' in 1996 and is now hoping to do
a similar book based on the life of Confucius. ``We're all digging
up the past looking for possibilities to do books like this.''
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for this spate of leadership books based on dead
or mythical figures?
</P>
<P>
   People are hungry for information about how to get ahead in
today's rapidly changing business world. Publishers, in turn, are
hungry for sexy, new angles that can set their latest management
book apart from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   And some writers seem to be building entire careers churning out
these books.
</P>
<P>
   Wess Roberts, the fellow who brought us ``Leadership Secrets of
Attila the Hun'' is the same person responsible for ``Make It So:
Leadership Lessons from `Star Trek: The Next Generation.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And Donald Phillips _ a management consultant who is also mayor
of Fairview, Texas _ started with ``Lincoln on Leadership'' and
went on to write ``The Founding Fathers on Leadership'' and
``Martin Luther King Jr. on Leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these books are carefully documented, with scores of
footnotes referring to historical sources. Others should really be
filed under fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual advice in nearly all of them is pretty
conventional and virtually interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Grant book reveals that the general's
management practices included ... (drum roll, please) ...
surrounding himself with good people, treating subordinates fairly
and trusting himself to make good decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan book, meanwhile, reveals that his success as a leader
was due to such less-than-shocking traits as being decisive,
communicating well and learning from mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes a good leader is pretty straightforward and
timeless,'' said David Vogel, a professor at the Haas School of
Business at the University of California at Berkeley. ``It's
unlikely, if not impossible, that any of these books contain
insights that aren't already known and available in other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The granddaddy of this whole trend is the Attila book, first
published in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   It offers scores of pithy tips that make the fifth century
steppes of Asia sound amazingly like an enlightened 1998 boardroom:
</P>
<P>
   ``A wise chieftain never kills the Hun bearing bad news.'' Or,
``Wise chieftains grant both authority and responsibility to those
they have delegated assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth? Almost nothing is really known about Attila's
personality or leadership style.
</P>
<P>
   There's certainly no historical evidence that Attila really
expected ``continual improvement'' from his followers, as the book
claims. Or that _ like some Silicon Valley team leader _ he
encouraged ``creativity, freedom of action and innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the Huns in general ruled an empire of widely
diverse people and exacted tribute from their allies as well as
their enemies,'' said Thomas Burns, an Emory University historian
who specializes in Attila's era.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as Attila, we know virtually nothing,'' Burns
continued. ``If a book is telling you these kinds of things about
Attila, someone is making it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there's more of a written record of Jesus' activities
as a leader. And in ``Jesus CEO: Using Ancient Wisdom for Visionary
Leadership,'' Laurie Beth Jones offers tips for managers based on
Jesus' life.
</P>
<P>
   Jones divides the book into more than 85 very brief lessons
about Jesus as an executive.
</P>
<P>
   They include: He Had a Plan. He Formed a Team. He Was a
Turnaround Specialist. He Kept in Constant Contact with His Boss.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' nuggets don't address the really hard questions, like how
Jesus-the-CEO would reconcile compassion for his workers with
shareholder demands for major layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And some readers might find her analogies a bit reductionist.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how she refers to Jesus' temptation by the devil:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the wilderness, Jesus was given several `business
opportunities' that did not relate to his mission. ... He resisted
them because they did not fit his mission statement.''
</P>
<P>
   And she describes Jesus' appearance at Galilee after his death
as a kind of team-building exercise:
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jesus returned from the dead, he prepared a fish barbecue
on the shore _ sort of a `team picnic,' '' Jones writes.
</P>
<P>
   Some books such as the ones on Lincoln and the founding fathers
can be interesting from a historical angle _ sort of a Cliff's
Notes version of American history for busy executives.
</P>
<P>
   But the history is pretty shallow. And the management advice is
simplistic and stereotyped. Some tidbits from the founding fathers
book:
</P>
<P>
   ``Be prepared for even the worst-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When people really care about a cause, they will not only act
on their own initiative, they'll move mountains to get the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Star Trek'' book, on the other hand, doesn't suffer from a
lack of historical depth.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it goes to the other extreme. Most of the book is made
up of lengthy retellings of ``Star Trek'' episodes _ so lengthy
that even this reader, an avid ``Next Generation'' fan, couldn't
bear it.
</P>
<P>
   The reward for boldly going through pages and pages of narrative
about Cardassian maneuvers and residual theta-band emissions? Bits
of wisdom such as: ``In space, officers can ill afford to allow
their crew to become distracted by misdirected competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Churchill on Leadership: Executive Success in the Face of
Adversity,'' by Steven Hayward, is one of the few books to paint
its subject with any kind of detail and nuance.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because the author has a Ph.D. in history. It may
also be because Churchill himself left behind many explicit
writings and statements on leadership _ some of which are quite
incisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success is going from failure to failure without loss of
enthusiasm,'' Churchill is quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Other books such as the ones on Grant and Reagan gloss over
their subjects' significant failings as leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Grant was a great general but a disastrous president. Reagan
changed the political direction of this country but also oversaw
the Iran-Contra scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Grant and Reagan books devote only a few brief pages to
these debacles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Some observers say that leadership books about historic or
mythic figures are popular for precisely this reason: The subjects
are distant enough that readers can overlook their flaws in a way
that's impossible with real-life business leaders like Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a general cynical attitude (about work) and a
jaundiced view about modern leaders, so we look to people from
other places and times,'' said Jim Meindl, a management professor
at the State University of New York at Buffalo who is studying the
portrayal of CEOs in the media.
</P>
<P>
   But reducing the complex realities of leadership into neat
kernels of advice doesn't necessarily do anyone a service.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have something useful if a biography could capture these
people in all their complexity,'' said John Case, executive editor
of the Harvard Management Update. ``It's the complexity that's
missing from these books. The problem is the idea that you can take
this advice and boil it down to some interchangeable nuggets. It
loses what is unusual about these people.''

 Bank of Tokyo To Trim Stake In Union Bank  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
In a local reverberation of Japan's banking crisis, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi plans to sell part of its stake in the parent
company of Union Bank of California through a $750 million public
stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   The secondary sale of stock will trim Bank of Tokyo's ownership
in Union's parent, UnionBanCal Corp., to between 62 and 70 percent
from the current 82 percent, depending on how many shares are sold,
said Union Chief Financial Officer David Matson. Union expects the
offering to take place before April.
</P>
<P>
   By selling a portion of its holdings, the Bank of Tokyo will be
able to do what it's long said it wanted _ avoid an outright sale
and keep a controlling stake in San Francisco's Union, which has
the third-largest market share among California banks.
</P>
<P>
   The sale will take place at the market price of UnionBanCal's
stock at the offering date. The shares of Union's parent company
rose $1.50 to $99 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of Tokyo, Japan's largest financial institution, has been
hit hard by East Asia's slumping economy and needs the sale's
proceeds to shore up its financial position, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Japanese banks, Bank of Tokyo is loaded down with bad
loans. For the fiscal year ended March 31, it lost more than $6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank of Tokyo is one of the strongest banks in Japan, but that
doesn't mean they're insulated from what's going on in the
market,'' said Thomas Theurkauf, an analyst with the New York
brokerage Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bank of Tokyo ``intends to maintain a majority ownership
interest in'' Union after the offering, the California bank said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, other Japanese banks are in headlong retreat from
Europe and North America, closing branches and selling
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Sumitomo Bank Ltd., for example, sold its entire interest in its
California unit, Sumitomo Bank of California, to Utah's Zions
Bancorporation earlier this year at a fire-sale price of $546
million.
</P>
<P>
   With $31.4 billion in assets and 244 offices throughout
California, Union is considered the crown jewel of
Japanese-controlled banking operations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Union's chief executive, Takahiro Moriguchi, is Japanese, but
most of the other top executives are U.S. banking veterans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the stock offering, UnionBanCal said it filed
plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue
$750million in debt securities, which would finance a $500 million
buyback of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   Of that amount, UnionBanCal said it plans to repurchase $250
million in stock from Bank of Tokyo and up to $250 million in
shares held by other foreign institutional shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, UnionBanCal said it will carry out a 3-for-1 stock
split effective December 21. It also will boost its quarterly
dividend 36 percent to 19 cents a share after the stock split.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the stock split and the the sale of Bank of
Tokyo's position to the public should increase the number of shares
that are traded, making it easier for investors to buy and sell
UnionBanCal's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the combination of moves should make UnionBanCal
more attractive to investors. Still, some shareholders may abandon
the stock because they were hoping for a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, this is a positive,'' said Van Kasper &AMP; Co. analyst
Joseph Morford. ``But there were some shareholders in the stock
based on takeover speculation.''

LOAN FROM LIVENT BOARD MEMBERS KEEPS CURTAIN UP FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
   (smw) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some of Livent Inc.'s board members came to the
Broadway theater company's rescue on Thursday, lending it $5
million, enough to keep the curtain up for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday,
is seeking loans of tens of millions of dollars more, which
executives say they need to pay salaries and other expenses while
the company reorganizes its financial matters.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nathan, a spokesman for Livent, said Thursday that he could
not comment on what moves the company may take to reduce costs as a
result of the bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Livent has canceled one of its productions of
``Ragtime,'' which is now performing in Minneapolis and was
scheduled to move to Seattle and to Boston in late January. The
company said it is trying to reschedule dates in Seattle and
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But a call to Ticketmaster Thursday found that agents were still
selling tickets to Boston performances in late January at prices of
as much as $75 a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan said he could not comment because of legal restrictions
relating to the bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Livent's other shows, including the musical ``Ragtime''
in New York, are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the company's two founders, Garth Drabinsky and
Myron Gottlieb, angrily disputed the accusations that Livent's new
managers have made against them. On Wednesday, the company's
management team, led by Michael Ovitz, the former president of Walt
Disney Co., had blamed Drabinsky and Gottlieb for the company's
financial failure, saying that the two men had engaged in a
widespread corporate fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky and Gottlieb said in a written statement that the
management's contention that they had improperly funneled
themselves more than $7.5 million of Livent's money was
``completely false.''
</P>
<P>
   They said that they would soon respond ``strongly and
factually'' to the accusations made by Ovitz and Livent's new
executives, who have filed a lawsuit against them that seeks $145
million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The company would not identify which directors had agreed to
lend the company a total of $5 million, saying that such
information was not significant. But the board includes many
wealthy individuals, including Ovitz; Thomas H. Lee of Boston, the
owner of a buyout firm; Conrad Black, a Canadian publishing
magnate; and A. Alfred Taubman, the owner of shopping malls and the
chairman of Sotheby's auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Without the loan, Livent would have been forced to dismiss its
employees and close its plays, Livent's lawyers told a judge at a
hearing Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Livent has retained investment bankers at S G Cowen to help it
find a buyer or a new partner, and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette to
advise it on how to reorganize its financial affairs if a buyer or
new backer cannot be found.

SHIVER MISSED `CENTER'S DREAM': TEAMS WITH NO NOSE GUARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys center Clay Shiver said the worst
part of being injured is that the games he has missed have been
against teams he figured he could excel against. In Shiver's
11/2-game absence, 31-year-old rookie Mike Kiselak has faced
defensive formations that Shiver believes do not put extreme
pressure on NFL centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's a good player, he had a good game last week,'' Shiver
said. ``But playing against those open fronts without a nose guard
is a center's dream. So obviously, those games are ones I'd enjoy
being in. It frees up people more for you to get on their players,
to double-team, and allows me to run with their linebackers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiselak has played so well against the New York Giants and
Arizona Cardinals that Cowboys coach Chan Gailey is not certain
Shiver will regain his starting job when he returns from a sprained
right big toe. Shiver has missed all practices this week, and is
listed as questionable for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's uncertainty regarding Shiver is a 180-degree turn from
his stance on another position on the offensive line. Gailey said
Everett McIver, who has been out since Oct. 4, will regain the
starting right guard position from Flozell Adams when he is
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Shiver said he does not worry himself about the status of other
players. He said he wants to be the starter, but seemed to indicate
that he would not become disruptive in the locker room if Kiselak
kept his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be there,'' Shiver said. ``But the team comes before
me. Whatever decision they may make will ultimately be the right
decision for the team. So that's my concern.'' On Wheaton's mind
These are tough times for reserve defensive back Kenny Wheaton.
</P>
<P>
   Today marks the one-year anniversary of the murder of Wheaton's
brother, Derrek, who was a 19-year-old freshman cornerback at
Phoenix Community College when he was shot to death while making a
pay phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Wheaton said last week was particularly tough because his
family was in the stands watching him play against the Cardinals.
Kenny, who has the program from Derrek's funeral hanging in his
locker, added that this week has been even more mentally
challenging as the Cowboys have asked him to work more at
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was in the stands except for him,'' Kenny said of
Derrek. ``It gets tougher now as the days go on. And then, having
to learn the safety and the cornerback position adds more pressure.
But I feel like I can do it, like I'm a strong enough person where
I can deal with the hurt of my little brother and continue to do my
job.''
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   McIver practiced again yesterday, and Gailey is optimistic that
McIver's surgically repaired right knee will hold up against the
Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. ``Everett practiced fairly well, and he
could be ready for the ballgame,'' Gailey said. ... Deion Sanders
(sprained big toe) was held out of practice again yesterday, but he
expects to be ready. ``It's coming along fine,'' he said.

NEW INTERNET GROUP URGED TO BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration on Thursday told the new
nonprofit group that hopes to manage the Internet to make itself
more open and accountable to the public and to do it soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've made some progress, but I don't think they've
gone far enough,'' said Ira Magaziner, President Clinton's top
Internet adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Burr, a senior Commerce Department aide who has been
working closely with Magaziner as the government divests itself of
responsibility for the Internet, said she hoped to have revised
bylaws from the group, known as the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers, as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The message was applauded by Internet activists who have
complained that the group's proposed bylaws do not adequately
protect the Internet from being dominated by special-interest
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good, frank, open and very lively discussion,'' Ms.
Burr said. ``I think they heard our concerns loud and clear. They
told us they would go back and talk about it and get back to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner has said he wants to complete the groundwork before he
leaves soon.

LABOR BOARD BACKS ABC ON ITS LOCKOUT OF STRIKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J.)   (af)  
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a major setback to ABC's off-camera television
workers, a federal official dismissed their union's unfair labor
practices complaint against the network Thursday, declaring the
company's 17-day-old lockout of about 2,200 workers legal.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by the National Labor Relations Board's regional
director for New York City came one day after ABC obtained a court
order in Los Angeles preventing union picketers from interfering
with the network's news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides planned to return to the bargaining table Friday
for the first time in more than six weeks, meeting with federal
mediators in Iselin, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very vindicated,'' said Julie Hoover, an ABC
spokeswoman. ``We are very pleased, because we always believed we
had behaved honorably and appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the union, the National Association of Broadcast
Employees and Technicians, said they would immediately appeal the
decision to the labor board's general counsel in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they said, they looked forward to the negotiations
and were pleased with the success of their campaign to keep
politicians and celebrities _ most recently the boxer George
Foreman _ off the network's programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No union places all of its efforts or its hopes in a court or
in the labor board,'' said Tom Donahue, a spokesman for the union,
known as NABET. ``When you are engaged in this kind of dispute, you
are working multiple fronts. On every other front, we are
pressuring the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The lockout was ABC's response to a 24-hour strike on Nov. 2
that the union called to complain that the network had not provided
a detailed list of how much individual medical procedures would
cost under a new health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing the complaint, the labor board's regional
director, Daniel Silverman, wrote that ABC had done what it could
to get the information from its insurance companies and provide it
to the union promptly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were sufficiently forthcoming and timely,'' Silverman
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman's ruling that there was no unfair labor practice means
that ABC is legally allowed to lock out its workers for striking.
Both sides said Thursday that they were eager to end the lockout,
but the network continued to say that it would not let the workers
return until the union agreed to warn it before any similar
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say that giving the notice demanded by ABC _ 72
hours for in-studio programs and two weeks for on-the-road shows _
would weaken their ability to pressure the network.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Responding to Silverman's ruling, Robert Iger, president of ABC,
wrote in a memo to all network employees Thursday: ``While our
legal right to lock our NABET-represented employees out has been
affirmed, we take no pleasure in doing so. While the most recent
focus has been on the union's walkout and the company's lockout, I
want you to know that the company's ultimate objective continues to
be to achieve a new labor agreement with NABET.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman, who had urged leaders on both
sides to return to the table, Thursday praised the resumption of
negotiations. The union members have been working without a
contract for 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that when the company and the union sit down
with the mediators and work through their differences, they will
find common ground and settle this dispute,'' Ms. Herman said in a
statement.

<P>
   After 25 years of running their own business, Jack and Alyce
Schmidt had a vision: When they retired, their three children would
take over and work together happily, each getting equal pay.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the kids are struggling to make the dream come true. In
1991, the Schmidts moved to Florida and handed over Spacesaver
Systems Inc., a $7 million storage-management company in
Kensington, Md., to David Craig, 36, Alyce's son from a previous
marriage, and Amy Hamilton, 35, and Carla Adam, 37, Jack's
daughters from his previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But long-latent tensions among the three began bubbling to the
surface, and this year they sought help when they found they could
not resolve disagreements over pay. Ms. Adam, who had joined
Spacesaver only three years ago and is now a sales representative,
was earning considerably less than Craig, the company president,
and Ms. Hamilton, an executive vice president, and she thought
raises should be given more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our parents were here, they called the shots,'' Craig
said. ``Now they've said, `You guys figure it out.' And we're not
sure how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hiring a consultant or going to a lawyer to draw up a
traditional partnership agreement, though, the three chose a path
that lies somewhere between counseling and therapy: a ``partnership
charter'' pioneered by David Gage, a clinical psychologist and
founder of Business Mediation Associates in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gage, a partnership charter is aimed at driving
hidden angers and resentments into the open before they can damage
or even destroy a business. It is essentially a new way to address
an old problem: staving off the sorts of disputes over money and
power that have been the undoing of many family enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Half the owners of family firms in the United States expect
their businesses to be jointly owned and managed someday by at
least two of their children, Gage said. Yet the chances of that
happening are slim, according to Joe Astrachan, editor in chief of
Family Business Review. Seventy percent of family businesses are
sold or liquidated before reaching the second generation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often spend a lot of energy avoiding issues because
they imagine they won't be able to handle the intense feelings,''
Gage said. ``They talk about money, but not in the depth they need
to. They say they'll be equal partners, get equal pay, work full
time. But what does full time really mean? Partners often run into
problems because someone feels it's not fair that he's putting in
more hours or bringing in more business than the other person.''
</P>
<P>
   First, Gage gives a personality test to wrangling family members
or other partners, to get clues on how they can best pool their
talents and avoid tasks for which they are ill-suited. Ms. Hamilton
and Ms. Adam were surprised to find that their scores were similar
in one area _ ``dominance,'' or overcoming opposition to accomplish
results _ because Ms. Hamilton had always appeared to be bolder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carla is much more reserved and quiet than I am,'' Ms.
Hamilton said. ``People tell us we're like night and day. She may
feel strongly about something, but she keeps it bottled up.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that they are aware of Ms. Adam's strong drive to succeed,
both Ms. Hamilton and Craig are more willing to let her try more
responsible roles in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The test also showed that Ms. Hamilton scored high in
persuasiveness and Craig in traits like conscientiousness. That
helped to explain why the two worked so well together.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2 was for Gage to meet with each of his three clients
separately, to talk about hopes and frustrations and then to put
all three together in the same room to air problems. The exercise
brought all sorts of issues to the surface that the three had been
loath to discuss: how, years ago, Ms. Hamilton had felt anxious
about her own future when it was clear that her stepbrother was
being groomed to be president; how Craig had a tendency to avoid
conflict, and how Ms. Adam felt like a fifth wheel in her
stepbrother's and her sister's smooth machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy and David had been working in the business together for so
long, they were pretty close,'' Gage said. ``Carla had a hard time
breaking into that. They're just figuring out now how to be a
three-person partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   The three are now drawing up their partnership charter and hope
by the end of the year to decide their roles and compensation.
``It's remarkable how far we've gotten,'' Ms. Hamilton said. ``We
decided whatever comes out of this, we'll agree to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   From the personality test, for example, they said they learned
that Ms. Hamilton did not need a lot of details in order to make a
decision. So the charter will probably spell out that anyone
presenting an issue to her should do so with broad-brush strokes
rather than exhaustive specifics.
</P>
<P>
   The Schmidts' children went to Gage before problems had a chance
to do real damage, but other clients find him after learning some
hard lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hubert, for example, sought help after the breakup of
his partnership with his father and brother in a dispute over the
direction of their construction company in Gaithersburg, Md.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid repeating that fiasco, Hubert said, he and his new
partner have spelled out their expectations for each other and the
business and their plans for dealing with disagreements or the
desire of either to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a partner because the burden isn't all on me; it
spreads the risk,'' said Hubert, who is 39. ``The last time I
wasn't prepared. I want to make sure I'm never in that situation
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the painful experience he endured is all too common.
``Family businesses don't want to admit they're having these
problems,'' said Nina Paul, executive director of the Family
Business Forum at American University in Washington. ``The reality
is, they all do.''

BEFORE THE RENOVATION, CONSIDER THE RETURNS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 22)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)  (af) 
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems that every house in my neighborhood is being renovated.
All summer, Dumpsters occupied one driveway after another, and an
angry hive of power saws started buzzing every morning, though
politely waiting until 8.
</P>
<P>
   This gave my wife a case of Dumpster envy. As a result, we have
redone our master bath, so that the door no longer bangs against
the toilet. And now, she has her sights on the cluttered family
room.
</P>
<P>
   Boomers are nesting, striving to create the perfect space in
which to raise their children. Kitchens are expanding, rooms are
being added, bathrooms are going upscale. Americans spent an
estimated $119 billion on home improvements last year, according to
the Census Bureau, up from $46 billion in 1980, and contractors say
the pace has picked up this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not all renovations make financial sense, however. While fixing
the bathroom was a no-brainer, my wife wants to add more toy
storage in the family room, somehow forgetting the inclination of
our children to ignore the latest in shelves for the convenience of
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to renovate is often an emotional one, and my wife
has a lot of company in wanting to make our home more inviting. But
from an economic standpoint, that can be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motivation of Americans to improve their homes is so
strong that they may make choices that are not good investments,''
said Paul Deffenbaugh, editor in chief of Remodeling magazine.
``Depending on circumstances, remodeling is usually not as good as
a 401(k).''
</P>
<P>
   That may sound coldblooded, but the truth is, we should treat
our houses as investments as well as homes if we want to afford
those condos in Florida when we retire. And contractors say more
people are realizing that.
</P>
<P>
   In the 80s, homeowners were throwing money at remodeling
projects with little concern for future value, said Joseph Matta of
Masterwork Kitchens in Goshen, N.Y. ``It was a frenzy,'' Matta
said. ``Now, boomers have bought more BMWs, kitchens, baths and
second homes than in the history of mankind. They are experienced
buyers. They want to see the return of their investment.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many of us have only the vaguest idea of what the
financial returns might be on all the hammering and sawing. Sure,
we have heard that improvements to bathrooms and kitchens, compared
with other parts of the house, probably add the most value, but we
have no clue how much. And what about the other rooms? Imagine
pouring money into stocks or mutual funds on such sketchy
information.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, Remodeling magazine studies the payoffs of various
renovation projects. The 1998 results, which have just been
published, can be a useful guide to where to put your money if you
want to maximize your home's value.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a new kitchen, on average, increases a home's
resale value a year later by 87 percent of the construction cost. A
minor kitchen renovation may be smarter, at 94 percent. The lowest
figure is for a home office, at 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that these numbers can change, so the return on
anything you do today may vary by the time you are ready to sell.
If the trend of working from home continues, for example, the
figure for home offices may climb.
</P>
<P>
   Brent and Terri Stuart of Goshen just finished a renovation that
included a new kitchen and full bath. They spent about $60,000 on
the two rooms _ $50,000 on the kitchen, $10,000 on the bathroom. By
the magazine's count, they can expect to recoup $52,400 of their
investment _ $43,500 from the kitchen and, at 89 percent, $8,900
from the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Anne and James Moss of Warwick, N.Y., just finished renovating
their house, a job that included spending about $50,000 on a
kitchen, family room, full bath and a deck.
</P>
<P>
   The return on the project was very important to the couple. They
consulted with experts on what work would increase the value of
their home the most. They learned, for example, that people in
their area were increasingly looking for a unified family room and
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   While just remodeling the kitchen would have cost the couple
about $28,000, for an additional $16,000 they were able to expand
the family room and then combine the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost to redo the kitchen was still going to leave the
house in a form that would not necessarily increase its
marketability by much,'' Ms. Moss said. ``But to do the total
renovation was in fact going to increase the value of the house
significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the magazine's numbers, the Mosses should get back about
$42,400 from their four main projects.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the returns from other types of projects, as calculated
from the magazine's survey: a two-story addition, 84 percent; an
attic bedroom, 83 percent; renovation of a master suite, 82
percent; siding replacement, 71 percent; a new deck, 70 percent,
and window replacement, 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is no getting away from how we feel about our homes and
how they reflect who we are. But there is also no getting away from
how important they are to our financial well-being. A bad housing
decision can do a lot of damage. That's why the return on any
renovation needs to be considered before the first nail goes in.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can go wild on the family room with your eyes wide
open.

NUCLEAR PLANT SOLD IN FIRST MULTIPLE-BID AUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., La.)  (rl) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Entergy Corp., a major utility company in the South, emerged as
the winning buyer Thursday in the first multiple-bid auction for an
American nuclear power plant, a 26-year-old reactor on the
Massachusetts coast that sold for $80 million cash.
</P>
<P>
   The auction of the Pilgrim reactor, housed on a 1,600-acre site
on Cape Cod Bay, reflected the growing attraction of nuclear plants
among utilities after a prolonged period of diminished interest
because of their cost and concerns over safety. Most nuclear plants
are safe and have lower operating costs than other kinds of plants.
</P>
<P>
   Just four months ago, the Unit I reactor on Three Mile Island
was sold for $100 million in the first-ever sale of a nuclear plant
in the United States. But unlike the auction for Pilgrim, there was
only one bidder, the Amergen Energy Co., a joint venture of the
Peco Energy Co. and British Energy PLC.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Reed, president of Reed Consulting Group of Burlington,
Mass., said prior attempts at selling nuclear plants had been
``like having a party where no one shows up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you, a lot of people showed up,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten potential buyers expressed interest in buying Pilgrim, owned
by BEC Energy, the parent of the Boston Edison Co., a utility
serving the Boston area. It has been disposing of its generating
plants under a Massachusetts plan to open utilities to competition.
</P>
<P>
   Two utilities ended up submitting bids for the reactor, which
produces 670 megawatts of power. That is considered small among the
104 nuclear plants operating in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The auction demonstrated that a group of utilities that operate
large numbers of nuclear plants are now potential serious bidders
to buy up other nuclear plants as some states force their utilities
to spin off generation as they deregulate.
</P>
<P>
   Some utilities have encountered problems operating their nuclear
plants efficiently, forcing them to shut the plants down for long
periods and passing the high cost of buying power to customers.
</P>
<P>
   A few utilities have faced such severe problems with nuclear
plants that they have decided to shut the plants permanently, a
costly and lengthy process.
</P>
<P>
   But the vast majority of the nation's nuclear plants operate
efficiently and produce some of the cheapest electricity in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   This is one reason why they have become a major attraction to
some large utilities like Entergy, which already operates four
nuclear plants. Although its headquarters are in New Orleans, it
wants to become a low-cost supplier of electricity in other
regions, like New England.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said other utilities that own only one nuclear plant are
likely to sell them. He also predicted that a small number of huge
utilities, like Entergy, Peco, Duke Energy of Charlotte, N.C., and
Southern Co. of Atlanta would acquire most of nation's nuclear
plants. They will end up as major nationwide suppliers of nuclear
power.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hintz, the group president of Entergy Nuclear, a subsidiary
that runs Entergy's nuclear plants, said the acquisition of Pilgrim
was the first of a series.
</P>
<P>
   ``As other nuclear plants become available, we plan to acquire
some of them,'' he said. ``There is going to be a consolidation in
the nuclear industry, where a few companies will own and operate
all the nuclear plants in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the $80 million purchase price, $67 million will pay for the
plant's nuclear fuel. This means the amount paid for the generating
capacity works out to about $20 a kilowatt, compared with about
$500 a kilowatt that has recently been paid for coal-fired plants.

 &HT;    Georgia Tech's Tarplin has become an oustanding defensive end
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About the time Jesse Tarplin was being recruited by
Notre Dame, Clemson, Florida and Auburn as a senior at Cross Keys
High in Decatur, Georgia Tech was in the middle of a 1-10 season
and Bill Lewis was on his way out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Tech had sent Tarplin letters earlier, but mail from The Flats
had long since stopped. By the time George O'Leary took over as
coach and called the Tarplin household, Tarplin was on his way to
the last of five official visits.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Leary caught his attention. So an unofficial visit was
arranged; Tarplin's parents paid for meals and drove their son to
campus. The night Tarplin returned from his last official
recruiting trip, he committed to Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be a part of rebuilding Georgia Tech,'' his
mother, Shirley Tarplin, said. ``I'm like, `Yeah, but there are
other schools out there that have got winning teams,' I'm thinking
to myself. But I never said anything. He's so positive. If he said
it, you can look for it to be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarplin, now a senior defensive end and the quiet leader of the
Georgia Tech defense, has made a believer out of his parents and
helped put the Yellow Jackets within reach of a share in the ACC
championship.
</P>
<P>
   He says the reasons he chose Tech were an opportunity to play
right away, the prestige of a Tech degree, the proximity to his
family.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Leary says Tarplin is the right kind of person to help
rebuild a football program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Jesse,'' the coach said, ``because when Jesse messes
up, he says, `Coach, I did that wrong; let's get it corrected,' and
he moves on. He doesn't go off and sulk. I respect Jesse for that.
When you meet his parents, you know why. They're all
eyeball-to-eyeball people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse and Shirley Tarplin have lived in the same house in
Decatur for 26 years. They have been to every one of their son's
games, from Little League baseball and Pop Warner football to high
school basketball and football to four years at Georgia Tech. For
his career-high 12-tackle performance against Clemson, Shirley
Tarplin was at Death Valley with her husband only two days after
she was in a serious car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Tarplin's father had taken a second job working security for
Crawford Long Hospital at night so he could pay to fly his wife,
his daughter and his granddaughter to Tech games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to be there for your family,'' Shirley Tarplin
said. ``That's what I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarplin learned responsibility from his parents. He remembers
one hard lesson in particular. As a fifth-grader, Tarplin took an
extra large pencil to school. When his teacher tried to take it
away, he resisted. Not only did he get a trip to the principal's
office, but his parents didn't let him go to Florida for a Pop
Warner championship game with his football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesson learned,'' Tarplin said.
</P>
<P>
   Tarplin loves being close to his family, both in geography and
in life. He still goes home every Sunday for church and lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they do it sometimes,'' Tarplin said. ``I've
always had great support from my family. It's one thing I'll
cherish always. A lot of people don't get that from their families,
and it's something you need, especially at the college level.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarplin, who began as a linebacker, missed the first six games
of his freshman year with a broken thumb. He was set back his
sophomore year after he rebroke the thumb, although he played in 10
games. By then, Tarplin had grown into the defensive end that
O'Leary had expected.
</P>
<P>
   In his no-nonsense manner, Tarplin has become one of the ACC's
most dominant defensive linemen. Tech is second in the ACC with 3.3
sacks per game. Tarplin leads the way with 10, double last season's
total.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of so many things,'' Tarplin said. ``I know
my position better, what I can and can't do. I've gotten stronger,
I've gotten quicker. I've got a great supporting cast from end to
end.

 &HT;    Season `a grind' for Bears
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They used to be da Bears, a team of national influence
and envy. Now, they are the Bad News Bears, a pathetic symbol of
ineptness. Chicago serves as a case study in how to execute the
painful fall from grace to disgrace. And how to stay there.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years removed from the Super Bowl championship, and the
resulting ``Super Bowl Shuffle'' video, the Bears find themselves
on the bottom. Such stars and personalities as coach Mike Ditka,
Walter Payton, Mike Singletary, Jim McMahon, ``Refrigerator''
Perry, Willie Gault et al. are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, they have been replaced by forgettable
impostors. These Bears are devoid of star talent, and much of
what's there is injured. Meanwhile, the head of coach Dave
Wannstedt perpetually rests in a figurative guillotine. If the
season continues on its downward spiral, Wannstedt would have to be
a magician to avoid the falling ax.
</P>
<P>
   And the worst is that no one with the Bears (3-7) has a clue how
to reverse things.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at the Georgia Dome, Chicago faces Atlanta, a meeting of
teams headed in opposite directions. While the Falcons (8-2) are
flying high after an impressive victory over the San Francisco
49ers, the Bears are mired in their pitiable wallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me it's been the same thing year in and year out,
and it's frustrating,'' receiver Curtis Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   Their seemingly inevitable trek to another offseason of
rebuilding has frustrated and angered many players, fans and media
members. No. 1 draft choice Curtis Enis is out for the year with a
knee injury. Quarterback Erik Kramer is sidelined, too. Most
significantly, the Bears seem to lack the desire to reverse course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing, it's exhausting, it's disgusting,'' tackle
Jim Flanigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago had won three of four going into its bye week and was
feeling good about itself. Now, Bears fans and the media are
questioning the team's commitment after a catastrophic 24-3 defeat
to the 3-7 Lions on national television Sunday night. They dropped
to 3-7, with no relief in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough mentally on all of us,'' cornerback Walt Harris
said. ``Once you start losing and continue to lose, it becomes a
grind on your mind. It affects you. You just try to hold on and
turn the season around in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, he said ``years,'' although he meant ``games.'' Just
another indication of how losing has affected the players.
</P>
<P>
   In their Sunday loss to the Lions, the Bears were called for
nine penalties and managed just two plays over 20 yards. Also, they
allowed rookie quarterback Charlie Batch to ``look like Joe
Montana,'' defensive end Mark Thomas said. ``We made him look a lot
better than he is.''
</P>
<P>
   With Kramer out, unproven Steve Stenstrom is expected to start
at quarterback, if his bruised shoulder is OK. If not, rookie Moses
Moreno would get the call. Either way, it does not look good for
the once-proud Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time when we have to stop looking back and look
forward,'' receiver Bobby Engram said. ``(But) I'm not going to lie
to you _ 3-7 is hard to swallow.

 &HT;    Stenstrom probable Bears quarterback
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bears backup quarterback Steve Stenstrom practiced
Thursday for the first time this week, and will likely start
Sunday's game at Atlanta (8-2).
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (3-7) almost certainly will be without starting
quarterback Erik Kramer for the third game in a row. Doctors can't
find a tear, but he has symptoms that sound like he has a damaged
rotator cuff, and he also has shoulder tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dave Wannstedt said Kramer, who did not practice, will be
the No. 3 quarterback Sunday, and rookie Moses Moreno will be the
backup.
</P>
<P>
   Stenstrom, a fourth-year veteran from Stanford, came into the
season with a career passer rating of 61.1. The 6-foot-2,
206-pounder, who is in this position only because the Bears waived
Rick Mirer before the season, has completed 28-of-50 passes (56
percent) for 313 yards, one TD and one interception _ good for a
73.2 rating.
</P>
<P>
   Stenstrom's not gifted at any one thing, is considered slow to
read defenses, and is therefore susceptible to defensive schemes
that mix in a lot of coverages.
</P>
<P>
   He did not practice Wedneday with sore muscles in his
non-throwing shoulder and chest after last Sunday's 26-3 loss to
the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Also for the Bears, starting tailback Edgar Bennett, who had
back spasms Wednesday, practiced Thursday and will start, Wannstedt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson returns
</P>
<P>
   Falcon RB Jamal Anderson practiced Thursday after being held out
Wednesday, and although he never really pushed himself or made any
hard cuts on his sprained left ankle, he said, ''I've got two more
days, and I think it will be 100 percent by Sunday.''... Tim Dwight
practiced for the second straight day after missing more than three
weeks with a strained medial collateral ligament in his knee. ''I
feel fine,'' said the rookie who is third in the NFC with a
26.5-yard kickoff return average. ''It catches once in a while, but
I think that helps it. I'm ready to go, but it's up to (coach Dan
Reeves).'' Reeves is probably going to be cautious. ''I think
because of the position he plays, we may want to give it more time.
We won't decide (any earlier than today),'' he said. ... Cornerback
Ronnie Bradford, who hasn't played defense since straining a medial
collateral knee ligament Oct. 25 against the Jets, will play
Sunday, likely in the nickel and dime defenses. If his replacement,
second-year cornerback Michael Booker, were playing this year as
poorly as he did when he replaced the injured Bradford for a few
games last season, coaches might rush Bradford back into the
lineup.... Safety Chris Bayne, who missed last Sunday's game with a
strained hamstring, is practicing.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the Falcons
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt is using the Falcons as an example. When he was going
over film with his team, he told players, ''They were 2-8 (last
year). If it happened for them, it can happen for us. We just have
to continue to work hard and stay together. That's what the Falcons
have done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears have games remaining against Tampa Bay (4-6), at
Minnesota (9-1), at Green Bay (7-3), against Baltimore (3-7), and
against Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to problem injuries to Kramer, who was the Falcons
quarterback for the three strike games of 1987 and whom Reeves
tried to sign as a backup last season, Chicago has six players out
for the season on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   First-round draft choice Curtis Enis, a running back, tore the
anterior cruciate ligament in his knee. Also on injured reserve:
defensive tackle Ken Anderson, cornerback Tom Carter, safety John
Mangum, punter Todd Sauerbrun (who was leading the NFL with nearly
a 50-yard average), and fullback Tim Tindale.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt, who is taking a lot of heat in Chicago after going
7-9 and 4-12 the last two seasons, is bummed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most discouraging thing over the last three years is not
having the opportunity to line up our best players and see if we're
good enough,'' he
</P>
<P>
   said. ''I felt we had an opportunity to make some headway this
season, but a couple of injuries have kind of slowed it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright spot
</P>
<P>
   Chicago rookie free safety Tony Parrish, the team's second-round
draft choice out of Washington, has been one of the highlights. The
5-10, 206-pounder is third on the team with 74 tackles (trailing
middle linebacker Barry Minter, 91, and strong safety Marty Carter,
92), leads the team with four forced fumbles and has recovered two.
</P>
<P>
   Not-so-bright spot
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason both safeties have so many tackles. The Bears
are ranked No. 26 in the NFL against the run, giving up 134.4 yards
per game. Their pass defense is ranked No. 9, allowing just 186.6
yards per game. Part of that is because teams don't need to throw
much on Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which has the NFL's No. 2 run defense, allowing just
76.5 yards per game, has the No. 30 pass defense, allowing 247.2
yards. But the Falcons have faced more passes (365) than any other
team, and given up the second-most completions (211) _ a 57.8
completion percentage. By contrast, the Bears have faced just 271
passes, allowing 173 completions (63.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Honor roll
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ray Buchanan was named NFC Defensive Player of the
Week after tying middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle for team honors
with eight tackles, one pass defense, and a 34-yard interception
return to set up a TD.

<P>
   One is always anxious when a dear friend has major surgery. Did
the doctors make the correct diagnosis? What if the scalpel slips?
After recuperation, will the patient have the same old zest, or
will the cure prove worse than any minor ailments it was supposed
to remedy?
</P>
<P>
   This year, those of us who've enjoyed the company of BMW's
vibrant 3-Series have spent some apprehensive time in the waiting
room while the car surgeons probed and sliced and sutured. Over
seven years, the last 3-Series established itself as the world's
pre-eminent sport sedan, a car of relatively modest price and
extraordinary poise.
</P>
<P>
   So what if it was a little cramped and austere? Were its
imperfections serious enough to warrant the risks of a redesign?
Would the new Bimmer emerge with plusher seats but a broken spirit?
</P>
<P>
   The bandages are off now, and two sedans, the first of the
next-generation 3-Series, are on sale. Enthusiasts' worries were
unfounded; the operation was a success.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 is more refined, and it mimics the bigger 5-Series in
its features, interior design and appearance. BMW has made
top-to-bottom changes including a new body and a couple of updated
engines, but it has left intact the car's character _ serious but
fun, solid but spritely. The 3-Series has grown up, and if it has
lost some adolescent spunk, it has gained a measure of maturity. It
feels different, but not degraded.
</P>
<P>
   With 30-some variations sold around the world, the redesign is
being phased in. The first to be remade were the sedans; they are
the only all-new '99 models. Coupes will be redone next year and
convertibles in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   BMW is eliminating four-cylinder engines in the American market,
and it has replaced the 318i with the new 323i, powered by a
2.5-liter six. Both that engine and the 328's 2.8-liter six now
have lighter aluminum blocks, and they have variable valve timing,
a bit of wizardry that improves power and economy.
</P>
<P>
   Both have slightly more horsepower and more torque at lower
speeds where it can be put to good use. A new five-speed automatic
transmission is also available.
</P>
<P>
   Some things have not changed. The engines are in-line designs,
valued for their smoothness and simplicity, not the V6s that most
companies _ including BMW's archrival, Mercedes-Benz _ have
switched to (the shorter V6s allow space to be used more
efficiently). And all 3-Series still have the rear-drive layout
that BMW treats practically as a religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good to separate the steering from the wheels that
put the power on the street,'' Wieland Bruch, a BMW spokesman,
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sedan has grown, the wheelbase by an inch, the entire car by
1.5 inches. It is slightly wider, and the opposing wheels are
farther apart for better cornering. But when BMW boasts that
``there is absolutely no flab,'' it is not kidding.
</P>
<P>
   The styling is familiar, but freshened. The reverse cant of the
rear roofline, coupled with the forward-sloping outline of the rear
doors, give the sedan a thrusting look. The wheel arches are more
prominent, and the front wheels are about as far forward as they
can go. The round headlamps are even more prominent behind clear
covers, with cutouts calling attention to the shape.
</P>
<P>
   The test car, a fern-green 328i with the sport package _ it
includes a lowered suspension and 7-spoke, 17-inch wheels _ looked
aggressive but also tastefully restrained.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-Series' body structure, already strong, is even more
rigid. High-strength steel accounts for half of the body weight, up
from 4.5 percent, and the body is nearly twice as resistant to
twisting.
</P>
<P>
   The handling is still superb, thanks to the rigidity and the
perfect weight distribution, half over each axle. The wheels track
flawlessly with no drifting, and the car feels glued to pavement.
Steering effort is light _ perhaps a bit too light _ but the driver
gets plenty of feedback.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With the sport suspension and big tires, the ride was jumpy, and
there was more wind noise than one might expect. In terms of quiet,
this is no Lexus, and I'd rather have more engine hum and less wind
rush.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the rear seat is slightly more spacious, and it is
accommodating, in a cozy way, for a couple of adults. A few
features once conspicuous by their absence have been added: the
formerly fixed-in-place steering wheel now tilts and telescopes,
and there are controls on the wheel for the stereo, cruise control
and phone.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument panel, less oriented toward the driver, is more
like the 5-Series'. A single-CD player now fits in the audio panel,
which is more horizontal. The doors and dashboard have accents of
myrtle wood, aluminum-look plastic or an odd high-gloss plastic,
depending on equipment level.
</P>
<P>
   The test car's leather sport seats were up to BMW's high
standards: firm enough to stave off fatigue and bolstered to hold
one in place through aggressive cornering. Adjustable thigh
supports accommodate legs of various lengths.
</P>
<P>
   New safety features include head-protection bags that inflate
out of the roof. There are also side-impact bags in the front
doors; rear-seat bags are optional ($385).
</P>
<P>
   The best safety features, of course, are the ones that keep you
from having a crash. Take the excellent brakes, with ventilated
disks front and rear. A new system regulates the braking pressure
between front and rear wheels, and a cornering brake control helps
to keep the car stable if the brakes are applied during cornering _
a weight-shifting move that can send a rear-drive car into a spin.
</P>
<P>
   The 328i has a lot of thoughtful touches that aren't immediately
apparent. All four windows raise or lower at one touch, and the
rear windows retract completely. Each key remembers its user's
seat, climate-control and radio preferences.
</P>
<P>
   The windows and sunroof can be closed from outside, using the
key in the lock. The hood's safety release pops out when the inside
release is pulled, eliminating the need to fumble for it. Central
locking seals the doors, fuel door and trunk. There is a
rechargeable flashlight, first-aid supplies and a tool kit.
</P>
<P>
   Options include a parking distance control that measures the
distance to objects behind the car, a boon when parking.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints are hard to come by. The lock button is inconvenient
on the center console. Even with its latest dressing-up, the
purposeful interior may strike some people as too plain for the
price. Back-seat passengers are pretty much ignored, with no air
vents or cup holders. Last year's dual-zone temperature settings
are gone, a victim of cost-cutting. And the radio has lost a handy
button that called up weather broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the main criticism is one that carries over: The price.
The 3-Series is more of a sport sedan (like the Audi A4 or perhaps
the Saab 9-3) than an ``entry luxury'' car (like the Lexus ES 300
and a host of others), but that distinction is often lost on
comparison shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Given that a very nice and fully equipped car like the Acura
3.2TL runs just $28,000, the 328i, starting at $33,970, may not
seem like a great value. (The test car, lacking a sunroof or CD
player, had a sticker of $37,245; fully equipped, the 328i
approaches $43,000.) Even the A4 with a V6, which starts at less
than $29,000, includes items optional on the 328i _ a power
sunroof, wood trim, folding rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   The 323i offers a compromise. For $26,970, it offers most of its
sibling's performance and style at a considerable discount. But
here, too, some pretty basic items _ cruise control, center armrest
_ cost extra.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-Series' last redesign, for the '92 model year, was a great
leap; the latest revamping is evolutionary. Still, there is nothing
quite like the 3-Series, with its compact size; its balanced
rear-drive layout; its optimal weight distribution; its solid,
purposeful design. And that is as true now, after a thorough
revamping, as it was before.

 &HT;    Sosa officially `The Man'
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Deep into the summer and beyond, Sammy Sosa argued
with that not he but home run rival Mark McGwire was ''The Man'' as
the two slugged their way through the most epic home run race in
baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Baseball Writers's Association of America begged
to differ for the last time, voting Chicago's Sosa the National
League's most valuable player in a runaway over McGwire. Drawing 30
of 32 first-place votes, Sosa found that 66 homers and a
league-leading 158 RBI count for something.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never considered myself to be 'The Man','' Sosa said, ''but
I considered myself a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Moises Alou, the only other player named on all
ballots, finished third while San Diego slugger Greg Vaughn was
fourth. The Braves placed two players in the top 10, first baseman
Andres Galarraga placing sixth and third baseman Chipper Jones
finishing ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa became only the second player from the Dominican Republic
to win the MVP, joining George Bell who won the award for Toronto
in 1987. For the first time ever, the BBWAA voted two Latin
American-born players as MVPs, Sosa joining Texas' Juan Gonzalez, a
native Puerto Rican who began his career with Sosa in the Rangers'
Gulf Coast League affiliate in 1986. The NL had not had a Latin MVP
since Orlando Cepeda in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ''I put everything together _ played hard as a team player, as a
team leader,'' Sosa said. ''I took everything in my hands and did
everything correctly. Maybe I can do it again. I have a feeling
that I can come back and do everything I did in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was voted second on 20 ballots and third on three
others. His two first-place votes both came from St. Louis-based
writers. The vote was surely swayed by how each players' team
fared, the Cardinals finishing 19 games behind NL Central Division
Houston while the Cubs made the playoffs for the first time since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Their comraderie was just as remarkable as their competition,
even as the baseball press and the game itself received criticism
for overplaying McGwire while underplaying Sosa's accomplishments.
The Chicago right fielder shrugged it off then and, in a telling
comment Thursday, restated their funky friendship when asked if he
had talked with McGwire about the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Mentioning McGwire was vacationing in Australia, Sosa said, ''I
want to make a phone call but they don't accept collect calls over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   As special as his season was, Sosa's dedication to his country
excelled it, after the Dominican was ravaged by hurricane Georges.
Sosa was to be on a 6 a.m. flight today to return there to resume
relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of people suffering in my country,'' he said.
''I don't have a lot of time to celebrate right now.''

 &HT;    Scott facing West, likely near sharing his fate
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This was Tuesday, the day before Tommy West's future
grew considerably dimmer, and shorter. The Clemson coach was asked
about the state of college football in the state of South Carolina.
With Clemson (2-8) and South Carolina (1-9) having taken such
simultaneous falls from grace, the Palmetto State is one contiguous
low country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really strange,'' said West. ``Never happened before.
Been a crazy year. You look at us, and them, and even the
(Carolina) Panthers, too. I know with us, anything that can go
wrong has. You think nothing else can. And then it does.''
</P>
<P>
   It went bad-wrong for West Wednesday, when he was fired with
three years left on his contract and one game left in his fifth
season: Saturday night's traditional Death Valley bloodletting with
archrival South Carolina, whose coach is nearly as embattled _ and
perhaps imperiled _ as West.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, The Game (6:30 p.m., ESPN2) has become secondary. More
pressing is whether Brad Scott will survive as South Carolina's
coach. If not, who'll succeed him? And more immediate, will West's
replacement hold the promise of the future (Tommy Bowden) or the
past (Danny Ford)?
</P>
<P>
   Those are Clemson's two leading candidates, and factions. Bowden
is this year's Gary Barnett, having taken Tulane to a 9-0 record
and No. 12 ranking. Clemson athletics director Bobby Robinson _ who
hired West in 1993, then fired him Wednesday _ reportedly spoke
last week with Cincinnati athletics director Bob Goin, an associate
AD at FSU from 1981 to 1991 when Bowden was an assistant coach to
his father, Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the elder Bowden dismissed the notion that
his son wouldn't want to coach in the ACC and compete against his
father. That heartened a large contingent of influential Clemson
alumni, IPTAY boosters and some trustees who favor hiring Bowden.
But with Tulane playing Houston Saturday and Louisiana Tech on
Thanksgiving, Bowden _ who has also been mentioned as a successor
to Scott _ likely won't make any decision until after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also considerable sentiment at Clemson for Ford,
who coached the Tigers from 1978 to 1989, went 96-29-4 and won the
school's only national championship. The football program also went
on probation twice, however, before Robinson fired Ford. Yet Ford _
fired by Arkansas after last season and now back living on his
Pendleton farm near Clemson _ has a strong Clemson constituency who
favor his return. Earlier this week, before West was fired,
innuendo even had Ford _ who was in Death Valley when Clemson lost
to Georgia Tech last week _ having reached an agreement two weeks
ago to succeed West.
</P>
<P>
   As for turning back the clock at Clemson, though, listen to
West, shortly after his firing: ``There was a lot of success here
in the '80s. I don't think it's wrong to want to have that success.
But the game has changed a lot since the '80s. The parity in this
game, it's here. I don't know if fans anywhere realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemson fans realized this: The Tigers are one loss away from
their worst finish since 1975. That such calamity occurred in
West's fifth season sealed his fate. Perhaps it will Scott's, too:
This is his fifth season at South Carolina. Going 2-9, even 1-10,
is acceptable in the first year or two. Not in the fifth, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't able to win the close games,'' said Scott, 23-32-1
with the Gamecocks (West is 30-28). ``We have a lot of youth and we
turned the ball over a lot more (25 times, to 13 for opponents)
than in previous seasons. But we were in our share of ballgames and
didn't win a single one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are rather damning for Scott. Yes, he did lead South
Carolina to a 7-5 record in 1994, including the only bowl win in
school history. Attendance soared in 1996-97. But after beating
Ball State in this year's opener, the Gamecocks have lost a
school-record nine straight. That included a home loss to I-AA
Marshall, later a disastrous 17-14 loss at Vanderbilt, which had
lost 22 straight SEC games.
</P>
<P>
   In Scott's five seasons, South Carolina is 13-26-1 in SEC play.
Against teams that finished seasons with winning records, the
Gamecocks are just 2-28-1 in that span.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Vanderbilt debacle, however, that has put Scott's job
in jeopardy. Yet after Saturday's finale, Scott expects to meet, as
usual, with athletics director Mike McGee early next week for their
annual end-of-season review of the program.

   ``Mike's given me great support,'' said Scott, who understands
his predicament. ``He's an old football coach, been through similar
situations in the past. We'll sit down next week and evaluate our
football program after five years, and evaluate the future.

 &HT;    FSU backup Outzen doesn't back down
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ With a sprig of red hair that sticks up in
front, his nickname, of course, is Rooster. As in bantam. As in
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Put Marcus Outzen in the ring, his friends say, and he isn't
going to back down. It doesn't matter how big the guy in the other
corner might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever shortcomings other people might think Marcus has,''
Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said, ``he has never lacked for
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good, because the sophomore quarterback will need all the
confidence and moxie he can muster Saturday when he faces the
biggest challenge of his football career: leading No. 5 Florida
State against No. 4 Florida (3:30 p.m., ABC) in a game that still
has implications for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen, 6 feet 2, 220 pounds,was thrust into the role Nov. 7,
when starter Chris Weinke suffered a season-ending neck injury
against Virginia. Outzen came off the bench in the second half of
that game to lead a 45-14 victory. Last week against Wake Forest,
he got his first start and had some modest success, throwing for
164 yards in a 24-7 win.
</P>
<P>
   But all parties _ Outzen included _ agree that it was not the
kind of performance required for the Seminoles to beat the Gators
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing OK; he just needs experience,'' Bowden said. ``I'm
just glad we had a game before this one so he could get his feet
wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Outzen said his ability to move gives him an advantage Weinke
would not have had against Florida's quick defensive front.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can throw any route in this offense, just like Weinke, of
course,'' Outzen said. ``The only thing I add is the ability to run
and to make a big play out of a broken play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles probably won't score a lot of points against
Florida and can't afford to give any away. In that respect, Bowden
said, the young quarterback might need to be reined in a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I can't let him do is get in over his head,'' the
coach said. ``A big game like this usually comes down to turnovers,
and as coaches we have to be aware of that. ``
</P>
<P>
   But if Outzen were afraid of challenges, he wouldn't be at
Florida State. He had been a Florida State fan since age 10 when he
met Bowden at a booster gathering in Destin. Former Seminole
quarterback Casey Weldon was his hero. He never thought of going
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen thought he would serve an apprenticeship behind Thad
Busby and then Dan Kendra. But in 1997, Weinke came back to college
after spending six years playing baseball. And in February, Florida
State signed Jared Jones, a Parade All-American.
</P>
<P>
   He thought about transferring after last season, but Bowden
talked him out of it. His advice: Be patient. You never know what
might happen.
</P>
<P>
   Busby graduated. Kendra suffered a knee injury in the spring and
was lost for the season. Weinke won the starting job but got hurt
against Virginia. Suddenly, in his third year, Outzen is the
starting quarterback against Florida in what is easily the biggest
game of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've done pretty (well) for the opportunities I've
had,'' Outzen said. ``I can't be too shocked and let this thing get
away from me. I believe that things happen for a reason. All I have
ever really wanted was a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, he will get that chance. The whole state of Florida
_ and a good chunk of the country _ will be watching.

 &HT;    Despite tough times, Dogs' defense decent
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ With apologies to songstress Joni Mitchell, Rich
Robich is a football player who has seen ``Both Sides Now'' _ in
more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman, the Georgia rush end was an Ole Miss Rebel
playing in a losing cause at Sanford Stadium. Now, as a Bulldog, he
has beaten the Rebels at Oxford and Saturday has a chance to do the
same in Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But Robich and his defensive teammates have also seen both sides
of the game this year _ making brilliant goal-line stands (South
Carolina), tackling poorly (Kentucky and others) and getting
dumbfounded for a quarter (Florida.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to talk about any negatives about our
defense,'' Robich said. ``I honestly don't feel like we have a lot
of negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Bulldog nation would be quick to dispute Robich. And
while head coach Jim Donnan agrees there have been some lapses, he
quickly points out a defense for his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you one thing about our defense,'' Donnan said.
``They have been good throughout the year at responding to the
sudden change _ when the offense turned the ball over (South
Carolina) or like the blocked kick (Auburn). And when you consider
(that) both offense and defense (have) been hurt by our lack of a
solid kicking game (both punting and kickoffs), they have played
with poor field position all year. ``
</P>
<P>
   Despite the field position, Georgia's defense has done a good
job of ``keeping the other team out of the end zone,'' Donnan said.
``We haven't given up big plays, except against Florida. We haven't
been as good on third down as I'd like, and we haven't created
turnovers. We have done a good job at stopping the run, even though
people are running more plays on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams have been getting more plays on the Bulldogs for two
reasons, he said: The Bulldogs haven't stopped teams on third down
as much as he expected, and the Georgia offense hasn't picked up
the first downs with the consistency he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Now come the Rebels, a team that has the confidence to gamble _
going for, and getting, a fourth-and-1 against LSU in a 37-31 OT
win _ and the players to make big plays. Quarterback Romaro Miller
and running backs Deuce McAllister (6-2, 215) and Joe Gunn (5-10,
196) have combined for more than 3,500 yards and 22 touchdowns this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have earned the right to be confident,'' Donnan said.
``They have exceeded their expectations. Miller is a versatile
athlete, and McAllister is a big back who can break tackles. And
Gunn is a good back, too. They concern me.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Joe Kines, who has received his share of
criticism this season, has coached from the field and from the
press box.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make football as complicated as you want to,'' Kines
said, ``but it still comes down to getting off the block and making
a tackle. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said, ``This team is very versatile and talented.
McAllister is an excellent back, a quality back and Miller is
talented. ... To me, the key, as it has been all year, is get off
the blocks and try to hem up (the running backs). We have to stop
their running game and pressure the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Adrian Hollingshed, while conceding that the
defense has ``had some tough times this season,'' said because of
the Ole Miss attack, the game ``should be fun and a challenge. We
can't let (McAllister) get into the secondary. If he does, there
could be problems. We have to tackle well and stay low against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a special game to me,'' the former Rebel, Robich,
said. ``To put on the red and black and play for the Georgia
Bulldogs. I have high expectations. I have had them all year. We
need to take care of these next two games and get to a good bowl.

 &HT;    Vikings have kept Packers on ice at Metrodome
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ He has never met the governor-elect of Minnesota,
but if Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren lived here, he, too, might
have voted for Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   The former professional-wrestler-turned-politician opposes the
use of public funds for a new stadium, a stance that could force
Vikings owner Red McCombs to relocate the franchise to San Antonio.
A loser in five of his previous six visits to the Metrodome,
Holmgren might not mind seeing the place turned into a flea market.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of last year, that's been a house of
horrors for us,'' Holmgren said. ``Even when they didn't have the
kind of talent they've got now, the Vikings played us tough
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the top game of the week, the Vikings can all but relegate
the Packers' playoff aspirations to the wild-card variety.
Minnesota will clinch a postseason berth with a win over Green Bay
and with a loss by either Arizona or New Orleans. A Packers defeat
would leave the two-time defending NFC champions two games behind
in the NFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikes stunned the Packers earlier this season when
quarterback Randall Cunningham threw for 442 yards and four
touchdowns in a 37-24 victory. Although Cunningham is bothered by a
balky knee that required arthroscopic surgery just 11 days ago,
Minnesota's collection of big-play, skill position performers might
be unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the NFL bests for this weekend:
</P>
<P>
   _ Upset opportunity: The home team has won all six previous
Pittsburgh-Jacksonville meetings, but that streak will stop Sunday.
The Steelers don't have enough offense to hang with the Jaguars,
who will rely more on the passing game than on rookie tailback Fred
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual matchup: Give the Cardinals credit for identifying
wide receiver Frank Sanders as an essential player and keeping him
from free agency with a contract extension last year. Sanders is
among the NFL's hottest players, and his battle with Washington
cornerback Darrell Green will be worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fantasy play: In the last 15 quarters, the Chicago defense has
surrendered 13 drives of 50-plus yards, all for a minimum of seven
plays. Although the team has played hard for coach Dave Wannstedt,
it is no match for the Falcons. Jamal Anderson will pound at a
front seven that hasn't stopped the run much lately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grudge match: It's time again for the twice-annual Mike
Shanahan-Al Davis blood feud. The Raiders owner fired Shanahan in
'89, and the Broncos coach will never forgive him. Against an
Oakland secondary missing cornerback Eric Allen, look for the
Broncos to pour it on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Division game: The Miami defense is quick and physical. New
England is fighting for its playoff life. There will be plenty of
bile and lots of train wrecks in Monday's game.

 &HT;    Season opens to warm reviews
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Weather so cold the air crackles; a steady rattling of
sleet on marsh grass; feet numb up to the knees. A duck hunter's
idea of perfection.
</P>
<P>
   But the way it looks now, conditions won't be anywhere close to
perfect when waterfowl hunting season opens in Georgia on Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The weather report calls for a low of 37 and a high of 56.
That's not bad for deer hunting, but there probably won't be a lot
of ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cold front they're having in the Midwest might drive some
of the big ducks down,'' said Atlantan Gary Merriman, proprietor of
the Fish Hawk in Buckhead. Before the migration is over, some 84
million ducks will have passed through Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Merriman, like most of Georgia's 16,000 waterfowl hunters, will
be hunting ``little'' ducks _ wood ducks _ opening day instead of
mallards or other big migratory fowl.
</P>
<P>
   The hunters will be on rivers and creeks, in blinds or maybe
floating along in canoes or on beaver ponds early in the morning,
waiting for a few woodies to skim in over the treetops.
</P>
<P>
   Or they'll be on one of the state's big reservoirs, such as
waterfowl-rich Lake Seminole, or maybe trying their luck at Lake
Lanier, where duck season is open for the first time in years.
</P>
<P>
   Waterfowl season runs through Jan. 19, and Canada goose season
through Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lake Lanier and Lake Oconee have special regulations to
ensure the safety of other lake-users.
</P>
<P>
   On Lake Lanier, no hunting is allowed within 1,000 feet of a
dock, house, structure, bridge, road, boat ramp, marina or open
recreation area, and waterfowl hunting is allowed only in certain
closed campgrounds and certain closed portions of some day-use
recreation areas.
</P>
<P>
   On Lake Oconee, no hunting is allowed within 300 feet of any
dock, house, boat ramp or other facility.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state is between major flyways, hunting should be
as good as last year, when hunters bagged an average of 8.4 ducks,
according to the Wildlife Resources Division of the Georgia
Department of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks
</P>
<P>
   _ Season: Saturday-Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit: Six (12 in possession).
</P>
<P>
   _ Hours: Half an hour before sunrise to sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Geese
</P>
<P>
   _ Season: Saturday-Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit: Two (four in possession).
</P>
<P>
   _ Hours: Half an hour before sunrise to sunset.
</P>
<P>
   _ License requirements for both: Georgia hunting license,
Federal Duck Stamp, Georgia Waterfowl License, Migratory Bird
Harvest Information Program Stamp, Migratory Bird Hunting and
Conservation Stamp.

<P>
   A warning to mutual fund investors who may already be struggling
through a tough year: You won't really know how bad it is until you
receive your funds' year-end capital gains distributions.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a fund may have racked up major losses this year, it
is required to distribute any realized capital gains, on which
investors will owe taxes. This year, the stars are aligned to make
those distributions whoppers for many funds.
</P>
<P>
   Why? In difficult market times, investors are wont to yank money
from a struggling fund, forcing it to sell appreciated stocks to
meet redemptions. Thanks to past years' bull-market returns, gains
on those shares may be particularly big.
</P>
<P>
   The question, of course, is which funds will be making big
distributions as the year winds down. Many funds, fearing a further
exodus, won't alert investors.
</P>
<P>
   But some have already reported: Templeton Growth recently made
an 11 percent capital gains distribution, though it lost nearly 16
percent for the 12 months through Sept. 30. And the MFS Managed
Sectors fund plans a 14 percent distribution despite its loss of 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   To compile a list of funds that are likely to make large
distributions, Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher,
looked at two factors: Does the fund have big potential capital
gains exposure, and has it seen the cash outflows that are likely
to prompt securities sales?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody has identified the precise formula for
determining the precise distribution,'' said John A. Rekenthaler,
Morningstar's research director. ``These are good candidates,
however.''
</P>
<P>
   Before buying a fund that is likely to make a big distribution,
it may be wise to ask when it intends to do so. If you already own
such a fund, one option is to sell the fund before the distribution
and then pop back in afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who want to lock in a tax loss, however, will have to
wait 31 days. The ``wash sales rule'' of the Internal Revenue
Service holds that if you buy back shares any sooner, you must
defer the deduction of your loss.
</P>
<P>
   A better approach may be to sell a fund before a distribution
and immediately buy a similar one that has already made its
payment. That way, if the market surges in the next month, you
won't miss out.

COMMENTARY: JUST A BUMP IN CAPITALISM'S LONG ROAD  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 22)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ This does not seem to be free enterprise's
finest hour.
</P>
<P>
   Asian economies that were once vibrant have collapsed, sending
millions of people who had pulled themselves up toward the middle
class back into a struggle for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's movement toward democratic capitalism is in shambles.
Even the world's biggest and strongest economies are at risk from
the global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed fair to ask Milton Friedman, the iconic advocate of
free markets, if the free-enterprise system had not proved
inadequate in this era of interconnected financial systems and
contagion by microchip.
</P>
<P>
   His reply was that the problems in most countries were a result
of bad policy at home and bad advice from the International
Monetary Fund, not any failure of the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Friedman, whose libertarianism left him on the fringes
of the mainstream starting in the New Deal and for decades
afterward, was not conceding anything in the growing debate over
whether the turmoil has exposed the limits of markets as a force
for prosperity, democracy and stability.
</P>
<P>
   Now 86, and as willing as ever to argue his cause in an
interview, he was typically provocative about the interplay between
ideology and the real world.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from the global crisis, he said, would inevitably
create some setbacks in what he sees as a slow but inexorable
movement toward less government involvement in the economy and
greater individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are again debating the merits of controls on capital,
and some countries, including the United States, are hinting that
they might raise trade barriers to protect domestic industries from
the ravages of a tumultuous global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a tendency when things go wrong to blame the
private market,'' said Friedman, who won the Nobel Prize in
economics in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that you've had these difficulties, there's no doubt
there will be backsliding,'' he said in his office at Stanford
University's Hoover Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of global crisis, however, is largely overblown, he
said, noting that the United States and Western Europe remain in
sound economic health.
</P>
<P>
   But in a broader sense, Friedman said, we are at a historical
turning point, when a gradual acceptance of free-market principles
on a philosophical level is beginning to translate into a
fundamental movement toward market-oriented policies, institutions
and politics. The implications for policy could be profound, he
said, ranging from lower taxes to exposing public schools to
greater competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my impression that you have long cycles of public opinion
on the one hand and public behavior on the other,'' Friedman said.
He cited the long delay between Adam Smith's ``The Wealth of
Nations,'' published in 1776, and Britain's move to repeal the Corn
Laws and go on to free trade.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, although the Fabian Society was formed in the
1880s, ``it was not until just before World War I that Britain
started down the road to the welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case for free markets and market economies, right after
World War II, was held by only a very small minority, who were
looked upon as reactionaries of the worst kind,'' Friedman said.
``In the period since then, the case for free markets has been won
rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody now believes in competition, believes in freedom,
believes that governments should have a relatively minor role and
that markets should be relatively free. That's the rhetoric, and
it's reached a peak since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, if you look at the practice, in the United
States and also most other Western countries, government is more
powerful, more extensive, more intrusive now than it was 50 years
ago. In that sense we have moved backward and been following the
prior socialist trend of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are sort of at the peak of the collectivist way,''
he continued, ``Over the next 20, 30 or 40 years, the rhetoric,
combined with the remarkable effects the Internet, is going to have
on our lives, will produce a decline in the role of government and
a widening of human freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it makes it harder to collect taxes,'' Friedman said,
referring to the difficulty of defining where a transaction takes
place when it occurs in cyberspace. ``Governments can get funds
fundamentally only from resources that find it difficult to move
elsewhere. The greater the freedom of movement of capital and
people, the harder it is for governments. That's the kind of
external force that is adding to what's coming from the
intellectual tide of opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now, though, is whether the crisis set off last
year in Asia will turn the tide again. As Friedman suggests,
history can be slow to render its judgment.

PLENTY OF COMEBACK HORSES BUT NO AWARD

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Racing hands out as many awards as the next
sport, but there's no Comeback Horse of the Year Award.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? There'd always be plenty of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   This season's competition would have ended when Da Hoss won the
Breeders' Cup Mile in only his second start since taking the same
race in 1996. Michael Dickinson's training job can be compared to
Charlie Whittingham's in preparing Cougar II to win the 1973 Santa
Anita Handicap after a four-month layoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really amazing,'' trainer Craig Dollase said of
Dickinson's feat, ``just seeing how patient he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Other notable comebacks this year include Belle's Flag, winning
the California Cup Matron five months after getting hurt at
Hollywood; and Big Jag, making the Cal Cup Sprint one of four
straight wins following an 18-month break. None is likely to match
Da Hoss, but with the Breeders' Cup over and the rich Santa Anita
and Gulfstream Park winter meets ahead, lots of top horses are
making comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Dollase's 7-year-old Dramatic Gold, best known for
finishing third in the 1994 Breeders' Cup Classic, ran a tough
second in a $60,000 allowance race at Hollywood Park in his first
start since foot and back injuries in February.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, 3-year-old Artax, once thought to be California's best
Kentucky Derby hope, runs in an optional claiming race at
Hollywood, his first outing since suffering knee and shin injuries
while finishing 13th in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at (workouts), he's doing well,'' trainer Randy
Bradshaw said. ``But works and races are two different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Others from the 1998 Triple Crown trail who plan comebacks soon:
Event of the Year, shooting for the Dec. 26 Malibu at Santa Anita;
Hanuman Highway, Classic Cat, Orville N Wilbur's and Derby and
Preakness winner Real Quiet, who is in Kentucky with an uncertain
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Older horses on the way back include 1998 Santa Anita Handicap
winner Malek and 1996 Santa Anita Derby winner Cavonnier. The
latter had aimed for last month's Cal Cup Classic and then Sunday's
On Trust Handicap but will wait for Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: Bob Baffert trains the top two in Saturday's
Prevue Stakes for 2-year-olds. Premier Property won the Sunny Slope
at Santa Anita and hasn't trailed in two starts; David Flores rides
for Indian Charlie owner Hal Earnhardt. American Spirit is coming
off a maiden win; Gary Stevens rides.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert won the Prevue the past two years with In Excessive Bull
and Commitisize.
</P>
<P>
   Big Jag is expected to head Sunday's On Trust Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   __ It's a festival: Not even those who tire of racing by this
time of year can ignore the Hollywood Park autumn meet. The reason
is the annual Thanksgiving-week Turf Festival that draws top grass
horses at a time when lawns across the nation are turning brown.
</P>
<P>
   More than $2 million in purses are at stake in the six-race
festival next Friday, Nov. 27; Saturday, Nov. 28, and Sunday, Nov.
29.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule:
</P>
<P>
   Day 1: The Hollywood Turf Express for sprinters and the Miesque
Stakes for 2-year-old fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Day 2: The Citation Handicap and the Generous Stakes for
2-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Day 3: The Matriarch for fillies and mares and the Hollywood
Derby for 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Neil Drysdale could dominate. He'll send likely
turf-females champion Fiji and Diamond on the Run against Auntie
Mame in the $700,000 Matriarch; Dr Fong against Ladies Din in the
$500,000 Derby; Hawksley Hill in the Citation; and Bodyguard in the
Turf Express.
</P>
<P>
   __ How's that again?: Frankie Dettori, who nearly rode Swain
into the Churchill Downs grandstand in the final furlong of the
Breeders' Cup Classic, has explained that he was trying to avoid
racing side by side with the tenacious Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the jockeys' room before the race, one of the riders told
me that you can't beat Silver Charm in a head-to-head, so I decided
to go four horses wide,'' Dettori said on English television in a
statement quoted by the Daily Racing Form. ``I did the best for me
and for Swain, but it did not work. That's life and it's all
forgotten now.''
</P>
<P>
   Swain finished third, a length behind winner Awesome Again and a
neck behind Silver Charm. Many think Swain would have won if he'd
run straight.
</P>
<P>
   Dettori apparently didn't defend his left-handed whipping, which
seemed to drive Swain to the outside. Instead he said Swain ``lost
a bit of concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that why horses have riders?
</P>
<P>
   __ Santos honored: Jose Santos was voted by his fellow jockeys
as the 50th winner of the George Woolf Memorial Award, which goes
to riders who bring credit to themselves and the sport.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation will be during the Santa Anita meet that starts
Dec. 26. The award is named for the rider who was killed in a 1946
accident at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being a finalist in the voting about 10 years ago,
and I was disappointed that I didn't get it,'' said Santos, a
37-year-old Chilean who rides mostly in New York. ``But it was
worth the wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Santos has ridden six Breeders' Cup races and led the nation's
jockeys in earnings each year from 1986 to '89. He rode in
California in 1991 but didn't catch on. &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
__ Hollywood Park leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Kent
Desormeaux, Garrett Gomez and Chris McCarron, 5 wins; Eddie
Delahoussaye and Alex Solis, 4. Trainers: Ron McAnally, 4; Randy
Bradshaw and Neil Drysdale, 3; several with 2.(UB)Handicapper
helper: After opening day Nov. 11, when late runners seemed to have
no chance on the Hollywood Park main track, the surface has
produced winners of all styles. Inside or outside post positions
have offered no obvious advantage. &QL; 
__ Upcoming stakes: At Hollywood Park: Saturday, $100,000 Hollywood
Prevue, 2-year-old fillies, 7 furlongs; Sunday, $100,000 On Trust

giving him 20 titles in a row at the San Mateo track. Trainer Jerry
Hollendorfer led both halves, giving him 17 straight. . . . Rider
Roberto Gonzalez might miss five or six months with multiple
fractures after a fall Saturday at Bay Meadows. Jake Barton could
miss four to six weeks with a broken arm suffered in the same
accident. . . . Gary Stevens told the Daily Racing Form he might

ALAN J. PAKULA, 70, FILM DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alan J. Pakula, a director of many psychologically
penetrating and celebrated films including ``Sophie's Choice,''
``All the President's Men'' and ``Klute,'' died Thursday in a freak
accident on the Long Island Expressway. He was 70 and had homes in
Manhattan and East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Pakula was killed when a metal pipe smashed through the
windshield of his black Volvo station wagon and struck him in the
head at 11:15 a.m., Det. Sgt. Brian Traynor, a spokesman for the
Suffolk County Police, said. The accident happened about a quarter
mile east of the Melville exit on the Long Island Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   Pakula's car swerved across a service road and hit a fence, the
police said. He was taken to North Shore University Hospital at
Plainview, in Nassau County, where he was pronounced dead at 12:22
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The police do not know where the 7-foot-long pipe came from,
Traynor said, but believe that it was already in the roadway when
another car gave it a glancing blow, sending it through Pakula's
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Pakula was on his way to his home in East Hampton to work on his
next screenplay, ``No Ordinary Time,'' about the White House during
the time of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Pakula, a tall, bearded, somewhat professorial man, produced or
directed more than 20 movies in his career, many of them richly
praised, but they had a knack for winning accolades more for his
actors than for himself. That was one of the reasons he was
occasionally referred to as an actor's director.
</P>
<P>
   He produced ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' in 1962; it won Oscars for
Gregory Peck and screenwriter Horton Foote, and it garnered three
other Academy Award nominations. A 1963 film he helped produce,
``Love With the Proper Stranger,'' won three Academy Award
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Liza Minnelli won an Oscar nomination for her role in the first
picture he directed, ``The Sterile Cuckoo,'' in 1969. In other
movies he directed, Jane Fonda won an Oscar for her starring role
as a disillusioned call girl in Pakula's moody detective thriller,
the 1971 ``Klute,'' and Meryl Streep won one of her Oscars for her
role as Sophie, a tormented Nazi concentration camp survivor, in
the 1982 ``Sophie's Choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the President's Men,'' Pakula's 1976 dramatization of how
two Washington Post reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein,
uncovered the Watergate scandal, won four Oscars: for actor Jason
Robards, for screenwriter William Goldman and for art direction and
sound. Pakula was nominated for an Oscar for ``All the President's
Men'' and for his screenplay for ``Sophie's Choice,'' but he never
won.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was incredibly supportive and would give you the courage
you needed,'' Candice Bergen said, who starred in a 1979 comedy
Pakula directed, ``Starting Over.'' ``He made it safe for me to
make a total fool of myself.'' She added that Pakula frequently
removed his shoes on the set and that when a scene seemed to work:
``You'd get a hop. The highest accolade would be to get two hops.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Ford, who had starred in Pakula's last movie, ``The
Devil's Own,'' called Pakula ``a natural guide to inner realms. As
a writer and a director, he was always concerned with evolving
emotionally. He was an elegant man.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakula made different kinds of movies, all of them intended to
entertain, but the thread connecting many of them was a style that
emphasized and explored the psychology and motivations of his
characters. The first film he produced, in 1957, was ``Fear Strikes
Out,'' starring Anthony Perkins, a study of talented but troubled
baseball star Jimmy Piersall, whose career was thwarted by his
mental illness.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pakula's interest in such issues was highlighted when one of his
stepsons, Robert Boorstin, a former reporter for The New York Times
and now an official at the U.S. Treasury Department, spoke publicly
about his depression and sought to educate the public on the
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Pakula participated in fund-raisers and spoke openly about his
stepson's battle with the disease and the impact on his own life.
</P>
<P>
   Pakula also spoke in interviews about his fascination with
psychology, with how men in particular deal with their fears. ``A
man who is in control, and inside there is a frightened child,'' he
said in an interview several years ago with The New York Times.
``That interests me. Why? You can draw your own conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   The most autobiographical film he made was ``See You in the
Morning,'' which was about a divorced man like himself, and his
marriage to a widow with several children. In fact, Pakula's second
marriage was to Hannah Boorstin, now Pakula, an author of
historical biographies whose first husband had died, leaving her
with three children. The man in the film is a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts, who appeared in his movie ``The Pelican Brief,''
said: ``He would allow you your time and the freedom to find things
in the material. He knew when to give me my space or when to
squeeze my hand. He was a psychiatrist and a director.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakula was born in the Bronx on April 7, 1928. His father was
the co-owner of a printing business. Pakula once said that the
months in between his graduation from high school and college
altered his life. He worked at the Leland Hayward Theatrical Agency
and fell in love with show business.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Yale University and majored in drama. His first job
in Hollywood was at Warner Brothers in the cartoon department. He
moved on to producing and only began directing in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Pakula's first marriage, to actress Hope Lange, ended in
divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Hannah Pakula, three
stepchildren and five grandchildren. &QL;

KEEPING COOL, WITHOUT A NET  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 22)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn.,  (Eds: The (AT) in the last graph should be replaced with the `at'
symbol.) 
(af) 
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My boss was fired, and, as his right-hand man, I have reason
to believe that I will also get my walking papers as soon as his
replacement is hired. Meanwhile, I am a manager without any sort of
contract to protect me. My media agency is small and needs me to
keep things running until the new boss arrives. Should I use this
opportunity to get a contract that promises me a severance should I
be dismissed? Or could such a request be interpreted as bad faith?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Two words: Stay calm. While the urge to scramble for legal
guarantees may be intense, avoid setting off warning bells among
the powers-that-be. Panic breeds panic, said Blaine Pardoe,
director of technology education services with Ernst &AMP; Young and
author of ``Cubicle Warfare'' (Prima Publishing, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   M. Lee Smith, a lawyer-turned-publisher whose Nashville company
specializes in employment law publications, agreed. ``Asking for a
contract might create more problems than it would solve,'' he said.
Making such a request now would arouse your employer's curiosity,
perhaps raising questions about your loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   So step back, breathe deeply and try to assess the situation
rationally. Your predicament may not be as grim as you think. You
work for a small organization, so management is probably aware of
your abilities _ assuming that you have prospered because of the
quality of your work and not because of any fawning upon your
dearly departed boss.
</P>
<P>
   What your firm may be less certain about is your willingness to
work with a new team. Thus, if you're hoping to stay with the
company, and perhaps even step into your former boss' shoes, ignore
the ax dangling above your head and throw yourself into the job
with enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Use this time to show the firm just how valuable you are,
advised Lee Miller, a human-resources executive and employment
lawyer. And if you think you could do your boss' job, let those in
charge know that you want to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't plan to hang around long, it is obviously
better not to be booted out the door before lining up another gig.
So be quiet about your job search, Pardoe warned; if word gets out,
you can kiss your current position goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Should you decide that circumstances give you enough leverage to
extract guarantees from management, tread softly. Present your
request as beneficial to everyone, Miller advised. ``Emphasize that
you are loyal and willing to stay on with a new boss,'' he said.
``Let your superiors know that you love the company but that you
are understandably concerned about your future.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, don't play hardball, Miller warned. Even if you
think the organization would collapse tomorrow without you, going
in with guns blazing, lobbing ultimatums, will only upset everyone
and probably get you fired. Some people harbor the bizarre illusion
that they are indispensable, Pardoe said. ``In the real world,'' he
said, ``everybody's replaceable.''  &QL;

   FED MINUTES SHOW CONCERN OVER PERCEPTION OF CUTS
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board decided to limit its rate cut on Sept.
29 to a quarter of a percentage point because it was worried that a
bigger reduction might exaggerate its concerns about the risks of
an economic slowdown, according to minutes of the deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   But just over two weeks later, the central bank cut interest
rates by another quarter of a point between meetings, despite
continued concern among some members of the committee that the move
would be interpreted as a signal that the central bank saw bad news
on the horizon.

   MICROSOFT ACCUSED OF LIFTING PRICES
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has kept the price of personal-computer software
significantly higher than would be expected if the company faced
real competition, an economic consultant testified at the software
giant's antitrust trial.

   LIVENT GETS $5 MILLION IN LOANS
</P>
<P>
   Some of Livent's wealthy board members came to the Broadway
theater company's rescue, lending it $5 million, enough to keep the
curtain up for 10 days. Meanwhile, the company's two founders,
Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb angrily disputed allegations
made by Livent's new managers that the two men had engaged in a
widespread corporate fraud.

   INTEL DEMAND LIFTS STOCK MARKET
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose, led by demand for Intel and MCI Worldcom. The Dow
Jones industrial average rose 14.94 points, to 9,056.05. The S&AMP;P
500 rose 8.13 points, to 1,152.61, and the Nasdaq rose 22.24
points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,919.68. In the bond market, prices
rose as the yield on the 30-year Treasury fell to 5.23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   French authorities said the Paris stock exchange would join an
alliance between London and Frankfurt, Germany, that is seen as the
precursor of a pan-European market.

   ENTERGY TO BUY NUCLEAR REACTOR
</P>
<P>

11-19 -- Prince Cyrus Riza, left, a turbaned royal servant, center,
and Princess Sakina, on a gray November day outside their ``dreary
lodge'' in New Delhi. Their mother once maintained the family in a
railroad station. Oudh was a wealthy swath of northern India in the
time of the maharajas. Its sovereigns traced their bloodlines to
ancient Persian kings. Their power seeped away under the rule of
the British, who finally seized the realm in 1856. Some of the
royal family never gave up their claim on the palaces. Nor did
their descendants. (Barry Bearak/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe called for broad-based talks
to resolve economic problems that have set off a wave of strikes
and escalating violence. Mugabe has been blamed by labor unions and

   Canada: Opposition to an Execution
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry is trying to block the execution next month
of a Canadian convicted of murder in Texas. Canada, which has no

contending that Texas breached international conventions by not
informing Joseph Stanley Faulder of his right to notify the
Canadian government after his arrest in 1975 for killing an elderly
Texas woman.

SPORTS COLUMN: CAMPBELL KNOWS ALL THE TRICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throwing the odd elbow. Clutching a stick while the referee is
preoccupied. Mashing a sweaty glove in the face of some foe-man.
Truth be told, Colin Campbell might even have done them himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne Cashman told me once, `Back in the '70s, you could do
things,''' Campbell said, referring to a fellow hockey lifer.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's view has changed now that he is the Hangin' Judge:
the new director of hockey operations in the National Hockey
League. An early flurry of suspensions and fines _ no doubt all
deserved _ are the latest career swerve for a man with 1,473
penalty minutes, but no suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   He administered his biggest whacking of this young season
Thursday, a seven-game suspension for Andrei Nazarov of Tampa Bay,
for hitting Colorado's Cam Russell in the face with his stick Nov.
13.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL, which is trying to increase scoring to make the game
palatable throughout the Sun Belt, does not appreciate the
stereotype of hockey as a haven of blatant goons. However, Campbell
was not brought in to make radical changes when Brian Burke became
general manager in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the job came open, I thought of Campbell because he has
experience on the ice level,'' commissioner Gary Bettman said. ``He
didn't have executive experience, but he's a smart guy. I think
he's off to a terrific start.''
</P>
<P>
   Stringin' em up for seven games just might catch the players'
attention. Last year through this date of the regular season, the
league had levied nine punishments for fines and a total of six
games in suspensions, plus lost salary. This regular season,
Campbell has handed out 16 decisions in fines and 41 games in
suspensions plus lost salary.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Rangers' coach until late last season, Campbell has
seen the heart of darkness, the manipulative, competitive,
larcenous soul of a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Lowe, used to say, `If you ain't cheatin', you ain't
tryin,''' he said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's mandate is to catch some of the cheaters some of the
time, and cut back the nasty business.
</P>
<P>
   He said players have always despised the dirty trick of
slew-footing, for which he levied his previous high penalty, five
games, to Ruslan Salei of Anaheim, for an infraction Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell uses films the way his old mentor from the
Petersborough Petes, Roger Neilson, a k a Captain Video, did as an
innovative coaching tool. The other day, flicking the video images
back and forth, a Zapruder Film of indoor mayhem, Campbell
demonstrated the insidious art of slew-footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that,'' he said, pointing as Salei skated alongside
Daniel Briere of Phoenix, locking him up, forcing Briere's left leg
far off the ground. Then Salei quickly planted his own left skate,
and kicked out his opponent's right skate, causing Briere to fall
straight backward, landing on his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at him go into convulsions,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Strapped onto a stretcher and rushed to the hospital, Briere is
only now working back into shape.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell cannot prevent all injuries because players are half a
foot taller these days, heavier, better conditioned, human
projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``And don't forget, nowadays, every channel, every sports show,
every highlight, they've got the slo-mo camera.'' Campbell said.
``People are much more aware.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his most controversial decisions produce no fine or
suspension. Eric Lindros creamed Andreas Dackell of Ottawa against
the boards, causing the player to exit on a stretcher, bleeding
from the head. The next day, Campbell recognized the politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to say Eric Lindros should be suspended every game,''
Campbell confessed. ``Here's a guy, 6-foot-5; he just likes to run
into people. We'd put our toughest player on him just to aggravate
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will say, `Campbell knows Neilson, so he'll favor the
Flyers.' Or, people will say, `Campbell is on a power trip. Some
people will say, `Just give him one game.' But if it's wrong, why
give him one game?''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the film, Campbell asked: Did Lindros leave his feet?
No. Did Lindros accelerate? No. Did Lindros tuck in his elbows?
Yes. Did Dackell duck down, putting his head directly in the path
of Lindros? Yes. Did Lindros use his stick? Absolutely not.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell wound up not suspending Lindros, which did not make him
popular in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   He says his toughest decisions are still ahead, in the Stanley
Cup series, when feelings impact. He played in the 1982 finals for
Vancouver and was an assistant with the 1994 Rangers. The Hangin'
Judge has been there, too.

11-19 -- Prince Cyrus Riza, left, a turbaned royal servant, center,
and Princess Sakina, on a gray November day outside their ``dreary
lodge'' in New Delhi. Their mother once maintained the family in a
railroad station. Oudh was a wealthy swath of northern India in the
time of the maharajas. Its sovereigns traced their bloodlines to
ancient Persian kings. Their power seeped away under the rule of
the British, who finally seized the realm in 1856. Some of the
royal family never gave up their claim on the palaces. Nor did
their descendants. (Barry Bearak/New York Times Photo)

 WASHINGTON: of power. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As for introducing himself to the public on a more favorable
note, Starr had nowhere to go but up. He went into the hearing
Thursday with a dim, 18 percent public approval rating, according
to a national poll taken a few days ago by CBS News. In the face of
attacks from the White House and leading Democrats, Starr has
maintained a stoic silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken felt he had to make a deliberate choice, not to engage in
the public debate,'' said Terrence B. Adamson, a Democrat and
lawyer who has been close to Starr for almost 30 years. ``It might
not be the right political decision, but it was the right
professional one.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at some points during the long day of testimony, Starr,
whose career has been rooted in the decorum of the law, found
himself the unlikely center of a political rumble.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat down to begin his testimony, he was greeted by
Democrats scrapping with Hyde over how much time Clinton's lawyer
should be granted to question the independent counsel. As Democrats
hurled loaded words such as ``railroad'' and ``gagged'' at Hyde,
Starr sat unblinking, looking slightly out of place.
</P>
<P>
   He remained outwardly unruffled as Democratic counsel Abbe
Lowell grilled him about his office's treatment of Ms. Lewinsky,
although sometimes he seemed evasive. He mostly sidestepped a
barrage of questions from Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., over alleged
leaks to the media from the independent counsel's office. Starr
defended the propriety of his office's conduct, remaining utterly
unemotional and offering few specifics, since there is a pending
investigation of leaks being conducted by a federal special master.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Starr called one of Frank's questions unfair.
``You're the expert on unfair questions,'' Frank retorted.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats used the hearing to question both the fairness of
Starr's investigation and of the Judiciary Committee's impeachment
investigation. Zoe Lofgren, D.-Calif., called the impeachment
proceedings ``embarrassing,'' and other Democrats, including
Lowell, pointedly compared the partisan rancor that has
characterized the investigation of Clinton with the Watergate
inquiry, which proceeded with bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the criticisms of Starr raised by Democrats, including
allegations of leaks, collusion with the lawyers for Mrs. Jones,
and rough treatment of Ms. Lewinsky, were not new.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his two-hour opening statement, the
prosecutor, who once considered a bid for the Republican Senate
nomination in Virginia, claimed that he is not suited for the
political high wire. ``I am not a man of polls, public relations or
politics _ which I suppose is obvious at this point,'' he said. ``I
am not experienced in political campaigns.''

ALL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE NBA LOCKOUT RETURN TO MONEY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association's labor dispute entered its
143rd day Friday. While the league and the players union have
broken their two-week stalemate and will meet in Manhattan Friday
for a bargaining session, more than 120 games have already been
lost. The earliest the season can start is the third week of
December. Players' salary losses will soon top $300 million, and
the owners' losses, through gate revenue and local television
rights alone, are in the tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But if you ever wonder why Patrick Ewing is spending more time
on his cellular phone outside a law office than on the court at
Madison Square Garden, here is a basic, question-and-answer session
about what they are fighting for and why.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the season really in jeopardy?
</P>
<P>
   A. Perhaps surprisingly to both sides, it actually is. Because a
month of preparation is needed for training camp and a free-agent
signing period, the earliest the season could start if a deal was
struck by Monday is Dec. 22. That would leave each team with fewer
than 60 regular-season games. If an agreement is not reached by the
second week of December, the league would be toying with less than
a 50-game season _ a prospect that could force the owners to
declare the season lost.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's really holding up the start of the season? Money?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. Money, money, money. The NBA last season took in roughly
$2 billion in revenue, including everything from television
broadcasting rights to gate receipts to the sale of merchandise.
When you add up the salaries paid to players, from Michael Jordan's
$33 million to Rex Chapman's $272,500, the league's players reaped
57.1 percent of that $2 billion. The owners, some of whom are
claiming economic hardship because of the salaries, want a bigger
take of the $2 billion. In simplest terms, the lockout continues
because the two sides cannot agree on what is a fair split.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Everyone is saying no one is getting anywhere in these
negotiations. Has there been progress?
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, there has been significant movement on both sides
toward managing the growth of salaries. Still, each side has a
preferred way of achieving that end.
</P>
<P>
   The players have proposed taxing teams that sign players to the
most lucrative contracts. The taxes would then be distributed to
teams around the league that are struggling financially. Right now,
the players are insisting that the tax apply only to players making
more than $15 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, saying that such a tax would apply only to a handful
of players, have laid out a complicated plan for imposing specific
limits on salaries. They want to hold even the league's best
players to salaries of between roughly $8 million and $12 million.
Teams who currently have players earning more than the $12 million
would be allowed to continuing paying those players at those rates
until they retired.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have also agreed that if either or both of their
preferred plans fail to sufficiently contain salary growth, they
would try another plan.
</P>
<P>
   Under that scheme, a certain percentage of all player salaries
would be put aside at the beginning of the season. If by the end of
the season total salaries had made up too big a slice of the NBA's
revenues, the money that had been initially set aside would be
returned to the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Major disagreement still exists on when such a payback mechanism
would be triggered and how much money would ultimately be given
back to the owners. The players do not want it to be triggered
until their salaries have reached 60 percent of overall revenues;
the owners want the triggering figure to be 50 percent of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is that the only money question?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides agree there is a need to reduce the gap between
the money paid to the league's superstars and the money paid to its
role players and journeymen, they each have different ideas for
remedying the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the league's minimum salary is $272,500. The owners
want to set the baseline salary at $250,000, with provisions for it
to increase during the course of the bargaining agreement. In the
third year of the agreement, the minimum salary would be $350,000
for a player with less than six years' experience and would
increase by $50,000 for each additional year of experience. A
player with 10 years of experience _ say Tyrone Corbin, who earned
the $272,500 minimum last season for Atlanta _ could not be paid
less than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The players want substantially more _ a $500,000 minimum salary,
plus $100,000 for each additional year of experience above five.
</P>
<P>
   They also want to alter another special provision that exists in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, a team can, no more than once every two years, exceed
the salary cap in order to sign one player. That player _ Rick Fox
was signed by the Lakers last year under this provision _ cannot
earn more than $1 million. The players want that figure increased
to whatever was the average salary paid to players the previous
season. Last season the average salary was $2.6 million. The owners
are proposing a less dramatic increase for such players.

 &HT;    Progress in Texas child support system minimal
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas legislators took a glimpse Thursday of the
beleaguered attorney general's child-support division that is
approaching a federal deadline for a whole new operating scheme
next year without preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an Oct. 1 federal cutoff to set up a central system
to distribute child support, the attorney general's office has not
yet sought bids for a new way to handle the payment system, the
Sunset Advisory Commission heard. Currently, most child support
payments are handled at the county level.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office also has not completed its request
to the federal government to be allowed to keep the system that
works now.
</P>
<P>
   And lawmakers were told that the ill-fated $78 million computer
system bought for child-support collections will not be able to
handle all that the federal government will require by next year
without buying more hardware.
</P>
<P>
   After the beginning of the hearing Thursday morning, the
commission's child-support consultant, David M. Griffith &AMP;
Associates, painted a despairing picture of the Texas system.
Still, it recommended to the the commission that the division
continue to operate out of the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant was hired to assess how well the program was
working in the attorney general's office _ and whether it should be
moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is smoke and mirrors,'' said Rep. Toby
Goodman, R-Arlington. ``I heard different explanations here than in
front of my committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, chairman of the House Committee on Juvenile Justice and
Family Issues, conducted hearings on the division last summer.
Goodman, who is not on the sunset commission, was invited to help
conduct the inquiry by state Sen. Chris Harris, R-Arlington, a
member of the commission and himself a key legislative player in
child-support issues.
</P>
<P>
   After Goodman had elicited the fact that the attorney general's
office had not completed its federal waiver application, another
commission member, Rep. Patricia Gray, D-Galveston, interrupted
him. ``One of the things I'm a little disturbed about was, a little
more than two hours ago, I asked whether we had applied for a
waiver and was told yes,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a deposition where we are trying to determine the
definition of the word is. It's a simple question,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dan Morales is scheduled to appear today , when
the hearing continues. His first assistant attorney general, Jorge
Vega, appeared in his place Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman and Harris have been critics of Morales' child-support
program for years. The child-support division collects on about a
fifth of cases referred to it, although many of those referrals
involve children born to unwed mothers and the fathers have not
been legally identified.

 &HT;    Bush still pondering 2000 presidential race
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ If George W. Bush dives into the 2000 race, he
will find a presidential derby vastly different from recent White
House contests.
</P>
<P>
   He also would find a personal challenge he has never encountered
_ candidates trying to outflank him on the right.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, as he spent another day never far from a TV camera
at the Republican Governors Association meeting, Bush acknowledged
2000 will be a different kind of presidential year for who ever
jumps in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has more of a feel of a national primary than ever
before,'' he said of the developing clustered primaries that could
favor candidates such as Bush with high name identification and
fund-raising ability.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of his father's bumpy rides through primaries, Bush
said he knows he would face a different game if he ran for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be a premium placed on candidates' capacity
to raise money early,'' he said. ``I think a candidate is going to
have to have pretty broad appeal because there are western
primaries and eastern primaries all on the same day.''
</P>
<P>
   And while other potential GOP presidential contenders are
spending time and money to lure social conservatives who could be
key players in many states, Bush said he has no plans to do
anything special to curry their favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the way I'm going to play it if I choose to run,'' he
said. ``I'm going to be myself and let the chips fall where they
may.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Bush scared off all other potential GOP gubernatorial
candidates. This year, he faced only R.C. Crawford, an unfunded,
unknown political rookie from Round Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of GOP opponents has kept Bush from having to compete
for the social conservative vote. Though he agrees with groups such
as the Christian Coalition on most issues, they have established a
largely arms-length connection to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks from the right already are being lobbed by Gary Bauer,
head of the Family Research Council, who also is considering his
own bid for president.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent appearance on the Fox News Channel, Bauer said the
success of the Bush uncandidacy is a ``mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush gets a lot of press, but we actually know very
little about what he believes on a whole host of issues _ his
policy towards China, abortion. His tax cuts in Texas ended up
being in many cases a tax increase,'' Bauer said. ``I'm assuming
that if George W. runs, he will run as a Bush Republican. And if I
run, I'm going to run as a Reagan Republican, and there is a
difference between the two.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in how the game will be played in 2000 is now going
on as states look to grab more importance. The campaign trail will
look more like a short series of clustered primaries than the
state-by-state procession the nation is used to.
</P>
<P>
   Though the final lineup has not been decided, it now looks as if
it will begin, as usual, with the Iowa caucuses followed by the New
Hampshire primary. Louisiana, as it did in 1996, may have an early
contest. South Carolina is planning a March 4 primary.
</P>
<P>
   But then the landscape changes dramatically, and in a way that
means the nominations could be decided before April Fools Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the candidate who can raise a lot of money in the
up-front will be benefited by the clustering,'' said Utah Gov. Mike
Leavitt, a driving force behind the developing western presidential
primary.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Bush, who has raised money from all 50 states for
his gubernatorial campaigns, and Steve Forbes, who finances his
campaigns by reaching into his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, said Leavitt, ``would likely fare quite well'' in a
western regional primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot in common between Texas and the interior
West,'' he said. ``It's a frontier kind of atmosphere. It's a
relatively independent group.''
</P>
<P>
   Other governors here also said Bush looks strong in their
states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush buddy David Beasley, ousted this month as governor of South
Carolina, spent this week talking like a man waiting to join a Bush
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to great friendship and working
relationships today and in the future,'' Beasley said. ``It's going
to be an exciting time. I support him 100 percent in all
endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very little doubt that the people of South Carolina
will support George Bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa, a traditional bellwether, may be more challenging for
Bush, said Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, who did not seek re-election
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Branstad is tight with ex-Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a
former and probable future presidential candidate, and expects to
back Alexander in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Branstad noted, Alexander and other potential contenders
have been working Iowa for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowa is a state that cannot be taken for granted, and I think
to do well there, you've got to spend a lot of time, you've got to
go to a lot of places,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it, somehow, already too late for a presidential candidate to
get involved in a caucus that is more than a year off?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is going to be tough,'' Branstad said. ``No, it is
not too late, but it is going to take a concerted effort because
there are other people that have been at least laying the
groundwork and spending some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it's wrong to think a presidential campaign not
already under way can't become a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who will vacation out of the country with his family next
week, said his presidential decision is months away and still
highly dependent on input from wife Laura and 16-year-old daughters
Jenna and Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say don't do it,'' Bush said of his daughters. ``I think
they are against it. I know they are not against me, and I think
there is a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, he said, is not opposing the race, ``nor is she
sitting there shoving me, `Please run,' urging me to jump out in
front of the next news magazine cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also wants it clear that the decision, though made with
family input, is his to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has got veto power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of days of high-powered national attention, Bush
said he is ``amazed'' by his front-runner status.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he knows something about physics and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand something,'' he said. ``What goes up, comes
down.''

 UNDATED: such players.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. That's all, right?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   The owners and players are also trying to come to an agreement
on how to treat the salaries paid to rookies and younger players.
Both are concerned about problems made clear in Minnesota's
dealings with Kevin Garnett, the 21-year-old forward who last
season signed a $126 million deal after just his second season. As
well, Denver last season found itself forced to trade Antonio
McDyess because it could not afford to meet his coming salary
demands. McDyess had played only two full seasons for the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, who are unhappy with the fact that players can now
gain unrestricted free agency after only three years in the league,
have proposed a plan under which a team would be better able to
hang on to a young, promising player for as long as five years.
Teams would retain an option to keep a player for a fourth year or
let him go, as well as be able to match any offer from another team
going into the player's fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the players have made a concession. They have
told the owners they would agree to one of two options: the team
would either have to commit to keeping a player for a guaranteed
fourth year at a set salary or simply be allowed to match any offer
from another team after the player's third year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How long a deal is being discussed here? And is there
anything to say that another season, sometime soon, will not be
compromised by further labor disputes?
</P>
<P>
   A. The players have proposed a deal that would last five years,
while the owners have proposed a plan that would last six years
with an option for a seventh year. Neither side has discussed the
inclusion of an escape clause that would allow for an early
revisiting of the agreement, and so any deal should mean at least
five years of labor peace.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who is likely to crack, and why?
</P>
<P>
   A. The obvious answer would be the players, who will lose an
estimated $1.1 billion in salaries if the season is killed. Tim
Legler, the Washington Wizards guard, became the first player to
publicly criticize the union, on Thursday in The Washington Post.
He said the only interests being served were those of the most
high-salaried superstars. While Legler backed off his comments
Thursday and said that the owners were to blame for the labor
problems, there is a feeling of frustration building among the
players. But much of that frustration is targeted at the owners.
</P>
<P>
   So far, in fact, the union appears to have held the players in
line. Knowing many of the league's owners made their money outside
of the NBA, players have little compassion for teams who claim to
have finished in the red last season. They do not care that an
apathetic public has generalized them as greedy.
</P>
<P>
   The owners appear just as firm. Four years after a World Series
was lost to labor strife, most owners believe Major League Baseball
is destroying itself economically. Throw in the National Hockey
League's Pittsburgh Penguins recently filing for bankruptcy, and
some of the worst fears are beginning to surface for small-market
teams. In spite of the NBA's economic boom, which has produced new
arenas and unprecedented revenue, the owners feel like befuddled
executives at MGM Studios in the 1950s; the stars, they feel, are
slowly killing their cash cow.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If they crunch numbers and shake hands Friday, why can't they
start the season Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's going to take about a month to start playing games for
several reasons. One, a free-agent signing period of about three
weeks is needed to fill out rosters. The Bulls, for example, have
only four players under contract. Two, most of these guys are in
decent shape but clearly not in NBA-game shape. They need an
abbreviated training camp and probably at least one exhibition game
to get their timing back. Three, the league has had to give up
arena dates because of the uncertainty of the negotiations.
Finally, lawyers on both sides probably need a week to reduce an
agreement in principle to writing. And Commissioner David Stern has
no intention of opening up camp until that happens.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will Michael Jordan play, and why?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, maybe just to get the last word in on Abe Pollin. The
owner of the Wizards and Jordan clashed behind closed doors several
weeks ago. If nothing else, Jordan probably wants to detonate for
60 points against Pollin's team.

 &HT;    Justices grill both sides in ground-water case
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Justices of the Texas Supreme Court gave no
clear signal Thursday whether they want a ground-water law with
19th-century roots to survive into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The justices took one side and then the other as they quizzed
lawyers in a case challenging the rule of capture, a ground-water
doctrine adopted by the court in 1904 that is based on an 1843
common-law ruling in England.
</P>
<P>
   Several justices expressed keen interest in the legal, political
and practical implications of the rule of capture, which allows
essen- tially unlimited pumping of ground water even if wells,
springs and creeks dry up as a result. The case is one of the most
important environmental and property-rights issues to be considered
by the court in recent years. Nearly 150 spectators attended
Thursday's oral arguments, and security officers turned away other
people because of fire-code limits.
</P>
<P>
   The court is considering an appeal by two families in Henderson
County in East Texas who contend that the Ozarka Spring Water Co.
depleted their wells. Ozarka denies the allegation. Two lower
courts, citing the rule of capture, found in favor of Ozarka
without hearing any evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The families want the court to scrap the rule of capture for a
doctrine allowing ``reasonable use,'' or, failing that, to at least
allow lawsuits for negligent pumping.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Supreme Court is decidedly conservative, it is not
averse to new approaches on water law. In 1996, the nine-member
court unanimously upheld a law intended to restrict pumping from
the southern portion of the Edwards Aquifer, a water-bearing
limestone formation underlying the City of San Antonio and large
stretches of agricultural land in South Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the justices _ especially Priscilla Owen, Nathan
Hecht and Craig Enoch _ played devil's advocate with the lawyers in
an effort to test their arguments. Here is an edited version of
some of the discussion:
</P>
<P>
   Enoch: ``Haven't most states that abandoned the rule of capture
done so by legislation?''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Rea, a lawyer for the East Texas families: ``Yes, but last
year's overhaul of water law by the state Legislature stopped short
of addressing the rule, leaving individuals without protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Enoch: ``So you want the court to impose a regulatory scheme
that you can't win politically?''
</P>
<P>
   In another exchange, Christopher Hanslik, a lawyer for Ozarka,
argued that landowners could obtain relief by persuading voters to
create a local ground-water district. If that fails, they could ask
the Legislature to create a district.
</P>
<P>
   Owen: ``But what if landowners cannot get a ground-water
district created? What recourse do they have?''
</P>
<P>
   Hanslik: ``Drill a deeper well.''
</P>
<P>
   Another discussion centered on the advancements in science since
the 1904 ruling, which presumed that ground water was too
mysterious to regulate. In that case, the court ruled against W.A.
East, a North Texas landowner who sued the Houston &AMP; Texas Central
Railway for drilling a large well that dried up his smaller well.
</P>
<P>
   Enoch: ``What if the Legislature fails to manage ground water
comprehensively? Isn't the court obliged to say it adopted a rule
based on faulty science and change that rule?''
</P>
<P>
   Hecht: ``We decided East. Why can't we undecide East?''
</P>
<P>
   Hanslik: ``Senate Bill 1, the water law, is just beginning to be
implemented. Give it a chance.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr's testimony Thursday had two
purposes: to restore his once shiny professional reputation and to
revive an impeachment inquiry that has lost momentum. On his
reputation, he probably did himself some good. On impeachment there
were few signs that he moved anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, Starr, the independent counsel, had the opportunity
to redeem the prestige he once enjoyed as a persuasive solicitor
general with sterling legal credentials.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the hearing Thursday, Starr went out of his way to
speak in lawyerly, measured tones. His dignified demeanor, which at
times bordered on the pedantic, recalled the days when he argued
the government's cases before the Supreme Court in a cutaway coat.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a forceful exchange late Thursday evening with David E.
Kendall, the president's private lawyer, Starr raised his voice
only to rebut charges that his office had illegally leaked grand
jury material or mistreated witnesses. His delivery was more
vigorous, but his words still rolled out as if they were from an
appellate brief.
</P>
<P>
   This Ken Starr was strikingly at odds with the caricature the
White House and its allies have drawn of an overzealous,
sex-obsessed prosecutor. Nor did he seem to fit the description
hurled at him by Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking
Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, in the opening minutes of the
hearing. Conyers lambasted Starr as the ``federally paid sex
policeman spending millions of dollars to trap an unfaithful
spouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the hearing, Starr had maintained a subdued silence.
``Second to Monica, he's been the unheard voice in all of this,''
said Bradford A. Berenson, a Washington lawyer who is acquainted
with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson and friends said Starr had looked forward to the
hearing as a ``liberating'' moment, a chance to introduce himself
to the public and counter what he viewed as an unfair White House
campaign to demonize him.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's personal chore of restoring his professional image was
difficult enough, but the goal set for him by committee Republicans
was even harder. They had hoped that his testimony would provide
fresh grounds and new energy to drive President Clinton from
office. In this mission, Starr seems to have failed. His testimony
offered no new evidence of impeachable offenses by Clinton and even
exonerated him on issues that some Republicans had hoped to pursue,
such as the firings of White House travel office employees and the
misuse of FBI files of government employees.
</P>
<P>
   His long-awaited testimony lacked the electric impact of star
witnesses at past congressional hearings. John Dean, Oliver North
and Clarence Thomas were able to shape the public mood with their
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike North, who arrived in uniform and talked in macho terms
about ``being the fall guy'' in the Iran-contra scandal, Starr
talked about Nexis searches and his ``primary factual
investigation.'' There were no dramatic phrases, such as Thomas'
memorable accusation in his Supreme Court confirmation hearing that
the Senate was conducting ``a high-tech lynching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken doesn't talk in sound bites,'' explained Barbara Olson, a
friend and former prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Starr gave rambling answers that appeared evasive and
made for less than riveting television. At other points, he offered
a stirring defense, denying any personal vendetta against the
president. Starr said he would prefer to be back in private life,
but added, ``My duty is to do my duty.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starr did try to lay out, as clearly and compellingly as
possible, the evidence and factual basis for his legal findings
against the President. He also tried to blunt criticism that his
impeachment report on the Monica Lewinsky matter, which he sent to
Congress on Sept. 9, was too graphic, too focused on sex.
</P>
<P>
   He was at least partly successful. He spent two hours offering a
highly detailed account of the evidence his investigation has
uncovered, shifting the emphasis from sex to lying. In the Paula
Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit, Starr said his evidence suggested
that President Clinton had been deliberately evasive in his
testimony in the lawsuit and before Starr's grand jury last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also outlined evidence of stonewalling and evasion in
other branches of his investigation, including the Whitewater
matter and purported efforts by the President's allies to win the
silence of Webster L. Hubbell, the former Justice Department
official, by helping him get lucrative retainers after he was
forced to resign in disgrace. Last week, Starr indicted Hubbell for
a third time, and Henry Hyde, the judiciary committee chairman, has
indicated that the committee will investigate the Hubbell matter
further.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence Starr recited did not do much to move his case
beyond perjury, and even some Republicans on the committee seemed
unconvinced that the President's unsuccessful citing of executive
privilege or attorney-client privilege amounted to an abuse of
power.

 WASHINGTON: of power.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As for presenting himself to the public in a more favorable
light, Starr had no where to go but up. He went into the hearing
Thursday with a dim, 18 percent public approval rating, according
to a national poll taken a few days ago by CBS News. In the face of
attacks from the White House and leading Democrats, Starr has
maintained a stoic silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken felt he had to make a deliberate choice, not to engage in
the public debate,'' said Terrence B. Adamson, a Democratic lawyer
who has been a friend of Starr for almost 30 years. ``It might not
be the right political decision, but it was the right professional
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at times in the long day of testimony, Starr, whose career
has been rooted in the decorum of the law, found himself the
unlikely star performer in a political rumble.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat down to begin his testimony, he was greeted by
Democrats scrapping with Hyde over how much time President
Clinton's lawyer should be granted to question Starr. As Democrats
hurled loaded words such as ``gagged'' at Hyde, Starr sat
unblinking, looking slightly out of place.
</P>
<P>
   He remained unruffled as Democrats grilled him about his
office's dealings with Ms. Lewinsky, the news media and lawyers for
Ms. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats used the hearing to question the fairness of
Starr's inquiry and of the Judiciary Committee's impeachment
investigation. Zoe Lofgren, D.-Calif., called the impeachment
proceedings ``embarrassing,'' and other Democrats, including
Lowell, compared the partisan rancor that has characterized Hyde's
investigation with the Watergate inquiry, which proceeded with
bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the criticisms of Starr by Democrats, including
accusations of leaks, collusion with the lawyers for Ms. Jones, and
rough treatment of Ms. Lewinsky, were not new.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his two-hour opening statement, the
prosecutor, who once considered a bid for the Republican Senate
nomination in Virginia, said that was not suited for the political
high wire. ``I am not a man of politics, of public relations or
polls, which I suppose is patently obvious by now,'' he said. ``I
am not experienced in political campaigns.''

DAVIES TAKES A TWO-SHOT LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ After struggling to qualify for the PageNet Tour
Championship, Laura Davies looked capable of winning it Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a 6-under-par 66, in a round that included two eagles,
Davies held a two-stroke lead after the first round at the Desert
Inn Golf Club. Juli Inkster (68) was in second place and Brandie
Burton and Dottie Pepper were tied for third at 69.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a subpar year by Davies' lofty standards. She
entered this week's tournament, which is limited to the tour's top
30 money winners, 24th on the LPGA money list, after four
consecutive years of finishing no worse than No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get left out of a tournament like this, you feel like
you've had a horrendous year,'' said Davies, who was the LPGA's
leading money-winner in 1994, and finished No. 2 in both 1995 and
1996. ``When you've been No. 1, it's hard to be No. 24. I don't
want to make any of the other players feel bad, but that's how I
feel. If they're happy to be No. 24, that's fine. But I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davies was extremely happy with Thursday's round, although
some of the other favorites were disappointed. Annika Sorenstam,
No. 1 on the money list and the defending champion, struggled to a
two-over par 74 and Se Ri Pak shot an even par 72. Sorenstam has
clinched the money title, but Pak could win the points race for
player of the year if she wins this weekend, and if Sorenstam
finishes fourth or worse.
</P>
<P>
   The longest hitter on the women's tour, Davies took advantage of
that power on the Desert Inn's par-5 holes. At the 525-yard No. 5,
Davies used a driver on her first two shots, then chipped in from
40 feet for eagle. Davies birdied the 500-yard No. 9, hitting a
strong drive, a 5-iron approach shot and short chip that landed a
foot from the cup. Then on No. 15, 453 yards, Davies made another
eagle, hitting a drive, a beautiful 6-iron that landed 10 feet from
the cup, followed by eagle putt.
</P>
<P>
   Davies also birdied No. 3, No. 10, and No. 13, and her only
bogeys came at No. 11 and No. 14. More important, Davies had only
one three-putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm missing the short ones now, which I never used to do,''
said Davies, who turned 35 last month. ``I'm still hitting a high
percentage of greens, but when you're putting poorly, it affects
your whole game. You're always thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been 18 months since I putted or chipped well.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Nov. 20:
</P>
<P>
   On the core question of whether President Clinton's misconduct
in office merits impeachment, the testimony of Kenneth Starr
brought more clarity than most Americans could have expected.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel outlined his case that Clinton lied
under oath, obstructed justice and tampered with witnesses, but he
brought the House Judiciary Committee no new evidence beyond that
offered in his Sept. 9 referral.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as then, that information provides what Rep. Bill McCollum
called ``a compelling picture'' of a president failing in his sworn
duty to see that the law is faithfully executed.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as then, the correct conclusion is that condemnation
through formal congressional censure is the proper punishment for
Clinton, not impeachment by the full House followed by the ultimate
constitutional penalty of removal from office by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, our position has been that censure of Clinton for
lying under oath was the correct remedy unless new evidence
emerged. The logic of that position proceeds from the political
consensus of the American people and the scale of the offenses,
even if every detail of Starr's allegations could be proved.
</P>
<P>
   This misconduct did not occur in the context of national
security or the misuse of key agencies. It stemmed from personal
weaknesses _ Clinton's compulsive risk-taking, his disrespect of
the high office and historic residence entrusted to him, his
habitual mendacity _ that no future chief executive is likely to
emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore Clinton deserves to be punished in a way that writes
his disgrace into the history books and affirms the presidency's
subservience to and obligations under the rule of law, while at the
same time sparing the nation the trauma that removal of this weak
man would impose on the people and the political system.
</P>
<P>
   Starr hoped to use his testimony to salvage his legal reputation
while also proving his case that lying in a sexual harassment suit
was in and of itself grounds for impeachment. His long opening
presentation was at once an orderly and useful summation of the
evidence to date, and a devastating admission that he had no
additional evidence that would strengthen his case.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe, as this page does, that new information was
needed to raise Clinton's misconduct to the level of impeachment
heard none on the Monica Lewinsky matter or on earlier scandals.
Indeed, Starr testified that he could not prove his suspicions
about President and Mrs. Clinton on Whitewater and that he found no
offenses by them on Travelgate and Filegate. This deck-clearing
exercise was useful, but Starr failed to explain why he could not
have settled those issues months or even years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Starr presented himself as bound strictly by the law, yet much
of his case against Clinton rambled far afield. He listed
misleading the American people, lying to the Cabinet and White
House staff, specious use of privilege claims and six refusals to
testify before the grand jury as part of the enumerated charges.
</P>
<P>
   These failings are part of the conduct that makes Clinton a
slippery and unadmirable president. But they are not legally
impeachable or even prosecutable.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest part of Starr's case focused on incidents of
presidential lying that unfolded after Dec. 5, 1997, when Clinton
first learned that his paramour would be a witness in the Paula
Jones case. On six occasions, starting with his Jan. 17, 1998,
deposition and ending with his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony,
Clinton testified falsely or lied in public about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky. In addition, between Dec. 5 and his Jan. 17
deposition, Clinton took a number of potentially illegal actions
that Starr said were shown by direct testimony or ``circumstantial
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In Starr's account, the president urged Ms. Lewinsky to swear to
a false affidavit, sought to tamper with the evidence of his gifts
to her, coached Betty Currie to tailor her testimony to his, and
reached out to Vernon Jordan and others to get Ms. Lewinsky a job
that would keep her silent.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said Clinton's actions over this ``eight-month journey''
amounted to ``witness-tampering, obstruction of justice and the use
of presidential authority and power in an effort to conceal the
truth of the relationship and to delay the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the heart of the impeachment case. For our part, we have
never been in the school that excuses presidential lying if it
concerns private conduct. We regard lying under oath for any reason
as a serious breach of presidential responsibility and agree with
Starr that much of this inquiry was necessitated by White House
stonewalling and deception on suspect events that started with
Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   But we still do not see impeachment as the appropriate legal
response. That is partly for the reasons of legal scale outlined
above, and more importantly for the final judgment that has now
developed in the public and the Congress. Even diehard
congressional Democrats like Rep. Barney Frank want Clinton to be
punished.
</P>
<P>
   But a substantial majority of the American people would not
support impeachment or removal on the existing facts, and Starr's
bottom line Thursday was that he has no more to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has dark and reasonable suspicions about, say, jobs for
silence, but he cannot prove them. Those parts that he can prove,
such as Clinton's blatant lying under oath about sex, will not be
supported as grounds for impeachment by a majority of the House,
even though it is controlled by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Starr handled himself better than Democrats had hoped in
responding to charges of collusion with the Jones lawyers, the
bludgeoning of witnesses and ideological obsessiveness. But serious
questions remain about his prosecutorial conduct, including his
handling of Linda Tripp and her tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, meanwhile, have an acute problem. They could
probably clear an impeachment recommendation on a party-line vote
in the Judiciary Committee. But that vote would damage their party
in the next election and displease their own designated speaker,
Robert Livingston. Most important, it would not be warranted on the
evidence presented by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   As for the final resolution of these matters, the mess does not
look so large Friday as it did Thursday. Starr's reputation for
legal acuity and balanced judgment has been seriously damaged.
Clinton is probably much nearer the severe censure that he deserves
for betraying the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Democrats can realize that events have tilted their
way and if chairman Henry Hyde can keep a lid on his Republican
colleagues, the Judiciary Committee may be lurching toward a
conclusion of an episode that brought down a speaker and
permanently blotted the president's record.
</P>
<P>
   The smart parliamentary move and the best outcome for the
country would be for a senior Republican and a senior Democrat on
the Judiciary Committee to offer a joint motion recommending a
censure resolution to the full House.

  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Of all the economic events of the 1990s, the decline of Japan's
financial colossus was perhaps the least expected. A decade ago the
Japanese appeared to be in command of the most successful economy
in the world. Now, as President Clinton concludes his Tokyo visit,
it is hard to be optimistic about the financial condition and
future of the world's second-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has recently done much better at announcing economic
repair plans than putting them into effect.
</P>
<P>
   The government's $195 billion economic stimulus package _
including money that is to be given to people on condition that it
be spent, not saved _ got a tepid reception in part because of
doubts about details and whether the government will follow through
on its promises. Even if it does, more is likely to be needed.
Structural reforms must be made to promote competition, and Japan's
banking mess must be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   Japan continues to run big trade surpluses, and is a very rich
economy. But wealth has not kept it out of a severe recession.
Savings are high and consumer spending is low. Many of the problems
stem from the bubble economy of the late 1980s, when stock and real
estate prices soared beyond all reason. The collapse left Japanese
financial institutions mired in bad debts that were long ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government has set aside money for bank bailouts _
and two major banks said on Thursday they would need more than $7
billion _ little has so far been accomplished. Japanese banks are
reluctant to lend money except to the safest borrowers, producing a
lethal combination of credit crunch and recession.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Japan faces a difficult task in dealing with its
banking system. The problem was caused by banks that lent too
willingly.
</P>
<P>
   But the country's economic problems now are being exacerbated by
the opposite problem as banks refuse to lend. Japan must close
banks that are insolvent, while providing additional capital to
other banks to enable them to lend money to creditworthy companies.
Unfortunately, the Japanese government has yet to show it can
accomplish that delicate balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists argue that Japan is now in a liquidity trap, in
which worried consumers hoard rather than spend any increase in the
money supply. They say Japan must adopt a policy of promoting
inflation so that consumers spend for fear that the yen they save
will be worth less next year.
</P>
<P>
   Such dire forecasts may be right, but it is also possible that
bold action would make a difference. It is encouraging that Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi, as part of a deal to bring an opposition
party into his government, agreed to consider tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be wise for Japan to reduce its resistance to
imports. An Asia-Pacific trade liberalization plan was scuttled by
Japan's refusal to lower tariffs on fish and forest products. Such
protection is one of the factors depressing domestic demand and
slowing Japan's economy. As Clinton said, ``Nothing is more
important to restore growth in Asia than efforts to restart Japan's
economy,''

STARR NOT A `MAKE-OR-BREAK WITNESS' DURING HISTORIC SESSION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's highly
anticipated testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on
Thursday did not appear to alter the dynamics of an impeachment
inquiry that has divided lawmakers and failed to ignite much
outrage in an ambivalent public.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the daylong session, it was clear that Republicans
and Democrats on the panel agreed on little, from the format of the
hearing to the fairness of Starr's probe.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, for the most part, calmly parried the
sometimes hostile questioning with lengthy and legalistic answers
that frequently frustrated Democrats eager to paint him as
overzealous prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But he also did not offer any explosive new information likely
to sway members wary of ousting a president on charges of lying
about sex.
</P>
<P>
   As Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., conceded, Starr was not a
``make-or-break witness.''
</P>
<P>
   The historic session was held in the same cavernous chamber
where the Watergate impeachment hearings on President Nixon took
place almost a quarter of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a long wooden table, Starr dominated the morning with
his recitation of charges against the president. The bespectacled
prosecutor displayed little emotion as he slowly read 58 pages of
highly legalistic testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation, however, appeared better suited for the
courtrooms where the former judge usually works than the national
audience watching the hearings televised on all of the major
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank , D-Mass., even slipped out to the gym for a
quick workout as Starr labored to make his case.
</P>
<P>
   However, another Democrat, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas paid
close attention to the details of the testimony, and interrupted
Starr at one point when he plunged into matters unrelated to the
Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee argued that Starr should not be able to discuss
Whitewater-related issues where the prosecutor had not found that
president committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston lawmaker, however, was quickly overruled by
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who reminded everyone that
the GOP majority in the House had approved an open-ended probe.
</P>
<P>
   While the chairman has frequently stated that he wanted the
inquiry to rise above partisanship, the spirit of comity was
missing from the packed room in the Sam Rayburn House Office
building.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats went on the offensive immediately after the
meeting commenced.
</P>
<P>
   They attacked the Republican majority for allotting Starr far
more time to make his case than they gave the president's lawyers
to rebut it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats later grilled Starr on a range of issues from why his
prosecutors initially discouraged Lewinsky from seeking legal
advice to charges he was leaking grand jury material to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make no bones about it. I think some of the tactics that
have been used are unacceptable,'' Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.,
sternly told Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The portly and generally affable Hyde at times appeared
frustrated with the Democrats' aggressive questioning and
objections.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not try to block them from having their say. And he
tried to inject some humor into the hearings to relieve the
tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will someone protect me from Maxine Waters,'' he joked during
one break.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were also quick to defend Starr, and said the
Democrats were ignoring charges that the president may have
committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, a Republican from San Antonio _ where Starr
was raised _ praised the independent counsel as a dedicated father
with a reputation for personal integrity. Smith said the prosecutor
had been ``unfairly savaged'' by his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the day a weary-looking Starr hinted that the
five-year probe had taken its toll on him. He told Republican Rep.
Mary Bono of Palm Springs Calif., that he often thought about the
law school dean's job he turned down at Pepperdine University in
Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer to be almost your constituent,'' he told Bono.
``I would like to be living my life.''
</P>
<P>
   While Starr's testimony may not have changed many minds on the
committee, his presence certainly captured the attention of the
national media, who filled several rows of seats in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing also drew a number of spectators including,
filmmaker Michael Moore, best known for his documentary ``Roger and
Me,'' which chronicled how General Motors downsized its carmaking
operation in Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he was filming a segment on impeachment for his new
cable television show, a piece that was clearly going to be
critical of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he had previously staged a protest in front of
Starr's home, which included seven people dressed up as Puritans
meant to represent the Salem witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Other less famous spectators who came to watch the hearings said
the partisan squabbling was all too predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats are Democrats. The Republicans are Republicans.
It is too bad,'' said Beverly Keeler, visiting from Worcester,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Others who walked by the hearing room said they had no interest
in the historic inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would rather eat lunch than wait for this,'' said Cher
Kiel, a photographer from New Jersey, who was in Washington to see
the Vincent van Gogh exhibit. Commenting on the White House scandal
and the impeachment proceedings, she snapped, ``It bores me.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: STARR DOES HIMSELF LITTLE GOOD, AND LITTLE
DAMAGE

<P>
   It's the law of the political jungle: spin or be spun. And
throughout the 11 months of the Lewinsky investigation, Kenneth
Starr's spin has been that he has none. He has portrayed himself as
the image of rectitude, comparing himself to Joe Friday in his
devotion to just the facts.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday viewers who knew him only as the man with the
inappropriate grin walking to his car each day finally saw what
those who have watched him in court had suggested: he can calmly
talk circles around his questioners. And while that's not a bad
quality in a lawyer, it makes for bland television, the primary
arena in which the impeachment process is being played out.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's daylong televised testimony before the House Judiciary
Committee forms a natural bookend to President Clinton's four-hour
videotaped deposition. It was a battle between Clinton, a master of
image making, and Starr, whose own supporters concede him to be one
of the least adept practitioners of the art of spin; after all, Joe
Friday is a camp figure of fun, and choosing him as a role model
reveals how out-of-touch the Starr approach to public relations has
been.
</P>
<P>
   Far from abandoning his passive-aggressive approach to spin
Thursday, Starr emphasized it in his prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a man of politics, of public relations, or of polls _
which I suppose is patently obvious by now,'' he said, reinforcing
his image as a man of no glitz, yet ignoring some harsh facts. He
is, of course, caught up in a fierce political and public relations
war. As for polls, someone must have told him that in the drumbeat
leading up to Thursday's meeting, commentators were wondering
whether his appearance could boost his ``single-digit ratings,'' as
the catch-phrase for his approval numbers became.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to court and not on the talk show circuit,'' Starr also
said in his statement, though his spokesman, Charles Bakaly III,
was all over the talk show circuit the night before. During the
committee meeting, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., reminded Starr that
he himself had appeared on ``Good Morning America'' that day.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, of course, that Starr has largely avoided public
comments, and the flaws in his no-spin spin have been obvious. In
the pithy phrase of NBC News' Lisa Myers, Starr's task Thursday was
to prove that he was not ``the sex-crazed, out-of-control
prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   And though no one really expected to see a red tail poking out
from beneath the witness chair, Starr's opponents probably took
heart from the opening minutes of the session. While the Democrats
complained about the fairness of the process, the cameras stayed on
Starr, who looked pale, dour, close-mouthed, almost spooky in his
sternness.
</P>
<P>
   That demonic impression passed quickly as he read his two-hour
statement, repeating his original report to the House in an
uninflected manner. Even when the language gave him an opportunity
to create fireworks, he didn't. ``That was untrue,'' he said of the
president's statements several times, creating a refrain. But in
Starr's quiet voice it came out sing-songy, not commanding or
dramatic. (Imagine what a fiery Jesse Jackson or even a dignified
Henry Hyde might have done with the same chant.)
</P>
<P>
   But if he didn't do himself much good, Starr did not do himself
serious damage, either. When it was time for the committee members
to question him, the meeting came nowhere near the
all-but-chair-throwing brawl some commentators had predicted. The
limit of five minutes for each member's questions turned many of
the Democrats into speed-talkers.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most pointed hostile questions (and most were
alarmingly unfocused) gave Starr a chance to repeat his evidence
and conclusions. He politely said ``You may disagree'' and ``You
may have another judgment'' while defending his office, and like a
true politician he sometimes answered a different question from the
one that had been asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did your office violate the law?'' Rep. Jerrold Nadler,
D-N.Y., asked Starr about the treatment of Monica Lewinsky when she
was first questioned. Ms. Lewinsky has said she was discouraged
from calling a lawyer; Starr said she wasn't. Did anyone expect him
to say anything else?
</P>
<P>
   Only at the end of the day, when Starr was questioned by David
Kendall, the president's personal lawyer, did the questions become
pointed enough to challenge Starr's unflappable demeanor and stock
responses.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction that Kendall and Starr would be well-matched
legal adversaries was the one prediction that turned out to be
true. As Kendall grilled Starr about matters such as leaks to the
media from his office and his legal firm's links to the Paula Jones
case, Starr often responded like a defendent rather than an
unflappable witness.
</P>
<P>
   Their exchange proved that there is still drama left in the
impeachment inquiry, though it is usually obscured by political
posturing. The day before, in a statement about the committee
process that quickly became a favorite sound-bite, Rep. Maxine
Waters said, ``If it goes on the way it's going now, it will be
great theater, but it will have nothing to do with a fair process
of trying to get the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not great theater, and the choice is not either/or,
theater or fairness. The theatrical component has become
inescapable, however much Starr pretends to ignore that. What
Thursday's largely uneventful day proved is that Joe Friday's days
as a television hero have passed.

ELISABETH OWENS, 79, PIONEER AT HARVARD LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elisabeth Owens, who helped to shape the field of international
tax law and in 1972 became the first woman ever granted tenure at
Harvard Law School, died on Sunday at Falmouth (Mass.) Hospital.
She was 79 and lived in Falmouth.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, said her
niece Charlotte Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Tenure did not come easily for Ms. Owens. Former students and
faculty colleagues alike say she was denied it for years because of
her sex. Speaking to a reporter for the Harvard Law Bulletin in
1988, another professor at the law school, Milton Katz, described
the granting of tenure for her as ``a delayed justice,'' and Ms.
Owens herself said at the time, ``It was a decision that I also
felt was overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for comment Thursday, Michael Chmura, a spokesman for the
law school, said Harvard did not comment on faculty appointments
other than to announce them.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Ms. Owens had gained tenure, said Ms. Harris, her
niece, she was assigned, condescendingly, to teach women's studies.
After a year of that, she refused to teach the subject and returned
to her main interest, international tax law.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Ann Owens was born in Boston and graduated from Boston
Girls Latin School and from Smith College, summa cum laude. She
received her bachelor of laws degree from Yale Law School in 1951
and subsequently became a research assistant to the tax expert
Stanley Surrey at Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   After a year in the office of the secretary of the Treasury in
Washington, she began teaching full time at Harvard. Asked once by
a reporter how she had decided to concentrate on tax law, she said:
``I think at one point Professor Surrey asked me, `What is
creditable tax?' My answer turned into three books.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Owens was the author of ``The Foreign Tax Credit'' (ITP,
1961), which Oliver Oldman of Harvard called ``one of the best tax
books ever written.'' Oldman said the beauty of the work was the
way it organized ``the law into a structured, reasoned whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Owens was also the author, with Gerald Ball, of the
two-volume ``The Indirect Credit'' (ITP, 1975 and 1979).
</P>
<P>
   In midcareer, Ms. Owens also developed an interest in
natural-resources law. She retired in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her sisters Margaret Harris of Falmouth and
Mary Bemis of Randolph, Mass.; her brothers, Cornelius Owens of
West Roxbury, Mass., and Graham Owens of Yarmouth Port; and 15
nieces and nephews, including her nieces Mary Owens and Charlotte
Harris, with both of whom she lived in Falmouth.

NEW YORK TRANSIT FARES SURPRISINGLY WELL IN STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: OPTIONAL TRIM) 
(smw) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While London, Paris and Tokyo are often praised for
the quality of their public transportation systems, a new report
suggests that the New York region fares surprisingly well in the
efficiency of its trains, buses and subways when compared with
these cities.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on a joint three-year study by groups in the
four urban areas, concludes that these mass transit systems share
many common attributes and problems, including highly centralized
rail networks, growing business centers at their urban cores, huge
populations of commuters and severe automobile congestion.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, mass transit in the New York region compares
poorly, particularly in the paucity of service to much of its
suburban ring, which forces suburban residents to rely on cars,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   But for New Yorkers who hold to a common view that the largest
cities of Europe, particularly Paris and London, have model mass
transit systems, the findings of the four-city study may come as a
shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing it shows is that New York has made a good recovery
in the last 30 years in the efficiency of its rail and subway
systems,'' said Bill Shore, a senior associate with the Institute
of Public Transportation, a New York City research group that
carried out the New York component of the study.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the New York region's commuter trains, including
Metro-North, the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit, were
found to be more punctual than those in the other metropolitan
areas. (New York's subways, however, proved less punctual.) All
three New York regional commuter train systems were found to be
punctual more than 90 percent of the time, while the regional rail
network around London, long lauded as an icon of efficiency,
registered only 88 percent on the punctuality scale.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Thursday in the form of a thick compendium
of charts, numerical rankings and other forms of comparative
analysis, was the largest study comparing what are perhaps the
world's most advanced large cities in terms of mass transit, its
authors say.
</P>
<P>
   The other groups participating in the study were the London
Research Centre, the Institut d'Amenagement et d'Urbanisme de la
Region d'Ile-de-France of Paris and the Tokyo Institute for
Municipal Research, all of which received government or
philanthropic grants in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While providing a broad portrait of the vast transportation
systems in each metropolitan area and the challenges those regions
face from urban sprawl, air pollution and other problems, the study
provides many reminders of the differences in how people commute.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, more than 500,000 people ride motorcycles into
Tokyo each day, about 5 percent of its commuting population. But
the report found that only about 10,000 motorcyclists brave the New
York area's highways each day, so negligible a number that the
report called it zero percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study's authors, far more important conclusions
reveal a combination of similarities in transit patterns and huge
problems that must be confronted by each metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among the comparative findings were that New York City subways
lagged their foreign counterparts in punctuality, with 80 percent
of the subways arriving close to their scheduled arrival time. By
that measure, Tokyo's metro system came out on top, with 97 percent
of its trains on time.
</P>
<P>
   The report found a big difference among the four regions in the
breadth of their mass transit networks. While the New York City
subway system has far more stations than the systems in its foreign
counterparts, the report found that its suburban rail network had
far fewer stations than other cities' networks.
</P>
<P>
   Shore said his group had concluded that the biggest challenge
for the New York region was finding ways to lure more suburban
residents onto trains and other forms of public transportation at a
time when there is little hope that extensive new suburban rail
lines will be built.
</P>
<P>
   Near-term approaches to the problem, he said, may include
providing better bus connections and more parking at suburban train
stations.
</P>
<P>
   But Shore said the vast scale of the problem is more likely to
require changes in land-use planning and the rules governing where
housing and other forms of suburban development are built. The
objective, he said, should be to confine development to places
already served by mass transit, instead of extending the limits of
suburban sprawl farther from existing rail stations or bus lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only solution appears to be in finding a way to better
relate housing and jobs to existing public transportation,'' he
said.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: MOVING OUT, SLIPPING BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How about the Los Angeles Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   Or the Houston Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   Could it have happened? Both cities reached deep into their
pockets and told the Patriots that they had the cash, guaranteed,
and were ready to build new stadiums. Los Angeles offered $100
million extra, right off the top, for the Patriots to move from the
New England region.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots will remain the New England Patriots. Out of
Foxboro, Mass., though. Into downtown Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Patriots players had to be informed. And Robert K.
Kraft, the owner, did the informing on Wednesday afternoon. He met
with his team in their Foxboro Stadium locker room and brought a
fancy illustration of the new stadium. He stood among them and told
them he wanted the Patriots to remain in New England. He told them
that moving to Hartford was a good plan for the Patriots' future,
for the Patriots' fans and for the Patriots' players. He said the
move would happen no sooner than 2001 and no later than 2002. He
said the team would likely remain at its current complex in Foxboro
even through the first season or two in Hartford until an office
complex and training center could be built, thus commuting to
Hartford for games. He said they would benefit because there would
be more money to keep more of them as free agents with the team.
</P>
<P>
   More money for us!
</P>
<P>
   Music to the players.
</P>
<P>
   And that was that.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the Patriots, this was not a big deal. For a few,
including quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who is building a
multimillion-dollar home not far from the current stadium, this was
a very big deal. But most of the Patriots would have loved moving
to a larger metropolitan area such as Los Angeles. Those in the
final year or two of their contracts don't know if they will be
future Patriots, anyway. Shoot, some said, beginning play in
Hartford as late as 2002? That is four seasons away!
</P>
<P>
   And, so, they pressed on. Football players do that. They are
more concerned with the present, the moment, the here, the now.
</P>
<P>
   The game. Being paid.
</P>
<P>
   Winning.
</P>
<P>
   And the Patriots lately have not been winning. That is where the
players' concern is. A season that began with a 4-1 record,
including an eye-popping 45-10 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs,
has skidded to a 5-5 season. Just average.
</P>
<P>
   Not what the Patriots expected after being in the Super Bowl
only a season and a half ago. Not after Bill Parcells and Curtis
Martin left and Pete Carroll arrived as coach. Not after last
year's playoff loss at Pittsburgh and then having expectations soar
again this year. Not this stretch in which the Patriots have lost
four of five games and two straight.
</P>
<P>
   So the focus is on this season. How do they regroup?
</P>
<P>
   It all started with their nemesis, Parcells. His Jets came to
town on a Monday night after the Patriots had dusted the Chiefs,
and everything fell apart for the Patriots. The Jets won that game
in the late moments in dramatic fashion and then the Patriots lost
in overtime at Miami. They beat Indianapolis, were then crushed at
home by Atlanta and then lost by 3 points last week at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Players were falling to injury in bunches. Receiver Terry Glenn
(hamstring). Receiver Vincent Brisby (broken finger). Receiver Troy
Brown (ankle). Linebacker Willie McGinnest (groin). On and on and
on, nearly 10 big-name players in all. And not just players falling
but starters. Playmakers.
</P>
<P>
   You take 10 starters, playmakers, from the lineup of any
National Football League team and that team will struggle. And the
Patriots have not been an exception.
</P>
<P>
   The heat has fallen on Carroll. On Bledsoe. Coach and
quarterback. Slumping football teams always result in a glare at
those two spots.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more.
</P>
<P>
   What alarms some within the Patriots' locker room even more is
the sense that some of those injured players possibly could have
played the past few weeks and did not. Did you just hear the word
soft? The players have discussed this topic among themselves. There
is an old line in football that ``you can't do anything on the
pine,'' meaning the bench. If a player is hurt, he is hurt. But
inside the Patriots' locker room, some of the injured are getting
second and third looks from their teammates. Get up. Get going.
</P>
<P>
   And it is very likely that the Patriots will. Glenn _ the key
returnee _ and most of the other injured players are expected back
when New England battles Miami on Monday night. Top to bottom, the
Patriots are the most talented team in the American Football
Conference East Division. They have the experience and the ability
to string together a stretch of victories in their final six games
and roll into the playoffs as a serious threat to the front-running
Denver Broncos. Remember, in the season opener, New England rode
into Denver on Monday night and gave the Broncos some of their best
competition of the season in a 27-21 Patriots loss. When they
earned a trip to the Super Bowl less than two years ago, the
Patriots started their season 0-2 and 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   We're moving, the Patriots players were told by Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   OK, they answered.
</P>
<P>
   And then they looked at each other and said, ``Now, how about
getting a move on this season.'' &QL;

WILLIAMS TURNS DOWN YANKEES' $60 MILLION OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mo.)  (bl) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Yankees offered Bernie Williams a five-year, $60
million deal within the past week, according to two members of the
organization, an offer that was rejected, an offer that some in the
organization said would not be increased.
</P>
<P>
   But Yankees general manager Brian Cashman has a favorite saying
about operating under the guise of owner George Steinbrenner: never
say never. Steinbrenner met with Williams' agent Thursday in
Cleveland in the Yankees' first face-to-face negotiation for the
services of the free-agent center fielder, and there is always the
chance Steinbrenner could find some common ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, however, have made an offer to left fielder Albert
Belle _ the specifics are not known _ and Cashman continues to
negotiate with Belle's agent, who is also talking to the Boston Red
Sox. Cashman has also expressed interest in outfielder Brian
Jordan, who met with club officials Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The talks involving Belle and the Yankees and Red Sox, which
speedily moved along in the last week, could carry over into the
beginning of next week. Belle must decide by Dec. 2 whether he will
sign with another team or return to the Chicago White Sox for the
final three years and $30 million of an existing contract he signed
after the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees seem likely to sign Williams or Belle, but would not
sign both. Jordan is their third choice, but appears to be headed
to the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' visit with Red Sox officials in Boston, initially
scheduled for this week, has been put off until next week. His
agent, Scott Boras, said his meeting with Steinbrenner went well,
commenting, ``We moved the process along and talked about a lot of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The delay will give Williams more time to consider the $60
million the Yankees say they dangled _ an offer that is a
staggering 60 percent greater than the five-year, $37.5 million
offer made to Williams a year ago. Unless the Yankees have
forwarded a more sizeable bid on Belle (Cashman is not commenting),
the offer to Williams is the largest ever made by the team.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee officials say the initial reaction from Boras and
Williams, however, was was not enough. Boras reiterated Thursday
night that there is a vigorous market for Williams, and an
executive for another team said Boras maintained to him that four
teams have strong interest in the center fielder, with contract
offers of as long as seven and eight years.
</P>
<P>
   No team has acknowledged making such an offer. The Red Sox,
criticized heavily in the wake of their decision to end
negotiations with the popular first baseman Mo Vaughn, may be
reluctant to offer Williams more than the five-year, $63 million
deal they placed before Vaughn. A high-ranking official from the
Baltimore Orioles said that team was not willing to pay a salary of
$11 million or $12 million to any player in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks, who have agreed to terms on a
four-year, $32 million deal with Todd Stottlemyre and are deep into
the bidding for pitcher Randy Johnson, may not be willing to offer
Williams the sort of package he seeks.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams with high payrolls are making other deals. The
Anaheim Angels are bidding on Vaughn, the Cleveland Indians are
closing in on a deal for the free-agent second baseman Roberto
Alomar, the Atlanta Braves are considered the front-runners for the
outfielder Brian Jordan, the Los Angeles Dodgers want Vaughn and/or
Johnson, and San Diego officials will fly to Atlanta today to
forward a megabucks offer to another of Boras' clients, pitcher
Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams appear to shying away from Williams because their
own superstars will command huge contract extensions soon: the
Seattle Mariners must cope with the demands of Ken Griffey Jr. and
Alex Rodriguez, and Texas is wary of what the cost of the two-time
most valuable player Juan Gonzalez will be. The market on Williams
seems to have taken the form of a silent auction.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yankees move forward and frantically with Belle.
They have known that Belle wants to become the game's highest-paid
player, and presumably are dangling a multi-year deal worth between
$10 million and $14 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   In other baseball off-season action:
</P>
<P>
   _ The St. Louis Cardinals implemented a major restructuring of
their team, signing two free agents and making a significant trade.
They swapped outfielder Ron Gant, veteran reliever Jeff Brantley
and pitcher Cliff Politte to the Philadelphia Phillies for closer
Ricky Bottalico and journeyman pitcher Garrett Stephenson. With
Gant off their payroll and Jordan headed elsewhere as a free agent,
the Cardinals then turned around and signed outfielder Eric Davis
to a two-year, $8 million contract. The Cardinals bolstered their
bullpen by signing the left-handed reliever Scott Radinsky to a
two-year, $5.5 million contract.

   _ The Baltimore Orioles, scurrying to rebuild what could be one
of the league's worst offenses next season, are talking to the
free-agent second baseman Delino DeShields, and Thursday night they
became the fourth team to play host to Jordan this week. Wednesday
night, the Orioles' owner, Peter Angelos, dined with first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro, a free agent. The Orioles have offered Palmeiro a
three-year, $22.5 million contract, and have expressed a
willingness to perhaps add a fourth year, possibly in the form of
an option.

   Ivan Stewart won his third SCORE Baja 1000 last weekend,
crossing the finish line after the trek from Santo Tomas to La Paz
five minutes ahead of runner-up and defending champ Larry Ragland.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart made the trek in 19 hours, eight minutes and 20 seconds
and averaged 55.91 mph over the rugged course despite having a
throttle-linkage problem partway through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could only go about 85 miles per hour and I had to use my
foot to pull up and push down the throttle,'' Stewart said.
Stewart's vehicle also suffered a pair of flat tires.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 228 vehicles, entered in 23 classes, started the race.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand Oaks' Steve Barlow won the ProTruck class, making the
trip in 23:26.34. Glendale's George Seeley Jr. was second in the
unlimited Baja Bug class.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cox of of Lancaster, Denny Wolf of La Crescenta and Cain
Smead of Quartz Hill shared driving duties in winning the ATV
250cc-or-less class.
</P>
<P>
   Indy Racing League driver Mike Groff of Pasadena teamed up with
Marth Fiolka of Long Beach to take second in the SCORE Lite class.
</P>
<P>
   Other local finishers included Gary Pentis of Newbury Park,
eighth in Class 9, and Neil Manninen of Palmdale, third in the
motorcycle over-40 division.
</P>
<P>
   __ Last dance: Their regular season is over, but one last chunk
of change remains to be contested by NASCAR's Winston Cup drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the regulars will be in Motegi, Japan, on Sunday,
roaring around the 1.5-mile Twin Ring Motegi track. Among those
expected to race are this year's three NASCAR series champs: Jeff
Gordon of Winston Cup, Dale Earnhardt Jr. of the Busch Grand
National and Ron Hornaday Jr. of the Craftsman Truck.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the field will be Dale Earnhardt Sr., racing for the
first time against his son.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one cars will start the race, their starting positions to
be determined by qualifying runs on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Notably absent will be Dale Jarrett, who will be home
recuperating from recent gall bladder surgery. Driving the familiar
No. 88 will be Darrell Waltrip.
</P>

   __ Turkey night moves north: The USAC midget and three-quarter
midget tours make their next-to-last stop of the year next
Wednesday and Thursday at Mesa Marin Speedway in Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   The tours will spotlight the 58th running of the annual
Thanksgiving Turkey Night races sponsored by Agajanian
Entertainment. Last year's Turkey Night races were held at Ventura
Speedway. The event began in 1934 at Gilmore Stadium in the Fairfax
district of L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Wednesday and Thursday races, the tours make one
final stop in Las Vegas on Nov. 28.
</P>
<P>
   __ Not again:Cruz Pedregon ended his 1998 NHRA funny car season
in fashion typical of the way he ran it at last weekend's Winston
Finals at Pomona. Once again, the Camarillo driver and his
Interstate Batteries Pontiac turned in the fastest qualifying time
_ the 12th time he has qualified first in 1998. And once again,
things fell apart soon after.
</P>
<P>
   At the starting line against Jerry Toliver in Sunday's first
round, Pedregon hit the gas when his lights went green _ then sat
motionless watching Toliver quickly become a distant blur.
Pedregon's throttle cable had snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I stepped on the throttle, I thought the car was stuck,''
Pedregon said. ``That was one of the strangest feelings I have ever
experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon's season standing wasn't hurt by the problem. He went
in and came out of the season finale in third place while John
Force won his eighth season title of the past nine years.

SOWARD MIGHT BE STEP SLOW, BUT BRUINS ARE WARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC coach Paul Hackett says R. Jay Soward will not
be 100 percent Saturday because of a sprained ankle _ and the
Bruins believe him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably like (Brian) Polak,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said
of his starting right tackle, also suffering from a sprained ankle.
``(Soward) will play, but you don't know how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a trade-off, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Then Toledo laughed.
</P>
<P>
   While the Trojans haven't figured a way to stop UCLA quarterback
Cade McNown, the Bruins have failed to slow Soward. Two years ago,
he had six catches for 260 yards and three touchdowns. Last year,
he had eight catches for 181 yards, including an 80-yarder on the
opening play.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA won't alter its game plan to stop Soward, but the defensive
backs will be aware of his presence and position at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great matchup for any of our guys,'' said defensive
coordinator Nick Aliotti. ``He's very fast and very talented, and,
obviously, he's a concern. We'll just mix it up and try to do a
good job.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Back for more: UCLA cornerback Marques Anderson returned to
the starting lineup last week, just in time to face Soward in the
second chapter of their fledgling rivalry. Last year, after Soward
burned Jason Bell for the opening touchdown, Anderson held Soward
to 101 yards on seven catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to have my thinking cap on, as well as my blood
running high,'' Anderson said. ``Some receivers, you can relax on a
little bit. But not R. Jay. You never know when the big play is
coming or where it's coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was an opening-day starter, then lost his position
after a lethargic performance against Houston. Ryan Roques played
so well for six weeks that Anderson couldn't regain his spot. But
Roques struggled against Stanford and Oregon State, and Anderson
was reinserted for the Washington game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't disappointed because I knew it was for the better,''
Anderson said. ``I looked at myself and saw I wasn't doing the job
I was capable of. It was more of an eye-opener than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sit back, relax: The mood at Spaulding Field this week,
although intense, lacked the sense of urgency that enveloped
practice before the Washington game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that game was over, there was a deep sigh of relief,''
Toledo said. ``We secured the Rose Bowl and the Pac-10. Now, let's
go cut it loose and have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Smart guys: Five Bruins were named to the Pac-10 All-Academic
team: kicker Chris Sailer (3.33 grade-point average,
communications); receiver Danny Farmer (3.01, history); center
Shawn Stuart (3.61, sociology); guard Andy Meyers (3.37, political
science), and linebacker Ramogi Huma (3.15 sociology).

STARR DEFENDS HIMSELF AND HIS WORK BEFORE THE NATION

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a marathon appearance that opened the House
impeachment hearings Thursday, Kenneth Starr sparred into the night
with Democrats as he defended his four-year investigation of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the evening Starr faced the president's private lawyer,
David Kendall, and for the first time the independent counsel
showed signs of irritation or anger. He heatedly rebuffed Kendall's
hostile accusations that Starr's office had leaked grand jury
information about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, Starr interjected: ``That's unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   The examination by Kendall capped a day of bitter partisanship,
in which Starr, before a national television audience, presented
his case against Clinton in both extemporaneous and rehearsed
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats challenged Starr's tactics and his judgment, and the
motives and fairness of the Republicans who control the committee.
But for all that, they rarely actually defended Clinton directly.
Republicans, for their part, praised Starr often and extravagantly.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day as Starr's appearance marked the beginning of
the public phase of the nation's third impeachment inquiry, he
coolly and in a quiet monotone described himself as a fervent
believer in the law. He spoke for hours in a patient voice that had
rarely been heard in public, replying at length to questions
ranging from details of the Lewinsky matter to how the
investigation had changed his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a man of politics,'' Starr told the 37 members of the
House Judiciary Committee. Instead, he described himself as a man
with ``unyielding faith in our court system _ our system of
judicial review, the independence of our judges, our jury system,
the integrity of the oath and the sanctity, yes, the sanctity of
the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   From the very first moments that the committee went into session
to begin an impeachment proceeding that has little public support
in the polls, the party divide was evident. On a party line vote,
the Republican-controlled committee rejected an effort by Democrats
to give the president's lawyers two hours to question Starr, who
had been granted two hours to deliver his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a grave disservice at a grave constitutional moment,''
said Rep. Bill Delahunt, the D.-Mass., who had called for more time
for Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the committee chairman, offered Clinton
``unlimited time'' in the event he chose to give his version of
events to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting strategies of the two parties _ reflected time
and again during the day _ were underscored almost immediately.
``Do we still have a government of laws and not of men?'' asked
Hyde, R-Ill., as he opened the hearing. ``Does the law apply to
some people with force and ferocity while the powerful are immune?
Do we have one set of laws for the officer and another for the
enlisted?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., the ranking Democrat on the committee,
sought to put Starr himself on trial, accusing him of crossing the
``line into obsession'' in his investigation of Clinton. ``The idea
of a federally paid sex policeman spending millions of dollars to
trap an unfaithful spouse, or to police civil litigation, would
have been unthinkable prior to the Starr investigation,'' the
Michigan Democrat said. ``Let there be no mistake, it is now
acceptable in America to investigate a person's private sexual
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his wife were both out of the country as the
Judiciary Committee held the first impeachment hearings against a
President since the Watergate inquiry of Richard Nixon 24 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was the first witness called before the committee,
although Hyde said Thursday that there would be others. Over the
next two weeks, the Republicans also plan to take closed-door
depositions from four other figures, including Robert Bennett, one
of Clinton's lawyers and Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White House
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   After Starr's morning statement, the White House said he had not
shed light on his investigation. ``He offered no new evidence, no
new information, and no new explanations for his tactics,'' said
Gregory Craig, a White House special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Starr calmly testified and answered sometimes hostile questions
throughout a day that began at 10 a.m. and stretched well into the
night. He rarely seemed rattled, and only once or twice became
acerbic. He defended himself and his office against accusations of
prosecutorial overkill, and he agreed to provide the committee with
a list of clients from his former law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Starr sought to dispel the argument that his case against
Clinton concerned the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
rather than the question of whether he had lied under oath in the
sexual harassment case brought against him by Paula Jones and then
lied before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual harassment cases are often he-said-she said disputes,''
Starr said. ``Evidence reflecting the behavior of both parties can
be critical _ including the defendant's relationships with other
employees in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such questions can be uncomfortable, but they occur every day
in courts and law offices across the country. Individuals in these
cases take an oath to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth. And no one is entitled to lie under oath simply
because he or she does not like the questions or because he
believes the case is frivolous or that it is financially motivated
or that it is politically motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sought to dispel the public impression that he was
responsible for the release of lurid details about the president's
affair, which were exhaustively documented in his report. He said
it was the House itself that had decided to make his report public.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during Starr's two-hour morning presentation, as he
mentioned his other investigations, including Whitewater, Rep.
Sheila Jackson-Lee, D.-Texas, interrupted to ask that Starr be
limited to the Lewinsky matter. She was overruled.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr had finished, Abbe Lowell, the Democrats' senior
investigative counsel, questioned Starr about his ties to lawyers
associated with Ms. Jones and about his office's early contacts
with both Ms. Lewinsky and with Linda Tripp, the woman who set off
the investigation by bringing prosecutors tape-recordings of her
conversations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell contrasted Starr's detailed report, which cited 11
possible grounds for impeachment, with that of the Watergate
prosecutor Leon Jaworski, who had presented Congress with facts but
no conclusions. Starr replied that he was the first to submit a
presidential impeachment report under the independent counsel
statute, and he believed the statute required him to make
judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tool,'' he said of his report. ``This is only a tool
for you to use as you see fit. But I don't think it's fair to
criticize my office for not following a pattern that was not
governed by a statute.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the most spirited exchanges came over the efforts by
Starr's deputies the January day when they first confronted Ms.
Lewinsky to keep her from contacting a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Using Starr's own words for describing the president's evasions,
Lowell asked whether Starr had presented a ``distorted picture of
the facts'' in a press release from his office that said Ms.
Lewinsky had consented to a meeting with FBI agents last January.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, Lowell said the statement did
not note that the young woman was frightened and crying and that
when she asked to see her lawyer she was told, ``she would not be
able to help herself with her attorney there.''
</P>
<P>
   She was, he said, ``threatened with going to jail for, quote, 27
years.'' And when she asked to call her mother, Jackie Bennett, a
Starr deputy said, ``You're 24. You're smart. You're old enough.
You don't need to call your mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't in your statement to the press that day, was it?''
asked Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, drawing laughter, said ``No, it wasn't, Mr. Lowell, and
let me explain what press statements are designed to do.'' At
another point he said, ``Surely you don't think that a witness is
going to say, `Thank you, law enforcement for finding out that I'm
in the middle of committing a felony.'''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, under withering questioning from
Democrats, Starr seemed more defensive about allegations that his
investigators had threatened one witness, Julia Hiatt Steele _ who
has contested Kathleen Willey's account of a sexual advance by the
president _ and said they would examine the legality of her
daughter's adoption.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he said he would answer a written question. At
another point he said that if Ms. Steele had a complaint it could
be resolved in court.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also called it a ``misjudgment'' that one of his
investigators in Arkansas had gone to a high school to subpoena the
16-year-old son of a Whitewater defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Across the afternoon Republicans rose to the defense of Starr.
``What we are seeing here is a desperate attempt to get away from
the facts of the case against the president,'' said Rep. Charles
Canaday, R.-Fla. ``Now I understand that because I find that the
facts are particularly compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Several voiced their sympathy for Starr. ``I commend you for
standing up to the nonsense,'' said Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats showed no such sympathy. Rep. Barney Frank of
Massachusetts asked the independent counsel why he had not told the
public before the November election that he had found no evidence
of impeachable offenses in his other inquiries, which ranged from
the dismissal of White House Travel Office employees to the
Whitewater real estate deal in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said his legal mandate was only to report on evidence of
potentially impeachable offenses. ``In other words, you don't have
anything to say unless you have something bad to say,'' Frank
retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Inglis, R-S.C., gave Starr the opportunity to
emphasize that he considered perjury an impeachable offense, no
matter what the underlying matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say as a former judge, any judge worth his or her
judicial salt would say `Not in my court. Witnesses tell the
truth,'' ' Starr said. ``It doesn't matter what the underlying
subject matter is. Once you're in court, under oath, you tell the
truth. That's the way judges look at the world, and perhaps that's
why no judge being subjected to impeachment for perjury, has dared
suggest 'Don't worry about it. It's not an impeachable offense.' It
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also said that Clinton could be prosecuted for perjury
once he left office.
</P>
<P>
   A few members of the committee questionned Starr about the facts
of his case. Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., questioned Starr's
charges of obstruction of justice. He noted that the White House
had been trying to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job for more than a
year _ not just after she was named as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr said his office had concluded that there had been a
``stepping up of the efforts to get her a job, especially once the
witness list was issued.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once all day did Starr show any discomfort with his role,
when Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif., asked him sympathetically about the
toll his job was taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to be back in private life,'' he said and
recalled the job offer that he once accepted and then turned down
to be law dean at Pepperdine University in California. ``I would
prefer to be almost your constituent,'' he told Ms. Bono. ``A
little bit farther west.''

FORD FOCUS IS OFF TO ROUSING START

  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: also sent in category `a')

 By WILLIAM DIEM   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Ford Focus, a subcompact that is replacing two
distinct Escorts manufactured in Europe and North America, is
Europe's car of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The award jury comprises automotive journalists from 21
countries. Of the 55 members, 42 gave the Focus their top votes,
and it received a total of 444 points, beating the Opel/Vauxhall
Astra (272), the Peugeot 206 (249), the Audi TT (235) and the Volvo
S80 (175).
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the prize vindicates Ford's risky design for the
Focus, especially the New Edge styling _ a combination of straight
lines, curves and planes. The Focus has a clear resemblance to
Ford's Ka city car and its Puma sporty coupe, niche vehicles that
preceded the Focus to market in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The award does not guarantee sales success, but previous winners
have done well. The Fiat Punto (1995), the Fiat Bravo/Brava (1996)
and the Renault Megane Scenic (1997) were all commercial successes.
The 1998 winner, the Alfa Romeo 156, had sales of 76,000 through
the first nine months of this year; its predecessor sold only
10,000 units in the comparable period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Focus replaces two separate platforms for the American and
European Escorts. The Focus went on sale in Europe early last
month, as three- and five-door hatchbacks, four-door sedans and
station wagons. Sales begin next fall in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ford sold 419,662 Escorts in Europe and 323,112 in
North America. A spokesman said Ford expected to sell 1 million
Focuses annually worldwide.

AS SCULPTOR OF NATURE, THE MAN THINKS BIG 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The idea of casting a wild elephant and making its
image in bronze came to the sculptor known as Mihail one night in
the 1970s at his loft apartment in the Chelsea district.
</P>
<P>
   Since being invited to leave his native country, Bulgaria
(Mihail is an independent-minded sculptor), he had been involved in
casting from nature: making a mold of the sand in Tunisia (he and
his daughter almost died of thirst after Mihail used their water
for plaster); making a cast of grass in Alsace-Lorraine.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the sculptor known as Mihail says, he is aware that there
was perfectly good grass in Central Park, but he had in mind a
larger project: casting the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then a new idea came to Mihail: casting an elephant.
</P>
<P>
   This Mihail actually accomplished, sedating and casting a bull
elephant in Kenya in 1980. It took 18 years to complete his
sculpture, and he gave it to the United Nations in a ceremony this
week.
</P>
<P>
   So you can imagine the artist's response when he learned that a
number of U.N. delegates were offended by the size of the genitalia
on his 3{-ton elephant and, after considering surgery, were
planning to surround the sculpture with tall shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it as a joke,'' says Mihail, who despite 25 years in
the United States retains a Bulgarian accent. ``Until I saw,
myself, the bushes being planted. This is exactly the problem
between people and wildlife. They create a frontier. Like the Iron
Curtain, the Berlin Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   A joke from the artist, who, while he glowered often during the
ceremony, does have a sense of humor: ``If I know who started this,
I challenge him to a duel.''
</P>
<P>
   The newest member of the city's bronze menagerie stands in the
United Nations' garden, clearly visible through the iron fence at
48th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, accepting the gift on Wednesday,
quoted the writer Isak Dinesen: ``Elephants pace along as if they
have an appointment at the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihail's elephant looks as if it has an appointment with a lady
elephant, and she's just around the corner, with Sinatra on the
boom box and a bucket of martinis.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this, according to Hans Janitschek, who heads the
fund that raised the money for the project, is medicinal: When the
elephant was sedated, in Africa, ``he had a sweet dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the elephant begins with Mihail, 69, whose family
name is Simeonov. In Bulgaria, Mihail is a successful sculptor of
national monuments. Then, in 1966, he glorifies the wrong man and
is exiled to Tunisia. He settles with his wife and daughter in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of casting an elephant occurs soon after.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to be the biggest creature in the world,'' Mihail
says over lunch with his daughter, Iana, 33, after the ceremony.
``The idea clicked so powerfully in me I never gave it a second
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You also thought about a lion,'' Ms. Simeonov says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I?'' says Mihail. ``Ah well, this is a problem with me. I
have a selective memory. I don't remember things I don't want to
remember and I do remember things that don't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihail continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been reading Rousseau's `Social Contract' and I am very
influenced by it, the idea there is a contract between every member
of society. I knew I had to make some contract between me and the
elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   A word he likes: ``It will be an enchanting thing to make a
contract with the elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mihail then requires someone to speak for the elephant's
rights, he finds a lawyer and creates the Cast the Sleeping
Elephant Trust.
</P>
<P>
   For casting the elephant, Mihail settles on alginate, a
quick-drying casting material used by dentists. (When working with
elephants, Mihail notes, you want to be fast.)
</P>
<P>
   In March 1980, accompanied by two helicopters, 11 chase
vehicles, the Kenyan elephant-immobilization team and a gang of
foreign correspondents, Mihail goes tracking in northern Kenya, on
a 117,000-acre ranch belonging to Adnan Khashoggi, the arms dealer,
who is then underwriting the project. Soon a 50-year-old bull
elephant is sighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not very friendly,'' Mihail recounts. ``The veterinarian gave
him two shots, but he ran for 20 minutes. At one time he tried to
run in a river bed; the helicopter came down and chased him away. A
herd of elephants, hearing an elephant in distress, comes running.
Finally, he stops and stands shaking, and then he falls down.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't Mihail supposed to be representing the rights of the
elephant?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not me,'' Mihail says. ``The trust. I am doing what people
always do. They hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if this project was more in the interest of art
than in the interest of elephants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the total interest of art and elephants,'' Mihail
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mihail says the Cast the Sleeping Elephant Trust will raise
money for wildlife preservation by selling additional sculptures at
$6 million each. So far there are no takers.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any money left in the trust. According to
Janitschek, it cost $500,000 to produce the elephant, and only days
before the ceremony, the Modern Art Foundry of Queens, where the
elephant was cast, refused to release it until an outstanding bill
of $2,000 was paid. The bill was paid by another emigre, Franziska
Sorger, an Austrian pastry chef who owns the Big Apple Strudel shop
on Second Avenue.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was not until the 11th hour of a long and
grueling day of testimony that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
measured, unflappably academic performance before the Judiciary
Committee began to wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, when he got into a knife-edged lawyers' duel with
David Kendall, President Clinton's attorney, Starr's testimony
resounded through the day with anticlimax after all the long months
of salacious news and sensational accusations that have left the
president facing impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel so long out of public sight except for
his morning taking-out-the-garbage photo opportunities finally
stepped forth to speak in defense of his case before a skittish
Congress and apprehensive nation.
</P>
<P>
   Far from offering another lengthy narrative on DNA results and
lurid Oval Office behavior, Starr chose to beam judiciousness and
managed to hide any rancor as he faced minority Democrats aching to
wrestle him into the dock in substitution of the president.
</P>
<P>
   But as he faced Kendall late in the evening, after a day of
calmly weathering the Democrats, Starr could not resist turning
back his attacks, even as he called him ``David'' and smiled. In an
instant, as Kendall asked about the independent counsel's hiring of
private investigators, Starr eyed his questioner and shot back:
``We have never hired Terry Lenzner, David.'' He referred to an
investigator who has looked into the background of anti-Clinton
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a long day's lawyerly calm seemed at risk for Starr,
who similarly could not resist pointing out that Kendall, even as
he complained that he was afforded only an hour to question Starr,
never dealt with the charges against the president but only
attacked Starr's methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dress, the DNA, the test results,'' he said, emphasizing
factual specifics in rebutting one of Kendall's inquiries about
news leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Except for that 11th hour, Starr did not rise openly to the bait
as the Democrats barbed their questions with everything from
mockery to irony. He responded in phrases of high professionalism
and supreme regard for the law, arguing that his proposed case
against the president was rooted not in political bias, but rather
in ``the sanctity, yes the sanctity, of the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, this left Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., fairly
gagging in the hallway during a break. ``Pathetic! Pathetic!'' he
declared of Starr, asking how such proclaimed standards of sanctity
squared with Starr's continued private lawyering in the corporate
sector even as he pursued the president, or his renunciation of the
flood of news leaks that have buoyed the case against the president
for the past 10 months. ``He's much more political than I thought
he was,'' said Meehan as the Democrats warily took their first
up-close measure of the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   It is something of a Capitol Hill tradition that hearing
witnesses often gain the status of victim during a grueling
hearing. As the Democrats peppered Starr into the night with some
shouted salvos of ``Do you affirm or deny'' questions, the
independent counsel, as if mindful of that tradition, was far from
complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Starr wanted to indicate his special position,
according to committee staffers, by being allowed to stand and
speak before the Judiciary Committee at a lectern, as he did before
the Supreme Court when he was solicitor general. But Republican
majority members decided it best he make his case seated at a
table, like any other witness.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats took their opening shots at him frontally,
denouncing him as the nation's ``sex policeman.'' ``Mr. Starr has
crossed the line into obsession,'' declared a scowling Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat, reviewing Starr's four
years of investigating a half dozen presidential portfolios, from
Whitewater to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Neither harried nor hurried, Starr used every minute of his
two-hour opening statement to restate his case against Clinton in
slow emphatic tones. ``Few have ventured that the president told
the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,'' he
declared, savoring the word ``truth'' and the court oath. This
became his rhetorical device at various times in accusing the
president of gravely violating that oath in the sex-and-mendacity
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats aimed to make their points before the watching
national audience. But, still, some seem frustrated in seeking a
promising handhold on Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look like a terrible, horrible person,'' Rep.
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., smilingly conceded during a break. ``He
looked like a lawyer reading a boring, monotonous speech.''
</P>
<P>
   After Starr disowned any personal talent or partisan experience
in the world of politics, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., asked a
series of skeptical questions. ``Why did you withhold that before
the election,'' he asked, referring to the exoneration of the
president that Starr suddenly announced Thursday in several areas
of his investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, patiently, Starr denied all partisan machinations. When
Frank asked about leaks from the investigation, Starr, a former
judge, gently objected: ``That is an unfair question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell me it's an unfair question, why, I'll withdraw
it,'' Frank shot back in mock reverence at Starr's demeanor of
judiciousness.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the hearing, Kendall seemed nettled by Starr and
the feeling became mutual as Starr pointedly noted that Kendall was
spending his time talking about news leaks more than the behavior
of his client, the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like another crack at him,'' said Kendall even as his time
ran out and Starr resumed his judicious demeanor.

PATAKI TO PROPOSE LAW TO PROTECT ABORTION CLINICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Describing the slaying of an abortion doctor in Buffalo last
month as a ``heinous act of terror,'' Gov. George E. Pataki said
Thursday that he would introduce state legislation to protect
abortion clinics from harassment and potential violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor said his bill, which would be nearly
identical to federal legislation passed in 1994, would provide
penalties of up to four years in prison for anyone who
``intentionally injures, intimidates or interferes'' with someone
entering an abortion or other health clinic. The legislation would
also authorize prosecutors to seek civil fines against anyone who
blocks access to a clinic. The governor's aides said that despite
the federal law, state legislation would provide a new layer of
protection for clinics and new penalties for harassers.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's announcement came in a press release from his
office, while Pataki was attending the Republican governors'
conference in New Orleans. It caught both Democrats and Republicans
in the New York Legislature by surprise, and it drew immediate
criticism from anti-abortion groups. Michael C. Long, the chairman
of the state Conservative Party, described it as ``pandering to
abortion extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday night what the prospects were of the
Legislature's passing the proposed bill. Starting in 1993,
Democrats, who control the state Assembly, have passed similar
legislation. But leaders in the Republican-controlled state Senate,
the more conservative of the two houses, were decidedly lukewarm to
Pataki's proposal Thursday night, saying they would consider it
only if it was part of legislation covering all types of public
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are existing laws in place,'' said John McArdle, a
spokesman for Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader. ``If
people are breaking the law and we need to do something, OK, let's
do it across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a matter of politics, Pataki's decision to embrace a bill
_ and so explicitly align himself with forces in favor of abortion
rights _ comes at a time of increasing turmoil for Republicans, in
New York and nationally, on the abortion rights issue. Several
political leaders contend that one of the reasons that Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato lost his bid for a fourth term by a substantial margin
earlier this month was his opposition to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's advisers said that the killing of Dr. Barnett A.
Slepian, who had regularly encountered protesters as he went to
work at his abortion clinic in Buffalo, was devastating to the
senator's re-election prospects. The original Federal abortion
clinic access bill was drafted by the man who defeated D'Amato,
Rep. Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's bill was drafted in direct response to the killing of
Dr. Slepian, the governor's advisers said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's announcement comes at a time when he has been steadily
trying to raise his profile as a possible candidate for national
office. He has aligned himself with moderate members of his party
who contend that the Republicans can no longer be identified with
firm opposition to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's advisers said Thursday night that there were no
national political calculations in introducing the bill, noting
that Republican Party primaries are dominated by voters who tend to
oppose abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's announcement was greeted warmly by both abortion rights
advocates and the leader of Assembly Democrats. ``We welcome it,''
said Pat Lynch, the spokesman for Sheldon Silver, the Assembly
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander C. Sanger, president of Planned Parenthood of New York
City, said he had helped Pataki's advisers draft the bill. ``He's
showing real moral and political leadership here by saying that
violence against doctors and women is totally unacceptable in New
York States,'' Sanger said.
</P>
<P>
   But Long, the Conservative Party leader, who has been a
supporter of Pataki since his first run for governor in 1994,
criticized Pataki in unusually harsh language. He asserted that
such legislation interfered with the rights of abortion opponents,
whose practices include praying and picketing in front of clinics.
He also questioned the need for a state bill when Federal
legislation was already in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pandering to the worst abortion extremists in our
society,'' Long said. He also noted that Pataki announced the
proposal a day after Roman Catholic Bishops meeting in Washington
issued a statement saying they had an obligation to try to persuade
Catholic elected officials who support abortion rights to change
their position. Pataki is Roman Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, the governor's spokeswoman, declined to comment on
Long's criticisms of Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures kept by Planned Parenthood, 12 states and
the District of Columbia have passed their own clinic access laws
since Schumer's Federal legislation was passed five years ago.
Pataki's advisers rejected the contention by Long and other
opponents of abortion rights that such legislation was unnecessary,
saying that the federal government could not adequately monitor
against harassment of clinics across New York. &QL;

STARR'S WORDS FAIL TO INSPIRE FIREWORKS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's highly
anticipated testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on
Thursday did not appear to alter the dynamics of an impeachment
inquiry that has divided lawmakers and failed to ignite much
outrage in an ambivalent public.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the daylong session, it was clear that Republicans
and Democrats on the panel agreed on little, from the format of the
hearing to the fairness of Starr's probe.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, for the most part, calmly parried the
sometimes hostile questioning with lengthy and legalistic answers
that frequently frustrated Democrats eager to paint him as
overzealous prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But he also did not offer any explosive new information likely
to sway members wary of ousting a president on charges of lying
about sex.
</P>
<P>
   As Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., conceded, Starr was not a
``make-or-break witness.''
</P>
<P>
   The historic session was held in the same cavernous chamber
where the Watergate impeachment hearings on President Nixon took
place almost a quarter of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a long wooden table, Starr dominated the morning with
his recitation of charges against the president. The bespectacled
prosecutor displayed little emotion as he slowly read 58 pages of
highly legalistic testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation, however, appeared better suited for the
courtrooms where the former judge usually works than the national
audience watching the hearings televised on all of the major
networks.
</P>
<P>
   While Starr labored to make his case, Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., slipped out to chat with reporters and be filmed by
someone making a documentary on the gay perspective on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   However, another Democrat, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas paid
close attention to the details of the testimony, and interrupted
Starr at one point when he plunged into matters unrelated to the
Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee argued that Starr should not be able to discuss
Whitewater-related issues where the prosecutor had not found that
president committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston lawmaker, however, was quickly overruled by
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who reminded everyone that
the GOP majority in the House had approved an open-ended probe.
</P>
<P>
   While the chairman has frequently stated that he wanted the
inquiry to rise above partisanship, the spirit of comity was
missing from the packed room in the Sam Rayburn House Office
building.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats went on the offensive immediately after the
meeting commenced.
</P>
<P>
   They attacked the Republican majority for allotting Starr far
more time to make his case than they gave the president's lawyers
to rebut it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats later grilled Starr on a range of issues from why his
prosecutors initially discouraged Lewinsky from seeking legal
advice to charges he was leaking grand jury material to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make no bones about it. I think some of the tactics that
have been used are unacceptable,'' Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.,
sternly told Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The portly and generally affable Hyde at times appeared
frustrated with the Democrats' aggressive questioning and
objections.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not try to block them from having their say. And he
tried to inject some humor into the hearings to relieve the
tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will someone protect me from Maxine Waters,'' he joked during
one break.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were also quick to defend Starr, and said the
Democrats were ignoring charges that the president may have
committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, a Republican from San Antonio _ where Starr
was raised _ praised the independent counsel as a dedicated father
with a reputation for personal integrity. Smith said the prosecutor
had been ``unfairly savaged'' by his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the day a weary-looking Starr hinted that the
five-year probe had taken its toll on him. He told Republican Rep.
Mary Bono of Palm Springs Calif., that he often thought about the
law school dean's job he turned down at Pepperdine University in
Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer to be almost your constituent,'' he told Bono.
``I would like to be living my life.''
</P>
<P>
   While Starr's testimony may not have changed many minds on the
committee, his presence certainly captured the attention of the
national media, who filled several rows of seats in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing also drew a number of spectators including,
filmmaker Michael Moore, best known for his documentary ``Roger and
Me,'' which chronicled how General Motors downsized its carmaking
operation in Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he was filming a segment on impeachment for his new
cable television show, a piece that was clearly going to be
critical of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he had previously staged a protest in front of
Starr's home, which included seven people dressed up as Puritans
meant to represent the Salem witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Other less famous spectators who came to watch the hearings said
the partisan squabbling was all too predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats are Democrats. The Republicans are Republicans.
It is too bad,'' said Beverly Keeler, visiting from Worcester,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Others who walked by the hearing room said they had no interest
in the historic inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would rather eat lunch than wait for this,'' said Cher
Kiel, a photographer from New Jersey, who was in Washington to see
the Vincent van Gogh exhibit. Commenting on the White House scandal
and the impeachment proceedings, she snapped, ``It bores me.''

CLINTON PRESSES JAPAN ON TRADE, DEREGULATION IN FINANCIAL REFORMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ President Clinton on Friday voiced confidence that Japan
will work its way out of its worst financial situation in 50 years,
but pressed the reluctant nation on trade and deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, counseling patience and fortitude as Japan enacts
financial reforms, also warned of the prospect of retaliation by
other nations if unfair trade practices continue.
</P>
<P>
   The president arrived in Japan on Thursday for a visit intended
to encourage the world's second-largest economy to embrace the
reforms that not only will help itself but also boost all of Asia,
now in an economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan and only Japan can lead Asia back to stability and
growth by meeting its own economic challenges,'' Clinton told
members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Japan. ``We have every
confidence that Japan is fully capable of restoring growth for this
country and all of Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message to political and business leaders, as well as
to Japanese citizens who questioned him during a televised town
hall meeting Thursday, was the same: Hang tough.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi earlier this week unveiled a $196
billion stimulus package that would lower taxes, increase spending
on public projects and provide merchandise vouchers for the elderly
and young families.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also cited open trade and deregulation as keys to
restoring economic growth. He specifically warned Japan about
dumping hot-rolled steel into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put that against an inability to open more markets, to
have more investments, to have more deregulation, to have more
market access, it will create in our time a condition for a
retrenchment here in a way that will not be good for Asia or Japan
or for the United States over the long run,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing that can happen is if it appears that when
times are tough, borders are closing up, other markets are being
heavily penetrated in ways that can't be justified by economic
forces, and then you're going to have, I'm afraid, a round of
retaliatory protectionism. I'm quite worried about this now,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States became frustrated with Japan during the Asia
Pacific Economic Conference forum this week in Malaysia when the
nation balked at opening forestry and fishing sectors.
</P>
<P>
   During a Tokyo Broadcasting Systems telecast, Clinton urged the
Japanese, who have suffered through an economic downturn for eight
years, to remain patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong Japan is good for you but also essential to the rest
of Asia emerging from its present difficulties. So, don't be
discouraged but do be determined, that would be the advice of a
friend,'' Clinton told the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, the fifth prime minister in four years, later toasted
Clinton at a dinner, making no mention of the uneasiness that has
developed between the two nations because of the United States'
impatience with the pace of Japanese reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Japan is in a period of great transition, which can be
described as the third opening of our country. This transition is a
challenge which entails a major institutional transformation which
is comparable with major restoration and rebuilding of our nation
after the Second World War,'' Obuchi said. ``We are resolved to
face and overcome this challenge with daring.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued to press Japan to take stronger steps to
stimulate its economy as well as to overhaul its banking system to
bail out and close failed financial institutions. He also called on
the Japanese, among the world's most diligent savers, to spend more
freely.
</P>
<P>
   The TBS special round-table discussion with the president was
aired nationally. People selected for the studio audience were
allowed to ask questions that surprisingly focused on personal
issues, including whether Clinton has been forgiven by his wife and
daughter for his extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing weary after a 14-hour flight from Washington, the
president began his official visit Thursday afternoon with a
courtesy call on Emperor Akihito who extended a rare invitation to
the Imperial Residence. Only an official entourage is traveling
with Clinton. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is on an official
visit to Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's overseas departure had been delayed several days
because of the United States' confrontation with Iraq. Vice
President Al Gore attended the Asia Pacific Economic Conference
forum in Malaysia in place of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also is seeking to soothe Japan's feelings following his
trip in June to China. Clinton, at the request of China, did not
visit Japan as part of his trip to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, Clinton and Obuchi plan to discuss threats
from North Korea, which is suspected of trying to develop nuclear
weapons. North Korea recently launched a rocket over Japan, a
provocative move to demonstrate its delivery capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will leave later Friday to visit South Korea and U.S.
forces stationed there. His trip ends Monday with a stopover in
Guam.

 &HT;    Starr defends report, call for Clinton impeachment
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth Starr seemed more
defendant than prosecutor Thursday as the first witness at the
first presidential impeachment inquiry in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Making his case to 37 members of the House Judiciary Committee
and millions of television viewers, Starr calmly responded to
questions about his motives, his ethics and his actions before a
hearing that began with partisan bickering and ended with calls for
more witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Through the grueling 12-hour session, Starr_ seated in a
straight-back wooden chair, alone at the witness table _ vigorously
defended his view that President Clinton should be impeached, at
times cradling his sexually explicit 445-page report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand behind it because it is mine,'' he said. ``I stand
behind each word of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr relentlessly outlined what he said was a pattern of
presidential abuse designed to conceal Clinton's sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``misused his authority and power as president and
contravened his duty to faithfully execute the laws,'' Starr said
in the same hearing room that served as the scene for impeachment
proceedings against President Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also said he believes the Constitution makes clear that
Clinton can be prosecuted once he leaves office for perjury or
other crimes he allegedly commits as president.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's personal lawyer who questioned Starr
near the end of the lengthy hearing, said nothing Starr has
presented is sufficient for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in this overkill of investigation amounts to a
justification for the impeachment of the president of the United
States,'' Kendall said, in a statement that preceded several sharp
exchanges between the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall prodded his adversary for more than a hour, drawing some
of Starr's edgier responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true. You know that's not true,'' Starr said when
Kendall asserted members of Starr's team ``held'' Lewinsky at a
Washington area hotel in January.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats attempted to make Starr the issue, portraying the
independent counsel as an overzealous prosecutor out to destroy the
president, and reluctant witnesses, at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a federally-paid sex policeman spending millions
of dollars to trap an unfaithful spouse, or to police civil
litigation, would have been unthinkable prior to the Starr
investigation,'' said Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the panel's
senior Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Starr has spent $40 million over the last four
years, Conyers said the investigation has made it ``acceptable in
America to investigate a person's private sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was little talk of sex Thursday from Starr, who said
the cover up, not the sexual affair, underlies his case. The rather
tame discourse Thursday differed dramatically from the wealth of
sexual material about Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky in the
report that Starr forwarded to Congress in September that outlined
11 possible grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides tussled repeatedly, with Democrats challenging the
Republicans and the independent counsel almost from the moment the
hearing began shortly after 10 a.m. Republicans, on the other hand,
concentrated on bolstering Starr's assertions and underscoring the
severity of Clinton's alleged misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The displays of bitter partisanship at times tried the patience
of the usually unflappable chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.).
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Starr remained calm in his first sustained
exposure to the American public. In his two-hour opening statement,
he six times intoned the phrase ``that was untrue'' as he
catalogued instances where he asserted Clinton lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, Starr said deliberately that the president swore
to tell ``the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He frequently held his report to Congress aloft for the
committee members and television viewers to see.
</P>
<P>
   Starr came into the proceeding roundly disliked by the public,
according to opinion polls. But after nearly 10 hours in the
witness chair, Starr received a figurative bouquet from Rep. Mary
Bono (R-Calif.), the panel's junior member.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see that behind that image, there's a human,''
Bono said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr drew the biggest laugh of the day when he responded to a
question about a news release. ``Let me explain what press
statements are designed to do,'' he told a group that has had its
share of experience with press statements.
</P>
<P>
   Starr presented relatively little new material Thursday, turning
again and again to his report, which has been bound and sold in
bookstores, as well as blasted around the world via the Internet
since its release.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed the ``professionalism'' of his prosecutors, but
acknowledged the House could reject their work as not being
``substantial, credible evidence'' of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   He found himself both defending Lewinsky's credibility and
questioning it, a point Democrats tried hard to elevate as a major
contradiction in the independent counsel's work.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Starr said he discounted her statement that no one
ever told her to lie and that she was never promised a job in
exchange for her cooperation with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rep. Mel Watt (D-N.C.) raised two other instances in
which Lewinsky may have exaggerated or lied, but which Starr failed
to note in his report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``A substantial portion of your case, isn't it Mr. Starr, is
based on the credibility of Ms. Lewinsky?'' Watt asked. ``How are
you picking and choosing what you believe from Ms. Lewinsky?''
</P>
<P>
   Starr had a ready answer for why he included meticulously
detailed accounts of Lewinsky's encounters with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can answer with one word, corroboration,'' Starr said. ``She
could identify a phone call coming in from a member of Congress,''
even to the point of recalling the congressman's nickname.
</P>
<P>
   The White House sent at least a half-dozen aides to the plush
Judiciary Committee hearing room, which was packed with reporters
and television cameras. White House counsel Charles Ruff and
Kendall, Clinton's personal lawyer, were in the room for every
minute of the marathon hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the attention being paid the proceedings, some
members of Congress professed to be uninterested in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Two senior Republicans, House Majority Leader Richard Armey of
Texas and Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), said they had no plans to watch
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't got time to watch it. I've got work to do,'' Armey
said when encountered in a hallway in the Capitol complex.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's reaction reflected the ambivalence of House Republicans
who are trying to figure out how to handle the impeachment issue
without angering either their conservative base that favors going
forward or the general public, which overwhelmingly would like to
see the matter dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many voices telling us to halt this debate _ that
the people are weary of it all,'' Hyde said. ``There are other
voices suggesting we have a duty to debate the many questions
raised by the circumstances we find ourselves in _ questions of
high consequence for constitutional government.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde tried to get the committee off on a bipartisan footing.
``The hearing today is not a trial. It is not White House vs.
Starr,'' Hyde told the committee. ``Nor is it Republican vs.
Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   But it certainly seemed to be a pitched partisan battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are disrupting the continuity of this meeting,'' Hyde
snapped at Democrats, who mounted procedural challenges at the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   Watt, a sharp-tongued former civil rights lawyer, shot back,
``We're disrupting a railroad, it seems like, Mr. Chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   The main avenue of attack by the Democrats was to show that
Starr had abused his office by, among other things, trying to
negotiate a deal with Lewinsky in January without her attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is not above the law, Mr. Starr, and neither are
you,'' Rep. Robert Wexler (D-Fla.) said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) pointed out that Starr waited until
after the November elections to announce Thursday that he did not
have evidence of criminal wrongdoing in his investigation of the
firing of White House Travel Office employees in 1993 and the
misuse of FBI files by White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Frank said, Starr sent the Lewinsky material to
Congress as the election season heated up.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were uniform in their praise of Starr, expressing
frustration and incredulity that his report has not generated an
outcry for Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common sense and reality are conspicuously absent,'' Rep.
Howard Coble (R-N.C.) said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the committee would have to decide whether lying under
oath is an impeachable offense. ``Is it essentially different from
a garden variety lie, a mental reservation, a fib, an evasion, a
little white lie, hyperbole? In a court proceeding, do you assume
some trivial responsibility when you raise your right hand and
swear to God to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Starr answered clearly that Clinton had lied repeatedly and
that, no matter the subject, the president's lies merit
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) disagreed with Starr, but expressed
one view that appeared to cross party lines. ``There is no doubt
that this is one of the most embarrassing chapters in the history
of the country,'' Lofgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the hearing ended, committee members met to vote subpoenas
for the deposition of several figures with some involvement in the
Clinton sex scandal: presidential adviser Bruce Lindsey; Robert
Bennett, the lawyer who represented Clinton in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case; Daniel Gecker, who represented former White
house volunteer Kathleen Willey; and Nathan Landow, a Maryland
developer and Democratic donor who has been questioned about his
contacts with Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the addition of new witnesses, Hyde said he expected the
committee to conclude its work by the end of the year.

 &HT;    Hearings sought on FPL profit
 &HT;    By Susan Spencer-Wendell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The remote prospect of partial refunds
for Florida Power &AMP; Light customers stayed alive Thursday as state
regulators again recommended investigating whether the utility is
making too much money for itself and its investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Service Commission staff said it had been unable to
negotiate an agreement with FPL, and called on the commission to
open official hearings about FPL's profits, said PSC spokesman
Kevin Bloom.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member commission now must vote Dec. 1 on whether to
open hearings. If those hearings were to determine that FPL's
profits were too high, that could ultimately lead to consumer
refunds. Regulators have not estimated how much money, if any,
would be refunded.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how much money should FPL keep for itself and its
investors, and it revolves around two calculations _ the company's
return on equity and its equity ratio. Both figures have a bearing
on how much money the utility can charge its 3.6 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   FPL's parent company, FPL Group of Juno Beach, is making a 12.5
percent return on equity, which is in the PSC's permissible range
of 11 percent to 13 percent. But the PSC staff contends that rate
is now out of sync with other AA-rated utilities and too high when
balanced with the substantial declines in interest rates. FPL's
projected equity ratio _ the percentage of its value held by
stockholders _ is at 65.7 percent, which the PSC also says is too
high.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, FPL argued before the commission that comparing one
company to another based on equity ratio is not fair because the
comparison should be based on debt. And the power company has noted
in previous arguments before the commission that it had not raised
its rates since 1985, despite adding $10 billion in facilities
since then.
</P>
<P>
   All parties involved in the negotiations have agreed not to
comment on them, Bloom said.
</P>
<P>
   FPL spokesman Dale Thomas did say, though, that the company will
continue to try to negotiate an agreement before the commission's
vote.

 &HT;    Chuck Muer escapes blame for Charley's Crab boating deaths
 &HT;    By Val Ellicott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A brother and sister in Michigan waited
years to tell jurors that Palm Beach restaurateur Chuck Muer was
legally to blame for the boating tragedy that killed their parents
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But they may never get the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a judge in Michigan threw out the lawsuit filed by
the children of George and Lynne Drummey, saying the children
couldn't prove how close Muer's boat was to shore when it sank
during the so-called ``storm of the century'' in March 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Muer, his wife Betty and their longtime friends, the Drummeys of
Grosse Pointe Park, Mich., were sailing to Florida from the Bahamas
when the boat, Charley's Crab, went down in 20-foot seas. All four
were presumed killed, although no evidence was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The distance between the boat and shore was crucial to the suit
against Muer's estate, said Jack Cote, the attorney for the estate.
</P>
<P>
   The Drummey children _ Kimberly Hunt, Patrick Drummey and Shawn
Drummey _ had demanded damages for the terror they said their
parents certainly experienced in the minutes before they died.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that those damages _ for
``pre-death conscious pain and suffering'' _ aren't available under
U.S. admiralty law when a boat sinks farther than 1 marine league,
or 3 miles, from shore. Based on that ruling, issued after the
Drummey children filed their suit, a federal judge dismissed the
suit about six months ago, Cote said. An appellate ruling later
sent the suit back to state court, where it had started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 23, a circuit judge in Detroit dismissed the case, which
Susan Muer, one of Muer's daughters, described in 1995 as a search
for ``blood money.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Karbel, an attorney and personal representative of the
Drummey children, said two of the children _ Hunt and Patrick
Drummey _ plan to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel there was a terrible wrong committed by Chuck
Muer,'' Karbel said this week. ``He either knew or should have
known about the storm.''
</P>
<P>
   The third sibling, Shawn Drummey, is no longer interested in
actively pursuing the suit, Karbel said.
</P>
<P>
   Cote said Muer, 55, was an experienced sailor and never would
have set sail unless he believed weather conditions were favorable.
</P>
<P>
   Cote recalled that the hurricane-force winds of the ``no-name''
storm that sank Charley's Crab took almost everyone by surprise.
The storm also sank a 400-foot freighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position has always been that the Muers and their friends
would not knowingly have started out on a suicide mission,'' Cote
said.
</P>
<P>
   The boat was last seen in the Bahamas by a Coast Guard Falcon
jet the day before it disappeared. The last clue to its whereabouts
was a silent, 14-second cellular telephone call to 911 that
originated east of Lantana at 4:30 a.m. on March 13.
</P>
<P>
   Muer's company owns the Charley's Crab restaurant chain, Chuck
and Harold's restaurant in Palm Beach and other restaurants in
Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Muer's survivors also had questioned a claim by Palm Beach
attorney Garrison Lickle, who billed Muer's estate about $48,000
for time spent helping to search for the missing boat as well as
legal services connected with settling the estate.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Muer children said they were shocked by the
bill and weren't aware Lickle was on the family's payroll. Lickle's
claim ultimately was settled for less than he had originally asked
for, one attorney said. Lickle said the payment went to his former
law firm.

STARR TESTIMONY CHALLENGES L.A.-AREA CONGRESSMEN
</HEADLINE>

(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They have a front seat at history in the making
and, for three Los Angeles-area legislators, it is proving to be a
serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Elton Gallegly of Oxnard and James Rogan of
Pasadena, and Democrat Howard Berman of Panorama City each serve on
the House Judiciary Committee that continued the impeachment
investigation of President Clinton on Thursday with the questioning
of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very intense,'' Gallegly said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important things we have to remember is the
historic nature of this and what the impact will be in the future.
It is not just a case against William Jefferson Clinton. It is a
case that could be setting precedents for cases involving
presidents 100 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman said through an aide that he would not be discussing any
aspects of the hearing while it is occurring.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Berman limited his questioning to whether
Starr had asked a federal grand jury to review or sign off on the
impeachment report. Starr said he had not requested the jury to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan, a former judge, said he was concerned that the
impeachment inquiry make sure that no rights or liberties are lost.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rogan pressed Starr on whether the president
could be charged with perjury for saying he didn't recall certain
information during a deposition.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Starr said a perjury charge could be made if it was
determined the president did know the information.
</P>
<P>
   But the hearings also presented Rogan with a personal problem.
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon interview on National Public Radio, Rogan
bemoaned the length of time the hearing was taking and the impact
on his marriage. Thursday was his 10th anniversary and Rogan didn't
want to miss a planned dinner with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Gallegly added he was not sure how the American public was
receiving the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different world in the hearing room,''
Gallegly said. ``During the morning, I took a break and watched it
on TV and it looks entirely different.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped the hearing would find a bipartisan conclusion,
but he said it appeared as though many of the members had made
their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must ensure that whatever we do will stand up to historical
scrutiny, for what we do is likely to be a model for the future,''
Gallegly said. &QL;

THE EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When UCLA and USC meet on the football field, you
never can be sure who'll wind up blinking in the spotlight's glare
and who'll merely be blinking back tears.
</P>
<P>
   The stars are often humbled and the humble exalted. Some of the
most memorable games in the 67-year series have turned on a tight
end's first catch of the season, a walk-on kicker's nerves, a
receiver's inability to be heard over a crowd's roar.
</P>
<P>
   Selecting the best games in this intracity rivalry is like
settling on the best dish at a five-star restaurant. There are so
many choices, it really depends on one's tastes. Ours leaned toward
the meaningful and mesmerizing; thus, our decision to go with these
seven, one for every year of the Bruins' series winning streak:
1939, 1952, 1967, 1977, 1982, 1991 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The nitty-gritty of those games is common knowledge. The stories
have been handed down from generation to generation like a legacy,
so that someone who habitually forgets his wedding anniversary
(despite having been there) can turn around and rattle off minute
details of a game he never saw. The passion people bring to the
intracity game is what makes it awesome or onerous, depending on
which side of the final score you sit.
</P>
<P>
   For every Bob Robertson, there's a Don MacPherson.
</P>
<P>
   For every Al Carmichael, there's a Paul Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   For every O.J. Simpson, there's a Zenon Andrusyshyn.
</P>
<P>
   For every Frank Jordan, there's a Johnny Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   For every Karl Morgan, there's a Scott Tinsley.
</P>
<P>
   For every Arnold Ale, there's a Reggie Perry.
</P>
<P>
   For every Skip Hicks, there's an Adam Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   Time marches on, except for those for whom it stands eerily
still.
</P>
<P>
   __ First really big game
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine years have passed since MacPherson stood open, in the
right corner of the Coliseum end zone, waiting for fellow Bruin
Kenny Washington's throw. That so much more than the football was
up in the air only added to his anxiety and anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA football team historically hadn't had much success
against its cross-town rival, but in 1939 the Bruins had come into
their own.
</P>
<P>
   They entered the game undefeated and with three ties. USC also
was unbeaten with one tie, which meant that for the first time
there was more than city bragging rights on the line. To the
victors would go the Pacific Coast Conference title, a Rose Bowl
berth and national-championship consideration.
</P>
<P>
   A medium-sized city crammed into the Coliseum. The record crowd
of 103,303 grew so quiet in the first quarter you could almost hear
the football drop when it fell out of the hands of USC running back
Grenville Lansdell at the UCLA 2.
</P>
<P>
   So ended the Trojans' best scoring chance. The Bruins put
together their finest drive late in the game, marching from their
20 to USC's 3. After three successive running plays, UCLA faced a
fourth-and-goal at the 5.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback, Ned Mathews, huddled with his offense.
Substitution rules precluded players from running in plays in those
days, so Mathews was on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Straining his voice to be heard above the crowd, Mathews asked
his teammates for input on the play selection. A field-goal attempt
was out of the question, their confidence in their kicking game
having been eroded by four botched extra points the previous week
against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   MacPherson was sure he could break free, so Mathews called for
the ball to be snapped directly to Washington and for him to throw
to MacPherson. At the line of scrimmage, a USC linebacker cheated
up and MacPherson wanted to warn Washington that it was imperative
he get the pass off quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd's cheering was ringing in his ears and he didn't
want to tip off the defense. And so, to his everlasting regret, he
remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   Washington rolled right before throwing, which gave Robertson,
the defender, just enough time to throw himself in the ball's path
and bat it down before it reached MacPherson. So it was that the
game ended in a scoreless tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I dream about it, I catch that ball,'' MacPherson
said the other day. ``I wish now I had leaned in and told Kenny,
`Throw it quickly.' People talk about that play and they say things
like the pass to MacPherson wasn't complete. It sounds like I
dropped it. It's just tough to take.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Mathews harbors but one regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I wish I had done differently is called a
timeout,'' he said from his Harbor City home. ``That was my
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   __ USC comes up roses
</P>
<P>
   The next time the PCC title and a Rose Bowl berth were hanging
in the game's balance was in 1952. Both teams came into the contest
with 8-0 records. USC emerged unscathed, beating the Bruins 14-12
on two flukey scores.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans tallied their first points when Carmichael, while in
the grasp of tacklers, pitched the football to tailback Jim Sears,
who ran untouched 65 yards to put USC up 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of a safety and a 1-yard run by Bill Stits, the
Bruins pulled ahead, 12-7. They were poised to pad their lead in
the third quarter when they took the second-half kickoff and drove
to USC's 18.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's tailback, Cameron, then tried to throw. He was hit as he
released it and the ball landed, as if deposited by providence, in
the hands of USC's Elmer Willhoite. He carried the ball to the UCLA
8. Four plays later, Carmichael posed as a blocker, then slipped
into the flat, where Sears found him with a perfect pass.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron left the game soon thereafter with a sore shoulder.
Years later, the Bruins remained pained by the loss. Donn Moomaw, a
senior on that squad, would later say, ``If we played them seven
more times, we'd beat them six more times.''
</P>
<P>
   A journalist who covered the game wrote: ``The teams were so
evenly matched it was a shame one had to lose. Too bad they can't
both go to the Rose Bowl and each play a half.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Undone by the run
</P>
<P>
   The 1967 showdown was for the Pac-8 title, all the Roses and the
Heisman Trophy, too.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA was 7-0-1 and ranked No. 1. USC was coming off a loss at
Oregon State that had dropped it from No. 1 to No. 3. The Bruins'
Gary Beban passed for 301 yards and two touchdowns, only to be
upstaged by the Trojans' thundering O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, a junior, brought USC to within 14-7 with a 13-yard
touchdown run that left seven would-be Bruins tacklers grasping at
his wake. It was a singularly sensational effort _ surpassed only
by his 67-yard sprint early in the fourth quarter that put the
Trojans ahead 21-20.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the game ended after UCLA placekicker Zenon
Andrusyshyn had two field goals blocked in the final 10 minutes. So
it was that Andrusyshyn became a sad footnote to arguably one of
the greatest collegiate games played.
</P>
<P>
   His story bears repeating, for as sure as there is another game
in the series on Saturday, there will be a goat. Heaven help him if
he ends up feeling as caged as Andrusyshyn.
</P>
<P>
   Andrusyshyn was so disconsolate immediately after the game, he
couldn't bring himself to shower and dress alongside his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt I had let my teammates down and the university
down,'' he said from his home in Tampa. ``So I waited until
everybody had cleared out of the locker room before I went in.''
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, he eschewed the team bus and bummed a ride
back to campus. As he was walking toward his dormitory, he saw a
group of students setting fire to something. Emotions over the
Vietnam War were running high on college campuses and it wasn't
unusual to see ritualistic burnings of draft cards.
</P>
<P>
   It was only as Andrusyshyn drew closer that he realized he was
being burned in effigy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt almost betrayed,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   His feelings remain pretty much unchanged today. The Bruins'
failed Rose Bowl bid in 1967 has become a permanent thorn in
Andrusyshyn's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just last year there was a story published in a newspaper and
some of the comments my teammates made were a little critical of
me,'' said Andrusyshyn, who played 16 years in the NFL, CFL and
USFL before becoming an ordained minister. ``It hurt me that
they're still harboring (ill) feelings toward me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, just a game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Clutch kick
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks the UCLA-USC clash is war needs to talk to
Jordan. In 1977 Jordan succeeded where Andrusyshyn could not,
booting a 38-yard field goal with 2 seconds left to put the Trojans
over the top 29-27.
</P>
<P>
   These days he works in the insurance business and organizes
historical tours of World War I battle sites on the side. He also
is finishing up a World War I docudrama he started writing long
before Steven Spielberg's World War II drama ``Saving Private
Ryan'' hit the cinemas.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan botched two extra points early in his first game against
UCLA. To this day there are Bruins who insist he never should have
had the chance to atone for those misses.
</P>
<P>
   Ask them their gripe and they'll tell you USC's last drive
appeared to have stalled at midfield when Lynn, a UCLA defensive
back, dived to deflect quarterback Rob Hertel's third-down pass
that was intended for flanker Kevin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In a controversial call, Lynn was flagged for pass interference
and the Trojans were granted a first down on the UCLA 40. Six plays
later, Jordan redeemed himself with a kick that booted UCLA out of
the Rose Bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the football sailed through the uprights, Jordan was
smothered. He managed to walk away unhurt from the pile-on, but one
of the Trojans' assistant coaches, Mike Haluchak, wasn't so lucky.
He broke his nose.
</P>
<P>
   __ USC ends up sacked
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's nose guard, Morgan, was the star of the 1982 game,
sacking USC quarterback Scott Tinsley on a two-point conversion
with no time remaining to preserve the Bruins' 20-19 victory. Nine
years later, another sack, this one by Ale on Perry, would preserve
the 24-21 win that set the Bruins on their current series streak.
</P>
<P>
   How the streak reached six is the stuff of which syrupy
Hollywood movies are made. The Bruins rallied from a 17-point
fourth-quarter deficit to send the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with thousands of nonbelievers from the crowd of 80,644
stuck in traffic outside the Rose Bowl, Hicks broke a 25-yard
scoring run on the first play of the second overtime to give the
Bruins a 48-41 win.
</P>
<P>
   Left tackle Kris Farris couldn't blame the fans for getting a
head start on their evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have left too,'' the junior said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the history of the series know to stick
around until the end. The Bruins have won the past seven meetings
between the two schools by an average of 5.7 points. This year's
undefeated UCLA squad has tested its fans' tickers time and again.
</P>
<P>
   All signs point to another fabulous finish Saturday afternoon
and wouldn't you know, there's one storyline tailormade for this
Tinseltown tradition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Abrams had a 40-yard field goal blocked that would have
won the game for the Trojans in regulation. In the name of Zenon
Andrusyshyn, may he get another chance to set his memories right.

CHAOS ERUPTS AS JERSEY CITY TEACHERS STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY _ Several public schools here degenerated into chaos
Thursday morning when teachers went on strike, leaving the
district's 32,000 students in the hands of principals and too few
substitute teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Classes at all five of the city's high schools were canceled by
midmorning, when students began hurling bottles and bricks, turning
over desks and computers, pulling fire alarms and even assaulting
each other and some substitute teachers. About 200 police officers
were called to the schools; they said they arrested eight students.
In a few cases, the trouble spilled over into the surrounding
neighborhoods, when students vandalized some businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were vandalizing store by store,'' said Nacha Messina,
23, the manager of a McDonald's near a high school. She said
employees cowered at the rear of the kitchen while students threw
the plants in the restaurant, emptied change out of a container on
the counter for charity collections and tried to rip out one of the
registers.
</P>
<P>
   At the district's grammar schools, students were dismissed at
12:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The district had hired fewer than 200 substitute teachers to
cover for the 2,500 teachers represented by the union, the Jersey
City Education Association, which decided to go on strike after
talks with the district over a new three-year contract broke down
Thursday at 1:30 a.m., at the end of a 10-hour negotiating session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely there were too few substitutes,'' said JoAnn Kenny,
executive assistant to schools Superintendent Richard DiPatri.
``There was chaos. It was a tough day.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Martin Greenberg of Hudson County Superior Court issued a
temporary restraining order Thursday afternoon ordering the
teachers back to work on Friday. But district officials will have
to serve every one of the union members with legal notices ordering
them back to work, so they do not expect all of them to return to
their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the possible delay, district officials decided late
Thursday to cancel classes at city high schools and to maintain a
shortened day at the elementary schools. Ms. Kenny said the
district would redeploy its substitute teachers on Friday to make
better use of them in an effort to avoid some of the problems of
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started within the schools, and not on the picket
lines manned by the striking teachers. At several of the high
schools, principals corralled the students into auditoriums and
gymnasiums when the day began and they realized they did not have
enough teachers for most classes. When students grew restless at
being confined for so long, many of them began fighting and
throwing things.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and other union representatives blamed the district,
the second largest in the state, for not planning better for a
strike that union members had authorized several weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should never have opened the schools,'' Thomas Favia, the
union president, said of DiPatri.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and students throughout the city reported problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't lie to you,'' said Althea Benthall, 13, who is in the
seventh grade at Public School 12. ``I was wild. I opened the
windows. I was saying `hi' to my teachers down on the sidewalk. The
substitute teacher would grab us and he'd try to close the
windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students were throwing wet toilet paper out the windows
and screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents came and pulled their children out of school early.
Others let their children remain in school, but said they did not
approve of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be negotiating after school,'' said Omari Abraham,
who came to get his 6-year-old daughter when school ended at 12:45.
``I see signs the teachers are carrying talking about dignity. What
about dignity for the students?''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that the students who were arrested faced
charges varying from criminal mischief to failure to disperse.

   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's highly
anticipated testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on
Thursday did not appear to alter the dynamics of an impeachment
inquiry that has divided lawmakers and failed to ignite much
outrage in an ambivalent public.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the daylong session, it was clear that Republicans
and Democrats on the panel agreed on little, from the format of the
hearing to the fairness of Starr's probe.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, for the most part, calmly parried the
sometimes hostile questioning with lengthy and legalistic answers
that frequently frustrated Democrats eager to paint him as
overzealous prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But he also did not offer any explosive new information likely
to sway members wary of ousting a president on charges of lying
about sex.
</P>
<P>
   As Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., conceded, Starr was not a
``make-or-break witness.''
</P>
<P>
   The historic session was held in the same cavernous chamber
where the Watergate impeachment hearings on President Nixon took
place almost a quarter of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a long wooden table, Starr dominated the morning with
his recitation of charges against the president. The bespectacled
prosecutor displayed little emotion as he slowly read 58 pages of
highly legalistic testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation, however, appeared better suited for the
courtrooms where the former judge usually works than the national
audience watching the hearings televised on all of the major
networks.
</P>
<P>
   While Starr labored to make his case, Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., slipped out to chat with reporters and be filmed by
someone making a documentary on the gay perspective on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   However, another Democrat, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas paid
close attention to the details of the testimony, and interrupted
Starr at one point when he plunged into matters unrelated to the
Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee argued that Starr should not be able to discuss
Whitewater-related issues where the prosecutor had not found that
president committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston lawmaker, however, was quickly overruled by
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who reminded everyone that
the GOP majority in the House had approved an open-ended probe.
</P>
<P>
   While the chairman has frequently stated that he wanted the
inquiry to rise above partisanship, the spirit of comity was
missing from the packed room in the Sam Rayburn House Office
building.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats went on the offensive immediately after the
meeting commenced.
</P>
<P>
   They attacked the Republican majority for allotting Starr far
more time to make his case than they gave the president's lawyers
to rebut it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats later grilled Starr on a range of issues from why his
prosecutors initially discouraged Lewinsky from seeking legal
advice to charges he was leaking grand jury material to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make no bones about it. I think some of the tactics that
have been used are unacceptable,'' Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.,
sternly told Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The portly and generally affable Hyde at times appeared
frustrated with the Democrats' aggressive questioning and
objections.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not try to block them from having their say. And he
tried to inject some humor into the hearings to relieve the
tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will someone protect me from Maxine Waters,'' he joked during
one break.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were also quick to defend Starr, and said the
Democrats were ignoring charges that the president may have
committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, a Republican from San Antonio _ where Starr
was raised _ praised the independent counsel as a dedicated father
with a reputation for personal integrity. Smith said the prosecutor
had been ``unfairly savaged'' by his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the day a weary-looking Starr hinted that the
five-year probe had taken its toll on him. He told Republican Rep.
Mary Bono of Palm Springs Calif., that he often thought about the
law school dean's job he turned down at Pepperdine University in
Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer to be almost your constituent,'' he told Bono.
``I would like to be living my life.''
</P>
<P>
   While Starr's testimony may not have changed many minds on the
committee, his presence certainly captured the attention of the
national media, who filled several rows of seats in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing also drew a number of spectators including,
filmmaker Michael Moore, best known for his documentary ``Roger and
Me,'' which chronicled how General Motors downsized its carmaking
operation in Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he was filming a segment on impeachment for his new
cable television show, a piece that was clearly going to be
critical of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he had previously staged a protest in front of
Starr's home, which included seven people dressed up as Puritans
meant to represent the Salem witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Other less famous spectators who came to watch the hearings said
the partisan squabbling was all too predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats are Democrats. The Republicans are Republicans.
It is too bad,'' said Beverly Keeler, visiting from Worcester,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Others who walked by the hearing room said they had no interest
in the historic inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would rather eat lunch than wait for this,'' said Cher
Kiel, a photographer from New Jersey, who was in Washington to see
the Vincent van Gogh exhibit. Commenting on the White House scandal
and the impeachment proceedings, she snapped, ``It bores me.''

EDDIE ELIAS, 69, SPORTS AGENT, FOUNDER OF PRO BOWLING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ohio)   (bl)  
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eddie Elias, a lawyer who founded the Professional Bowlers
Association in 1958 and later represented sports and entertainment
celebrities, died Nov. 15 at Naples (Fla.) Community Hospital. He
was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The PBA said the cause was complications of pneumonia. Elias
suffered a stroke in 1995 and had been confined to a wheelchair
since.
</P>
<P>
   After the stroke, he moved from Akron, Ohio, to Naples while
Eddie Elias Enterprises, his sports-marketing firm, remained in
Akron. The firm's clients included Don Carter, Dick Weber and
Carmen Salvino from bowling; Tommy Bolt, Chi Chi Rodriguez, Fuzzy
Zoeller, Gary McCord, Ken Venturi and Bob Murphy from golf; Rony
Seikaly from basketball and Ralph Nader, Phil Donahue, Marlo
Thomas, Chris Schenkel and Phyllis George.
</P>
<P>
   Elias was best known for his role in lifting bowling from a
blue-collar recreational activity in dingy, smoke-filled alleys to
television's second-longest-running professional sport behind
college football.
</P>
<P>
   While working his way through Case Western Reserve Law School in
Cleveland, he was a radio and television producer and performer at
WAKR in Akron and WESW in Cleveland. One day, on ``The Eddie Elias
Show'' in Akron, he was interviewing Don Carter, perhaps the most
celebrated bowler ever, and Dick Hoover, who had just won the
All-Star tournament, the predecessor of bowling's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when 10 percent of the U.S. recreational dollar was
being spent on bowling, Carter and Hoover bemoaned the absence of
an organization that could run a tournament circuit. Elias decided
to change that, and at the 1958 American Bowling Congress Masters
tournament he persuaded 33 professional bowlers to put up $50 each
to start the PBA.
</P>
<P>
   As the PBA's legal counsel, Elias nurtured the organization and
the sport. In 1965, he persuaded the maker of Firestone tires to
sponsor bowling's most elite annual competition, the Tournament of
Champions, one of the first corporate sponsorships of a national
sports event.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, television had difficulty selling
advertising time for sports events. Elias realized that bowling
needed television more than television needed bowling, and under
his guidance the PBA started selling at least 80 percent of the
advertising time on its own. With those contracts in his hands,
Elias then negotiated with the television networks to carry the
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really started out of necessity,'' Elias said of the
sell-your-own philosophy. ``Without TV, we were out of business.
But I knew a network couldn't refuse something with most of the ad
time already sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Elias also marketed such television series as ``Jackpot
Bowling,'' ``Make That Spare'' and, with Marlo Thomas, ``That
Girl.'' As Donahue, the talk-show host, said, ``Long before free
agency, long before pro sports rose to billion-dollar levels, there
was Big E, bargaining his heart out for big and small clients
alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward George Elias was born Dec. 12, 1928, in Akron, and at 6
feet 2 inches he played baseball and basketball at the University
of Akron. He was a member of the ABC Hall of Fame and the PBA Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Peggy Emerson; two
daughters, Rainy of Akron and Annie of Chicago, and three sisters,
Jackie Wilson, Norma Balaj and Nancy Stevens, all of Akron.

DEMOCRATS ASSAIL STARR'S `OBSESSION' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth Starr told a partisan,
contentious House Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday that
President Clinton ``misused his authority and power'' to thwart
investigations into his White House affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   While Starr and committee Republicans targeted Clinton,
Democrats on the panel _ aided by the president's private attorney
_ took aim at Starr and his team of investigators, saying they
mishandled the Lewinsky probe and ``crossed the line into
obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing as the leadoff witness in only the third presidential
impeachment inquiry in U.S. history, Starr told committee members
that regardless of the outcome of their investigation Clinton could
be prosecuted for perjury after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the day Starr dryly defended his team of
investigators and the methods they used to investigate Clinton's
efforts to hide his affair with Lewinsky. Late in the evening,
Starr's temper grew short and his answers became more terse as he
went head-to-head on national television with Clinton's personal
lawyer, David Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is false, and you know that it is false,'' Starr snapped
at Kendall, who accused the prosecutor's deputies of misconduct in
their dealings with Lewinsky. ``I am confident that we have abided
by our obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the committee's Democrats, Kendall focused largely on
Starr's conduct and the tactics used by prosecutors and FBI agents
assigned to his office. At one point, Starr interrupted Kendall's
cross-examination and turned to committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., saying: ``It's time for some fairness with respect to all
of these charges that keep getting bandied about.''
</P>
<P>
   The first 2 1/2 hours of Starr's testimony involved his reading
a 58-page summary of his investigation and how in January it turned
from Clinton's business dealings in Arkansas to his affair with
Lewinsky, who _ when their trysts began _ was a White House intern
and later a government employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``On at least six different occasions ... the president had to
make a decision. He could choose truth, or he could choose
deception,'' the special prosecutor said. ``On all six occasions,
the president chose deception.''
</P>
<P>
   With each decision, Starr said, Clinton created the crisis
threatening his presidency. ``The president's intimate relationship
with a subordinate employee was transformed,'' Starr said. ``It was
transformed into an unlawful effort to thwart the judicial process.
This was no longer an issue of private conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, for the first time, Starr acknowledged that the five-year
investigation of Clinton, which began with his Arkansas business
dealings, have found no criminal wrongdoing by the president or
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the White House travel-office
firings or misuse of FBI files.
</P>
<P>
   Although his staff last year drafted an impeachment report
alleging that Clinton lied under oath during the Whitewater
investigation, Starr said he decided the evidence against the
president was not strong enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those matters will in fact not be coming to you,'' Starr said,
referring to the law requiring him to notify Congress when his
investigation turns up crimes involving the president.
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., asked why Starr had not told
the public before the fall elections that he had found no evidence
of impeachable offenses in the Whitewater, FBI files and travel
office cases, the prosecutor responded that the law did not require
him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, you don't have anything to say unless you have
something bad to say,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's testimony was the first heard by the full committee
since the House voted for an open-ended impeachment investigation.
The inquiry was prompted by Starr's report to the House in early
September alleging 11 possible offenses that could warrant the
president's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Starr began testifying Thursday morning, he came
under a withering attack by the committee's ranking Democrat, Rep.
John Conyers of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Starr a ``federally paid sex policeman spending millions
of dollars to trap an unfaithful spouse,'' Conyers said the
independent counsel engaged in unacceptable tactics by forcing
Lewinsky's mother to testify, lawyers to testify against their
clients and Secret Service agents against the president they
protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``While an independent counsel can and should pursue a case with
vigor, I and many others believe that Mr. Starr has crossed the
line into obsession,'' Conyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, chief lawyer for the committee's Democrats, drew a
touch of sarcasm from Starr when raising questions about actions
taken by his deputies during their first contacts with Lewinsky and
Linda Tripp, the woman who secretly taped the intern's telephone
conversations
</P>
<P>
   On those tapes Lewinsky said she planned to lie about her
relationship with the president in a sworn deposition in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment case and urged Tripp to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said his deputies' treatment of Lewinsky during their
first encounter _ which Democrats have charged was too harsh _
relied on standard law-enforcement techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a felon in the middle of committing another felony,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor also denied that his office had leaked secret
grand jury testimony to the media or hidden his contacts with
Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were far more gentle, and lauded Starr for his
unflappable responses to questions from the Democratic House
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I commend you for standing up to the nonsense ... that you
have had to put up with today,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia
Republican who is among Clinton's most ardent critics.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said the Democrats were off the
mark and accused them of firing ``drive-by questions'' at Starr.
``I think what we're seeing here is a desperate attempt to get away
from the facts of the case against the president,'' Canady said.
</P>
<P>
   When the committee hearing began, Rep. William Delahunt,
D-Mass., sought to expand the time allocated to the White House to
question Starr from 30 minutes to two hours, but committee
Republicans voted down the proposal. Republicans insisted on a
strict timetable, but as the day wore on Hyde used his discretion
to extend members extra time to question Starr. Kendall eventually
was given a full hour to grill the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde announced plans to vote after Starr's testimony on whether
to subpoena other witnesses. Republicans _ who have the votes to
set the committee agenda _ want to question Deputy White House
counsel Bruce Lindsey, the president's closest confidant, and
Robert S. Bennett, a private attorney who represented Clinton in
the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr began his 11 1/2 hours of testimony, Clinton was on
the other side of the world on a five-day visit to Asia. White
House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton did not watch any
of the live television coverage but saw one short clip from Starr's
testimony during a news broadcast.

PATRIOTS' MOVE TO HARTFORD: LUXURY SEATS CALLED KEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New England Patriots' proposed move from the Boston area to
the much smaller Hartford, Conn., market could make the team much
richer, but only if the team can sell out the luxury seating
planned for a 68,000-seat stadium, stadium experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed $350 million stadium would have 125 to 150 luxury
suites, and 6,000 club seats, which typically feature comfortable
chairs and waiter service.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hartford market, which saw the Whalers hockey team leave
last year for North Carolina, is the 27th largest in the country,
with 915,770 households, according to Nielsen Media Research. The
Boston market has nearly 2.2 million households.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an immense amount of luxury seating for that market to
absorb,'' said Mark Rosentraub, director of the Center for Urban
Policy and the Environment at Indiana University. ``The real
downside is if they can't sell it all and need an extra state
subsidy.''
</P>
<P>
   A move to Hartford would add another National Football League
team to the ranks of those that have moved to smaller markets in
the 1990s, drawn by the lure of stadium leases that confer almost
all the revenue upon the team. The Rams and Raiders left the Los
Angeles area, the second largest market, for St. Louis, the No. 21
market, and Oakland, which is part of the No. 5 market,
respectively. The Oilers were lured to Tennessee from Houston, the
11th largest market, and will start the 1999 season in a new
stadium in Nashville, the No. 33 market.
</P>
<P>
   And Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell took the team from the
13th largest market to Baltimore, the 23rd largest. The newly named
Ravens play in a stadium paid for largely through state lottery
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders' return to Oakland has been fraught with
difficulties in selling luxury seating and season tickets. But the
other moves have been largely successful because they tapped into a
fan base hungry for a first crack at pro football, like Nashville,
or eager to get a team back, like Baltimore, whose Colts bolted for
Indianapolis in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to Hartford is really trading down,'' said Rosentraub,
who added that a concern for the Patriots should be whether it can
continue to tap into the corporate wealth of the Boston market for
its luxury seating while playing 85 miles away in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kraft, the team's owner, said the renters of the 35
luxury suites in the Patriots' current stadium, in Foxboro, Mass.,
are scattered around the region. But the Hartford suites would be
more plentiful and more expensive, requiring the team to draw a
broader, wealthier clientele than it currently taps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 25-mile radius around Hartford isn't that strong, but when
you expand it to 75 miles it's better,'' said Marc Ganis, the
president of SportsCorp Ltd., a Chicago-based consulting firm. ``If
they can tap into Fairfield County, with its Fortune 100
headquarters, to sell luxury suites and club seats, that would be a
big plus. But it's a big challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, who bought the Patriots nearly five years ago, declined
to say whether he had received any advance guarantees from
corporations to lease the luxury suites. But he said: ``We think
we'll be able to sell the luxury suites out before the stadium is
finished. We've done the studies. We feel the location can support
the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Bonham, head of the Bonham Group, based in Denver, said:
``You can have a $350 million stadium, 150 luxury boxes and a sweet
lease, but if not enough people show up, you have a problem. I hope
they're doing good market research on the fan base.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Patriots-Hartford deal is a distinct wrinkle in the
game of threats and cajolery that team owners play, pitting city
against city for the best stadium deal possible. Kraft wanted to
stay in his region _ he even wanted to use his own money to build a
stadium in South Boston, which is rare among owners _ but got
caught in the politicking in the Massachusetts legislature and
found a more kindly reception in Connecticut. ``If we couldn't
solve this problem for New England, I'd have to put the team up for
sale, which I didn't want to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By being lured to Hartford with a plan that requires him to pay
only 10 percent of gross revenues, Kraft could reap a windfall like
those being received by teams in new stadiums, raising his stadium
income to between $20 million and $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bonham suggested that the Connecticut agreement could be the
leverage Kraft needs to stay in Massachusetts. If Kraft tried to
move elsewhere between now and Dec. 31, he would forfeit $2 million
now in escrow. ``The $2 million would be an inexpensive price for a
deal in Massachusetts,'' Bonham said. The move to a smaller market
will have no appreciable effect on the team's broadcast income
because all television deals with the NFL are done on a national
basis.

ACTION, NOT WORDS FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Since USC is a Nike school, perhaps it's
appropriate that the Trojans have adopted a ``Just do it''
philosophy about playing UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the team's leaders have refrained from fiery
speeches, group meetings or visual reminders to underclassmen about
the Trojans' seven-game losing streak to the Bruins. All have been
tried in recent years, without success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to go out and lecture someone about how important
this game is, then they don't need to be here and they don't need
to be on the field,'' senior Daylon McCutcheon said. ``A dog has it
naturally in its genes that it hates cats. That's how it is when
you're a Trojan. I never wanted to be a Bruin. I don't think I
should have to talk to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon's sentiments were echoed by senior wide receiver
Billy Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't talk about it, you've got to be about doing it,''
Miller said. ``We've got to go out there and prove it. We've got to
go out and play the best game of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Soward update No. 101: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward did some
light running again Thursday, leading to differing opinions on his
ability to play in Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really encouraged by what he did,'' Hackett said. ``I
think we'll have him throwing with Carson (Palmer today). R. Jay at
80 or 85 percent is still pretty good. I'm going to anticipate
having him with two more days of treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are much less optimistic, believing Soward is far from
ready to play, especially with such minimal practice time.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he did not anticipate Soward receiving an
anti-inflammatory injection before the game. Soward has already
received three in his right ankle and tried seeing a chiropractor
to speed up his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Soward pretended to stagger off the practice field with a
pronounced limp Thursday, to exaggerate his condition.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he would be ``shocked'' if Soward watched the game
in street clothes.
</P>
<P>
   __ No cardinal: Hackett was surprised to learn that the Trojans
no longer wear cardinal jerseys when they play UCLA as the road
team. The last time he coached in the game in 1980, the NCAA
allowed both schools to wear their home jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   __ Receivers ready: Aside from Soward, USC should be in fairly
good shape with its receiving corps. Mike Bastianelli will play but
will have to wear a brace on his knee after suffering a sprained
medial collateral ligament against Stanford. ``I'm out here running
around, I'm playing,'' Bastianelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Quincy Woods is also available after being out much of the
season with a sore knee.
</P>
<P>
   __ All-Academic team: Tailback Chad Morton and kicker Adam
Abrams were named first-team members of the Pacific-10 Conference
All-Academic team. Brennan Ochs and Mike Van Raaphorst were named
honorable mention.

ARLEDGE HONORED  
 JURY DUTY GETS STAR TREATMENT  
 BITING THE HAND, ETC.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rotunda of the Low Memorial Library at Columbia
University was transformed into media land on Wednesday night, with
the spotlight on ROONE ARLEDGE, the once and venerable head of ABC
Sports and ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Arledge, who stepped down as chief of ABC News in June, is a
1952 Columbia alumnus who has been credited with revolutionizing
network news coverage in a 30-year career at ABC.
</P>
<P>
   So as DIANE SAWYER, BARBARA WALTERS, CONNIE CHUNG and several
hundred luminaries of print and broadcast journalism paid homage,
Arledge was awarded Columbia's Alexander Hamilton Medal, the
highest award bestowed by the alumni association.
</P>
<P>
   The normally staid library was outfitted with a giant screen for
watching a videotape of the honoree's career, and for the first
time anyone could remember, a sound system that tamed its
acoustical idiosyncrasies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, everyone clearly heard TED KOPPEL sing an a
cappella accolade to the tune of ``My Heart Belongs to Daddy'':
</P>
<P>
   He set the stage
</P>
<P>
   For this new age,
</P>
<P>
   There's no other man who could do it.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote this tune
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate Roone,
</P>
<P>
   'Cause we couldn't get Don Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt produces ``60 Minutes'' for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Arledge responded with an anecdote, quoting his mother: ``You
know there is so much garbage on TV. I am so proud of you. I always
knew you would rise to the top of the heap.''
</P>
<P>
   Jury Duty Gets Star Treatment
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Justice may be blind, but jurors sometimes see stars.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT De NIRO and HARVEY KEITEL were among those summoned to
jury duty in Manhattan this year and they were back Thursday to
pose for pictures as part of the city's third annual Juror
Appreciation Day.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel and De Niro looked more like defendants, unshaven and in
sneakers, jeans and leather jackets. Neither had been impaneled,
and each was sheepish and short in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a system that has to work,'' De Niro said.``The only way
it works is if everybody's involved in it, so I'm for it.''
</P>
<P>
   De Niro attracted the most flash photography, but another guest,
IRV GIKOFSKY, the television weatherman known as G., got all the
laughs. ``I work three minutes a day,'' he said. ``Fifteen minutes
a week. An hour a month.'' Jury duty, with its hourlong commuting
and full-day waiting, is too much, he said, adding: ``I need a nap.
All I can tell you is, it's going to be cloudy this afternoon. And
it's going to rain tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Biting the Hand, Etc.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It seems that everywhere MARILYN MODE, the Police
Department's deputy commissioner for public information, goes, Lil,
her little white dog, is sure to go, too. Lil has toured the city's
station houses and gone on gang-busting raids. But Lil's presence
at headquarters has not always been popular. Sometimes she barks.
One time, she became the prime suspect in the case of the
policeman's missing lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a new complaint. According to three officers who
insisted on anonymity, Lil bit a sergeant on Wednesday. Although
the dog never broke flesh, they said, some wondered if Lil's days
at work were numbered. Lil may now meet the Patrol Guide's
definition of a dangerous dog: ``any dog that, when unprovoked,
approaches, or menaces, any person in a dangerous or terrorizing
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mode was out of town Thursday and could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that they were not sure whether Lil was
covered by the 48-hour rule, which gives department members two
business days before they can be interviewed about potential
misconduct.

U.S. IS URGED TO BAN VINYL TOYS FOR SMALL CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to insert hyphen in Health Canada web address; hcsc should be

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twelve consumer, environmental and religious
organizations asked the Consumer Product Safety Commission on
Thursday to ban vinyl toys for small children, four days after
Canadian officials advised parents of small children to throw away
vinyl teethers and rattles, because of possible kidney and liver
damage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 28 members of Congress signed a letter to President
Clinton asking whether the Commerce Department is lobbying to keep
European markets open to vinyl toys, and urging that the lobbying
stop if it was doing so. Several European countries have put
restrictions on the use of vinyl in toys, partly in response to a
sustained campaign by Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   Even though scientists do not agree on whether vinyl toys are
safe, some toymakers and marketers have stopped selling them. Toys
R Us said this week it had removed toys with vinyl that are
intended to be mouthed by infants.
</P>
<P>
   But toy manufacturers argued that the material was safe. As a
practical matter, manufacturers said, teethers and some other small
objects made by injection moulding can be made from vinyl-free
plastics; more complex shapes, like rubber ducks or teddy bears,
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The material at issue is polyvinylchloride, or PVC, which is
familiar to consumers as a material used for pipes and other rigid
parts, mixed with a ``plasticizer,'' to make it soft. Since the
mid-1980s, the industry has used a material called DINP, because a
material used up to that time, DEHP, was found to cause health
damage to rodents at high doses.
</P>
<P>
   More recent studies show that the substitute material produces
similar effects in rodents, but chemical manufacturers say that the
damage occurs by a mechanism that is not relevant to humans, and
that both materials are safe.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The CPSC, which brokered the deal in the mid-'80s that ended the
use of DEHP, said Thursday it was conducting research on how much
dose a toy could give a child, and reviewing the animal studies
that showed health damage, and hoped to make an announcement soon.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Thursday was made by the National Environmental
Trust, whose president, Philip Clapp, said it was unacceptable that
American parents would have to go to a Canadian web site to get
authoritative government advice on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   (Health Canada's advisory is available at
www.hc-sc.gc.ca/advisory/index.htm).
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, even steps like the ones taken by the Canadian
government and Toys R Us were inadequate, because they only covered
items that were intended to go into a baby's mouth. ``Infants and
toddlers don't distinguish between toys intended for the mouth and
all other toys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Mattel, Inc., of El Segundo, Calif., said it would
phase out the plasticizers in teeth toys for children under 36
months. Thursday the National Environmental Trust listed two of its
products as having particularly high levels of DINP, but neither
was covered by the phase out. The toys were the arms of Rugrats
Tommy Pickles Ice Cream Face doll, and the shoes of Cabbage Patch
Kids Starr Rosie Doll.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel did not respond to a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   David Miller, a spokesman for the Toy Manufacturers of America,
an industry trade group based in New York, said that the
plasticizers had been thoroughly studied, used for years and
represented no risk. He said the Canadian authorities had grossly
overestimated the amount of dose a child could get from chewing on
such a toy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the product should be banned until proven safe, he
said, ``on that logic you can rule out half the products sold in
the United States today.''
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating the uncertainty, Dr. Cathey Falvo, a pediatrician
representing Physicians for Social Responsibility who spoke
Thursday in favor of a ban, said that some health effects might not
turn up for decades.

NEW YORK UNION IS BEING INVESTIGATED FOR VOTE FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Manhattan district attorney is investigating
allegations that officials at District Council 37, the umbrella
group representing 120,000 New York City municipal employees,
committed extensive vote fraud in 1996 to win ratification of a
widely criticized contract that included a two-year wage freeze,
lawyers knowledgeable about the investigation said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers said a union leader had told prosecutors that
officials at a large local of clerical workers stuffed ballot boxes
with fraudulent ballots to ensure ratification of the five-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Arthur Schwartz, who represents several of the
council's 56 locals, said Joseph DeCanio, president of a local
representing highway workers, told prosecutors about the vote fraud
as part of a broad investigation into allegations of embezzlement,
kickbacks and other misdeeds at the council.
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer knowledgeable about the investigation said
DeCanio has told the district attorney that the ballot-box stuffing
involved thousands of votes and was instrumental in putting the
contract over the top by a considerable margin.
</P>
<P>
   DeCanio, the lawyers said, has also told prosecutors that he saw
thousands of blank ballots in a union leader's office and has said
he believed those ballots were part of a scheme to tip the
ratification vote, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ratification of the contract was important to the council's
executive director, Stanley Hill, because rejection would have
embarrassed him before his members and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at a
time when the union leader was trying to solidify his relationship
with the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The contract also proved to be pivotal for Giuliani. He had
relied heavily on its two-year wage freeze to end the city's budget
deficit, and he has pointed to the contract with the largest
municipal union as the cornerstone of his peaceful relations with
labor.
</P>
<P>
   That contract set a pattern for contracts later accepted by
unions representing the city's other 180,000 workers, including
firefighters and sanitation workers. It also smoothed the way for
Giuliani's winning the endorsement of Hill and the council in last
year's mayoral election.
</P>
<P>
   DeCanio's statements to prosecutors echoed allegations of vote
fraud that James Butler and Charles Ensley, the leaders of two of
District Council 37's largest locals, made immediately after the
ratification 33 months ago. They said then that they were surprised
at how many votes for ratification came from the clerical union,
the same local that DeCanio has identified as the center of
suspected ballot-stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   But until DeCanio began talking with prosecutors earlier this
month, there were no specific allegations to back up the
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   DeCanio declined to comment despite repeated requests for
interviews, and his lawyer, Debra Cohen, said she would neither
confirm nor deny that he had spoken to the district attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, has
subpoenaed records from all 56 locals in the council and is looking
into the disappearance of millions of dollars from union coffers.
The parent union, the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees, has already expelled the president of one
local after a union panel found that he had embezzled more than
$1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall officials declined to comment, saying the ratification
vote was an internal union matter.
</P>
<P>
   Labor experts said that even if the fraud allegations were
proved, the contract would remain in force, because the district
council's leadership had signed the contract and the city has
carried out its end of the deal.

MORGAN STANLEY PLANS ITS THIRD TOWER IN TIMES SQUARE AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. signed a deal
Thursday to build a million-square-foot office tower on Seventh
Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, creating a pinstriped
corporate campus in what was once the unlikeliest of locations:
Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The planned 33-story glass skyscraper, tentatively named Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter Plaza, would be the giant financial service
company's third building at the northern end of the Times Square
area, where peep shows and T-shirt shops have given way to new
theaters, restaurants, hotels and MTV. The tower would rise on what
is now a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley signed an agreement Thursday afternoon with the
current landowner, the Rockefeller Group, after 11 months of
on-again, off-again negotiations. Under the terms of the deal, the
tower would be developed as a joint venture of Morgan Stanley and
the Rockefeller Group, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Estate Co.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Kohn Pederson Fox, the new tower will be the latest
element of a building boom that has swept through Times Square. The
Planet Hollywood Hotel is under construction at the southwest
corner of Broadway and 48th Street, along with movie theaters,
theme restaurants and a Madame Tussaud's museum on 42nd Street.
Douglas Durst, the developer, is completing the first new office
tower in Manhattan since 1992, on Broadway between 42nd and 43rd
Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Two other towers may soon loom over Times Square as well.
Bertelsmann AG is inching closer to a deal to build a new home for
Random House at Broadway and 45th Street and the newly combined
Nasdaq and American Stock Exchange may build a headquarters and
trading floor at 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times Square has become a center for financial, legal and
entertainment companies,'' said Peter Riguardi, executive vice
president of Colliers ABR, a real-estate broker that represented
Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   The new Morgan Stanley tower will sit across the street from the
investment bank's building at 750 Seventh Ave. and only a block
north of the company's 43-story headquarters at 1585 Broadway,
between 47th and 48th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   The design for the building is nearing the end of the city's
land use review process, although Morgan Stanley may revise the
plans and begin the process again. The tower would include retail
stores at the base, an entrance to the subway, a plaza with a large
reflecting pool and the kind of large neon signs required in the
Times Square district. Morgan Stanley's headquarters is festooned
with a three-line stock ticker.

21 PERCENT RAISE PROPOSED FOR N.Y. JUDGES
</HEADLINE>
   (smw) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York State's chief judge proposed a 21 percent raise for
state judges Thursday as part of an annual budget proposal that the
judge submits to the legislature and Gov. George Pataki for
approval.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether lawmakers and the governor will approve
the request or even when they might take it up for consideration.
The timing of the announcement by Chief Judge Judith Kaye suggested
that she would like legislators to consider pay increases for
judges if they decide to reconvene next month to vote raises for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers are usually reluctant to talk publicly about
raises, there is reason to suspect that they might return to Albany
in a few weeks to increase their pay. Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver, who has already endorsed raises for legislators and state
executives, would also support increases for judges, said Silver's
spokesman, Pat Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, the legislature cannot vote itself raises
during its two-year term. Because legislators may approve raises
only for a subsequent term, any increase for the next two years
must be voted before Jan. 1, when the next term begins. If the
window is missed, lawmakers cannot not get a raise until 2001 at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye noted that state judges had not received a raise since
1993. ``Over many years, the judges of this state have experienced
a significant decline in the real value of their salaries,'' she
said in a statement. A commission that examined the salaries of the
1,300 judges who are paid by the state, including City Court and
Housing Court judges, along with higher-level state judges,
recommended substantial raises earlier this year, Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has repeatedly opposed raises for legislators, and he
said last month that he would not support an increase now.

WHILE BOSTON POINTS FINGERS, HARTFORD CLAPS IN GLEE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Conn.)  (lb) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In Boston, the saying goes, there are only three things
that count: sports, politics and revenge. And the announcement
Thursday that the New England Patriots will leave suburban Boston
to play in Hartford, Conn., combines all three, revealing that
underneath the sheen of its current economic boom, Boston is often
still a city of tribal neighborhoods and vendettas without strong
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is not our finest hour,'' said Chad Gifford, the
chairman and chief executive of BankBoston, who is also the head of
Boston's Chamber of Commerce and a close friend of the Patriots'
owner, Robert Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is a great city, from our history to our cultural
institutions to our geography by the water,'' Gifford said. ``But
there was a good opportunity here for the city, and sometimes we
are so proud, it verges on arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the Patriots to Hartford, 41 years after they played
the first game in the old American Football League here against the
Denver Broncos, is being blamed largely on one man, Thomas
Finneran, the speaker of the Massachusetts House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran seemed to make it a personal crusade to stop Kraft,
whom he at one point referred to as a ``whiny billionaire,'' from
getting state financing to help build a new stadium in Foxboro,
where the team now plays, even though Kraft had proposed putting up
$200 million of his own money to pay the bulk of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, on WEEI-AM, a sports talk radio station, Finneran
said he would not mind if his role in driving the Patriots out of
Massachusetts was ``chiseled on my gravestone.'' One caller to the
radio station said Finneran's actions were ``immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of many sports fans, real-estate developers and
other politicians, there was enough blame to go around, reflecting
on a widespread failure of civic and political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. William Weld and the newly elected governor, Paul
Cellucci, had both promised to help Kraft get the government
financing to keep the team in Massachusetts. They failed. So did
Mayor Thomas Menino, who last year blocked a plan by Kraft to build
a privately financed stadium on unused land in South Boston near
the harbor after opposition from neighborhood groups.
</P>
<P>
   Menino said he was disappointed the Patriots were moving to
Hartford, but he did not sound deeply troubled. ``If it was the Red
Sox, I'd be concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have not played in Boston itself in years, Menino
said, whereas the Red Sox play 81 games a year at Fenway Park and
have a big impact on the city's restaurants and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are also trying to build a new ball park to replace
Fenway, the smallest and next-to-oldest baseball stadium in the
nation, but they too have so far been unable to come up with a plan
that will satisfy neighborhood groups.
</P>
<P>
   This is a serious problem for the Red Sox, for although Fenway
Park remains one of the best places to watch a baseball game, it is
simply too small and outdated to generate the revenues needed to
compete with teams like the Yankees or the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Football fans were despondent and did not accept Kraft's
contention that he was keeping the Patriots in New England, close
enough for them to still go to games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was going to be the Providence Patriots, I would view it
differently,'' said Steve Doran, a marketing consultant in Hingham
and a former season ticket holder. ``But I think of Hartford as
being a bedroom community for New York, Giants country. I don't
even think of Connecticut as being part of New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran did not return phone calls to his office Thursday. But
on WEEI radio he blamed Kraft's greed for the move. ``Why are the
owners of pro sports teams entitled to hundreds of millions of
dollars?'' he asked. ``Entertainment is not a public
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But the state Senate president, Thomas Birmingham, like Finneran
a Democrat, said he was ``befuddled'' by Finneran's position. Under
Birmingham, the Senate last spring approved a bill, by a 36-1 vote,
to provide $70 million in state money to improve roads and highway
ramps as part of Kraft's plan to build a new stadium in Foxboro
with $200 million of his own money.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran rejected that as too generous, and the bill failed in
the House, even though Birmingham said the proposal was the
``stingiest'' government support in the nation for the construction
of a new professional sports stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Birmingham said, is that the Patriots
contribute $10 million a year in payroll taxes to Massachusetts,
and his bill would have involved an expenditure of $2.3 million a
year in government money. Now the state will lose $7.7 million a
year. ``How can this be justified in the name of fiscal
responsibility?'' he asked, jabbing at Finneran.

TROUBLED HMO BREAKS CONTRACT WITH PROVIDER, GOES UNDER STATE
SUPERVISION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Efforts to shore up the finances of New Jersey's
fourth-largest health maintenance organization took a bitter public
turn Thursday when the organization, HIP Health Plan of New Jersey,
broke its contract with the medical provider it hired 18 months
ago. That provider's parent company then filed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The actions brought to an abrupt halt nearly two weeks of secret
negotiations among HIP, the medical provider it hired, Pinnacle
Health Enterprises, whose parent company is PHP Healthcare Corp.,
and state regulators. The talks were aimed at forestalling a
threatened state takeover of the plan, which serves 194,000 people.
Those negotiations began after officials of the state's Department
of Banking and Insurance and Department of Health and Senior
Services, which regulate HIP, moved in state court to take control
of the plan, saying that it was running deficits in excess of $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to breaking its contract with Pinnacle, HIP
voluntarily agreed to state supervision of its financial operations
as well as the network of Pinnacle-owned clinics that serve the
plan's members.
</P>
<P>
   Both HIP and Pinnacle said that Thursday's developments would
not affect the operations of the health centers serving HIP members
because HIP would continue to pay Pinnacle the fees for those
patients the company treated at its 18 clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Pinnacle charged Thursday, in comments made on the
condition of anonymity, that state officials never actively
participated in the weeks of negotiations, thereby dooming them.
The parent company, PHP, which is based in Reston, Va., stands to
lose the more than $140 million it had invested in the contract
with HIP. In a statement released Thursday, Pinnacle charged that
HIP had ``no legal basis'' for ending that contract.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, HIP of New Jersey accused Pinnacle of failing to
use money HIP provided from its premiums to satisfy tens of
millions of dollars in claims from health providers. Officials at
HIP also said that Pinnacle, which acquired HIP's nearly two dozen
clinics or health centers last year, had unilaterally laid off
employees in a manner that hurt the quality of medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Comfort, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of
Banking and Insurance, would not respond to the charge by Pinnacle
officials that the state failed to participate actively in the
negotiations over the last few weeks, noting that the state judge
in the case had prevented the parties from discussing the talks.
She added that the state would go to court on Friday to formalize
its supervision of HIP
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Pinnacle was required by contract to provide
medical services for up to 12 months after the end of the contract.

THE `MAGIC DUST' FOR REDEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Conn.)  (lb) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Business owners answered their telephones with
bold greetings Thursday, boasting that they were in the home of the
Hartford Patriots. News dealers at Old State House Square hawked
souvenir issues of the local paper with headlines worthy of a war
or a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Civic leaders predicted a downtown renaissance that would
include new museums, a community college and thousands of hotel
rooms and apartments. And sports fans signed onto the Internet to
order tickets for the National Football League season of 2001, when
the Boston-area franchise is expected to move 100 miles west.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a gray drizzle, Thursday's announcement brought a spring
to Hartford's dragging step, a straightening of its collective
shoulders. ``This is an enormous compliment to the city's
potential,'' said Evan Dobelle, the president of Trinity College
here and a dynamic force in the city's redevelopment efforts.
``It's a validation of all the work we've been trying to do. It is
immeasurably helpful, not even quantifiable. This will lift all
boats.''
</P>
<P>
   At ZuZu's coffee bar, near the Civic Center that not too long
ago lost its National Hockey League team, Dean Zappalorti predicted
that the Patriots would attract young professionals looking to
settle in a small, vibrant city. ``It's a great building block,''
said Zappalorti, who sells advertising for the Rangers'
minor-league club, which replaced the NHL Whalers.
</P>
<P>
   At Old Town Cafe in suburban Wethersfield, where ``Monday Night
Football'' draws standing-room-only crowds, Tom Tigno, a retired
firefighter, hoped for more restaurants, small businesses and
employment downtown. ``It's dead right now,'' he said. ``We need a
shot in the arm.''
</P>
<P>
   And at Timothy's Restaurant, where sprouts and nine-grain bread
are popular with the Trinity College crowd, Marsha Kelly, a retired
schoolteacher who lives downtown, looked forward to increased foot
traffic, energy and maybe even a movie theater or two. ``It's
unfortunate it takes a sports team to do it,'' she said. ``But
anything that brings people.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, Hartford's proud men and women worked in factories that
built bicycles, sewing machines, typewriters and rifles and relaxed
in parks built by Frederick Law Olmsted and museums endowed by J.P
Morgan. That glorious infrastructure remains in the compact
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years Connecticut's capital has been better known
for a collapsed manufacturing base, a downsized insurance industry
and a middle class that fled to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   A professional football team alone is no panacea for urban
decay, as other cities have learned, but Hartford sees the Patriots
as part of a broad redevelopment scheme. Plans were already in the
works for a convention center, hotel and riverfront esplanade at a
site known as Adriaen's Landing, just blocks from the gold-domed
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The project, according to Dobelle, a member of the redevelopment
task force, will include two new museums, a community college,
1,500 hotel rooms and 1,000 apartments. The arrival of the
Patriots, assuming NFL and legislative approval, would add other
elements _ the team's executive offices, perhaps a soccer franchise
and good fortune for the University of Connecticut football team,
which would move up a division in collegiate play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the magic dust,'' Dobelle said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not that everyone here is a believer. Two government workers
lunching at Timothy's complained that Hartford needed new schools,
low-income housing and community services more than it needed
football. ``Tell me how it's going to help the poor,'' Joan Parker
demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Political cynicism ran deep at the Old Town Cafe, a blue-collar
hangout in a white-collar suburb. Jack Strasser, a food
distributor, worried that thousands of poor people would be
displaced from neighboring housing projects. And he wondered if
Gov. John Rowland, who roared to re-election, was motivated by
ambition for national political office.

CBS TO SHOW KEVORKIAN'S VIDEO OF MAN'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The CBS newsmagazine ``60 Minutes'' plans to broadcast on Sunday
a videotape provided to them by Dr. Jack Kevorkian showing the
doctor administering a fatal injection to a patient who then dies
on camera.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, said Kevin Tedesco, a spokesman for ``60 Minutes,''
is ``trying to raise an issue, to get himself arrested and to make
his case a trial balloon.'' Kevorkian, whose license to practice
medicine has been revoked in his home state of Michigan and in
California, has in the past decade made himself synonymous with the
issue of physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 through 1996, Kevorkian was acquitted of charges
related to five separate deaths at which he assisted.
</P>
<P>
   The planned segment on the CBS television newsmagazine would be
the second national broadcast of an assisted suicide. In December
1994, the ABC-TV newsmagazine ``Primetime Live'' broadcast segments
of a Dutch television documentary, ``Death on Request,'' which
showed the assisted suicide of a 63-year-old man suffering from the
degenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after The New York Times published excerpts from the
transcript of ``Death on Request,'' a representative of ``60
Minutes'' called the editor who assembled the transcript, seeking
to get in touch with the Dutch documentary film makers. Those film
makers, however, already had an arrangement with ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch broadcast was condemned by the Vatican as ``a
horrifying spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   The CBS broadcast is scheduled to take place during the November
sweeps month, when networks are striving to achieve the maximum
viewership so that their affiliated stations can set the highest
possible charges for advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian could not be reached for comment Thursday night, nor
could Don Hewitt, the executive producer of ``60 Minutes,'' or Mike
Wallace, the correspondent who worked on the euthanasia segment.
</P>
<P>
   Tedesco said Kevorkian brought his video to the program last
week. The moment of death is shown on camera, Tedesco said, as is
the moment when the fatal injection is administered. Wallace also
interviews the family of the patient about their decisions
involving the death and the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it's in bad taste,'' Tedesco said. ``This
particular death is peaceful, calm and nonviolent.''
</P>
<P>
   Tedesco said the network plans to broadcast an advisory early in
the program warning that the segment may disturb some viewers.

SPITZER DECLARES VICTORY IN CONTESTED ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not waiting for confirmation from election officials
or a concession by his opponent, Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic
challenger in the race for state attorney general, declared himself
the winner of the tight contest Thursday and announced that he was
putting together a transition team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a long, tough race,'' Spitzer said at a press
conference in his law office in midtown Manhattan. ``And now that a
sufficient number of votes have been counted to establish beyond
any doubt that I have won, I think it is appropriate that I declare
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Elections said Thursday that Spitzer was
22,626 votes ahead of Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco in a race
in which more than 4 million votes were cast. Board officials
estimated that about 15,000 paper ballots remained to be counted
from the 250,000 that were cast. The bulk of those are from
Westchester County, where Spitzer won the voting machine tally by a
slight margin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those totals, Vacco apparently considered his Democratic
opponent's declaration premature, coming as it did only a day after
lawyers for the incumbent filed a complaint in state Supreme Court
saying that there were widespread discrepancies in the vote
tallies, particularly in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco said in a statement, ``I do not intend to make any
additional statement with regard to the outcome of this election
until I am so advised by my lawyers and the court that a final
determination has been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Election officials have said they do not intend to certify a
winner in the race until all legal challenges have been settled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials of both campaigns met Thursday to begin
inspecting the nearly 7,000 voting machines in New York City, under
a court ruling issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco's lawyers have complained that the number of votes
reported on election night did not correspond to the totals
released by the board a week later. As a result, Justice Thomas
Keegan of state Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that the campaigns
could inspect the machines again and report their findings to the
court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While Vacco was muted in his response, state Republican Party
chairman William Powers was vehement in denouncing Spitzer's
declaration. ``Spitzer can declare himself king if he wants to, but
that doesn't make him one,'' Powers said in a letter he sent
Thursday to his party's county chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's announcement, Powers said, ``is nothing more than a
cheap ploy to deflect attention away from the potentially
fraudulent vote count that occurred in New York City.'' The Board
of Elections tabulation represented ``a shell game,'' Powers said,
adding that ``Dennis Vacco is our attorney general and we have full
confidence he will remain so if we are successful in our lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Spitzer forthrightly took on the mantle of the
victor, standing at the press conference beside both his wife,
Silda, and Judith Hope, the chairwoman of the New York State
Democratic Committee. Spitzer announced that his law partner _
Lloyd Constantine, a former chief of the antitrust bureau of the
state attorney general's office _ would head his transition team.
</P>
<P>
   Of Vacco's legal challenge, Spitzer said, ``I do not dispute his
right to go to court and raise the issues he has raised.'' Still,
he said, it would now be appropriate for Vacco to ``designate
certain individuals in his office whom I can consult with so that
there can be an orderly transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer made it clear that he had already turned his attention
to the operation of the office, discussing a wide range of topics,
from his opposition to the recent agreement between the state and
the tobacco industry to the need to protect the state's water
supply. He also expressed his desire to have a cordial relationship
with Gov. George Pataki, a Republican who was re-elected to a
second term Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the state Board of Elections said they probably
would not complete the vote count until next week. State law
requires the board to declare a winner by Dec. 15, but officials
said that deadline could be delayed if legal challenges continue.
</P>
<P>
   If no certification is made by Jan. 1, Vacco would vacate the
office and an interim attorney general would be selected by the
combined houses of the Legislature, in which a majority of the 211
lawmakers are Democrats.

THREE SETS AND A FLASHBACK: GRAF OUTLASTS SELES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the fifth match point of her epic quarterfinal
battle with her old foe, Monica Seles, Steffi Graf blew on her
serving fingers, not to cool them but to ensure a death grip on her
racket. She was preparing a serve that finally backed Seles into a
corner where she lost her last bit of leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Granted the chance to end the suspense with her signature shot,
one of those forehand missiles, Graf plastered it past Seles and
immediately raised both arms in the air to celebrate a 1-6, 6-4,
6-4 comeback at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so glad to come back and win this match after she
came out and played so well in the first set; it was just amazing
for me to come back and win,'' Graf said. Graf is 9-4 against Seles
in a rivalry that's 10 years old and seems, if this match was any
touchstone, evergreen.
</P>
<P>
   Graf had her left foot wrapped after Seles held for a 3-2 edge
in the final set, but any discomfort she felt from it, or from
Seles' treatment of her in the first set, vanished once she broke
Seles for a 5-4 lead that set her up to serve for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, comebacks are becoming Graf's forte. She has won two
straight tournaments coming into this event after recovering in a
hurry from September wrist surgery: Given a chance to opt for an
early vacation or pound her body back into playing shape in time to
make a madcap dash into contention for the Chase Championships, an
invitation-only event for the world's top 16 players, Graf gambled
and made the dash.
</P>
<P>
   This latest victory extended her unbeaten streak to 12 matches
and sent her to the semifinals of the Championships, an event she's
dominated on five occasions, the last time in 1996 when she
outlasted Martina Hingis in five sets.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Thursday night's test against Seles, whose health
was in doubt because of a debilitating stomach bug, Graf had
defeated the top three players in the world: Lindsay Davenport,
Hingis, and this event's defending champion, Jana Novotna, in the
first round. No other player had ever defeated the top three in a
four-game span. Then again, the 12th-ranked Graf, now a very
veteran 29 but unmindful of it, is like no other player.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Seles, who performed so valiantly throughout the one hour
49 minute confrontation that her illness was invisible: In the
23-minute first set especially, Seles snapped away her shots, one
doublehanded slash after another, with such surgical power and
precision that Graf's forehand was ineffectual.
</P>
<P>
   Seles gobbled up the German's serve and treated it as fodder for
a battery of returns so vicious that Graf was forced to step
backward to try and corral them.
</P>
<P>
   While Graf did a slow burn on her side of the court, Seles kept
on attacking, and with a mean-spirited backhand return that shoved
Graf back into a corner and rendered her completely helpless when
Seles followed up with a backhand drop shot that landed and expired
on command.
</P>
<P>
   Graf gave herself a tongue-lashing as she sat in her changeover
chair, and in the second game of the second set she finally won a
game, her first since the third game of the opening set. After
breaking Seles to take a 2-1 lead, Graf marched back to her chair,
slammed down her racket as if incensed: She wasn't. She was simply
priming her competitive pump for the uphill climb she needed to
make to win the match.
</P>
<P>
   As theater, this was hardcore tennis: Graf and Seles come from
the old school, and their performance mode is gimmick-free. Their
shots flew across the net with harmful intent: The groundstrokes
burned like lasers, and their serves were designed to detonate on
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   If Graf and Seles were sending a message to each other, and to
the crowd of 13,023 they enthralled Thursday night, it was that
they remain a valid factor, and threat: This was vintage tennis
played by a couple of vintage champions with 30 Grand Slam singles
titles between them, champions determined not to give any further
ground to the teenage upstarts lately ruling the roost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to keep on going,'' said Graf. ``Everybody else
may be tired, but I'm feeling pretty excited just to be here.''

APPEALS COURT STRIKES DOWN RACIAL PREFERENCE POLICY IN BOSTON
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs 8th graf to change `members of less qualified minorities' to
`less qualified minority members'; also corrects headline to change
`schools' to `school')  
 (ATTN: Maine, Mass., N.H., R.I., Puerto Rico)  (JT/bl) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first federal appeals court ruling on racial preferences
in public school admissions, a three-judge panel in Boston on
Thursday struck down the affirmative-action policy at Boston Latin
School, the city's most prestigious public high school.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to Boston Latin, brought by Henry Robert Wessman,
the father of a white student who was not admitted, moves the
highly charged debate over affirmative action in education from the
college and professional-school level down to the public school
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in a case involving the University of Texas law
school, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals barred the use of
race in university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   But the constitutionality of racial preferences in admissions to
prestigious public high schools is more complicated _ and more
amorphous _ since so many districts, like Boston, have been under
court order to desegregate. Indeed, many districts have created
magnet schools specifically to promote integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are very different in public schools, where every
child will get a placement, than in the professional school
context, where a person who doesn't get into law or medical school
may not have access to that career,'' said Patricia Brannan, a
lawyer working on a similar case involving a magnet school in
Arlington, Va. ``At this point, it's not clear exactly what's
allowed. There are several cases rattling their way through the
courts, and I think it's an area where we're going to see a lot
more court rulings.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Thursday's ruling is binding only on Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico, it is
likely to draw intense interest in many school districts that are
race-conscious in admissions to their most competitive schools.
While most school districts have abandoned strict racial quotas,
many magnet schools still consider race in their admission
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Latin selects half its students solely on entrance
examination scores and grades, and admissions for the other half
are weighted by race, so that if 27 percent of the remaining
qualified applicants, those from the top half of their class, are
African-American, 27 percent of those admitted must be
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's 2-to-1 decision overturning a May ruling by the
district court upholding that policy, Judge Bruce Selya of the 1st
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Boston Latin to admit
15-year-old Sarah Wessman, a white student who complained that she
had been illegally denied admission in favor of less-qualified
minority members. Sarah ranked 91st among the applicants for the
1997 ninth-grade class. To fill the first 45 seats, the school went
through the top 47 students on the list; for the other 45, the
policy required allocation to 13 blacks, 18 whites, nine
Asian-Americans and five students of Hispanic descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts a further stake in the heart of the diversity
rationale,'' said Terence Pell, senior counsel at Center for
Individual Rights in Washington, which brought the Texas case.
``People might have thought that if the diversity rationale would
survive at all it would be in the elementary and secondary school
context, but the court said, no, the legal standard is the same and
there is no more compelling interest in racial balancing that
elementary and secondary level.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a press conference Thursday, Dr. Elizabeth Reilinger, chair
fo the Boston School Committee, said that the committee would
comply with the decision _ and would schedule a special meeting to
decide whether to appeal the decision or change its policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read the decision yet, but I'm very concerned that
it could lead to racial isolation, resegregation and less
educational opportunity for minority children,'' said Jeff
Simering, director of legislation at the Council of the Great City
Schools, a Washington, D.C., organization of the nation's largest
urban school districts, adding that many of his group's members are
still under desegregation orders, and using race-conscious policies
to integrate their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the four specialized high schools admit
students strictly on the basis of an entrance test and do not use
race as a factor. The makeup of the two top schools, Stuyvesant
High School and Bronx High School of Science, is predominantly
Asian and white. At Stuyvesant, for example, African-Americans
account for 4.1 percent of the student body, Hispanics 3.7 percent,
47.7 percent Asian and 45.5 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, rioting broke out in Boston when a U.S. District Court
ordered widespread busing to end segregation of schools. The
following year, because of the low number of African-American
students at Boston Latin, the court required the school to set
aside at least 35 percent of each entering class for
African-American and Hispanic students, a plan the appeals court
affirmed in 1976. Although the court removed that mandate in 1987,
the Boston schools continued that policy until 1995, when it was
challenged by Michael McLaughlin, the lawyer-father of another
rejected white applicant.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin's case was dismissed last year, and his daughter
admitted, after the city agreed to change from the 35 percent
set-aside to the new half-and-half approach.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin, however, sued again, on behalf of Sarah Wessman,
charging that the new system was still an illegal quota masked by
``high-minded and amorphous terms'' of diversity and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Selya's opinion said the policy making race ``a determining
factor in the admission of a subset of each year's incoming
classes, offend's the Constitution's guarantee of equal
protection.''

   LOS ANGELES _ A precocious 20-something has done what heavy
hitters like Michael Ovitz are only dreaming about _ bringing
professional football back to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Wasserman, just 24 years old and barely removed from his
college days at UCLA, stepped forward Thursday as the owner of
L.A.'s new Arena Football League franchise. The as-yet-unnamed
expansion team begins play at the new downtown Staples Center in
the spring of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman, the grandson of former MCA/Universal chairman and CEO
Lew Wasserman, is drawing on his family's entertainment experience
as well as its capital to make his first foray into sports
entertainment. The franchise fee was not disclosed but is no less
than $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am truly excited about this opportunity,'' Wasserman said at
a press conference to announce the team.
</P>
<P>
   As L.A. awaits the return of the NFL, Wasserman and AFL
commissioner David Baker both exuded confidence that the quirky,
50-yard Arena game will carve its own niche in the region's sports
market and, eventually, benefit from proximity to a new NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   With a spring-summer schedule, Arenaball doesn't compete with
outdoor pro football and, in fact, is close to reaching a
partnership with the NFL to promote the concept of year-round
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you love football, you're going to love Arena football,''
said Baker. ``It's in-your-face, rock-'n'-roll, hard-hitting,
helmet-popping, heart-stopping football.''
</P>
<P>
   Arenaball has already failed twice to catch on in this region _
the Cobras played in 1988 at the Sports Arena, and Baker's own
Anaheim team folded after playing in '96 and '97 at the Pond. But
Wasserman is undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal will be to create reasons for people to come to these
games,'' said Wasserman, a former Cleveland Browns ballboy. ``I
don't think we'd be here if we didn't think we could fill that
(20,000-seat) arena every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman and Baker figure the Arena franchise will benefit from
being cross-marketed with its fellow Staples tenants, the NBA's
Lakers and Clippers and the NHL's Kings. Staples management is
already creating mandatory combined ticket packages for luxury
suites and other high-end seating.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Soboroff, top assistant to Mayor Richard Riordan, and
Staples officials were also on hand to welcome Wasserman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that it's a great partnership,'' Baker said.
