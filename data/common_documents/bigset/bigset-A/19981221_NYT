RAIDERS CHANGED, BUT DAVIS HASN'T
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Away from a half-dozen or so pieces of pending
litigation and out of the eternal spotlight glaring off his curious
relationship with the rest of the NFL, Al Davis remains the most
single-minded of sports owners.
</P>
<P>
   He just wants his Raiders to win.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter where they win. It doesn't seem to matter how
anymore, either, and that's no small change. But there's no
mistaking: Davis still burns to win, to make the playoffs and find
that Super Bowl stage. Al Davis still wants to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time since he has. The Los Angeles Raiders won
a Super Bowl in 1983 and contended the next two years. But since
1986, a span of two cities and 13 tumultuous seasons, the Raiders
have been to the playoffs just three times.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Oakland Raiders beat the dismal San Diego Chargers
17-10 to improve to 8-7, but their playoff hopes died out of town
with New England's win. Since separating from L.A. and launching
its second tour of the East Bay, the Raiders are 27-36 and have yet
to make the playoffs or post a winning season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' Davis said Sunday. ``It's my life, you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm looking for right now is a foundation. I think we've
got one here. We're doing some things well, things we can build on.
I thought we had a foundation back in 1993, I really did. You
remember. We were close. And I thought we had it turned around in
1995, too. Things happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have two more wins this season if we hadn't lost
(cornerback) Eric Allen (to a torn ACL). The defense alone would
have won us two more games.''
</P>
<P>
   On another day at another time, those comments could have
sounded as bitter as burnt coffee. Sunday, they sounded reflective,
like someone who has come to terms on matters which, in the past,
would have raised the blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room after the win, Davis wore an easy smile and
congratulated everyone. That was hardly the demeanor one would have
expected, say, five years ago in the same playoff-less
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Brown and Davis engaged in an animated, good-humor chat for
about 10 minutes, a fascinating thing to see since there were years
during the L.A. era when the two didn't say 10 words to each other.
</P>
<P>
   People who work for the Raiders say the organization recently
took a collective step back from its own reputation. After years of
turmoil and blown expectations, there was little to be arrogant
about.
</P>
<P>
   A fundamental change was needed, and the Raiders apparently got
it by hiring Jon Gruden as head coach. He's 35 and has cheeks pink
enough to get him carded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest change has been Gruden,'' said Brown. ``The
decline in penalties are all him. He won't take that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Gruden Raiders committed just three penalties, quite
a departure from the years (1994 and 1996) when the team averaged
almost 10 a game and set NFL records. On defense, the Gruden
Raiders play more base defense, smarter since the unit doesn't have
the star power of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the quarterbacks Gruden has had this year _ the lame
Jeff George, clipboard guy Donald Hollas and the ancient Wade
Wilson _ eight or nine wins is quite an achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always disappointing to not make the playoffs,'' said
Brown. ``If we win next week, we'll be 9-7 and improved five games
on last year (4-12). And a winning record is something that hasn't
been done around here since 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is always a relative term when it's the Raiders, of
course, and it wouldn't be a Raiders story if there were not some
speculation about their moving back to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Davis declined to discuss it, but he was interested in knowing a
grassroots letter-writing campaign is under way. Of the 60,716 in
Qualcomm on Sunday, about 20,000 of them were loud Raiders fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a shame,'' said Raiders chief exec Amy Trask,
``because if the Hollywood Park idea had been allowed to go
through, Los Angeles already would have a privately funded
stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. That's one of those pieces of litigation coming to a
courtroom near you. For now, L.A. remains unaffiliated, and Davis
still wants to just win. &QL;

TWO MORE COMMIT TO PLAY FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC continued to bolster its recruiting class as
kicker David Newberry and linebacker Chris Prosser committed to the
Trojans this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Newberry, a junior-college transfer from Corsicana, Texas, will
be a sophomore next season. Prosser (6-foot-2, 200 pounds) is from
Morse High School in San Diego, the alma mater of USC free safety
Rashard Cook.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have received 11 oral commitments. USC has received
commitments from defensive tackles Bernard Riley and Sagan Atuatasi
of Los Alamitos; linebacker Aaron Graham of Bakersfield; defensive
tackle Malcolm Woolridge of Boca Raton, Fla.; wide receiver Kareem
Kelly and defensive back Darrell Rideaux of Long Beach Poly; tight
end Jacob Rogers of Oxnard; offensive lineman Nate Steinbacher of
Anaheim Esperanza and linebacker Markus Steele of Long Beach City
College.
</P>
<P>
   USC also leads for two players close to making a decision:
offensive linemen Lenny Vandermade of Mater Dei and Courtney Morgan
of Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   This was the final recruiting weekend for the Trojans until they
return from the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Family affair: Linebacker Mark Cusano will be the most popular
Trojan at the Sun Bowl, with more than 20 relatives and friends
attending the game. Cusano grew up in The Colony, Texas, a suburb
of Dallas, but his mother's family lives about 30 minutes outside
El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're excited,'' Cusano said. ``They're all going to get to
see me play in person for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusano also has family coming from Dallas, but USC's appearance
in the Sun Bowl isn't as much of a break for them as one might
think. El Paso is actually closer to Los Angeles than Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to fly. They don't want to drive,'' Cusano said.
``It's a terrible drive. Once you get out of Dallas, there's
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMars returns: Defensive lineman Bobby DeMars of Westlake High
School resumed practicing after undergoing hernia surgery before
the UCLA game.
</P>
<P>
   DeMars practiced Saturday but quickly experienced pain and had
to rest. ``I wanted to come back slowly and then go full speed,''
DeMars said. ``But I came back too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMars said he should be healthy for the Sun Bowl.

HOW TO TEACH THE CHILDREN WELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kids play sports. Kids need to learn the rules.
And kids love to watch videos.
</P>
<P>
   But who's kidding who? A plus B doesn't necessarily equal C.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to produce sports instructional tapes that hold
the attention of anyone under age 5 without including a stupid
purple dinosaur is as tough to make as one for someone older than
10 who won't be bored by something too simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   A new series of tapes with the ESPN label is worthy of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Distributed by Buena Vista Home Entertainment, the ESPN
Instructional series ($14.95 each) uses not just top-name athletes
and coaches on the box to sell the product, but ones who address
the audience without talking down to them. They find a way to
demonstrate the fundamentals and reinforce them with
easy-to-understand drills without giving in to elementary
entertainment devices.
</P>
<P>
   So, in this series, kids who want to improve will learn
something, and the adults who often find themselves thrust in as
coaches are shown the best way to go about teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Let's Play'' tapes include baseball (with Ozzie Smith),
soccer (with Mia Hamm, John Harkes and Zachary Ty Bryan), tennis
(with Tracy Austin, Fred Stolle and Cliff Drysdale) and skiing for
beginners (with Picabo Street, A.J. Kitt and Holly Flanders).
Basketball is demonstrated by Mike Krzyzewski, which can be a
little tedious for short attention spans. Maybe Dick Vitale would
have been a better choice.
</P>
<P>
   Younger kids can watch them over and over to absorb the
information and most of these tapes are in the 30-to-50 minute
range.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Teaching Kids'' series aimed at adults and older kids
includes the must-have basketball video (with John Wooden). There's
also football (with Bo Schembechler), tennis (with Nick
Bollettieri), golf (with Ben Sutton), swimming (with John Naber),
baseball (with Jerry Kindall), skiing (with Hank Kashiwa) and
bowling (with Gordon Vadakin). These run as long as 75 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Now the hard part _ tracking these gems down. The only reliable
option is a toll-free phone number (800-662-ESPN) since neither the
ESPN Store in Glendale nor the shopping area on the ESPN.com Web
site (http://store.espn.com/) are consistent with titles.
</P>
<P>
   The closest this series has to a roller hockey instructional
video is the NHLPA's Wayne Gretzky All-Star Hockey, which can be
ordered through 888-702-3776. &QL;

VIKINGS CRUSH JAGUARS, 50-10 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Minnesota Vikings, trying to lock up
home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, on Sunday night
pounded the Jacksonville Jaguars, 50-10, before 64,063 fans at the
Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Vikings their first unbeaten record at home
since 1989 and just their second since 1976, the last time they
went to the Super Bowl. The 50 points gave them 530 for the season,
the second most in National Football League history and 11 short of
the record set by the 1983 Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a blitzing, gambling Jacksonville defense, the Vikings
started slowly, leading by 3-0 after a quarter and by 12-3 at
halftime. Then the team went to its most explosive target: wide
receiver Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   After a flea-flicker from running back Robert Smith to
quarterback Randall Cunningham, Moss was single-covered by safety
Travis Davis. No contest. Cunningham, who fractured his nonthrowing
hand in the first half but played well into the third quarter
before being replaced by Brad Johnson, lobbed the ball high, and it
landed right in Moss's chest in the end zone for a spectacular
43-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   The Moss catch, one of three touchdown passes by Cunningham in
the second half, gave Minnesota a 26-3 third-quarter lead.
Minnesota's defense took control in the fourth quarter, scoring on
an interception and returning a fumble inside the 5-yard line to
put the game well out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Minnesota (14-1) clinched home-field advantage
throughout the playoffs and remains a strong favorite to get to the
Super Bowl. Jacksonville, which had already earned a playoff berth
before the game, fell to 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel great,'' Vikings Coach Dennis Green said. ``It's an
important win for us because as you know, no domed team has ever
won home-field advantage, and with our team speed, getting home
field gives us the best chance to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota entered Sunday night's game knowing that Atlanta had
beaten Detroit. So, while the Vikings had won the National Football
Conference Central Division and clinched a first-round bye, they
still had to win to stay ahead of the Falcons for home-field
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have been unstoppable, winning seven straight games.
At one point this year, it looked as if the Jaguars were also
headed deep into the playoffs, but the team was crippled by
injuries, including the Pro Bowl quarterback Mark Brunell's
severely injuring his left ankle. The Jaguars may still be a
post-season force _ they clinched their first division title this
week _ but Jacksonville was forced to start the third-stringer
Jonathan Quinn at quarterback against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn is a rookie out of Middle Tennessee State, and played like
one. The Jaguars crossed midfield only three times, and Quinn
completed 12 of 27 passes for 88 yards and 2 interceptions, one
returned 30 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter by Jimmy
Hitchcock. Quinn also called a timeout once when the crowd got so
loud that he could not call signals, and there also was confusion
with some of the hand signals he used at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, often with a defender in his face, was off target
with some of his throws, too. Moss, who leads the league in
touchdown catches with 16, did not have his first reception until
there were seven minutes left in the first half. Wide receiver Cris
Carter had dropped two passes.
</P>
<P>
   But this Vikings offense has numerous weapons, and if one is
shut down, another two respond. One bullet is Gary Anderson, whose
field goals of 48 and 53 yards gave the Vikings a 6-0 lead. Then
came Smith, who in Minnesota's final drive before halftime had
crucial runs of 22, 9, and 3 yards. That led to a 14-yard touchdown
catch by tight end Andrew Glover, and a 12-0 lead when the 2-point
attempt failed.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville, with no time on the clock, got a 25-yard field
goal from Mike Hollis to trail by 12-3. The Jaguars were helped by
a pass interference penalty on cornerback Ramos McDonald, who did
not turn to look for the ball while covering wide receiver Jimmy
Smith.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy, but we're focused enough to understand that this
is just one step along the way to trying to win a championship,''
Glover said.

`MAIL' STAMPS OUT BOX OFFICE COMPETITORS
</HEADLINE>

By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The romantic comedy ``You've Got Mail'' delivered
the top spot at the nation's box office with an estimated $18.8
million at 2,691 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period, studio
sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' teaming of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, who scored a
major hit with 1993's ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' proved a solid draw
for moviegoers, but analysts said the opening weekend was hurt by
extensive televised coverage of President Clinton's impeachment and
the bombing of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real box office winner this weekend were the TV
stations,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source
tracking service. ``No one in the industry expected all this to
happen now and it really hurt films targeted at adults.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' opening of its animated biblical epic, ``The Prince
of Egypt,'' finished second with $14.3 million at 3,118 theaters.
Distribution chief James Tharp said the performance was in line
with studio expectations, adding, ``We feel the film is positioned
to play well through the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Arthur Rockwell called the ``Prince'' opening
``respectable'' and noted that it represents a tough marketing
challenge. ``People want fun movies at this time of year, so I'm
not sure this is the right time to release such a serious film,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Overall business totaled $76 million, making the weekend one of
the few this year to post a year-to-year decline. ``Titanic''
opened a year ago with $28.6 million, followed by ``Tomorrow Never
Dies'' with $25.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is doing blockbuster business this season, but the
overall business is very strong with a very crowded marketplace,''
Rockwell said. ``This weekend was solid, but at the lower end of
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum predicted ``Mail'' will take in $110 million overall
and ``Prince'' will hit $85 million. Both face serious competition
on Christmas with openings of Universal's ``Patch Adams,''
Miramax's ``The Faculty,'' Sony's ``Stepmom'' and Disney's ``Mighty
Joe Young.'' The latter two received strong responses from Saturday
night sneak previews.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's fifth weekend of ``A Bug's Life'' came in a respectable
third with $9.5 million at 2,773 sites as it benefited from adding
new outtakes during the closing credits. ``Life'' has gone past $96
million overall and will soon become the 12th movie this year to
top the $100 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's second weekend of ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' saw
much of its audience vaporize as it fell to fourth with $8.5
million at 2,649 theaters, representing a 60 percent decline from
its opening. By comparison, Warner's second weekend of ``Jack
Frost'' lost only 27 percent from its debut, finishing fifth with
$5.1 million at 2,152 sites.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of holdovers continued to perform solidly _ Disney's
fifth weekend of ``Enemy of the State'' with $4.4 million at 2,237
theaters, Paramount's fifth weekend of ``The Rugrats Movie'' with
$3 million at 2,616 theaters and Disney's seventh weekend of ``The
Waterboy'' with $2.9 million at 2,242 locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' has grossed $140.7 million and ranks 72nd on
the all-time domestic box office list after ``A Few Good Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal's dismal performance persisted as its ``Psycho''
remake lost half its audience and finished ninth with $1.9 million
at 2,325 theaters to give it only $18.4 million overall. Gramercy's
seventh weekend of ``Elizabeth'' came in 10th with $885,000 at 548
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Two high-priced Universal projects also performed poorly _ the
sixth weekend of ``Meet Joe Black'' with $655,000 at 1,095 screens
and the fourth weekend of ``Babe: Pig in the City'' with $560,000
at 1,525 theaters. ``Joe'' has totaled $42.6 million while the
``Babe'' sequel has hit only $14.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's ``A Simple Plan,'' a critical favorite, posted
moderate returns in its second weekend with $405,000 at 72
theaters. Miramax's ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which has emerged as a
leading contender for the Academy Awards, continued to perform well
with $340,000 at 19 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date grosses have reached approximately $6.6 billion, up
8 percent over the same 1997 period, and the outlook is bright for
the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest two weeks of the year for family films,''
said Bucksbaum. He predicted ``Patch Adams,'' starring Robin
Williams, will lead the Christmas weekend and give a badly needed
boost to Universal.

TRAIN INVOLVED IN EARLIER FATALITY DERAILS IN NORTH TEXAS, 15 HURT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Amtrak's Texas Eagle, bound from Chicago to
Los Angeles with 199 holiday travelers, derailed near Six Flags
Over Texas in Arlington Sunday night, injuring at least 15 people.
</P>
<P>
   Nine cars of the 13-car train left the tracks about 7 p.m., 31/2
hours after the same train had hit and killed a deaf woman in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the 199 passengers were taken to area hospitals with
what were reported as minor injuries, and uninjured passengers were
evacuated to the Meadowbrook Recreation Center in Arlington, blocks
from the derailment. Later, the passengers were taken by Arlington
school buses to the Ramada Inn in downtown Fort Worth, where 175
rooms were reserved for them.
</P>
<P>
   John Wolf, an Amtrak spokesman in Washington, said Sunday night
there was no indication of what caused the derailment.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Railroad Administration and National Transportation
Safety Board are investigating. Union Pacific Railroad crews were
dispatched to help clear the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The train's silver cars sat crookedly off the tracks. Medical
crews stood by with stretchers, blankets and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Bionica Mullins, 16, walked out of the wreckage
carrying her baggage to a truck belonging to a friend who came to
pick her up. She was on her way to Fort Worth from Benton, Ark.,
when the train derailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just came off the track,'' she said. ``I was sitting there
and we felt a jerk and then it tipped over. I thought we were dead.
I was waiting the whole time for the thing to cave in. I held on. I
was still in the chair. It was dark, and everybody was
scrambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Brian O'Brien, who was headed to Tucson, Ariz., said
he had just finished dinner when he felt the train come to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit the brakes hard,'' O'Brien said. ``You could feel him
put on the emergency brakes. It chattered a bit, and then you could
feel it go on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The derailment closed Division Street between Six Flags Drive
and Stadium Drive. Arlington fire Lt. Pat English said it may be up
to two days before Division is reopened while the wreckage is
cleared and investigators try to determine the derailment's cause.
Heavy equipment will be needed to clear wreckage, which also is
near power lines, English said.
</P>
<P>
   The superliner originated in Chicago, where passengers said an
electrical problem caused a 11/2-hour delay, and was headed for Los
Angeles via San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The speed limit was recently raised to 60 mph on the Union
Pacific tracks used by up to 25 trains a day through Arlington,
portions of Fort Worth and Grand Prairie in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Several passengers said the train was traveling very fast, but
English said the passenger train was going ``much slower'' than 60
mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just had that two- or three-hour delay, so I figured he
was making up for lost time,'' said Bob Toney of Nappanee, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 injured were treated mostly for neck and back pain,
English said. One person was trapped in the train, but only because
a door was stuck, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have been much, much worse,'' English said.
</P>
<P>
   Six people were taken to Dallas-Fort Worth Medical Center in
Grand Prairie. Six others went to Arlington Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours after the wreck, 150 passengers remained in
their seats on the train, as tow trucks and ambulances lined
Division Street.
</P>
<P>
   The same train ran over and killed a deaf woman earlier in the
day near Jim Miller Road and Redbud Street in Pleasant Grove, the
Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Martinez, 33, was killed about 3:25 p.m. as she was
walking on the tracks, officials said. The death appeared to be
accidental, but an autopsy was not scheduled to be complete until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The train was delayed in Pleasant Grove for about three hours
for the medical examiner's investigation and to remove the woman's
body from beneath the train.

UCLA LANDS TOP RECRUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA capped its biggest recruiting weekend of the
season with five oral commitments, including two from players
considered among the best at their position in the state: Hart High
receiver Jerry Owens and Corona offensive lineman Shane Lehmann.
</P>
<P>
   Owens was so impressed with UCLA he plans to cancel visits to
Oregon, Ohio State, USC and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to take all my visits, but I got (to UCLA) and had
the feeling that this was something I needed to do,'' said Owens,
whose host for the weekend was freshman tailback DeShaun Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Owens topped UCLA's wish list at receiver, but don't count on
him stepping into the starting lineup next season because the
Bruins are loaded. Danny Farmer, Brad Melsby, Brian Poli-Dixon,
Freddie Mitchell, Jon Dubravac and Cody Joyce all return.
</P>
<P>
   If injuries strike, perhaps Owens will join the rotation. If
not, he has the option to redshirt, get stronger, recover from a
broken leg suffered in Hart's last regular-season game, and be
ready for 2000 with four years of eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches cannot comment on recruits until letters of intent are
signed Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Some recruiting analysts believe Owens is the state's best
receiver, while some prefer Long Beach Poly's Kareem Kelly, who has
committed to USC. But there's no doubt about Lehmann. He is
6-foot-5 and 280 pounds and chose UCLA over Notre Dame, Ohio State
and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA also received an oral commitment from Esperanza kicker Nate
Fikse, who will compete for Chris Sailer's vacant position with
current walk-on Chris Griffith. The Bruins are also in search of a
punter, since Sailer has performed both functions the last two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Bruins landed David and Matt Ball, twin defensive
ends from Dixon, a Sacramento suburb. The Balls are 6-5 and 230
pounds each and play with a controlled rage missing from the Webb
twins, Micah and Josh, who have not lived up to their billing in
the three years since they signed.
</P>
<P>
   Cal, Washington, Stanford and Oregon were recruiting the Balls.
</P>
<P>
   Where they stand: The weekend commitments increase UCLA's total
to nine. The others are Venice quarterback J.P. Losman, Temecula
safety Ryan Wikert, Anaheim linebacker Asi Faoa and Bakersfield
defensive lineman Rodney Leisle.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has 20 scholarships available.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell update: Mitchell's availability for the Rose Bowl
probably will be determined this week. He has made a breathtaking
recovery from a broken leg suffered at Houston on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Mitchell had the second of two interlocking screws
removed from his left femur _ the stabilizing rod will remain for
the rest of his career _ and he recently ran the 40-yard dash in
5.3 seconds. If the time drops, as expected, he may be cleared to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The scholars: Sailer and center Shawn Stuart are among 35
players nationally who have been awarded $5,000 postgraduate
scholarships by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart, a sociology major from Saugus, had a 3.62 grade-point
average and currently attends graduate school. He has made the
director's honor roll (3.0 GPA or higher) in all 14 quarters at
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Sailer, from Burbank, is a communications major with a 3.32 GPA.
He has made the honor roll in eight of the last nine quarters.

MAN FACED OWN HORROR TO TRY TO SAVE A LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Slammed to a halt behind an exploding gas tanker
on the Ventura Freeway, 19-year-old Mike Daniel watched in horror
as fire snaked closer to a crashed Chevy Blazer. Trapped inside,
22-year-old Zaki Gordon screamed for help.
</P>
<P>
   Flames blazed 200 feet high and explosions sounded like gunfire.
Yet Daniel rushed into the inferno and tried to free Gordon, only
to find his legs pinned, his body immobile.
</P>
<P>
   As heat from the flames began to lick Daniel's face and arms, he
gave up hope and ran for safety. About four minutes after the
explosion, the flames engulfed the car with Gordon in it.
</P>
<P>
   For Daniel, with a past shaded by a juvenile record, that moment
Saturday afternoon on the freeway west of Los Angeles marked a
change of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be heavy into gangs and things like that when I was
younger,'' he said Sunday, from his home in suburban Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go through that and see people getting killed, and
something like this happens and you try to save a life instead of
take one, it opens your mind to a whole different way.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Daniel gathered with his friends Keri Homan and Sito
Tupuola, who were with him Saturday, to come to grips with the
tragedy they had shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened all so quick,'' said Homan, who was driving
Saturday. ``Now that I think about it, I think we did everything we
can. The way that the Jeep was stuck, you would need the Jaws of
Life to get him out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel brooded over his inability to free Gordon from the
burning vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   When a firefighter who transported him to the hospital praised
his bravery, Daniel rejected the compliment.
</P>
<P>
   In the emergency room, he played the scene over and over,
reviewing rescue maneuvers he could have tried: He could have put
the truck in neutral and pushed it out of harm's way, he thought.
He could have gotten in the Blazer and loosened Gordon's wedged
legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so messed up because I thought I failed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said, well, you did all you could. But you know what?
If I had been more aware of the situation, there could have been a
lot more done.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred when Gordon, entering the northbound Ventura
Freeway from the Lindero Canyon on-ramp, lost control of his
vehicle on the rain-slick roadway, the California Highway Patrol
reported.
</P>
<P>
   He swept into a Chevron gasoline tanker truck, which rolled on
its side and slid into the center divider. The Chevy Blazer landed
alongside it.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after the crash, the rig exploded with a thunderous
boom, and gas gushed onto the freeway around Gordon's vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a bridge above us, and the flames were as huge as
that,'' Homan said. ``The flames ran across the whole entire
freeway.''
</P>
<P>
   Homan slowed to a stop about 20 feet before the crash site, and
leapt out with Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, John Legans, 48, of Lancaster, north of Los
Angeles, was taken to a hospital where he was treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   Zaki Gordon's brothers Yani, 11, and Adam, 14, leaped from the
sport-utility vehicle immediately, and Homan said she rushed over
to check their wounds. Both suffered minor injuries and were
treated at a hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   But their older brother was pinned in the driver's seat, his
legs jammed by the crushed left side of the vehicle, Homan said.
</P>
<P>
   As he struggled to free himself, flames from the explosion were
spreading along the trail of spilled gasoline, creeping closer to
his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor thing was trying to start the car after it was
crushed, to try and move it, because he saw the fire coming and he
couldn't do nothing about it,'' Homan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was scared, and then my friend Mike jumped in.''

   Daniel lives with his grandparents and aspires to be a stuntman.
He's now looking for a job, he said. His current life, however, is
far from the one he left behind three years ago. Between ages 9 and
16, he said, he associated with gang members, and spent time in
juvenile hall. He renounced all gang connections at 16, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the problems of his past receded into the background
as he saw someone's life at stake and tried to save him.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel was airlifted to UCLA Medical Center and treated for
first-degree burns to his face and lungs, and second-degree burns
to his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   While he was unable to save Gordon's life, the experience opened
a new window in his own. ``I used to see things like that on the
news, and like well, truck blew up, that guy burned to death, well,
that happens,'' he said. ``But now it's a different thing. Wow,
that poor guy burned to death. His poor family. His holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's grandmother, Joan DeHaven, acknowledges that the
incident gives her a shiver of fear when she imagines what might
have happened. But it's also testimony to how much he has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worries me that he jumps in and does things without
thinking,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she said, ``I'm very proud of him. Not many people
jump into a burning car to try to help somebody. That's really
quite astounding that he did that.''

LATE FIELD GOAL LIFTS PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The tumult of excited Patriots crashed onto
the playing field, amid a stadium of disbelieving fans who had
witnessed a fairy tale game led by the Wizard of Zo.
</P>
<P>
   Running contrary to the predictions of most prognosticators, the
Patriots defeated the San Francisco 49ers, 24-21, Sunday at Foxboro
Stadium. The unlikely win, combined with the Tennessee Oilers' loss
at Green Bay, lifted New England into the playoffs for the third
straight season.
</P>
<P>
   The game ball went to Scott Zolak. The inspiration for the win
went to Scott Zolak. The praise for leadership went to Scott Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand,'' said receiver Shawn Jefferson, who
caught a 61-yard touchdown pass from Zolak in the second quarter.
``Zolak is a very confident player. He gives out that confidence in
practice and he gave it on the field today. When he was in the
huddle he kept clapping and said, `Let's go get 'em.' When the
quarterback is feeling that way, it spreads over to the whole team.
We rallied around him, there's no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers may not bear out Jefferson's comments. Zolak
completed 14 of 30 passes for 205 yards, two touchowns, and two
interceptions. He wasn't always sharp and could have had even more
interceptions, but that didn't matter. The fact is he made throws
when the Patriots needed them most. His passing led to the tying
touchdown in the fourth quarter, then he led a 23-yard drive that
set up Adam Vinatieri's winning 35-yard field goal with three
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw all that stuff on TV while I was watching the pregame
shows (Saturday) night, and some of the things being said really
pissed me off,'' said Zolak. ``When you hear all of that stuff, you
want to prove people wrong. That's the way I've always been.''
</P>
<P>
   If Zolak keeps it up, the Patriots may have even bigger
surprises ahead. He likely will lead the Patriots into the
Meadowlands to face Bill Parcells's New York Jets in a game that
may help determine whether New England will host a wild-card game
or if the AFC East champion Jets earn a first-round bye. Even with
a loss to the Jets, the Patriots could host a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   The win was emotional not only for Zolak and his teammates but
also for coach Pete Carroll, who was bypassed for the 49ers' head
coaching job two years ago after two years as their defensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big game for us to win. It's huge,'' said Carroll.
``The way we all stuck together and followed the game plan and
responded when we had so many players missing was remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak certainly had a lot of support. Rookie running back Robert
Edwards followed up his 196-yard effort against the St. Louis Rams
last week with 101 yards on 24 carries. He did some tough running
and, unlike last week, got the tough yards when they were needed.
And the offensive line pushed the 49ers around.
</P>
<P>
   The defense came up with big plays along the way _ big
fourth-quarter sacks by rookie Greg Spires and cornerback Steve
Israel as well as a fourth-quarter interception by Willie Clay,
which set the stage for the game-tying drive.
</P>
<P>
   With the Patriots trailing, 21-14, and 12:18 left, Clay got
things headed in the right direction by picking off a Steve Young
pass intended for Terrell Owens with a diving effort at the 49ers'
49-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game at that point called for someone to make a big play,
and I was in position to do it,'' said Clay.
</P>
<P>
   From there Zolak, methodically led the Patriots down field. He
completed a big third-and-17 play to Tony Simmons that went for 20
yards to the San Francisco 21. Moments later, Simmons made a
mistake when he caught a 13-yard pass on third down and went out of
bounds 2 yards short of the first-down marker.
</P>
<P>
   With 8:48 left, the Patriots decided to go for it on fourth
down. They came out in a shotgun and Zolak found Ben Coates for a
4-yard gain and a first down at the 9.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards did the rest, running up the middle for 4 yards, then
off Todd Rucci for 5 yards and the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last week, I wasn't about to be stopped there,'' said
Edwards, who was stopped on two series inside the 5-yard line in
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defense responded from there, but after an Israel
sack forced a 49ers punt, San Francisco stiffened on defense as
well and got the ball back at its 11 with 3:29 left. Spires came up
with a huge play on a third-and-1, sacking Young for a 10-yard loss
that resulted in a punt and a 14-yard return by Troy Brown to the
49ers 41.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots took over with 1:48 remaining and stayed on the
ground with four running plays by Edwards and an important facemask
penalty by Winfred Tubbs, which put the ball at the 17. After Zolak
took a knee at the 18, Vinatieri, who had missed a 33-yarder in the
second quarter, nailed the winner.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, things looked bleak.
</P>
<P>
   On the final play of the half, the 49ers had botched a 40-yard
field goal attempt on a poor snap, but holder Ty Detmer, the backup
quarterback, gathered the ball and rolled to his left. Tight end
Irv Smith somehow got behind the Patriots' coverage into the end
zone, and Detmer hit him with a pass for 6 points and a 21-14 49ers
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers had tied it, 14-14, when Zolak threw a ball intended
for Coates that went into the arms of Tim McDonald, who ran it 18
yards to the Patriots 22. Three plays later, Young threw to a wide
open Owens for a 7-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots drew first blood, going 48 yards on six plays and
scoring on Zolak's 19-yard toss to Edwards, who got a big block
from Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   With 9:18 remaining in the second quarter, Young connected with
Jerry Rice on a short pass over the middle, and Rice beat Clay and
the rest of the Patriots secondary for a 75-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   But Zolak and the Patriots showed their resiliency _ and a deep
game of their own. Jefferson separated himself from defender Merton
Hanks at the 25, caught a Zolak long ball on the fly at the 15, and
went in for the 61-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn called that one. He told me, `I can beat him deep,' and
to watch for it, so I did,'' Zolak said. ``Shawn got free.''

IN QUICK TRIAL, TOP DISSIDENT GETS 13 YEARS IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ After a three-hour trial, the most prominent democracy
advocate remaining in China was sentenced to 13 years in prison
Monday on charges of seeking to overthrow the state.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh sentence for Xu Wenli, 55, who previously spent 12
years in prison for peacefully advocating democratic change, showed
the firm determination of the Communist government to stamp out a
new democratic political party Xu had promoted, and any other
effort to organize alternative political groups.
</P>
<P>
   After the judgment was announced, Xu condemned the sentence as
``political persecution,'' according to a person from the
court-appointed law firm that had been given just four days to put
together a defense. The person from the law firm, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Xu initially said he did not want to
appeal the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, two other men who promoted the new political party,
Wang Youcai, 32, and Qin Yongmin, 45, were also tried on subversion
charges, but results have not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Friday trials _ both of which proceeded with no defense
attorneys _ Monday's proceeding showed that in cases involving
security issues, the police and courts can write their own rules.
</P>
<P>
   According to the criminal procedure law, defendants are to be
notified at least 10 days before a trial, but Xu was told only four
days ago that his trial would be on Monday. His wife _ who has not
been allowed to contact him since his arrest on Nov. 30 _ was told
only three days ago of the trial date.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants also have a legal right to a lawyer of their choice,
but Xu was assigned a lawyer by the court late last week. Before
Monday morning's trial the lawyer, Mo Shaoping, only saw his client
for one brief meeting, his associate said.
</P>
<P>
   Xu's wife, He Xintong, refused to meet the lawyer herself,
saying he could not possibly mount an effective defense. ``Meeting
him would be tantamount to cooperating with the whole charade,''
she said in a telephone interview this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The person from the defense lawyer's office said prosecutors had
dwelled Monday morning on three issues: that Xu had in statements
to foreign journalists and others called for independent trade
unions; that he had accepted money from foreign hostile forces, and
that he had been active in organizing the China Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The defense argued that Xu had been peacefully expressing his
own views and that they did not amount to subversive activities
against the state. But the court quickly declared Xu guilty and is
sending him to spend what may be much of the rest of his life in
prison.

JAKE'S LATE MAGIC KEEPS DREAMS ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Jake Plummer wasn't certain, but he thought he
saw a shadow of doubt on the faces of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans Saints had just taken a one-point lead in the
closing 81 seconds of an emotion-charged, playoff-atmosphere battle
with the Cardinals, one that both teams needed to win Sunday to
keep postseason hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' fortunes appeared bleak when a holding penalty on
the kickoff return put the ball at their 8-yard line with 1:16 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into the huddle and said to the guys, `I don't see the
look in your eyes,' '' Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, as they had seven previous times since Plummer
became their quarterback last season, responded. Two passes to
Frank Sanders for 53 yards and a 21-yard scramble later, Plummer
positioned Chris Jacke to kick a 36-yard field goal as time
expired, giving the Cardinals a 19-17 win that vaults them to the
brink of their first playoff berth since moving to Arizona in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals (8-7) beat the San Diego Chargers (5-10) at Sun
Devil Stadium on Sunday in the season finale, the Cardinals are in.
</P>
<P>
   The magic of Plummer in late-game situations has been largely
responsible for their ascension from a four-win season in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being in that situation, although we've been in it
probably too many times,'' said Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Adrian Murrell became a 1,000-yard rusher for the
third straight season and the line did not allow a sack in 44
passing plays as the offense rolled to 513 total yards, the
Cardinals were in trouble late because they had scored in threes
rather than sevens.
</P>
<P>
   That left an injury-battered defense the chance to identify some
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Maddox, an eighth-year pro starting his third game at
middle linebacker in place of injured Ron McKinnon, made his first
career sack.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Sapp, a backup outside linebacker, forced a fumble on
another sack.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Wilson, who started in place of injured defensive tackle
Mark Smith, deflected a field goal. Wilson blocked one at
Washington on Nov. 22 that proved to be the difference in that
game, as well.
</P>
<P>
   At Washington, the 318-pound Wilson, when describing his
vertical leap, quipped, ``I can dunk a doughnut.'' After this one,
Wilson said, ``Now I can dunk with two hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The big turning point, though, was a defensive stand early in
the fourth quarter after Murrell lost a fumble at the Arizona 18.
The Saints moved nine yards in three plays. On fourth-and-one,
Saints Coach Mike Ditka turned down a field-goal try that would
have tied the game at 13. Maddox, who was on three Super Bowl teams
at Buffalo, stuffed Aaron Craver for no gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had just gotten all the momentum with the sudden change,
and when that happens, we have to go make something happen quickly
to take it right back from them,'' Maddox said. ``Bernard and
Rashod (Swinger) did a good job tying up their guard and center,
and I got in scot-free. We just weren't going to let them get a
first down on us down there.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the Cardinals controlled the ball for more than
10 minutes in the first quarter with only 3 points to show for it,
until Jacke kicked his second straight game winner (his 32-yard
field goal beat Philadelphia in overtime Dec. 13), points were hard
to come by.
</P>
<P>
   The difference ultimately was that the Cardinals had Plummer and
the Saints didn't.
</P>
<P>
   And after this morning, the Cardinals are expected to have
Plummer, who is under contract through 1999, a lot longer. The
Cardinals have called a news conference and are expected to
announce a long-term extension. Plummer's agent, Leigh Steinberg,
was on the field after the game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to get it done tonight,'' Steinberg said. ``But I
don't think we're going to ask for a separate charter to take his
family to and from games.''
</P>
<P>
   If Plummer, who completed 32 of 44 passes for 394 yards,
continues to bail the Cardinals out of tight spots, team owner Bill
Bidwill might at least upgrade Plummer to first-class seating on
the new charter aircraft unveiled last week. After all, his
last-drive heroics assured the Cardinals of a non-losing season and
equaled the most wins they've had since they moved to the Valley.
If they beat San Diego, they will end the league's longest playoff
drought at 16 years and post their first winning record since going
9-7 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   And while there were more than 20,000 empty seats in Sun Devil
Stadium for what many believed was the team's biggest game since
moving here, the crowd of 51,617 was strongly pro-Cardinals, which
often has not been the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you work for,'' Coach Vince Tobin said. ``I've
never liked having to depend on someone else do do things for me. I
like to carry my own weight. I want to get into the playoffs
because of what we do, not what someone else does.'' &QL;

SO FAR, ZO GOOD FOR BACKUP QB TURNED STARTER 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Only Zo knows.
</P>
<P>
   Drew can guess, but he doesn't know, because Drew is The Star
and the star simply cannot relate. Drew Bledsoe makes the big bucks
and gets all the headlines, and that's the way it should be since
he has the obvious God-given talent and the proven ability to win
games in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   So how could Drew know?
</P>
<P>
   How could Drew know what it's like to be 31 years old and be the
perennial backup quarterback to a man who has been both efficient
and amazingly durable? How could Drew know what it is like to go
through an entire season (1996) in which your two chances to play
consist of a game in which you throw one pass (completed) and one
in which you take three successive knees at the end of a 45-7 rout?
</P>
<P>
   How could Drew know what it's like to have gone more than three
full seasons without starting? How could Drew know what it's like
to walk the local streets knowing that people are pointing at you
and saying, ``Boy, I wish I had a cushy job like that guy has,'' or
``Drew Bledsoe's backup ... that's like being the Maytag
repairman,'' or ``Is that guy a football player or a football
watcher?'' or ``Hey, Zo, don't drop the clipboard, buddy''?
</P>
<P>
   No way Drew could know. Only some other team's Zo could know.
</P>
<P>
   Only another Zo somewhere in the National Football League could
relate to the satisfaction Scott Zolak felt Sunday afternoon when
he took the first snap, the last snap, and every Patriots snap in
between for a team whose dramatic and highly entertaining 24-21
victory over the San Francisco 49ers sent New England into the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to the Super Bowl and did some other good
things,'' said Zolak, ``I was pretty much along for the ride. It's
nice to be able to put my stamp on one of these games. It was worth
staying around.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci said Zolak was as good as he
needed to be, but he was better than that. He was good, period. He
made a number of quality professional plays and he made one very
big play, airing it out for a 61-yard TD bomb to Shawn Jefferson
that let the Niners know he wasn't going to be some
pocket-protector nerdy custodian of perfunctory quarterback duties.
That pass let the San Francisco 49ers, and perhaps any future
Patriots opponents, know that Drew Bledsoe wasn't the only
legitimate professional quarterback in the organization's employ.
</P>
<P>
   This game was the textbook definition of pressure. If the
Patriots had lost _ even if they had lost, 50-47, in overtime _
where do you suppose the finger would have been pointed? This was
the biggest game of Scott Zolak's eight-year professional career.
It was a pass-fail exam, and he aced it; that's all there was to
it.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of happy fans in the doomed stadium Sunday
afternoon, but none more ecstatic than the occupant of Section 121,
Row 8, Seat 13. That would be his former high school coach, a Mr.
Paul Zolak, who, yes, also doubles as Scott Zolak's father. For the
past eight years the elder Zolak has attended every Patriots home
game, usually driving the 10 1/2 hours needed to make the trip from
his home outside of Pittsburgh. But for this game, one in which it
was certain that he would start, Scott Zolak had his dad flown in.
</P>
<P>
   And just as Drew could not know, neither could Mac Bledsoe,
another coaching dad, possibly know what it's been like to be Paul
Zolak, to come week after week, year after year, hoping to see your
son demonstrate his ability without wishing any harm to befall the
star quarterback who was making his son a career caddy. It would
have been one thing if Paul Zolak were just a cheerleading layman
of a father. But when you have coached the game, when, in fact, you
have coached a man some say was the Best Quarterback Ever _ does
the name Montana ring your chimes? _ and when you know enough about
the technicalities of the sport to know that your son really is a
capable professional quarterback, it cannot be easy to attend all
those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say I knew he could do this if he ever had a
chance to prepare,'' said Paul Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   With appropriate paternal pride, Paul Zolak ticked off some of
his son's long-ago accomplishments, starting with a title-winning
performance against Belle Vernon High School and concluding the
dissertation with a four-touchdown show that propelled the Maryland
Terrapins past hated Virginia and into the vaunted Poulan Weed
Eater Bowl (fabled in song and story). But with all deference to
the pair of Ws his son posted back in '92 (pre-Drew and pre-Tuna),
he had to acknowledge that what Scott did Sunday represented the
zenith of his professional career. Perhaps Zolak pere was confident
Zolak a fils could get the job done, but not everyone shared that
opinion, as Scott Zolak knew all too well.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe himself did his best to instill confidence, but there
was only so much anyone on the outside could do. This was not an
easy week. He was the center of unwelcome media attention, and he
did not sleep very well. He knew the stakes. He knew that if he
went onto the field and tossed out a stink bomb, his reputation
would never be salvaged.
</P>
<P>
   So how could anyone on this earth know what it felt like to be
Scott Zolak at approximately 4:10 Sundayafternoon, after he had
proven to the world and, most important, to the 44 players whose
fate he had held in his hands that he was someone they could rely
on?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about what Zo did today,'' saluted Chris
Slade. ``It is great to know you can lose your starting quarterback
and have someone come in and play the way he did today. We did not
lose a beat today with Zo in there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a great day to be Scott Zolak, but no one else knows how
great.
</P>
<P>
   Only Zo knows.

COUNT ON CARDS FOR THRILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The winner's locker room was quite a scene.
Cattle were mooing. Shepherds and wise men knelt in wonder around
the heaven-sent quarterback whose favorite receiver, Frank Sanders,
called ``an exciting little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bidwill bumped into a camel.
</P>
<P>
   Beaming like a new father, Bob Ferguson reached out and pumped
the hand of anyone and everyone, accepting congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't happened yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got one more,'' reminded Ferguson, vice president of
player personnel, after the Cardinals' 19-17 win over the New
Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   The most overdue team in professional sports still must beat the
San Diego Chargers at home Sunday in the last game of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cards (8-7) ``are'' going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they'll probably have three or four turnovers. Look for them
to blow a lead and fall behind late in the fourth quarter. Isn't it
always that way?
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer will come in and huddle the offense near his goal
line and take the team down the field, licking his fingers and
working his magic as he did again Sunday, when the Cardinals beat
the odds and the clock and kicked a 36-yard field goal on the last
play.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the way it is with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fight and fight and fight. Finally, it pays off,'' Patrick
Sapp said. The backup linebacker grinned, exposing a gleaming row
of gold teeth. ``That's the story of our season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cards are infuriating. Exasperating. Maddening.
</P>
<P>
   Delightfully entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   To my knowledge, not one fan has left Sun Devil Stadium this
season, after a win or a loss, and demanded a refund.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't like ``this'' ticket, you don't like roller
coasters,'' said Dave McGinnis, the frazzled defensive coordinator.
``You hang onto the bar. Maybe it'll keep you in. Maybe it won't.
What a ride.''
</P>
<P>
   One more win.
</P>
<P>
   The blessed event is close now. The due date is almost here.
Cardinals fans must feel as if they're in the last week of an
11-year pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardiac Cards beat the Chargers, they will qualify for
the NFL playoffs for the first time since the team moved to the
Valley. The last time the franchise qualified for the postseason in
a non-strike year, Henry Hyde had dark hair. Monica Lewinsky was 1
year old.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they are going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are going to make the playoffs because their
quarterback is a leader and a winner. Ask Plummer how he does it,
how he scrambled for 21 yards on the game-winning drive, and he
shakes his head and gives a beats-me smile. ``Just playin' baby,''
he said. ``Just playin.' '' Just doing what comes naturally.
</P>
<P>
   They're going to win because veterans like Aeneas Williams and
Larry Centers are determined to seize this long-dreamed-about
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, there was Centers catching a short pass,
then dropping his left hand to the ground to balance himself, then
running, weaving, legs churning like a bicyclist, and finally,
trying to hurdle a tackler for an extra yard.
</P>
<P>
   Centers worked as hard as Saints Coach Mike Ditka, who paced and
ranted, his jaw working furiously on a stick of chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   They are going to win because of young players like Pat Tillman.
To Tillman, the game of football is only a little more precious
than air. The rookie from Arizona State lost his job as starting
free safety a month ago. This week, Vince Tobin drew up a scheme
that placed Tillman in the thick of the action at middle
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like this?'' he asked McGinnis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hail, yes,'' his defensive coach said in his Texas drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman loved it. ``You should have seen his eyes light up,''
Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half, Tillman stood alongside McGinnis. ``Cub,
Cub,'' he said, whispering the code name for the alignment that
would get him off the sideline and into the game. The Cardinals
went to the formation in the second half. The Saints were caught by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the coaching staff for finding a way to take advantage of
Tillman's aggressiveness. The Saints couldn't block him. All he did
was make plays.
</P>
<P>
   One more win.
</P>
<P>
   They should do it. Aeneas Williams looked around the locker room
and liked what he saw. ``We're getting close,'' he said, ``to what
I call harvest time.'' &QL;

PLUMMER CLOSE TO LONG-TERM DEAL  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE Schoenfeld  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Second-year quarterback Jake Plummer will sign a
four-year contract extension with the Cardinals today, likely
making him the highest-paid player in team history.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have scheduled an 11 a.m. news conference but
refuse to discuss the details.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Plummer said his agent, Leigh Steinberg, and
the team were hammering out details Sunday night and expected to
complete them this morning.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to be for substantially more than $5
million a year, the going rate for young starting quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Another Steinberg client, Rob Johnson of Buffalo, signed a
five-year, $25 million contract last spring that included an $8
million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who still are $3 million under the 1998 salary
cap, could count some of Plummer's pro-rated signing bonus against
this year's cap.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg told ``The Arizona Republic'' that he has talked often
with Cardinals officials recently about a new deal for Plummer, who
has one year remaining on his rookie contract that averages
$545,000 a year. He earned $362,500 this year, one of the lowest
totals for a starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   By signing Plummer to the extension, the team will have its most
important and popular player under contract through the 2002
season. It also means the team will not have to use the
``franchise'' designation on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not right there, but we're close,'' Steinberg said of
negotiations. ``It could happen. There still are a few things to
work out, but I think we can get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg and his associate, David Dunn, attended Sunday's 19-17
victory over the New Orleans Saints, a game in which Plummer drove
the Cardinals 73 yards in the final 81 seconds for the winning
score.

UMASS MADE MOST OF ITS RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ In all honesty, it wasn't fair. The 1997
University of Massachusetts football team wasn't a conference title
contender, but it was much better than its 2-9 finish. The season
should have been marked with productivity and memorable moments
rather than embarrassing defeats, fingerpointing, and frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Fate was too cruel to the hapless Minutemen last season; players
who had given their best effort to make the program successful had
little to show and were left nonplussed, wondering if the reap-sow
principle ever would kick in.
</P>
<P>
   Fate made its peace with the Minutemen this season, paving the
way for an unlikely run to a winning season, a postseason victory,
then a national title. It was a year that made up for the futility
of last season and the sub-par years that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time last year ... I was looking for answers about what
had happened and just trying to put it in the past,'' said UMass
senior linebacker Khari Samuel following UMass's 55-43 victory over
Georgia Southern in Saturday's Division 1-AA national championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I don't remember too much because every game we
lost I tried to put behind me the next day. This year, we set so
many goals. Coach (Mark) Whipple set the goals when he came in
here, to win the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as I've said a few times this year, I've always known
we've had the talent to win. It's just about putting it together
and bringing confidence back in this program.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass discovered on Nov. 22 it had earned an at-large bid to the
16-team 1-AA tournament, but many players were still discouraged
over the 28-27 regular season-ending loss to Connecticut the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   UMass first-year coach Whipple told his 11th-seeded team that
its previous two defeats were followed by four victories, and that
four victories would give the Minutemen the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the players simply stared at their coach, whose words
sounded similar to his preseason claim of fielding a team capable
of winning a national championship. Surely many of UMass's
opponents didn't give it much of a chance, as evidenced by comments
Minutemen heard during the run.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with every game, Whipple's claim appeared conceivable. While
UMass didn't have as much speed and quickness as most of its
opponents, it had enough at key positions, and it made up for lack
of speed at other positions with technique and effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen's foes were often confused, frustrated. Offenses
which had spent all season controlling the game with a solid rush
attack had to abandon that game plan once UMass went ahead with its
pass-rush mix. Teams passed more than they were accustomed to, and
that led to much futility.
</P>
<P>
   Defenses which had dominated opponents with quickness and
aggression were fooled by trick plays and misdirections, and were
left tentative. Some who had underestimated players like running
back Marcel Shipp and wide receiver Adrian Zullo paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   Shipp set 1-AA championship game records in carries (35) and
yards (244) against GSU.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the effort was no less impressive than the 257 yards he
gained against Maine Nov. 14 and the 270 yards gained against UConn
Nov. 21 _ both coming after missing practice with a knee injury
suffered in an Oct. 31 game at New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Shipp's injury was so painful after the Connecticut game he was
forced to sit out the Minutemen's first-round playoff game against
favored McNeese State. Yet freshman tailback Kevin Quinlan, who
entered the game with 21 carries for 73 yards, left with a
career-best 147 yards on 28 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Zullo injured an ankle in the regular-season finale against
Connecticut and was expected to miss the postseason. But he was
back at practice the following week and shined in postseason,
catching a touchdown pass in three of the four playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the regular season, no one was surprised by
UMass's success. Yet it wasn't supposed to happen in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Not against McNeese State, last season's runner-up and this
year's preseason pick to win it all. Or Northwestern State, whose
only regular-season defeats were a 1-point loss to 12th-seeded Troy
State and a 35-14 setback to Division 1-A Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   UMass entered the championship game having beaten two
higher-seeded teams on the opponents' home field and one previously
unbeaten team.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people were saying we're from the North, and we don't
know how to play football,'' said tight end Kerry Taylor. ``We went
down and took care of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen drew many detractors before Saturday's game. GSU
had posted one of the most dominant seasons in 1-AA history, an
option attack which set 49 offensive records, including 12 national
1-AA marks.
</P>
<P>
   It ranked second in the nation in rushing (378.7 yards per
game), and had scored 82 touchdowns. Moreover, GSU reached the
finals with a 42-14 rout of Western Illinois, which had the best
defense in 1-AA.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Minutemen proved early on they would give the Eagles
their most formidable challenge of the year. The UMass charge was
led by linebacker Kole Ayi, who pulled a chest muscle during the
Lehigh game and didn't practice for Northwestern State. Against
GSU, he had 10 tackles and three fumble recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   And despite giving up 595 yards total offense to the Eagles, the
Minutemen made crucial stops and collected seven turnovers to keep
GSU from taking command. Even when the Eagles shut out UMass, 14-0,
in the third quarter to pull to 38-33, UMass didn't falter,
responding with two rushing touchdowns to put the game out of
reach.
</P>
<P>
   And that left GSU, a team which had just 20 turnovers all
season, in a state of disbelief. When it was over, GSU coach Paul
Johnson was asked if he felt the Minutemen's effort was indicative
of a team of destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something magical could have helped us drop the ball seven
times, but I think it was their defense,'' he said. ``There's no
question Coach Whipple's done a great job, and he should be coach
of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   After the contest, UMass players began to look to next season,
anticipating a defense of their title.
</P>
<P>
   UMass will need to fill the void created by the departures of
cocaptains Samuel and Taylor but Todd Bankhead, Shipp, Zullo, and
Ayi return and the Minutemen are expected to apply for a fifth year
of eligibility for senior wideout Jimmy Moore, a Southern Methodist
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, why not (win it all again)?'' said Ayi. ``We're going to
have to work hard again. Maybe harder, because people are going to
be looking for us.''

BACKUP TALLAS GETS BACK UP AFTER LONG LAYOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He has won his last two games, earning a 5-4 overtime
victory over Washington and beating Tampa Bay, 4-1. Problem is,
those contests were eons ago. Backup netminder Rob Tallas, who has
a record of 3-2-0, a goals-against average of 1.85, and save
percentage of .926, hasn't set foot (or skate) in the Bruins' net
since Nov. 24. Because of the club's schedule, which had Boston
playing just nine games in the 25 days since Tallas's last start,
Byron Dafoe has had nearly all of the goaltending duties.
</P>
<P>
   But, with Tallas's unblemished record against the Tampa Bay
Lightning _ 4-0-0 for his career _ he will be back between the
pipes Monday night when the Bruins host Tampa at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be an easy assignment for Tallas. The Bruins are coming
off an emotional 4-1 win over the Stanley Cup champion Red Wings
Saturday and are subject to a letdown against the lowly Lightning.
Add to that the long layoff, and Tallas may be facing an uphill
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just basically stay positive,'' said Tallas, when asked how
he dealt with the idle time. ``You look around the league, and
other goalies are in the same situation.''
</P>
<P>
   If truth be told, some backup goalies are in worse situations.
For example, former UMass-Lowell goalie Dwayne Roloson is the
backup in Buffalo behind warrior Dominik Hasek and has played just
60 minutes of a possible 1,583.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough but it's part of our job and you have to fight
through it,'' said Tallas. ``There was a time last year I got hurt
and then we had the Christmas holidays and I had about four weeks
off. I came back and got a shutout in the first game against
Washington, and you have to look back and be positive on that,
like, `You've done it before, you can do it again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a true challenge. We're coming off a high.
It's a Monday night crowd, and sometimes they're not the best. It's
a great challenge for me. I hope they come prepared and throw
everything my way and that I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas routinely is the last Bruin on the ice at practice,
getting in extra work.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Assistant coach) Bobby Francis has been great the last couple
of days,'' said Tallas. ``He told me you don't want to be playing
games too much after practice with the guys because you pick up bad
habits. Basically, relax and do some game situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby has always been great to me, even in Providence. I
respect him as a coach. When he tells me something, I totally
listen to him because he's right. He grew up with his father, Emile
Francis, the original Cat. Bobby knows what he's talking about; he
knows a lot about goaltending. (Saturday) we worked on game
situations, handling the puck. Sometimes you get away from that
because as the season goes on, the practices get shorter. In my
case, they have to get longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas has always been upbeat, but he said it has been difficult
to sit and watch every game, as he has the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't deny it's frustrating because you really want to
feel like a part of the team,'' he said. ``You want to get out
there and prove something. You miss the excitement. We've got some
games coming up, and I just keep looking at that. I know what the
schedule reads in the future. I'm definitely always looking
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas said his frustration is mitigated by his strong
relationship with Dafoe. The two are friends and spend a lot of
time with each other, relating as only goaltenders can.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for him,'' said Dafoe. ``I haven't really been in
that situation, so I can't know what is going through his mind. I
would love to play every game. I know it's not going to happen, but
as for Robbie, he's a very positive person and that's what is going
to keep him in this league for a long time. He works hard in
practice, and when he gets his opportunity, he takes advantage of
it. He is coming off two wins, let's not forget that, so he's on a
roll.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tallas plans to keep that roll going Monday night.
</P>

COYOTES MAKE MOST OF PIT STOP  
 TKACHUK'S FINAL-PERIOD GOAL BESTS ISLANDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Considering where the Coyotes have been and where
they're going, Sunday's game against the New York Islanders was
like an overnight stop at a businessman's hotel.
</P>
<P>
   You might say that all those clanging souvenir handbells that
were ringing non-stop at sold-out America West Arena were their
wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   After returning home from a four-game road trip, the Coyotes
stuck around long enough to stick it to the Islanders, 4-2, before
getting ready to head out of town again today for games at Detroit
on Tuesday and Chicago on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to finish these next two games and get back home
and play in front of our crowd,'' said Keith Tkachuk, who provided
the game winner for Phoenix on the power play by shuffling in Deron
Quint's shot toward net with 5:20 left to play. ``December's been a
tough month for us with all the travel, but I think we're battling
through and doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk apparently forgot that the Coyotes also must venture to
Los Angeles on Saturday _ their 11th time away from home in 13
games _ before returning to the Valley for a five-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Home has been good for the Coyotes (18-5-4), who pulled to
within three points of Dallas _ which has played two more games
than Phoenix _ for the best record in the league. Sunday's victory
ran the Coyotes' streak to 11 home games without a loss, which ties
a franchise record set in the 1983-84 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes haven't lost here since their opening-night 4-1
disaster against Ottawa. Since then, they're 10-0-1, haven't
allowed more than two goals in a single game and have outscored the
opposition, 37-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a big bonus for us,'' center Bob Corkum said.
``Especially when you get down to playoff time. If we can keep
streaks like this going, it's very imposing for other teams to come
in here and try to get a win when they know we haven't lost in so
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Corkum sealed it for Phoenix with an empty-net goal shortly
after New York Coach Mike Milbury pulled goalie Tommy Salo for a
sixth attacker in the final frantic minute and a half.
</P>
<P>
   With a faceoff in front of Coyotes goalie Nikolai Khabibulin,
Islanders defenseman Eric Brewer lost the puck along the boards and
stumbled, allowing Corkum to race down the wing for the clinching
score with 31 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost a wheel,'' said Brewer, who had tied the score at 2
with his third goal of the season midway through the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Adams had a goal and an assist for the Coyotes, who also
got a goal from second-year pro Juha Ylonen, just his second of the
season and the third of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Mark Lawrence had a goal and an assist for the Islanders
in his 10th NHL game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game started out like the best of my life and ended as
the worst,'' Lawrence said. ``We had a lot of chances tonight and
didn't capitalize.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as many chances as the Coyotes, who had 34 shots and
seemingly could have racked up seven or eight goals had Salo not
stoned them on a few can't-miss attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their goaltender played real well,'' Quint said. ``It's a
different style than what we've seen. He comes out a lot and
challenges you. We didn't make many passes by him, so we kept
shooting it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes scored twice on the power play after an 0-for-15
stretch and failing to score with the man advantage on their recent
four-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Schoenfeld likened Sunday's pit stop to another road
game, a hockey one-night-stand, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost ``is'' like another road game,'' Schoenfeld said,
``when you only come back for one after playing games out East.
You're back for one game, and we're leaving again in the morning
for Detroit. It isn't like a home game where you get acclimated.
You're in town and out of town, so this was just like another road
game, which all of December pretty much has been.'' &QL;

UCLA LANDS TOP RECRUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA capped its biggest recruiting weekend of the
season with five oral commitments, including two from players
considered among the best at their position in the state: Hart High
receiver Jerry Owens and Corona offensive lineman Shane Lehmann.
</P>
<P>
   Owens was so impressed with UCLA he plans to cancel visits to
Oregon, Ohio State, USC and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to take all my visits, but I got (to UCLA) and had
the feeling that this was something I needed to do,'' said Owens,
whose host for the weekend was freshman tailback DeShaun Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Owens topped UCLA's wish list at receiver, but don't count on
him stepping into the starting lineup next season because the
Bruins are loaded. Danny Farmer, Brad Melsby, Brian Poli-Dixon,
Freddie Mitchell, Jon Dubravac and Cody Joyce all return.
</P>
<P>
   If injuries strike, perhaps Owens will join the rotation. If
not, he has the option to redshirt, get stronger, recover from a
broken leg suffered in Hart's last regular-season game, and be
ready for 2000 with four years of eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches cannot comment on recruits until letters of intent are
signed Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Some recruiting analysts believe Owens is the state's best
receiver, while some prefer Long Beach Poly's Kareem Kelly, who has
committed to USC. But there's no doubt about Lehmann. He is
6-foot-5 and 280 pounds and chose UCLA over Notre Dame, Ohio State
and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA also received an oral commitment from Esperanza kicker Nate
Fikse, who will compete for Chris Sailer's vacant position with
current walk-on Chris Griffith. The Bruins are also in search of a
punter, since Sailer has performed both functions the last two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Bruins landed David and Matt Ball, twin defensive
ends from Dixon, a Sacramento suburb. The Balls are 6-5 and 230
pounds each and play with a controlled rage missing from the Webb
twins, Micah and Josh, who have not lived up to their billing in
the three years since they signed.
</P>
<P>
   Cal, Washington, Stanford and Oregon were recruiting the Balls.
</P>
<P>
   Where they stand: The weekend commitments increase UCLA's total
to nine. The others are Venice quarterback J.P. Losman, Temecula
safety Ryan Wikert, Anaheim linebacker Asi Faoa and Bakersfield
defensive lineman Rodney Leisle.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has 20 scholarships available.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell update: Mitchell's availability for the Rose Bowl
probably will be determined this week. He has made a breathtaking
recovery from a broken leg suffered at Houston on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Mitchell had the second of two interlocking screws
removed from his left femur _ the stabilizing rod will remain for
the rest of his career _ and he recently ran the 40-yard dash in
5.3 seconds. If the time drops, as expected, he may be cleared to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The scholars: Sailer and center Shawn Stuart are among 35
players nationally who have been awarded $5,000 postgraduate
scholarships by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart, a sociology major from Saugus, had a 3.62 grade-point
average and currently attends graduate school. He has made the
director's honor roll (3.0 GPA or higher) in all 14 quarters at
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Sailer, from Burbank, is a communications major with a 3.32 GPA.
He has made the honor roll in eight of the last nine quarters.

COYOTES FELLED BY FEARSOME SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's been called the scariest shot in hockey. St.
Louis Blues defenseman &UR; Al MacInnis has a slap shot that's been
clocked at over 100 mph.  &UR; Mike Sullivan, the Coyotes' checking line
left wing, felt it Thursday night in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   A MacInnis blast hit his left skate so hard during the Coyotes'
3-2 loss that it broke Sullivan's big toe, forcing him to miss
Sunday's game against the New York Islanders, as well as upcoming
games at Detroit, Chicago and Los Angeles. He will be out anywhere
from a week to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an awfully hard shot,'' Sullivan said after the
Coyotes' 4-2 win over New York. ``I played the rest of the game and
it got progressively sorer and sorer, but I didn't know it was
broke. He's got one of the hardest shots in the league, and you
have a tendency to try and get to him faster (to block a shot)
because he poses such a threat to you.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of other Phoenix players found themselves in the way of
MacInnis slap shots Thursday, including  &UR; Dallas Drake, the right
wing on the team's No. 1 line. Drake played Sunday against New
York, but the shot he took in the foot likely will put him in a
walking cast off the ice while he continues to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts a little,'' Drake said, ``but I didn't get it as bad
as Sully did.'' &QL; 
On the mend
</P>
<P>
   After missing two games because of a nagging groin injury,
 &UR; Keith
 &UR; Tkachuk returned to the Coyotes lineup and scored the game-winning
goal with 5:20 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great. My groin's much better. It just takes some time
to get into it, but I felt pretty good out there,'' said Tkachuk,
who netted his team-leading 16th goal. ``Obviously, at the end, it
gets a little tiring. But a couple more practices, a couple more
games . . . it feels almost like not being in training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk missed camp this summer because of a holdout. It took
him a week or so, he said, before he got his legs under him. &QL; 
Ringing in the season
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes teamed up with the Salvation Army in an effort to
set a Guinness world record during the second intermission of
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the sellout crowd of 16,210 purchased $2 holiday
hand bells and then, under the direction of Surf Dog recording
artist Gary Hoey, performed _ supposedly _ the world's largest hand
bell choir to the tune of ``Silver Bells,'' which originally was
written for the Salvation Army.
</P>
<P>
   According to a news release, there had to be at least 1,000
bells ringing to qualify for a record. &QL; 
Slap shots
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rick Tocchet had to be pulled away from Islanders goalie  &UR; Tommy
Salo after the two started yapping at each other during the first
period. Tkachuk then barged in and had a few choice words for Salo
before also getting led away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he did something to Rick, that's why I came in,''
Tkachuk said. ``Usually, it's the other way around. Rick always
comes in there for me, so I wanted to come in there for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Right wing  &UR; Shane Doan was back in the lineup after missing
Thursday's game in St. Louis to be with his wife,  &UR; Andrea, who
delivered the couple's first child early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Doan couldn't get back to Phoenix in time for the birth of
7-pound, 3-ounce daughter  &UR; Gracie Shea, however.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he just missed scoring his first goal of the season.
He is the only forward on the team, other than  &UR; Louie DeBrusk, who
has appeared in just one game, without a goal.

CARROLL STILL HASN'T WON OVER EVERYONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The coach was feeling his oats Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His team had just won the biggest game of the year when it was
outmanned and seemingly outgunned and had reached the playoffs for
the second straight season. Pete Carroll was feeling flush.
</P>
<P>
   Everything he believes in _ democracy in the locker room and the
players assuming responsibility for their team's future _ had
played out for him Sunday. Or so he thought, at least.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, they had been throttled by a team they should have
beaten even if the team plane had crashed on the way to St. Louis,
but this was a different week and a different team. While some see
that teeter-totter effect as a bad sign, Sunday all Pete Carroll
saw was a band of wounded warriors ambushing one of the best teams
around.
</P>
<P>
   He saw his team, the Patriots, hanging (as he would put it) and
hanging and hanging until they finally hung a 24-21 defeat on the
San Francisco 49ers. It was a win that when coupled with a loss by
the Tennessee Oilers put New England back in the playoffs. It was a
win that Carroll seemed to believe made a statement not only about
his team but also about himself and his methods.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two years, Carroll has felt that the local media has
been unfair to him. He complained last week to a West Coast
reporter that he has been unfairly labeled ``a California surfer''
even though he has never been on a surfboard in his life. Fact is,
no one in New England has ever said he has been, but let's not let
the facts get in the way of a pretty good line.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, that's the way Carroll sees it and so it has become
reality in his mind, just as the dark specter of the man he must
coach against next Sunday has stalked him from the shadows and will
continue to until his team does something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big win but until Pete beats the Jets ...''
linebacker Chris Slade said Sunday without finishing the thought.
He didn't have to finish it, because in New England the Jets mean
Bill Parcells and Bill Parcells means a headache for Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   That pudgy migraine exists in Carroll's head in part because he
feels that for the past two years his methods have been unfairly
compared to Parcells's by many in the media. He feels no one here
is capable of understanding his approach to football. We are
ignorant and he is smart and one day we'll all understand, but not
until it is as plain as the nose on Paula Jones's face. Until then
we must suffer in our ignorance and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When are you going to figure it out?'' Carroll asked Sunday,
less than an hour after his team's biggest win of the season.
``When are you going to figure out there's more than one way to do
this? The problem is with you, not me.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't saying that a week ago in St. Louis, of course, when
the Rams nearly butted his team out of the playoffs. But that was
last week and this was today and today had produced a big win by a
team that had rallied around him. So it was time to make his point,
which apparently is that it is not only Congress that needs to
develop a new sense of civility and open-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't say enough about the collective effort by so many
people to get this thing done,'' Carroll said. ``It took a bunch of
players that just wouldn't say die, that wouldn't listen to all of
the talk that they didn't have a chance against a great football
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about seeing people hang together and stay
with the coaches and believe in the coaches and believe in the game
plan and put it to work and make it come through and be successful.
I just can't say enough about the fact that it was a collective
effort by so many people to get this thing done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big win. That's a fine, fine football team (the
49ers) and they're hot. I'm darn proud of this whole thing today.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he was. He was proud his team had overcome injuries to
defensive end Willie McGinest, linebacker Ted Johnson, fullback
Tony Carter, quarterback Drew Bledsoe, and wide receiver Terry
Glenn. He was proud he had found a way to convince his team it was
still alive when it had good reason to feel otherwise with so many
of its top players in jeans and windbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   He felt proud that his methods had been vindicated against a
team he grew up cheering for, a team he once had coached, a team
that had chosen someone else to be its boss when he thought of
himself as a logical successor to George Seifert two years ago.
Proud to be alive for another couple of weeks, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it,'' said Patriots cornerback Steve Israel.
``Pete has lived the Walton, John Boy, Wonder Years (life). He's
lived the picture perfect career. He grew up in San Francisco. He
cheered and rooted for the Niners. He got an opportunity to coach
for them. Then he comes here in a big game and we knock them off. I
mean, what more can you ask for?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, complete acceptance of his methods by the skeptical,
for one. It was not enough Sunday for Pete Carroll's team to win.
It was not even enough to have it coupled with an Oilers loss that
put the Patriots back into the playoffs. Carroll needed more than
that. He needed acknowledgment from those he perceives as unfair
critics that his ideas will play here in the Northeast, where
everything seems unnecessarily harsh to him.
</P>
<P>
   He needed acceptance that his way is the true way, or at least
an acceptable way, to long-term success in the NFL. A win over the
49ers was enough to get that team into postseason play, but it
wasn't enough to give him that acceptance because it is still a
long walk from 9-6 to Miami on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   A long walk to prove that democracy and good cheer are enough to
lead a team to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   What went on Sunday at Foxboro Stadium was something Pete
Carroll had every right to be proud of, as did his team. But before
he talks too much about that he should remember this Biblical
admonition:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pride cometh before a fall.''

EDWARDS'S BIG GAIN: CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A smile crossed Robert Edwards's face, a
rare smile in front of the media, when he was reminded that a
certain other running back from the University of Georgia had
received virtually all the running back publicity before Sunday's
Patriots-49ers game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we don't rub noses too much, me and Garrison,'' said
Edwards when asked if this victory was sweeter because it was
Edwards _ and not Hearst _ who made the key runs in the final
minutes to put his team in position to win. ``I had a good game,
Garrison had a good game, and we really don't compete to see who
had the best game.''
</P>
<P>
   But at game's end, when plays had to be made, it was Edwards who
made them. ``I've grown a lot as a runner in the last two weeks,''
said the rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Edwards appears much more confident, no longer thinking
first, last, and foremost of simply not fumbling the ball, but
instead focusing on reading his blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards made three late runs that were huge for the Patriots,
especially considering that their two most feared offensive
weapons, Drew Bledsoe and Terry Glenn, were out of the lineup. In
the final quarter, San Francisco and New England had virtually the
same offensive philosophy _ the 49ers gave the ball to Hearst, and
the Patriots gave the ball to Edwards. Time and again.
</P>
<P>
   It was Edwards who came through, first when the Patriots faced a
first-and-goal at the Niners 9-yard line with eight minutes to
play. Edwards gained 4 yards, setting up a situation that New
England's players, coaches, and fans knew all too well: Just last
week in St. Louis, Edwards and the Patriots had the ball inside the
5 and failed to get it into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down on ourselves for not scoring there last week,''
said Edwards. ``I know when the ball gets down that close, I should
be able to score, and I didn't. I didn't want that to happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Edwards's number was called on the second-down play, ``I
knew we had to have it. When I heard my number, the first thing I
was thinking was, `Don't fumble the ball,' and then I was thinking,
`Just get it in.'''
</P>
<P>
   The much-maligned offensive line did its part, ``and I had a big
lane to run through,'' said Edwards, who finished with 101 yards on
24 carries and broke the 1,000-yard mark (1,068) for the season.
The rookie has had to learn many lessons this year about running a
football in the NFL, but he has not had to learn what to do when
he's near the goal line _ he has an instinct for getting into the
end zone, the St. Louis game the glaring exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to score,'' said Edwards. Which he did, slicing
through the middle of a pliant San Francisco defense and lunging
the final _ and most important _ yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I had that slump at midseason, it was all my fault,''
said Edwards. ``I wasn't reading (blocks) the way I should. But
I've learned what to do with my first read and then my second
read.'' And the result, said Patriots coach Pete Carroll, is that
he has become a back ``who ran like a warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week in St. Louis, when Edwards gained 196 yards, ``he had
a breakout week in terms of just being productive,'' said Carroll.
``But you noticed in practice this week there was a difference, and
I know it's just having confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was not finished running, however, because the game was
only tied. After the New England defense stifled the strangely
conservative San Francisco offense and the Patriots took over on
the 49ers 41 with 1:48 left, it was Edwards who carried the ball
into Adam Vinatieri's kicking range.
</P>
<P>
   On first down, Edwards gained 10 yards. Then he gained 3 more.
But his biggest run of the game came two plays later, when New
England faced a third-and-6 at the 27 with 23 seconds left, a
lengthy field goal attempt facing Vinatieri if Edwards did not come
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were trying to run the clock down for a field
goal,'' said the rookie, ``but I knew we had to make some more
yards.''
</P>
<P>
   So Edwards circled right end and gained 5 yards. Five more were
added on after linebacker Winfred Tubbs was flagged for grabbing
Edwards's face mask. Vinatieri was in prime position for the
winning kick.
</P>
<P>
   When the game was over, Robert Edwards and Garrison Hearst met
at midfield, two former Georgia running backs congratulating each
other for a game well played.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we talked about getting together after the season for more
workouts,'' said Edwards, who usually does not say much, but might
have something more to say when the two are back in Athens, Ga.

SEAHAWKS RALLY, BUT MISS PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Before Sunday's game was three plays old, the Seahawks
had been eliminated from the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They proceeded to make the Indianapolis Colts look like a
playoff team, falling behind by 13 points after three quarters at
the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Seahawks shook off the disappointment of being
eliminated from the postseason for the 10th straight year _ this
time because the New England Patriots had upset the San Francisco
49ers earlier in the day _ and surged past the Colts with 17
fourth-quarter points. The 27-23 victory marked the first time this
season they rallied to win after trailing going into the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way everybody fought to come back, that was impressive _
especially knowing the situation,'' running back Ricky Watters said
after running for a career-best 178 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Watters got the rally rolling, scoring on a 33-yard romp through
the Colts' defense that looked more like a slalom run the way he
juked, jived, eluded and finally stiff-armed would-be tacklers to
cut the Colts' lead to 23-17 with 9:19 left to play. Watters also
had a 38-yard run that set up a 30-yard field goal by Todd Peterson
with 1:57 left to give the Seahawks their final margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Pro Bowl cornerback Shawn Springs scooped up a
Marshall Faulk fumble that was forced by defensive end Phillip
Daniels and returned it 14 yards for a TD that gave the Seahawks a
24-23 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Seahawks' big-play defense withstood four throws
by rookie quarterback Peyton Manning into the end zone from the
Seattle 7-yard line to ice the win. Cornerback Willie Williams
tipped away Manning's first-down pass that was intended for E.G.
Green. Strong safety Jay Bellamy tipped Manning's second pass meant
for Ken Dilger and free safety Darryl Williams made sure the Colts'
tight end did not catch it by blasting him from behind just as the
ball arrived. Daniels hurried Manning into an incompletion on third
down. Manning's fourth-down throw to Torrance Small at the back for
the end zone was too long.
</P>
<P>
   As Watters said, everybody contributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the best game that we played,'' coach Dennis
Erickson said, ``but those guys fought to the end. There were
plenty of times in the fourth quarter when they could have hung it
up, but we just kept hanging in there, making plays and we ended up
winning a football game.''
</P>
<P>
   His players said they will give no less effort in Sunday's
season finale against the 13-1 Broncos in Denver. They will be
playing for pride, and probably under Erickson for the last time.
Despite being eliminated from the playoffs, the now 8-7 Seahawks
can post their first winning season since 1990 by upsetting the
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   It is less than what the Seahawks were expecting after they
loaded up on free-agent talent for the second consecutive offseason
and then started the season with three easy victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully when it's all said and done, we'll finish up at
9-7,'' linebacker Chad Brown said. ``You play every year for the
playoffs, but when you let it slip away like we did, the way we
came back is refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the game, the Seahawks appeared stale.
</P>
<P>
   The offense was having trouble moving the ball with any
consistency against a Colts' defense that ranked 28th in the league
and had surrendered at least 26 points in seven of its past nine
games.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, meanwhile, did a masterful job bottling up Marshall
Faulk, limiting the Colts' Pro Bowl running back to 19 yards on 13
carries. But Manning was something else. He completed 23 of 39
passes for 335 yards, spreading the ball to fellow rookie and
former Washington Husky Jerome Pathon (six catches for 66 yards),
Dilger (4 for 61), Small (3 for 120) and Green (3 for 52).
</P>
<P>
   That's how a Colts team that had won only three of its first 14
games came precariously close to pulling out this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of our main problem all year,'' Manning said
about blowing a fourth-quarter lead for the fourth time. ``In this
case, we jumped up on them in the second half and thought we had a
good lead ... . But we let it slip right out of hands. It's
extremely frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Seahawks used some monster plays from the oldest
Seahawk and one of the youngest to rip this one from the Colts'
clutches.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to Watters' TD run would not have happened if
quarterback Jon Kitna, making his fourth start this season, had not
scrambled for 17 yards on third-and-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Erickson said, ``was a huge play.''
</P>
<P>
   So was the 16-yard catch Brian Blades made two plays later.
Blades is in his 11th season and the only player left from the last
time the Seahawks were a playoff team _ 1988, his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive to Peterson's field goal, Kitna and Blades hooked
up again for an 11-yard gain on third-and-11. Watters' 38-yard run
came on the next play. Peterson's field goal came five plays later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody stepped up their games today,'' said Kitna,
who completed 16 of 29 passes for 177 yards and is now 3-1 in his
stint as the starter since replacing Warren Moon. ``Everybody did
their part today.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody except the 49ers.

AGAIN, PATRIOTS FANS HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ So after six months, 20 games (including
preseason), 101 trips to the hospital, a couple of court
appearances, an answered prayer, the rise of the Tuna in New
Jersey, and the announcement that they are leaving town, it is
official: The New England Patriots are going to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots Sunday beat the vaunted San Francisco 49ers, 24-21,
on a closing-seconds field goal by Adam Vinatieri. With almost a
half ton of high-priced meat sitting on the sideline (Drew Bledsoe,
Ted Johnson, Terry Glenn, Willie McGinest), New England rallied
'round backup quarterback Scott Zolak and defeated the perennial
Super Bowl contenders.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time in five weeks that the Patriots beat a
quality team (Miami, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, San Francisco), and the
third straight last-minute home win for the Future Hartfords.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the I-84 Pats are the feel-good story of our Christmas
week. They were impeached by the local media and many of their own
fans, but they have survived their trials on the field. Beaten
down, ridiculed, counted out, the Patriots are going to the
playoffs. Not only that, but if Miami loses Monday night against
Denver or next week at Atlanta and the Patriots find a way to beat
the Jets Sunday, New England actually will host a playoff game
after New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how proud I am,'' said Daddy Pete Carroll,
who took home the game ball. ``We're real pleased that this has
come out of our season after all we've been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll had reason to gloat. Most of us were calling for his
head when the Patriots staggered to 5-5 at mid-November, and his
wounded team was given little chance Sunday against the hot 49ers.
Let's not forget that northern California is home to Daddy Pete and
he did his best work as defensive coordinator of these 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't listen to all this talk that we didn't have a
chance against a great football team,'' said Carroll. ``This is
just getting the job done. It is great to beat these guys ... just
because it's home and it means so much. I can't tell you how proud
I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who was reduced to a clipboard-carrying Edward
Scissorhands, said, ``It's a great feeling. We've been through a
lot of stuff. Injuries. Setbacks. And now here we are _ we've got a
shot. We've just got a lot of guys that have a lot of heart.
Everybody counted us out. I don't think many people gave us a
chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. The midseason slump, coupled with owner Bob Kraft's
intended defection to the suburbs of New York, soured New England
on this team. The Great Recovery started on ``Monday Night
Football'' against the Dolphins and continued (with an interruption
at St. Louis last week) through the final shopping weekend before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose Sunday, there was a high likelihood of a playoff
berth, but few fans wanted to wade into the postseason with an 8-8
record, a three-game losing streak, and a raft of players in the
infirmary.
</P>
<P>
   But everything changed with the victory over the 49ers. It still
seems unlikely New England will meet Denver for the AFC
Championship, but Sunday's victory gives our region's sports fans
something to follow at least into early January. (That ought to
hold you until pitchers, catchers, and peanut vendors report in
mid-February.)
</P>
<P>
   Winning with Zo gave this one extra meaning. Zolak would
probably be voted Most Popular and Class Clown if the Patriots
produced a high school yearbook, but he needed to remind his
teammates and the fandom that he is more than a stage-diving quote
machine. Now he can go into next week and maybe into free agency
with a win over the 49ers under his belt. He was 14 of 30 for 205
yards, including a 61-yard touchdown to Shawn Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was riled up, and other guys could feel that energy,'' said
Jefferson. Zo was riled up, and now Patriot Nation goes into the
holidays with a reason to believe in the hometown team again. With
any luck, there might even be one more traffic jam on Route 1
before the season is over.

FORGET TALK ABOUT UNLUCKY NUMBER  
 JACKE COMBINES 13 WITH SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Maybe Chris Jacke has figured out this Cardinals
Jinx.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the number 13 is supposed to be bad luck. But that's
for those who otherwise have good luck. It only figures to be good
luck for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   And darned if it wasn't Sunday in a heart-thumping, 19-17
Arizona victory over the New Orleans Saints at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Jacke, the Cardinals' interim place-kicker, wears No. 13 on his
jersey. And Sunday he hit the 13th game-winning field goal of his
career, this one from 36 yards out as time expired, to keep the
Cardinals' playoff heart beating.
</P>
<P>
   The former Green Bay Packer has been with the Cardinals for only
three weeks, and he has hit two game-winning field goals in the
past two games. Last week in Philadelphia, he missed one in
regulation but made up for it by winning the game in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost the identical kick,'' Jacke said. ``I think it was 35
this week (it was 36), and last week it was 36, the one we missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's probably why they brought me in here. They
brought me in knowing that I've been in this situation before.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all his experience, Jacke admitted that he was a little
shaky after quarterback Jake Plummer drove the Cardinals from their
own 10 to the New Orleans 19 to put Jacke in the middle of the
field for the decisive kick.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Saints called a timeout to ``ice'' Jacke. This
guy kicked in Green Bay. Ice is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everybody else, I was a little excited,'' Jacke said.
``Two weeks in a row we're going to kick game-winning field goals.
(The timeout) helped me calm down a little, get my spot prepared,
and I thought I kicked the ball as well as I have since I've been
here.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know exactly it was perfect, but he had that gut
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I hit it well. Now, whether it was going straight, I
had to look up and check,'' he said. ``I looked up, and it was
going straight. I usually don't hook the ball or fade a ball too
badly, so it was pretty much down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   And nobody in the stadium was any happier about it than the guy
on crutches with a brace on his surgically repaired left knee. That
would be Joe Nedney, who started the season as the club's kicker
and suffered a season-ending injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, my situation is that I'm just trying to be the
biggest Cardinals fan anybody can be and really root my butt off
for those guys,'' Nedney said. ``It's out of my hands, and that's
all I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is a very surreal feeling standing there watching Chris
Jacke hit two game-winning field goals in two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted, however, that without Nedney's similar
game-winning heroics in a 17-15 victory at Detroit and a 29-27
defeat of Washington at Sun Devil Stadium, Jacke's kicks wouldn't
mean a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just good to see this team with one game left to clinch a
wild card,'' Nedney said. &QL;

49ER PLAY CALLS DON'T GET PASSING GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The game was over. An NFL scout and a
television analyst sat side by side at the back of the press box,
shaking their heads in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Scout: ``Can you tell me what the San Francisco game plan was?
What were they trying to do out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst: ``Looked like they were trying to run themselves into
third-down situations so Young could get sacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Scout: ``I'm befuddled.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst: ``Beats me.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of the day, when it was all over and the Patriots
had beaten San Francisco, was: What were the 49ers thinking about?
</P>
<P>
   Against a team that gives up more first downs to the pass than
just about any team in the league, the Niners ran 34 times and
threw the ball just 24 times.
</P>
<P>
   Still, San Francisco racked up 292 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   An average of 8 yards per pass attempt is considered
outstanding. The Niners were averaging 12 yards per pass, and still
didn't want to throw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we could run the ball,'' said 49ers coach Steve
Mariucci, whose play selection frustrated quarterback Steve Young.
``We had success with the run, but in the fourth quarter they
stopped us. But we had our chances to put the game away before that
and we didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into the fourth period, the Niners led, 21-14. To this
point, they had dominated the statistics, gaining 400 yards to 223
for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   However, that completely reversed in the final quarter, as the
Patriots outscored the 49ers, 10-0, and outgained them, 109-10.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. After gaining 400 net yards through three periods,
San Francisco died in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the last nine San Francisco offensive plays: run, no
gain; run, no gain; pass, interception; run, 2 yards; run, 3 yards;
pass attempt, sack minus-10 yards; run, 7 yards; run, 2 yards; pass
attempt, sack minus-10 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And on the last play, Young hurt his knee, ending what had to be
one of the most frustrating games of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Young wanted to attack New England in the air. Time and again,
after his team ran for short yardage on first and second down, he
looked to the bench and motioned for his coaches to call a play
that would go up field.
</P>
<P>
   Young's body language told the story. Many times he stood with
hands on hips, shaking his head in disbelief after short runs, or
looking skyward for some divine guidance. None came.
</P>
<P>
   The favored Niners gave the Patriots a chance to win, and New
England took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we could run the ball against them,'' said backup
quarterback Ty Detmer, who threw a 27-yard touchdown pass just
before the half on a muffed field goal attempt, giving his team a
21-14 lead that looked like it might hold up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did run it against them, but it seemed that when we got to
the red zone we bogged down and couldn't get it in. That's not like
us. We usually get it in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Niners admitted they underestimated the ability of Scott
Zolak. ``We knew we were going to play a backup quarterback,'' said
linebacker Ken Norton. ``We thought they would try to run the ball
a lot to help him out, and then throw the ball short. But he
surprised us with that bomb (a 61-yard scoring throw to Shawn
Jefferson in the second period). After that we backed up a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a pretty good job on defense against them until the
fourth quarter. Then they made some plays on us and ran the ball to
the outside better than I thought they could.''
</P>
<P>
   All the credit belongs to the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak played tough when it counted. He threw two interceptions,
but he did enough to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, with the game on the line, he was stout.
He completed 14 of 30 passes on the day, but in the fourth period
he was 5 of 7, throwing for first downs on a third-and-17 and a
fourth-and-2 with the rush right in his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to blitz him in passing situations, but we didn't
get any pressure on him. Their offense did a good job of picking us
up,'' said Norton.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots offensive line did a terrific job. Zolak was sacked
just once, and that was more of a coverage sack than a breakdown in
front of him. And the Patriots were able to run the ball 31 times
for 132 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, San Francisco played a very dumb game. Four times the
49ers had to call timeouts to cover mistakes. (Three times they
didn't have enough men on the field; another time their tight end
didn't know the play.)
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, they threw just twice on 13 first-down
plays.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Young found himself in third-down passing
situations, with the Patriots blitzing him and not enough blockers
to account for the rushers. He was sacked five times and didn't
have a single yard rushing. Not once did he elude would-be rushers
as he has so well in the past, establishing himself as one of the
greatest running quarterbacks of all-time. The Patriots kept him in
the pocket and banged him around.
</P>
<P>
   Young was 13 for 15 passing in the first half, and yet his
coaches called for just eight passes in the second half, when his
team was shut out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play at home, we are a great football team,'' said
Mariucci. ``Away, we don't know how to win. And you can't be a
great team unless you can win on the road.''

MURELL GAINS 1,000 WITH UNLIKELY HELPER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Adrian Murrell got his 1,000-yard rushing season
against the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. Now he figures he's going
to have to buy an unlikely source a thank-you dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell, who needed 48 yards against the Saints to crack the
1,000-yard barrier and become the first Cardinals running back to
do it since Garrison Hearst (1,070) in 1985, did it on a 21-yard
scoring run on which quarterback Jake Plummer threw the springing
block.
</P>
<P>
   ``I buy dinner for my linemen when they do something right, so I
guess I'll have to buy him one, too,'' said Murrell, who gained 65
yards on 19 carries and has 1,017 for the season. ``He finally got
it right. He owed me one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week he had a chance to spring me and missed the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer threw a perfect crossbody block on cornerback Tyronne
Drakeford and wore a sheepish smile all the way back to the bench
as Arizona took a 13-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It's the third consecutive 1,000-yard season for Murrell, who
came to the Cardinals along with a seventh-round draft pick in a
trade with the New York Jets for the Cardinals' third-round
selection. He had 1,249 yards in 1996 and 1,088 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He became the eighth active NFL running back to reach the mark
in three or more consecutive seasons, and joins Ottis Anderson, Jim
Otis, John David Crow, Hearst, Ronald Moore and Stump Mitchell as
the only Cardinals to reach 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   About the only sour moment Sunday came when he was hit just
after taking a handoff and fumbled on his own 17. The Giants
recovered, but the Cardinals defense rose to the occasion and
stopped New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The odds on Murrell reaching 1,000 yards didn't seem good. The
Cardinals averaged just 78 yards a game rushing last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line is doing a great job for me,'' Murrell said. ``We
took a lot of heat earlier about being more productive on the run.
But we just kept pounding it at them. It's been going smooth all
year. Some weeks it's going to go well, and some weeks it isn't.
That's the game. But as long as we win, it surpasses everything
else.'' &QL;

DESPITE BEATING COLTS, SEAHAWK SHORTCOMINGS ALL TOO APPARENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If you had earned a permutations minor while obtaining
a math degree in college, you might have looked forward to Sunday's
Kingdome game, what with the Seahawk possibilities for playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But since all the options ended by the game's third play, when
New England recorded a victory over San Francisco, you could have
had more fun looking for a downtown parking space.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' 27-23 win over the inept Indianapolis Colts (3-12)
was as desultory as it was irrelevant, falling just shy of
embarrassment. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning, with a
first-and-goal at the Seattle 7-yard line in the final minute, blew
all four chances at the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Nine weeks earlier in San Diego, Charger quarterback Ryan Leaf
failed at the threshold against the Seahawk defense in almost
identical last-minute circumstances, and the Seahawks prevailed,
27-20.
</P>
<P>
   So think of it this way: If it hadn't been for the rookieness of
QBs for two desperate franchises, the Seahawks are 6-9 this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   That's one thing to recall in the woulda-shoulda-coulda
lamentations that commence now that the Seahawks have been issued
formally their standard non-invitation to the NFL postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Seahawks were jobbed by a bad call in New York. Yeah,
they had bad luck in a Kansas City monsoon. And they should have
beaten the Oakland Raiders twice. But for every call or turn of
fortune that went against them, they also had their share of
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The point about the Manning-Leaf rookie vulnerability
underscores a larger theme: Among the many veteran quarterbacks
having stellar seasons, the Seahawks will have faced only John
Elway, Troy Aikman and Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the Seahawks had a schedule of baby's-bottom softness.
With a week left in the season, they have played only three teams
that are assured of winning records: Denver, Dallas and the New
York Jets _ the teams with the three good QBs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Seahawks are 8-7, and the odds favor a seasonal tally of
8-8 after a game Sunday against the AFC-best Broncos in the
Colorado refrigerator. That's the same record they had in 1997 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Siberia can't build this many snowmen.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of snow, what has a longer tradition: Christmas, or the
Seahawks missing the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Arizona Cardinals look to be the NFC's sixth and
final playoff team, the Seahawks' 10-year absence is the new NFL
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Wait 'til next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you count on other teams to lose, it's our fault,'' guard
Brian Habib said of the Seahawk playoff requirements. ``We never
should have been in that position. There were so many games we
should have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoulda. Woulda. Coulda.
</P>
<P>
   Never dida.
</P>
<P>
   At least not in the four years of coach Dennis Erickson. In a
sport jiggered to achieve parity, the Erickson Seahawks have been
the league's poster child.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Seahawk wheel-spinning means the end of the
Erickson regime, perhaps as soon as a week from Monday. The primary
reason will be opportunity squandered, especially relative to the
payroll (No. 4 in the NFL) and the success of other recently
middling teams.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.2l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This season alone, Atlanta went to 13-2 from 7-9 a year ago;
Minnesota to 14-1 from 9-7; Buffalo to 9-6 from 6-10; the Jets to
11-4 from a non-playoff 9-7. Even the Cardinals, who looked awful
in a 33-14 loss here in Week 2, managed to create a turnaround
within the season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.2l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Not the Seahawks. They almost never were awful, but seldom were
they stellar.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.2l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was another example. Ricky Watters rushed for a
personal-best and Seahawk season-high 178 yards, and the defense
held the Colts' star back, Marshall Faulk, to 19 yards. Normally,
that sort of disparity in the game's most fundamental element
should be decisive. Instead, the Seahawks had to break every
fingernail to hang on to victory.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.2l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Reasons were numerous. They always have been. Since the team's
shortfall rests almost exclusively with the offense, here's four
large reasons:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.2l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Biggest bust, individual: Warren Moon. He had his moments. But
the holdout, limited mobility, injuries and persistent third-down
failures conspired to turn the talk about his age into shouts.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest bust, group: Erickson and his offensive staff, who
switched from last year's wide-open air attack to an emphasis on
rushing without the personnel to pull it off so abruptly. Then they
switched back, which fails to inspire confidence or convert third
downs.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest continuing travail: The line. A 10th straight year of
starting lineup change helps extend the 23-year shutout from the
Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Worst fate, individual: Linebacker Chad Brown. ``I've always
been in the playoffs _ Pop Warner, high school, college, Pittsburgh
(for four years). Except for here.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the tradition, Chad. It soon may supplant rain,
coffee, slugs, the Space Needle and bad rock music atop the list of
Seattle icons.
</P>
<P>
   The season was hardly without achievement: The establishment of
Jon Kitna as a legitimate starting quarterback; the recovery of the
special teams; the creation of a defense that held up remarkably
under the weight of carrying the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But the virtues likely won't come to more than 8-8, which will
add up to an 86 for Erickson and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   A close, cruel call, but the right one.

THEY LEFT HEART IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ They asked themselves the same questions
everyone else was asking them.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   How could a team whose passing game was moving so well in the
first half get shut down in the second half, especially in the
fourth quarter?
</P>
<P>
   How could such an offensive breakdown _ and accompanying
defensive malaise _ happen against a team missing its best
defensive player, its starting quarterback, and its best receiver?
</P>
<P>
   None of the answers the 49ers came up with Sunday seemed to make
sense. Nor did San Francisco's stunning 24-21 loss to the Patriots
at Foxboro Stadium, which put New England into the AFC playoffs and
put the 49ers in jeopardy of having to play a wild-card playoff
game on the road.
</P>
<P>
   And there was even more ominous news in the 49ers locker room.
Quarterback Steve Young, who had toyed with the Patriots in the
first half _ completing 13 of 15 passes for 185 yards and two
touchdowns _ was limping around on a sore left knee, which will be
tested Monday to see if there is significant damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say a thing until I see what the tests
show,'' said Young, who was injured on the 49ers' last series when
defensive end Greg Spires pancaked him onto the Foxboro Stadium
turf. ``I have no idea on my knee. I'm going to wait until I have
an MRI done.''
</P>
<P>
   If Young has a serious injury, the 49ers situation may become as
dire as the Patriots' seemed to be when they came into the game
with Drew Bledsoe in street clothes on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers had come in acting like the 49ers of old, powered by
an awesome offense led by Young, wide receiver Jerry Rice, and
running back Garrison Hearst, who had amassed a career-high 198
yards in a romp over the Detroit Lions last Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco came to New England with some underlying
concerns. Although the 49ers had won 11 of their 14 games, they
were a shaky 3-4 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   They were especially shaky defensively. Throughout the season,
they had shown a few cracks: letting some opponents get out in
front early, letting others back into the game after they should
have been beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Neither bodes well for the future.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half Sunday, however, the 49ers looked just fine.
Led by Young, they had a 21-14 lead at the half. And they had a
sense that they were controlling the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want us to be aggressive and dynamic,'' said Young, who was
neither in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter, when
he attempted just one pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been having a difficult time running the ball,''
said Young. ``Those running plays have been working for us all
season.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't work well in the second half, however, and as a
result the 49ers find themselves in dire need of a win in next
week's regular-season finale against the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   And they find themselves wondering just what kind of team they
are. ``We've got ourselves into a situation where we need to be
able to win on the road against the kind of teams we're going to
see in the playoffs,'' said 49ers head coach Steve Mariucci.
</P>
<P>
   Young was more definite about what San Francisco must do.
``We've got to finish drives off,'' he said. ``We need to be able
to put teams away when we get a lead. We should have done that
today.''
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't. The 49ers didn't win a game that may not have
been easy but certainly was winnable.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   About the condition of Young. And their role as a championship
contender.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the San Francisco 49ers feel vulnerable.

ISRAEL APPRECIATES IMPORTANCE OF WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Pete Carroll and Steve Israel are two
Patriots who can fully understand how significant it is to beat the
San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking about the best receiver (Jerry Rice) to ever
play the game,'' said Israel. ``You're talking about the best
quarterback (Steve Young), whose efficiency is better than anyone's
in history. You're talking about the best receiving corps and I
haven't even gotten to Garrison Hearst yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' corner spent two years with the 49ers when Carroll
was the defensive coordinator. During Sunday's 24-21 win over the
49ers, the Patriots blitzed at all the right times and controlled
Young when they absolutely had to.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie defensive end Greg Spires, who was filling in for Chris
Sullivan (knee), who was filling in for Willie McGinest (groin),
had a huge sack in the fourth quarter and came up big in his most
significant performance as a Patriot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just some real gutsy play and he had to play a lot
because Chris was banged up,'' said Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's biggest play came on a third-and-5 from the 49ers' 29.
He blitzed from the left side and sacked Young for a 10-yard loss,
which forced the 49ers to punt from their own end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had missed an interception earlier and I said to myself to
keep going because there'll come a time in the game when I would be
called upon to make a big play. Thank God, that opportunity arose
again,'' Israel said.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots cornerback Ty Law, who intercepted a Young pass (Law's
ninth interception of the season) and returned it 30 yards in the
second quarter, said, ``This means a lot, but nobody expected us to
win. They have All-Pros and Hall of Famers on their team and we
have guys who are banged up and couldn't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we held up together as a team. We didn't give up. We
played four quarters of football and even when they got up, we
figured if we could make a big play here and there we could get it
back. Willie got the pick and (Scott Zolak) led us back.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Clay, victimized on Rice's 75-yard pass play in the
second quarter, made a fourth-quarter interception that started New
England's game-tying drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big boost for us, I was glad to make the play,'' said
Clay. ``I think we won because we made less mistakes than we did
last week. You can't turn the ball over. We turned the ball over
twice and we limited it to that. The big plays they made hurt us,
but they had one or two. We limited that pretty well when it really
counted down the backstretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense also got after Young, sacking him five times. Chris
Slade, who had the type of game Slade fans have come to expect, had
one sack and nine tackles, with Israel, Spires, Chris Carter, and
Sullivan all getting in on the sack parade.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Milloy played a big part in stopping the run as he made
14 tackles to lead the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   While Hearst managed 107 yards on the ground, the Patriots held
him in check when they had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearst did OK, but we did a decent job holding him down,''
said Chad Eaton. ``We knew if we could keep Hearst from running
wild against us we had a chance to win the game. He had a good
game, but it wasn't like he had last week. I will say he was the
best running back we've faced all season.''

WILLIAMS LIMPS IN WITH GAME ON LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD AND BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Sore left big toe and all, Cardinals
veteran &UR; Aeneas Williams limped to his cornerback position in the
final two minutes Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had been out of the game for most of the second half of
the 19-17 victory over New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was on the line,'' Williams said. ``You know what the
stakes were. Remember, I've been here eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't able to stop the New Orleans Saints from driving 75
yards in 14 plays to take a one-point lead with 1:21 left. But he
was there on the sideline leading the cheers as quarterback  &UR; Jake
Plummer drove the offense 73 yards in six plays, capped off by
 &UR; Chris Jacke's game-winning field goal with no time remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what happens, we always believe Jake can win,''
Williams said. ``We believe in Jake.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates in the defensive backfield were awed by Williams
putting himself back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy wants to win,'' defensive back  &UR; J.J. McCleskey said.
``He was in pain, but he knew we had to have the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't just go back out there,'' rookie cornerback &UR; Corey
Chavous said. ``He went out there with the belief that he would
make the play that would seal the game.''
</P>
<P>
   While Williams was out, he was replaced by  &UR; Tom Knight, who had
missed the past three games because of a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been frustrating from the standpoint of what I
envisioned my role,'' said Knight, who began the season as a
starter. ``I think I've developed an understanding of what it takes
to be successful. I'm still part of the team and want to
contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   He almost recovered a fumble on the Saints' last drive, but
offensive guard  &UR; Chris Naeole beat him to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I should have had it,'' Knight said. ``I jumped on it,
but two guys came in on me and got me off the ball.'' &QL; 
Goat to glory
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Frank Sanders was shaping up as the goat for the Cardinals
after a couple of first-half blunders.
</P>
<P>
   On the team's first possession, on third and 1 at the Saints'
28, Sanders was charged with a false start that moved the ball back
five yards. Following an incomplete pass on third down, Jacke
missed a 51-yard field goal try. The Cardinals had nothing to show
for an 11-play march that lasted 3:42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, on second and goal at the New Orleans 5,
Sanders caught a hitch pass from Plummer and seemingly had a clear
path to the end zone. Saints cornerback  &UR; Alex Molden knocked the
ball loose from behind, and Saints safety  &UR; Chad Cota recovered it
for a touchback in the end zone, killing another drive.
</P>
<P>
   But with the game on the line in the closing 1:16, Sanders
caught passes from Plummer that covered 25 and 28 yards, postioning
the Cardinals for a game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an exciting turn of events,'' said Sanders, who caught
10 passes for 138 yards. ``I never let my faith waver. The game is
60 minutes long. You've got to keep your faith. With our two-minute
offense, there's never a dull moment. Jake made great reads on
those two passes at the end. That's just Jake being Jake.'' &QL; 
Out with the crowd &QL; 
The Cardinals asked for a big crowd, and the fans responded. More
than 5,000 bought tickets at the game, about 4,000 more than usual.
</P>
<P>
   But preparations at Sun Devil Stadium for the Fiesta Bowl mean a
whole lot of those fans never got to their seats until near the end
of the first quarter. The Fiesta Bowl has taken over the stadium
ticket offices, according to  &UR; Tom Stadler, Arizona State's stadium
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary ticket locations were set up near Wells Fargo Arena _
in trailers _ but there were long lines, and traffic jams formed
near the stadium as fans tried to drive up to the ticket locations.
The problem could be the same next week when San Diego visits, so
fans are encouraged to buy tickets before going to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walk-up fans didn't know where to go,'' Cardinals
spokesman &UR; 
 &UR; Paul Jensen said. ``The best thing fans can do next week is buy the
tickets ahead of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are available at the Cardinals training facility at
Hardy and Warner roads in Tempe, at Safeway stores with ETM
machines or by calling 1-888-ETM-TIXX. &QL;

4TH-DOWN FAILURE DOESN'T FAZE DITKA  
 BUT HE'S UPSET WITH DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Mike Ditka's answer was predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters wanted to know what he was thinking when he decided to
go for it in a fourth-and-one situation at the Arizona 9-yard line
early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of your business,'' Ditka replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka's response had the same result as the critical fourth-down
play: It came up short.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of forging a tie with the chip shot field goal, the
Saints failed to gain the critical yard, and the Cardinals drove
down the field to set up a 46-yard Chris Jacke field goal for a
16-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the Saints later came back to take a 17-16 lead.
But had it been 20-16, Arizona would have needed to go 90 yards for
a touchdown in the final 1:21 instead of merely into field goal
range for Jacke's 36-yard game-winning kick as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   But Ditka was bothered more by his defense's execution on the
final drive, in which the Saints gave up two long pass plays to
receiver Frank Sanders, than he was the fourth-down failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ahead, 17-16,'' Ditka said, finally responding to
questions. ``They got some 90 yards to go. I made the call. Only
me. I made the call. You got a half-yard to go (on fourth down). If
you can't make it, you don't deserve to win. We talked about this
all year, fellas. I made the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have made any difference. We were not going to win
this game at the end. We went into a shell. We are not going to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid (Sanders) ran no route. Believe me, (he) came off and
ran 20 yards and turned around and then the ball was thrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's their best receiver, and we didn't have anybody
covering him.''
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans defensive coordinator Zaven Yaralian was at a loss
to explain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason in my mind for us to let that happen,''
Yaralian said. ``We called the defense we've called all year. Maybe
we called the wrong defense, but we could have blown any
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it has been the Saints' defense which has carried a
struggling offense all season. This time, quarterback Kerry Collins
made the plays to get his team the lead, and the defense wilted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what happened or what went wrong, we were there
at the end,'' Collins said. ``And we made mistakes, we did some
good things, but it still doesn't belie the fact we didn't get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who converted a fourth-and-four play during the
go-ahead drive, defended the fourth-and-one call. ``We got a yard
(to go), and we've got to get those fourth downs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Collins was convinced the decision was moot after New
Orleans took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very confident in the defense,'' he said. ``They've been
playing well. I think they're a great defense. And they'll do it in
the future, I'm confident of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to score more points. I don't think there's any doubt
about that.''

STILL ALIVE AND KICKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The tradition is the holder doesn't speak to
the kicker when the game is on the line, even more so when New
England's playoff chances were resting on Adam Vinatieri's toe. So
Tom Tupa and Vinatieri went about their business. Silently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, Adam and I were patting down the field,'' said Tupa,
when asked to provide details about what transpired during the 40
or so seconds of the timeout just before Vinatieri's 35-yard field
goal attempt with six seconds left on the clock and the Patriots
and 49ers tied, 21-21. ``We were trying to get a good spot on the
field so Adam could get some good footing. And I was looking for a
good spot to place the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   This is routine in December in New England. Usually, said
Vinatieri, ``the field is pretty chewed up when you get to December
and you need to pat down the field. But the weather hasn't been too
hard this year and the field wasn't bad.''
</P>
<P>
   So Tupa, head down, looked for a good spot to place the ball,
then tamped it down with his spikes. So Vinatieri, head down,
looked for a good spot where he estimated he would plant his left
foot and tamped down the grass. All this was done in silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' said Tupa, ``it was pretty calm out there. It was
just like another kick.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri already had missed a chip shot for him _ a 32-yarder
that hit the left upright and bounced away on the Patriots' first
drive _ but, Vinatieri said that miss was out of his mind when he
waited for the snap from Mike Bartrum and Tupa's hold in those
final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A kicker has to have a short memory,'' said Vinatieri. ``No
matter what you did before, you have to put that out of your mind.
You can't let how you kicked the last one affect how you'll kick
the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, was anxiety rushing into his bones, not to mention his
mind?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you've got the adrenaline going and you've got some
butterflies going,'' said the Patriots kicker. But that was all,
because in his rookie year three years ago Vinatieri had kicked a
winning field goal in overtime against Jacksonville, and he had won
three other games since with field goals, ``so I felt confident
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it seemed Vinatieri might have to try a 44- or
45-yard attempt because the Patriots gained little on their first
two downs after a first-and-10 from the 49ers 31. ``But distance
isn't a factor,'' said Vinatieri. ``If I had to kick it 45 yards, I
still have to kick it straight and I still have to kick it hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartrum snapped it straight and true back to Tupa (``The guys on
the line huddled up and said, `Just give Adam some time,''' said
Bartrum), Tupa placed the ball, and Vinatieri kicked. It is no
understatement that Vinatieri's kick did not split the uprights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a yard or so inside (the right upright),'' said Tupa,
``but as soon as it took off you knew it was good. It didn't move
from its line or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri, too, said he felt confident as soon as he looked up
and spotted the ball's flight. When he first looked up, ``I knew it
was close, but I still knew it was good. I turned around and
started celebrating right away. That's a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The next-to-last play of the game truly made up for the last
play of the first half for the Patriots special teams, when a
botched field goal attempt by the 49ers resulted in the
slowest-of-seemingly-slow-motion 25-yard touchdown passes from
holder (and backup quarterback) Ty Detmer to Irv Smith, who had
been lined up just inside San Francisco's wide blocker.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer fumbled the snap and then, after players on both teams
froze for a second, he rolled to the left and stood there for
second after second as confusion reigned. But the Patriots remained
frozen for more than a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had blocked (a field goal attempt) earlier and that time we
had a middle block (play) on,'' said Marty Moore, the heart of the
Patriots special teams. ``And what happened was we had some guys
who thought that the other guy had some of their guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may be as good a description as any of a field goal
attempt botched by both teams. What was most irksome, though, was
New England had faced the same play last week in St. Louis, when
the Rams' Rick Tuten fumbled a snap, ``but that time Tebucky Jones
got to (Tuten) before he could make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   This time?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything sort of went haywire,'' said Moore. ``Guys who had
their guys kind of just dropped them and I dropped back with their
tight end. But I thought the tight end was behind me. It just got
sort of messed up out there.''

BEST TEAM IN MASS. PLAYS IN AMHERST 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere in your city, neighborhood, or house, someone is
looking at the University of Massachusetts football team and
saying, ``Who cares?''
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen are the best team in the country, the champions of
Division 1-AA. They scored the most points in the history of a 1-AA
championship game and had a running back, Marcel Shipp, rush for
more yards than anyone else in a title game. Ever. But there is no
Rose or Sugar Bowl in 1-AA, so many people mistakenly think that it
doesn't take much to win a championship against the Georgia
Southerns and McNeese States, schools that most of us associate
with ESPN2 at 2 a.m. People think they can gather a bunch of guys
from Home Depot and knock off the 1-AA champions.
</P>
<P>
   Those who think that can't imagine what it's like to see outside
linebacker Kole Ayi speeding past an offensive lineman, with
intentions of quickly introducing himself to the quarterback. The
sophomore from Nashua, N.H., did that a lot during the Minutemen's
season. He will do it for two more seasons in Amherst. And, yes,
he'll eventually do it for some team in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   This is why you should care about these guys: They are the top
local story of the year.
</P>
<P>
   I know that Pat Burns inherited a terrible Bruins team and took
it to the playoffs. I know this is the year when the Patriots
announced they were leaving the state; when you and I can say,
right now, that we make much more money than pro basketball
players; when a Red Sox team won 92 games, went to the playoffs,
and said goodbye to Mo.
</P>
<P>
   But those are all pro stories. And those are all stories that
lack one element: a national title. UMass can say it has one. The
Minutemen also have some history with 1978. In the same year that
the Sox lost a one-game playoff to the Yankees, the Minutemen lost
the first 1-AA title to Florida A&AMP;M. Twenty years later, one team
has shaken itself from the clutches of a jinx.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's tough to be a college athlete in Massachusetts
and Greater Boston. Professional sports rule. It's fair to say that
we could represent our colleges better, no? Rick Pitino used to go
crazy as a young coach at Boston University in the early 1980s.
Back then, the current Celtics coach was experimenting with a manic
basketball system where guards could wind up playing forward and
forwards might be asked to lead the fast break. The early version
of PitinoBall might as well have taken place in the coach's family
room because not many people came to the games. The majority of
fans waited several years later and paid $50 per ticket per night
to see Pitino at the FleetCenter. They could have seen him in the
early years on the cheap and been able to put his system into
better context.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't get a chance to see UMass this season, promise
yourself that you will check them out next year. If you don't do it
then, you most certainly will miss the Mark Whipple Era. He may not
be the Pitino of his league, but if he wants, this guy will
definitely be a 1-A school's head coach or offensive coordinator
before the 21st century. If someone didn't know football and asked
me to show them why people get excited about it, I would tell them
to watch a game coached by Whipple.
</P>
<P>
   He is that friend of yours who, on a whim, says, ``Hey, ever
been to the Grand Canyon? Wanna go? I'll meet you at your house in
15 minutes.'' You should have seen the man's offense Saturday in
Chattanooga. The Minutemen won the game, 55-43, and probably could
have scored 70 (seriously) if they hadn't been careless with the
ball. Whipple called a fullback option in the national title game.
He called for a fake punt in the first half and the team made it.
He had his team line up for an onside kick in the first half,
something that had the visitors calling him a lot worse things than
``Yankee.'' He did not necessarily run to set up the pass or pass
to set up the run. He just brought out a weighty offensive package
and said to Georgia Southern, ``All right, boys. Stop this.''
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious that Southern could not stop it. The end zones at
Finley Stadium face a hill and a street, respectively. There is no
protective net behind the goal posts to catch kicked footballs.
Each time UMass scored, the ball would sail onto the hill or into
the street on the extra-point attempt. The first few times that
happened, anxious children ran to retrieve the balls. But finally
they tired themselves out because there was so much scoring.
</P>
<P>
   That was just one of the refreshing sights of UMass's title
chase. The Minutemen were able to see the red-clay dirt of the
South. They were able to humble several communities which
collectively asked, ``Where exactly is UMass?'' They faced a
frighteningly fast Georgia Southern quarterback named Greg Hill.
Their receivers got the chance to line up against a defensive back
named Earthwind ``Shining Star'' Moreland, whose parents are
obviously 1970s rhythm and blues fans. And, most important, they
were able to alter 10 championship game records Saturday, including
Shipp's 244 rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   As Aretha would say, UMass deserves its propers. It went from a
bad team to a title team in just one season. Those who missed it
should remember that there is only one thing worse than that:
Missing it again next year.

WEEK BY WEEK, THE LEGEND OF JAKE GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Where would they be without him?
</P>
<P>
   Adrift. With a head coach requesting his last meal and a stadium
blueprint lining the bird cage. With apathy prompting a call for
moving vans. With Mr. Bidwill checking out land in Houston and
trying on 10-gallon hats.
</P>
<P>
   So Andre Wadsworth is ``The Gift.'' What, then, is Jake Plummer?
</P>
<P>
   ``The miracle,'' Wadsworth said. ``How about that?''
</P>
<P>
   When the fireworks exploded, when the combination of relief and
disbelief washed over 51,000 people, they stood and cheered for an
eternity. Until Plummer raced off the field, his feet barely
touching the ground, tapping his heart before blowing kisses into
the stands.
</P>
<P>
   And as the roar continued, the signs were held like property of
zealots:
</P>
<P>
   ``PLUMMER 3:16.''
</P>
<P>
   ``ON THE EIGHTH DAY, GOD CREATED JAKE.''
</P>
<P>
   ``WE BELIEVE.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 24 years old with 24 career starts, and the numbers are
preposterous: Eight comeback victories. Six this season. And that
doesn't count two others that resulted in losses, including a
furious 28-point rally against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   You're ridiculous, I tell Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he says with a smile. ``This team's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, this is a group effort, a team that is getting better
by the week. But it all stems from Plummer. A kid who glows with
stardust, acts like the frat boy who just tied your shoelaces
together, performs with no fear. A kid blessed with the magic, the
ability to part the sea for an NFL doormat. And with one more
victory, he will have guided them across.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how the NBA is building things around Grant Hill?''
Redskins' safety Darrell Green said last month. ``The NFL, if this
can be an analogy, should do the same thing with Jake Plummer.
Build it around that kid. He's a nice kid, he's hungry, he's a
competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations to the Cardinals. For all their lack of vision,
they were the ones who plucked him in the second round. The ones
who rewarded him with a multiyear extension on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations,'' Saints coach Mike Ditka said. ``Their
quarterback made us look like fools all day.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Plummer threw 44 passes, completing 32, wracking up
394 yards. With a few exceptions, every toss was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   It was an afternoon when the game slowed to a crawl in his
cranium, when he routinely checked off one receiver, two receivers,
before finding the proper target. An afternoon when he threw a
block that sprung a touchdown. When he walked into the huddle at
the 8-yard line with 81 seconds remaining _ this kid who once
emerged from the shower and danced naked in front of teammates just
for a chuckle _ and told 10 other guys to ``get the look.'' When he
had the game on a string, and once again, made it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys have it, some guys don't,'' reserve quarterback Dave
Brown said. ``He's definitely got it. What impresses me most is
that he feels like he ``should'' do it every time.''
</P>
<P>
   A feeling that comes from . . .?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, and I don't want to know,'' Plummer said. ``But
I like to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd like something else. A full house for the season finale
against the Chargers. A game that could propel the Cardinals into
the playoffs for the first time since the continents split. And if
you can't pack the place for this guy, this team, this occasion,
you don't deserve an NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on you fans that didn't come today,'' Plummer said.
``You missed a great ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, in a hallway, Plummer hugged Fiesta Bowl
president Herman Frazier. The two go back a long way, but the irony
is this: If the Cardinals make the playoffs, the Fiesta Bowl will
be an afterthought in this city.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Cardinals make the playoffs, they are poised to make
some noise. Turnovers and red-zone troubles aside, the Cardinals
played their best football game of the season on both sides of the
ball against the Saints. Beating the Cowboys in Dallas is not
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is with this guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legend grows every day, right?'' player personnel boss Bob
Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Without fail. &QL;

DEFENSE USES `CUB' TO CLUB NEW ORLEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The Cardinals' defense closely resembles the
famed Revolutionary War painting of the crippled fife and drum
corps hobbling along in pain but with great pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense is beat up and crippled, but I can't say enough
about the character of this team or the way Vince has built it,''
Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis said after Sunday's
thrilling 19-17 win over New Orleans. ``It believes in him and
believes in us. It a pretty good deal we've got going here, guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our front four played outstanding. This team has a lot of
stuff going for it.''
</P>
<P>
   It also has a pretty good defensive strategist in Coach Vince
Tobin. With starting defensive tackles Mark Smith and Eric Swann
and middle linebacker Ron McKinnon limited because of sprained
knees, it was Tobin who came up with a variation of the Chicago
Bears defense and proposed it to McGinnis on Tuesday in hopes of
creating a run defense and a pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin named the defense the ``Cub,'' and it played a large role
in holding New Orleans to just 82 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In general terms, it put end Andre Wadsworth at nose tackle,
linebackers Jamir Miller and Patrick Sapp out wide and safety Pat
Tillman at middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals run about five different variations from the
formation. It was the defense used when Sapp sacked Kerry Collins
and Miller recovered the ensuing fumble to stop the Saints' first
drive of the second half at Arizona's 23. The Cardinals marched to
a go-ahead touchdown on the next series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cub worked, but I don't want to go into too much detail
about it,'' Miller said, grinning widely as if he were keeping a
state secret. ``It confused them. They didn't know where we were
coming from, and that's always a good thing. They didn't know how
to block it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis said the Cub was employed six to eight times in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were having so much success in our regular defense, we
thought about not using it in the second half,'' he said. ``But it
created the big fumble, and it was successful several times in the
red zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tillman played well, and so did Jamir. It puts a lot of heat
on him because he's got to make all the adjustments. They didn't
know how to block it, which was the intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth wasn't into discussing the X's and O's, preferring to
talk about the inner strength of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always fight to the end,'' he said. ``You know what it
looked like today? We looked like a team that just didn't want it,
but one that had to have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like somebody who hasn't eaten in two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth will get no argument from Pro Bowl cornerback Aeneas
Williams, who missed most of the second half because of a sprained
big toe before returning for the Saints' final series, in which
they scored to take a brief 17-16 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating having to watch,'' he said. ``But the guys
who were out there did a great job. Tommy Knight (playing with a
hamstring pull) did a great job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to experience this (playoff chase), because of
what we have going and the fashion in which we're doing it. We've
been planting the seeds for a long time, we've watered them, and

   &UR; CASANOVA: THE MAN WHO REALLY LOVED WOMEN &LR;  By Lydia Flem.
Translated by Catherine Temerson. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $13. A
Belgian scholar argues that Casanova was far more than a sexual
athlete _ in his high-spirited virtuosity he was the embodiment of
the Enlightenment. ``Perpetually captivated by Casanova, as lover,
adventurer or wanderer, Flem makes us determined to seek out his
company,'' Jonathan Keates wrote in The New York Times Book Review
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PFITZ &LR;  By Andrew Crumey. Picador USA, $12. In this slender
novel, an 18th-century German prince mobilizes the collective
mental powers of his subjects to create an elaborate imaginary
city. Unfortunately, reality creeps into his vision of aesthetic
purity, in the form of a young cartographer who falls in love with
another worker. ```Pfitz' is a surprisingly warm and likable book,
a combination of intellectual high-wire act and good traditional
storytelling,'' Andrew Miller wrote in 1997. The author ``develops
his story with admirable rigor, seizing on both the comic and the
philosophical potential of a world in which the actual and the
imagined have become fatally blurred.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TAKING WING: ARCHAEOPTERYX AND THE EVOLUTION OF BIRD FLIGHT &LR;  By
Pat Shipman. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15. When the fossilized
skeleton of a prehistoric creature that was half bird and half
reptile was discovered in Bavaria in 1861, it touched off a
long-running debate about the dinosaurian ancestry of birds. The
author of this account makes a strong case for such a link.
``Shipman brings to her excellent book the authority of a
paleontologist and the talent of an accomplished writer on science
for popular audiences,'' John Noble Wilford wrote earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFTER MAN: A ZOOLOGY OF THE FUTURE &LR;  By Dougal Dixon. St.
Martin's Griffin, $15.95. This envisions the species on earth 50
million years from now, like the vortex, a giant whalelike creature
descended from penguins. In 1982 in The New York Times Book Review,
Timothy Ferris found this illustrated book full of ``endearing and
plausible specimens'' that ``engender reflection about the
mysterious forces at work beneath the skin of real animals.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANTHER IN THE BASEMENT &LR;  By Amos Oz. Translated by Nicholas de
Lange. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $11. A patriotic boy is accused of
treason after befriending a gentle British soldier in Jerusalem
just before Britain's departure from Palestine in 1947. In 1997 Lee
Siegel called this ``an insightful, inventive and lyrical'' novel
that uses ``the theme of betrayal to explore the status of the
individual in a country where public and private landscapes are
constantly merging.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FAR EUPHRATES &LR; . By Aryeh Lev Stollman, Riverhead, $13. A
first novel about a lonely rabbi's son growing up in Ontario during
the 1950s and '60s and the extended family of troubled adults
around him. ```The Far Euphrates' is remarkable both for Stollman's
eloquently understated prose and for the ease with which he
constructs his artful plot,'' Margot Livesey wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SEA OF TREES &LR;  By Yannick Murphy. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin,
$12. Set in Indochina during the 1940s, this first novel is
narrated by a girl who comes of age in a Japanese internment camp
and in postwar Saigon. ``Her story unfolds through a dreamlike
progression of glinting surfaces, telling gestures and precisely
rendered moments, in which matter-of-fact horror butts up against
absurdist hilarity,'' Catherine Bush wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AT RISK &LR;  By Alice Hoffman. Berkley, $13. A middle-class
family's comfortable world is shaken to the core when their
11-year-old daughter contracts AIDS from a blood transfusion. ``In
its simplicity and directness and restraint there is very often a
compelling power'' to this novel, Jim Shepard said in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GERSHWIN &LR;  By Edward Jablonski. Da Capo, $17.95. The author
maintains that the brash optimism of George Gershwin's music was
emblematic of a vibrant young America rising to its potential in
the arts and business. In 1987 the reviewer Francis Davis said this
biography features ``a wealth of pertinent detail and fresh
musicological insight.'' The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE
COMPLETE LYRICS OF IRA GERSHWIN &LR; , edited by Robert Kimball ($35),
which tracks the artistic growth of George's older brother and his
search for fresh ways to avoid cliches. In 1993 Sheldon Harnick
said this book should be ``in the home of everyone who has an
interest in the art of the musical theater.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EMPIRE OF LIGHT: A HISTORY OF DISCOVERY IN SCIENCE AND ART &LR;  By
Sidney Perkowitz. Joseph Henry, $16.95. A physics professor
explores the nature of light and the complex human responses to it,
as well as various theories of the phenomenon through the ages. In
1996 one critic called this a ``smoothly written, comprehensive and
thoroughly enjoyable'' overview written with ``a fine awareness of
light's appeal to our aesthetic senses.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SKULL SESSION &LR;  By Daniel Hecht. Signet, $6.99. An out-of-work
teacher with Tourette's syndrome, hired to fix up a vandalized
Hudson Valley estate, finds that the damage may be linked to some
missing high school students. This is ``an accomplished first novel
... that keeps the reader guessing till the very end,'' Charles
Salzberg wrote this year.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Help, I'm being held prisoner by an ATM machine!
 &HT;    For release Dec. 23, 1998.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON - It was just past 11:30 p.m. and we were returning to
our hotel after enjoying a performance of Oscar Wilde's ``An Ideal
Husband.'' As we emerged from our tube station, I spotted an ATM
machine. I am drawn to ATM machines as a moth is drawn to light.
This time, however, something turned out the lights.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bleak moment when you realize that you are thousands of
miles and five time zones away from home, your funds nearly
depleted and the card you have carried with you to get more has
been eaten by an alien ATM machine.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps ``bleak'' isn't the proper word; ``panicky'' is more
likely.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30 p.m., in a darkened arcade in the Kensington section of
London, I panicked in the sense that I was down to the equivalent
of about $8.50 with no way to get more money. The language that
spewed from my mouth was crude and I apologize to any Britishers
who heard it within the five-miles range of my raucous voice.
</P>
<P>
   It took a calming wife to settle me down, although I
repetitiously continued to declare ``The $%&AMP;(% thing ate my card!''
</P>
<P>
   This was a lesson in both economics and travel. I long ago came
to the conclusion that the world is populated with more ATM
machines than it is trees. As a result of that incredulous notion,
I found it easier to travel with less funds, less credit cards, no
personal checks and no travelers checks.
</P>
<P>
   My belief in ATM machines was so great that I began preaching
about them. They're wonderful, I would tell friends and occasional
strangers. Each day, withdraw just the amount of money you need to
carry you through the day, get it in the funds of the country
you're in, have it drawn electronically from your checking account
in the U.S. at that moment's exchange rates and pay only a small
fee for the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   It made it so easy. On this trip, I left the U.S. with but
little more than $100 cash in my pocket _ and that ATM card.
</P>
<P>
   So, here I was standing in the shadows of a London arcade, down
to my last $8.50 and my financial lifeline sucked into this
unyielding machine. How I longed for those travelers checks, how I
wished I had brought more cash. How I swore!
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to reach a bank executive near the midnight hour is
like trying to make sense of what is going on in Washington, D.C.
these days, but my wife persevered (while I sulked.) Working her
way through the London Yellow Pages, she finally located an on-duty
somebody who, naturally, couldn't help us but told us who to call
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the morning that we were told the card would not be
removed from the ATM machine until the next day but based on other
factors (my wife had a duplicate of the card but absolutely refused
to use it because she feared it, too, would be eaten) we were given
some money to tide us over.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, and two bank branch offices later, we had our card
returned to us with apologies.
</P>
<P>
   Although a lesson was learned not to put all my eggs into one
ATM machine, I remained curious. ``Why,'' I asked a bank officer,
``was my card kept? I had sufficient funds, I put in the right ID
number . . . ``
</P>
<P>
   The bank officer referred to a computer printout. ``You took too
long to make your decision on how much money you wanted,'' he
answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for that, you kept my card?'' I exclaimed. ``Why wasn't it
just sent back and me told to try again?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' he said, ``that's the way we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Accepted, however grudgingly. But the next time I leave the
country, I'll be backed by more than just an ATM card.

 &HT;    Keying in to `high-tech hate' on the Internet
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A couple of months ago, Internet hate
groups pulled a high-tech, in-your-face trick on the mainstream
press that normally tries to ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   It got them immediate attention, but not the kind they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In early October, certain U.S. and foreign newspapers suddenly
began getting puzzled and angry reports from people searching for
their World Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of finding the Chicago Sun-Times, St. Louis
Post-Dispatch or Atlanta Constitution, people were landing on the
swastika-emblazoned site of Stormfront Inc., a Nazi-patterned white
power organization based in West Palm Beach. Stormfront is run by
Don Black, a former Ku Klux Klansman who was the first to set up a
white supremacist site on the Internet, according to groups that
monitor bigotry on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Someone _ Black says he didn't do it _ had registered variations
of 14 newspapers' names on the Internet, then programmed them to
divert searchers to the Stormfront site. For example, a searcher
looking for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Web site who typed
atlantaconstitution.com would wind up instead at stormfront.org.
The Constitution's real Web address is ajc.com.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver was a new twist on cyber-squatting, in which
opportunists register names similar to famous trademarks and try to
make businesses pay them to give up the names.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first known time that Web searchers had been hijacked
to a hate site, according to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith. The ADL, which monitors hate groups worldwide, estimates
several hundred now operate on the Internet. The Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles, also a monitor, lists more than 800 sites
that it classifies as hate-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message was we're now in the generation of high-tech
hate,'' said William Rothchild, ADL regional director in West Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers got another message from the Stormfront incident.
Cyber-squatting has opened a chaotic new realm of legal conflict
over trademark protection, and the hate-group twist added a free
speech element that made it even more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is moving ahead faster than the law, and the law
needs to catch up,'' said Jon Vegosen, attorney for the Chicago
Sun-Times. ``Fortunately, there were (trademark) laws here to
protect people in this case, and we were able to take advantage of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago and St. Louis papers sued the groups in federal
court for trademark infringement in October and got restraining
orders. Within a month, the groups had given up the soundalike Web
domains to the newspapers, which registered them to their own
companies. The remaining sites either have been or are being
re-registered to the trademark owners, or have been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania attorney general also has sued Stormfront and
two white supremacy groups with cyber links to it. That suit, filed
in October in Pennsylvania state court, accuses ALPHA HQ and White
Pride World Wide of using their Web sites to make ``terroristic
threats'' against two state employees.
</P>
<P>
   Stormfront holds the distinction of being the first Internet
bigotry site, according to the ADL and other hate-watch
organizations. It showed up in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Black, 45, is a former Grand Wizard of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan.
In the 1980s, he was sentenced to three years in prison for leading
an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the government on the
Caribbean island of Dominica.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Chloe _ formerly married to Louisiana
politician and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke _ have lived
in West Palm Beach since 1987 and have a 9-year-old son. Black
manages a network of Web sites and computer servers from his home,
according to court records in the newspaper suits.
</P>
<P>
   Groups maintaining such sites range from old-line ones such as
Aryan Nations and Knights of the Ku Klux Klan to the newer
Skinheads of the Racial Holy War and record companies peddling
white-power albums with violent lyrics. Graphics are heavy on
swastikas, Celtic crosses, Gothic type and dark backgrounds with
flames, flags and thunderbolts. Articles quote ``scientific''
evidence that whites are genetically and culturally superior to
other races and allege persecution of white, Gentile,
English-speaking patriots by blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Jews, the
media and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Black said in an interview that he knew nothing about the plan
to divert newspaper searchers to Stormfront. He said it was
strictly the work of Adrian Edward Marlow of Suisun City, Calif.,
from whom Black rented space on a computer and knew only through
online communication.
</P>
<P>
   But newspapers sent lawyers after Black and Stormfront, as well
as Marlow and others. Court documents from the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch case disclosed a national network of connected Web
sites, post office addresses and computer-support functions. For
example, according to the documents, Black provides Internet access
and Web site links to:
</P>
<P>
   _Frank Weltner of St. Louis, who calls himself Von Goldstein
Mohammed and calls his Web site Jew Watch.
</P>
<P>
   _Adrian Marlow, who created and maintains a site called White
Pride World Wide and who provided computer space for part of
Black's Stormfront operations, as well as for Weltner's
jewwatch.com.
</P>
<P>
   _Tim DeLaire of St. Charles, Mo., listed as the contact for
Bluelantern Inc., the name used to register the White Pride World
Wide site.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to contact Weltner, Marlow and DeLaire were
unsuccessful. Marlow did not respond to telephone messages
requesting comment, and the number listed for DeLaire on his
Bluelantern site registration produces a recording saying the call
can't be completed.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge found that Weltner had reproduced a copyrighted
Post-Dispatch story and photograph about Jewish religious services
on his Web site without the paper's permission. He signed a consent
order forbidding further use of copyrighted material.
</P>
<P>
   Federal courts in Missouri and Illinois also issued injunctions
against Black, Weltner and the others, ordering them to stop using
any variations of the newspapers' trademarked names. They, too,
signed consent orders agreeing to the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents showed that Marlow had used the initials, MKM,
and post office box of his mother, Monika K. Marlow _ without her
knowledge _ to register the names. She was dismissed as a
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the newspapers, two variations of pharmaceutical
giant Abbott Laboratories' Web address also were registered to MKM.
A spokeswoman for Abbott said the company is ``working to
invalidate the current registrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Stabbe, an attorney for The Atlanta Constitution said
Marlow told him in a telephone conversation that he wanted money
for the atlantaconstitution.com address. Stabbe said Marlow told
him he had linked the address to Stormfront to create publicity,
attract more traffic and thus make the site appear to be worth
more.
</P>
<P>
   But Marlow gave up the name, under a cease-and-desist letter and
threat of a suit, without ever saying how much money he wanted,
Stabbe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never got that far,'' Stabbe said.
</P>
<P>
   Tweaking the noses of the establishment press, and being hauled
into court for it, wasn't as impressive to Black as it was to the
newspapers and their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a ripple, but it wasn't that big a story,'' Black
said. ``The attorneys certainly put forth a great deal of effort.
Getting a court injunction is a big deal, considering it's such a
trivial issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania lawsuit is another matter. As in the St. Louis
and Chicago newspaper cases, the suit is directed at a cross-linked
network of organizations, Web sites and individuals _ including
Black and Stormfront; DeLaire and Bluelantern; and a Philadelphia
white supremacist group called ALPHA HQ and its founder, Ryan
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says the ALPHA HQ Web site posted pictures of two women
employed as fair housing and human relations workers by the state
and made ``terrorist threats'' against them. It called one a ``race
traitor'' and said traitors ``will be hung from the neck from the
nearest tree or lamp post.'' It also carried a photograph doctored
to look like the employee's office building was exploding.
</P>
<P>
   The state wants the court to ban publication of the photos and
images on the ALPHA HQ site and prohibit Black and the other
defendants from providing computer support for the site. Further,
it wants the court to force Network Solutions Inc., the worldwide
registry for Internet names, to banish ALPHA HQ from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Black says the suit is an attack on the groups' First Amendment
rights and the attorney general would be wise not to push it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a violation of the Ku Klux Klan Act,'' Black said. ``He
could be countersued based on that act.'' The Civil Rights Act of
1871, known as the KKK Act, was an attempt to curb Klan violence by
forbidding one person or group from usurping another's
constitutional rights, including by force of law.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions Inc., which has 3 million Internet ``domain''
names registered, says monitoring trademarks and content on Web
sites is not its job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is it's up to trademark owners to police their
own trademarks,'' said spokeswoman Sheryl Regan. ``We register Web
addresses . . . on a first-come, first-served basis, but we don't
concern ourselves with the content on sites using those
addresses.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been 4,000 disputes since NSI began registering names
in 1993, Regan said. NSI has been targeted in court actions 44
times, including the Pennsylvania case, and has never been found at
fault, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Internet sites promoting hostility and even
violence against racial, religious, ethnic and other populations
keeps changing as groups adopt the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Black and his inspiration, David Duke, are enthusiastic leaders
of the Internet movement. They say it gives them access and
exposure to millions of potential recruits and followers they can't
reach through other media that shun them. A headline on Duke's Web
site sums up their expectations: The Coming White Revolution _ Born
on the Internet.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: At last! Boxing day off
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Thanks to a calendar quirk this year,
Americans will get a taste of Stephenstide. Maybe after we've tried
it, we won't want to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   Because Christmas falls on a Friday, the feast of Stephen falls
on Saturday, a day off for most American workers. So, finally, the
civilized practice of recognizing the second day of Christmas will
extend to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of the English-speaking world, however, a Dec. 26th
at home does not depend on happy coincidence of calendar and work
week. It is an every-year, bona fide, no-mail,
``closed''-sign-hanging-in-the-front-door, sit-around-the-house
holiday. It is the Feast of Stephen, the Second Day of Christmas,
Boxing Day.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it called Boxing Day? Because that's the day in family
holiday gatherings when the gloves finally come off. I thought
everyone knew that.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, other explanations. It is also said to be
the day when, Christmas having been safely taken care of, gifts
were boxed for service employees: postmen, doormen, coal
deliverers, the paper boy and the like.
</P>
<P>
   In our consumer-driven economy, however, the emphasis of the
Boxing Day has shifted almost entirely to boxes plopped on the
counters of returns departments. It is the day when bad guesses by
unskilled present-buyers are put right. Second Chance Day.
</P>
<P>
   We've come to believe that holiday second chances are restricted
to bringing back misguided purchases. Wrong. That's
one-day-of-Christmas thinking. On the second day of Christmas, one
has the opportunity for salesmanship. The time to convince
recipients that misguided present choices are actually
misunderstood present choices. Items the recipient always wanted
without knowing it. Objects that undoubtedly will grow on you.
</P>
<P>
   Such dialogue demands the leisure of a Boxing Day away from
work.
</P>
<P>
   The other second chances of Stephenstide have to do with being
able to do Christmas things you were too busy to do on or before
Christmas because of intense holiday preparations. With the day off
you can practice the fine art of holiday cooking by microwaving
pre-prepared cookie mix. You can force teen-agers to pretend to
like their families in photographs taken by the tree. (``Jonathan,
the spikes stay off until you see the flash go off.'') To sing
Christmas songs whose second verse you almost know.
</P>
<P>
   For this last activity, there is even a custom-made,
day-after-Christmas song, ``Good King Wenceslaus.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, I considered this song wonderfully exotic because
you cannot sing it with a Southern accent. All its syllables must
be pronounced. Its rhythm is fast, choppy and hard, like something
big falling down the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   It also demands that you pronounce ``cruel,'' ``crew AL.'' The
way a hammy villain would in a bad horror movie on television. Then
you must immediately match it with ``fuel'' pronounced as ``few
AL.''
</P>
<P>
   Way coo-AL.
</P>
<P>
   Within its Dr. Seuss rhyme scheme, the words paint a Christmas
tableau like a crowded and garish cover of a paperback book from
the wizards-and-lizards fantasy shelf: Glowing footprints in the
snow, fountains in the middle of a forest, a hiking king and his
long-suffering page. All topped with a socially responsible message
about the blessings of charity.
</P>
<P>
   A neat song for a holiday this country somehow thought it could
do without.
</P>
<P>
   Well, no more. Increasingly, the days before Christmas are a
shrieking tinseled blur. They involve mall hiking, involuntary arts
and crafts, home cleanup, dig out and decoration, as well as
amateur electrical work, familial negotiation and reckless baking.
A break is needed whether we call it Boxing Day, Holiday Overload
Day or Second-Chance Day.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing Day is just the kind of fadeout and reward we need. A
time when the kids have not yet lost interest in their toys and are
no longer hyper with expectation. When there's still enough
leftovers to avoid making meals. When the singing Christmas tree
ornament has been successfully disabled. When the batteries are
installed, assembly completed and computer reconfigured.
</P>
<P>
   When I was little, I used to look forward to Christmas. Now that
I'm older, I look forward to Boxing Day.

 &HT;    `It doesn't matter if it's one string of lights or 100, it's all
beautiful'
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ He didn't intend to decorate for Christmas this
year, but Michael Neitman couldn't help himself. Some Christmas imp
_ maybe one of the 500 or so animated figures in his collection _
spurred him on, and, almost against his will, he started stringing
lights.
</P>
<P>
   His mother told him he was crazy. For Neitman, after all,
decorating isn't what it is for most families _ string up a few
lights and you're done. Back in the old days on Yale Avenue, it
took three weeks to put up the 120,000 lights and 100 or more
mechanical figures that transformed the stately old mansion into a
Christmas phantasmagoria. Neitman hired a Santa Claus who passed
out candy canes and small toys to the children. (As a special
nostalgic touch, many of the animated figures are from the old
Rike's windows.)
</P>
<P>
   Neitman wasn't a rich man, but for 15 years his Christmas
display outdazzled the showiest showplace in town. More than 35,000
people from all over the Miami Valley made the pilgrimage every
year. For many families, it was an annual tradition. ``Every year
we would go over there,'' says Charlene Martin, a retired Dayton
teacher. ``We were so touched by the fact he was doing this for the
people, something so extraordinary to look at, when he was not a
wealthy man.''
</P>
<P>
   The tradition ended in 1996, when the house at 16 Yale Ave. was
sold. Neitman, one of six renters, bought a small house at 218
Edgar Ave. in Walnut Hills.
</P>
<P>
   It ate at him that he couldn't put up his display, couldn't
greet the friends who had visited Yale Avenue year after year. The
regular visitors missed it, too. Every year since 1985, Christina
Anderson of Kettering and her mother, Martha Goldberg, had visited
the display after Thanksgiving dinner. ``My mother called Mike a
gentle giant, and he always had a special gift for her,'' she says.
``I just think that he has a magical gift. His display takes you
back to a time that was very loving and giving.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while driving up Wayne Avenue, Anderson looked to her
left and noticed a blaze of Christmas lights. She turned down Edgar
Avenue and ``there were beavers chopping wood, teddy bears and an
elf decorating a Christmas tree on the front porch,'' she says. The
animated windows, with the dancing gingerbread and bobbing Santas,
looked familiar too. She knocked on the door and, sure enough, it
was her old friend.
</P>
<P>
   They cried a little together when Anderson told Neitman her
mother was dying of lung cancer. A few nights later, Anderson
talked her mother into going over with her. Goldberg told her she
was daughter was too weak, ``but her frail little body was as a
child again, looking for things she enjoyed like the beavers
chopping the tree. And her buddy the gentle giant came out and as
always gave her a tin of chocolate candy and a warm hug, as if time
had stood still.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg died Monday night. The reunion ``meant a lot to me,''
Neitman says.
</P>
<P>
   So he's not sorry he put up his display this year, even if it
could only be a tenth of his collection of 300,000 lights and 500
mechanical figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as big as at Yale Avenue,'' Neitman concedes, ``but
it doesn't matter how big it is, as long as you're making smiles.
It doesn't matter if it's one string of lights or 100, it's all
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   He says it like he means it, and I think he does. But I can't
help noticing he's eyeballing his neighbor's yard. ``A two-yard
display would be nice,'' he says.

 &HT;    Season brings out deeds of generosity, genius
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Judge Bill Logue looked down and saw chocolate
still under his fingernails. This despite countless hand washings.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't going to jump him about it. You can't get on a guy's
case after he's filled 308 coffee cans with 3,000 or so pieces of
candy he's made by hand, and made sure that each can gets to
someone.
</P>
<P>
   Logue's candy _ chocolate-covered dollops commonly known as
Martha Washingtons _ is so good I'm surprised Waco didn't make it a
controlled substance by now. It causes work stoppages and
arm-wrestling matches. It is a disruptive force in our fair city.
</P>
<P>
   This uncommon labor of love entails 60 pounds of pecans, 160
pounds of sugar, 35 pounds of coconut. These figures come from his
wife Gloria, who's witnessed this ritual for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The McLennan County district judge is retiring next year, and
says this is his last batch. I doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Logue isn't a man of his word. It's just that he
appears hopelessly addicted to giving.
</P>
<P>
   Cliches aside, this is a season that brings out remarkable
gifts, not just the kind you lay before a friend but also inspired
deeds.
</P>
<P>
   One can't help but be inspired, for instance, hearing the
combined Waco High orchestra, choir and show choir do ``Oh Holy
Night,'' crescendos that make neck hairs stand. They did that the
night of Dec. 12 in concert at Baylor's opulent Jones Hall. It's an
imposing venue to fill with sound. The high-schoolers were more
than equal to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds and silence
</P>
<P>
   Putting matters crass and commercial aside, we have a range of
celebration this time of year, from the jubilant to the somber,
from the decorated homes that stop traffic to the single string of
lights across a blue-collar frame, or one candle in a window.
</P>
<P>
   We have the moving choruses and the jaunty standbys. We also
have offerings in silence _ in meditation.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the colors, one of the more striking offerings is a
plain booklet that came my way written by the members of Lakeshore
Baptist Church. An annual booklet of Advent meditations,
``Extravagant Gift'' contains 34 offerings of prose and poetry from
members of the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   In this day and time, getting people to contribute expressions
like these is remarkable _ valuable to those who read them and
valuable to those who write them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extravagant gifts''? The Lakeshore writers find themselves
showered. Each expression in this pamphlet is a heartfelt
celebration of blessings without pricetags.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday and Friday throughout McLennan County extravagance was
carried out in the most humble of offerings: a single storybook for
a single child, carried out over and over.
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of the Tribune-Herald/Central Texas Literacy
Coalition Storybook Christmas were shared, 14,805 books for little
ones in local grade schools and pre-schools.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't at any of the parties this year that distributed the
books, but I've been at several. And I've seen little ones hug
those books tightly and recoil momentarily from a grownup's reach.
Then they realize that rather than wanting to take the book away,
the grownup wants to share the book, read the book, to that child.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas, Hanukkah, holy observances near and far, find people
celebrating life and connectedness. When bombs fall and partisan
spears fly, it's easy to feel disgusted about our species.
</P>
<P>
   But among the rewards of this season is the abundant
demonstration that we are in fact an extraordinary species, with
extraordinary blessings and extraordinary opportunities to increase
our connectedness.
</P>
<P>
   The question, of course: Why does this need a season?
</P>

Tribune-Journal. His column appears Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

 &HT;    Prospects for peace melt with each new `icicle'
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those new ``icicle'' lights hanging from suburban roof
gutters during this Christmas season tell us a lot about the global
economic outlook and the potential for worldwide political
instability.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought the dangling bulbs just looked pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they do. But they also help explain why the world is
getting to be a more dangerous place. Let's start at the beginning:
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Americans have been stringing colored lights on
their houses to brighten the holiday season. But in recent years
the booming economy has created enough wealth to allow many
homeowners to upgrade to spectacular displays of white lights or
strings of lights that appear to chase each other.
</P>
<P>
   But now even that seems tired and we are eager for a new fad in
decorative lighting. And darned if someone hasn't come up with a
cute idea, vertical strings of clear lights that hang from an
electrical wire. When tacked along a roof's edge, they appear to be
shimmering ``icicles'' hanging down.
</P>
<P>
   This ``ice'' could not be hotter. Tens of millions of icicle
lights have flown off of store shelves. Many retailers, who have
been sold out for weeks, describe the consumer demand as ``an
explosion'' in the lighting industry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some electric utility companies are reporting record
demand for energy as more and more homes add those new lights.
Electric bills will be steep in January, but no one seems to mind;
we just want to see those beautiful lights in December.
</P>
<P>
   This is part of a very big trend in the U.S. economy. We no
longer are worried about energy conservation. From the Las Vegas
strip to our own front yards, we are turning on the lights and
revving up our engines as energy prices fall. Next year Georgia
Power Co. will cut electricity rates for residential consumers by
nearly 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But by far the biggest energy bargains can be found at the gas
station, where prices have dropped to early 1970s levels. Because
of a global glut, oil now costs less than $11 a barrel, down from
more than $35 in the early 1980s. That drop is certainly wonderful
for Americans who want to gaze at the huge sport-utility vehicles
glimmering in the driveway under the glow of all those Christmas
lights.
</P>
<P>
   But plunging fuel prices are leaving poor nations much poorer
and less politically stable. Some of the world's most dangerous
countries, such as Russia, Libya, Iran, Iraq and Algeria, are among
the biggest oil producers. With oil profits collapsing, the people
in those countries are becoming more unsettled. One Libyan official
recently described the social unrest in his country as ``becoming
very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, the economic crisis continues. The Chinese workers
making Christmas lights are earning a pittance. Millions of other
Asians are desperate for any kind of income. Their willingness to
work for pennies makes it possible for U.S. retailers to hold down
prices for our consumers.
</P>
<P>
   This Christmas, it's clearer than ever that Americans are the
big winners in the global economy. Most U.S. children will get
mountains of toys and the holidays will literally get brighter with
more lights than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But in the rest of the world, the combination plunging energy
revenue, deflating commodity prices and brutal wage competition are
driving millions into dire conditions. The fantastic disparity
between our fortunes and theirs is disturbing. How long can the
United States continue to be the peaceful, prosperous island
surrounded by so much poverty and turmoil?
</P>
<P>
   Through hard work, good government and ingenuity, Americans have
ended up being the world's economic victor. But it's a dangerous
game when the winner gets to take all. Unless other countries get a
bigger share of the wealth, the chances for peace on Earth will be
slim

 &HT;    Celebrating the season along with new cycles
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ My son Kristofor and I have been together for
31
</P>
<P>
   Christmases now, and we've run the gift wish list gamut from
Pooh bears and model trains to computers and cars. Even though I'll
always miss the little guy in the footy pajamas who would scuffle
into my bedroom at daybreak to announce:
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun is up and Sandy Claus has been here,'' this Christmas
promises to be the best one ever.
</P>
<P>
   Kristofor was only four months old the first time Santa came to
call. He didn't quite know what to make of the colored lights and a
tree growing in the living room, but his baby eyes danced with
excitement anyway. That was the year his grandmother gave him a
giant stuffed tiger. It was a love match at first sight and by
afternoon the pair were napping together under the Christmas tree -
the boy sprawled on top in guileless baby sleep, drooling in the
tiger's ear.
</P>
<P>
   By the time his second Christmas rolled around, Kristofor had
forgotten all about the first one so his father and I decided to
make it a big surprise. We waited until he was tucked in for the
night before putting up the tree and hauling presents down from the
attic. Somewhere around the house I have a faded Polaroid of a
curly-haired toddler on Christmas morning, all zipped up in a fuzzy
bunny sleeper and frozen in his tracks at the living room door as
he catches his first glimpse of the lighted tree.
</P>
<P>
   A second shot shows him just moments later reaching for a
particularly shiny
</P>
<P>
   ornament that has caught his fancy. The final shot is of a
puzzled little boy with his mouth in a wide-open ``O'' as he stares
at the pieces of the ornament scattered on the floor at the foot of
the tree.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, for his two-year-old Christmas, there was an easel
with a sketch pad and a king-size box of tempera paints. On the
first warm day I slipped one of his father's old T-shirts over his
sun suit and helped him set up a studio in the back yard. He said
he was going to paint the pine trees. I told him I thought that was
a dandy idea. A while later I came back to check on his progress.
There was no paint on the sketch pad but he had indeed painted the
pine trees - some yellow and a whole lot blue. It never occurred to
me to ask the obvious question in advance.
</P>
<P>
   This was also the year of the shiny red fire engine - the one
that boasted two removable ladders, and ran on a car battery with
enough juice to take him a few times around the neighborhood
fighting fires and rescuing treed cats before
</P>
<P>
   it needed recharging.
</P>
<P>
   When Kristofor was 3, he and his dad did a back-to-nature thing
and went out into the country to cut their own tree. I have a
picture of that too. He's the short one with the swagger and a
hatchet tucked into the hammer loop of his overalls. He says that
was a great year because in addition to helping his dad cut the big
tree, he was allowed to cut a sapling (which he now feels badly
about) for his very own to decorate any way he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   We've had some memorable Christmases along the way. One of our
favorites was
</P>
<P>
   spent in Cortina D'Ampezzo, a storybook village in the Italian
Alps. We remember window shopping and listening to the church bells
on Christmas Eve. No glitz just the snow and some friendly people
wishing us Merry Christmas in Italian. We answered in kind.
</P>
<P>
   As the years passed, it was easy to tell the age of the boy by
the presents under the tree. They ranged from Playskool filling
stations to archery equipment with straw targets that mildewed in
the southern humidity. Soon, chemistry sets and ant farms had given
way to requests for computers and car insurance.
</P>
<P>
   And almost before I knew it, Christmas became a brief vacation
to be spent at
</P>
<P>
   home. The holiday season signaled the arrival of duffels of
dirty laundry and a
</P>
<P>
   college boy who slept until noon and spent the rest of his time
emptying the
</P>
<P>
   refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Christmases through the years have been good for us, but this
one is going to
</P>
<P>
   be the best of them all. This year I'll be packing up the
presents and driving to Pennsylvania to spend the holidays with my
son, his fiancee, and the family
</P>
<P>
   we're going to be marrying into.
</P>
<P>
   And so the cycle begins again. New wish lists, new generations,
and eventually a new Pooh bear or two - and I intend to be the lady
carrying the tiger.

 &HT;    All I want for Christmas is Mustang hall
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When I made out my Christmas wish list this year,
there was one item not just for me, but for the Atlanta automotive
community at-large, especially those people who love Ford Mustangs.
I asked Santa to see what he could do about the location for the
Mustang museum.
</P>
<P>
   You are probably saying, ``What has Santa got to do with this?''
The location has been narrowed down to two finalists, Atlanta and
Orlando. It may take someone with the magic of Santa Claus to
offset the magic Orlando can bring to bear from the Disney
corporation, ABC television and even ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, on the other hand, has history in its favor. If it
weren't for a small group of Georgians who 22 years ago formed what
would grow to become the Mustang Club of America, the Mustang might
not even be in production today. Under the leadership of Dalton,
Ga., resident Bill Dillard, they launched what is today the world's
largest Mustang Club.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's first meeting was April 11, 1976, and by the
time the first Grand National show was held at Stone Mountain Park
that August, the membership had grown to 250 with more than 100
Mustangs and 1,200 enthusiasts in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   International status came quickly with over 600 names, including
many from foreign countries making up the roster at the second
Grand National event in 1977. As the club continued to grow, a
national headquarters was established in 1981 in Lithonia. Today
the Mustang Club of America has its headquarters in Stockbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are over 429 Mustang clubs worldwide and more
than 70,000 members who want to build a permanent facility as a
lasting tribute to their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, 25 metro areas were identified as potential sites.
Dillard said the mayor of Detroit even ``offered for free the land
that Tiger Stadium sits on. (But) there was no way we were going to
take responsibility for the destruction of another American icon,
even if the land was free!''
</P>
<P>
   Now the time is near to open the winning envelope. The ultimate
decision will be made by the Mustang Club of America's board of
directors next year.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 1, Ford Motor Co. donated $1.5 million toward the
museum's construction.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, while he is a fine fellow, I think Mickey Mouse has
enough coins and enough attractions. So, if you have ever owned a
Mustang, thought about owning a Mustang or even had a date in a
Mustang, let the club know how you feel. Its mailing address is
3588 Hwy. 138, Suite 365, Stockbridge, GA 30281 or e-mail at
mustang(at)mustang.org.

 &HT;    Time to take crash course in brakes
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How do you know when you need new brakes? What is that
squealing noise when stopping or the chirping noises while still on
the move? Why does the brake pedal vibrate when pushing on it to
stop?
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few of the questions that come up about brakes.
</P>
<P>
   I have a rule for teaching; I won't tell anyone how to fix
something before explaining how it works. So, sit back and let's
take a crash course on brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are several combinations of brake systems, they
all basically work the same. The parts of the system attached to
each wheel that actually stops the wheels are called either brake
rotors or brake drums.
</P>
<P>
   A brake drum looks like a heavy metal cake pan and is commonly
made of cast iron. Unless the car is very old, they are only used
on the rear wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Brake rotors, also called ``discs,'' are flat metal cast iron
disks and vary in thickness depending on the size of the vehicle.
They are used on the front wheels and are becoming more predominant
in rear brake use.
</P>
<P>
   Either the brake rotor or drum rotates with the wheel. The
stopping action of the wheel is achieved when the friction material
attached to a brake shoe (for drum brakes) or brake pad (disk
brakes) is forced against the spinning drum or disk. There are two
brake shoes or brake pads used at each wheel.
</P>
<P>
   All brake systems also must have a way to move the shoes or
rotors against the drum or disk. This is accomplished
hydraulically, with brake fluid, which is contained in a closed
system of cylinders, plungers, seals and tubing. Let's talk about
how all of this works, starting at the brake pedal and working
down.
</P>
<P>
   When you step on the pedal, it moves a rod that pushes a plunger
inside a cylinder, which in turn moves the brake fluid into a
network of tubes or brake lines. The principle is the same as the
hypodermic syringe a doctor or nurse uses to give you an injection.
</P>
<P>
   In need of assistance
</P>
<P>
   The pressurized fluid moves through the brake lines into another
cylinder mounted near the wheel, where the fluid pushes against
another plunger (piston).
</P>
<P>
   In a disc-brake system, the fluid pressure moves the piston
against the back of the brake pad, forcing it against the spinning
rotor. This action causes the wheel to stop.
</P>
<P>
   On drum brakes, the piston pushes against the brake shoe, which
is thrust against the inside of the rolling brake drum, stopping it
and the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Most brake systems use some form of power assist unit. The most
common type gets its help from the engine.
</P>
<P>
   However, power assist is not a frequent source of trouble.
Anti-lock brake systems also are separate so I'll save them for
later.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, I'll answer some specific questions about brakes. You
might want to keep this column so you can refer back to the terms
I've used today.

A TOUGH NEW GOAL IN IRAQ
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER and YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scenes were gnawingly familiar: the video-gamelike
renderings of air strikes, the beribboned generals with their maps
and pointers, the unshaven Iraqis gaping into craters dug by U.S.
cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   It was so routine, in fact, that this latest act of war against
Iraq hardly delayed the debate in the House of Representatives over
impeachment of a sitting U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   And yet because this U.S.-Iraqi contest of cat and mouse has
occurred so often in the past eight years without vexing, let alone
trapping, the mouse _ there, once again, was a smiling, sinister
Saddam Hussein clad in his natty foulards or his field marshal's
epaulets _ many are asking a broader set of questions this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   What is the endgame? What is the long-term strategy? How many
more times can this happen?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while this bombing campaign has looked like a larger
version of half a dozen previous ones aimed at forcing Saddam to
abide by United Nations resolutions or to back away from allied
protected zones, President Clinton and Congress have called it
something much more significant. This, they say, is the first salvo
in a campaign to remove Saddam and install a government more
democratic and less dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   And while analysts and officials here and abroad applaud such
goals, they wonder whether such a policy shift goes beyond the
rhetorical. They are quick to point out that even if the Americans
are serious, the task is enormous not only because of Saddam's
continuing grip on power but because of the political culture of
the Iraq he has built over the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Any serious new government would have to come from Iraq's
professional and middle classes. Yet it is these people who have
been the direct beneficiaries of the universities, bridges, roads
and secular, modernized structure that Saddam has created. That
makes them, paradoxically, the ones with most to lose if he
departs.
</P>
<P>
   They are also the ones who have suffered most from U.S.-led
international sanctions against the country, watching their fixed
government salaries disappear and selling their artwork and
appliances for a pittance to feed their families.
</P>
<P>
   The urban poor are used to scraping by, and villagers can _ and
do _ turn back to farming. The urban middle class has truly felt
punished.
</P>
<P>
   And given the divided and ineffectual foreign-based Iraqi
opposition, the fierce mistrust of U.S. intentions felt across the
Arab world, and the fear of Iraqi middle classes that the first
result of any coup would be to bring the pent-up wrath of northern
Kurds and southern Shiites down on them, the challenge of
installing a new government becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
   Many people point to the continuing international trade
sanctions as the first problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sort of naivete about sanctions bringing democracy
to Iraq,'' said Denis Halliday, the Irish U.N. official who ran the
oil-for-food program in Iraq until quitting this year, declaring
that sanctions amounted to a ``declaration of war against the Iraqi
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Unicef officials say the lack of spare parts for the
electric, sewer and water networks are contributing to the deaths
of more than 6,000 infants a month there. While the West blames
Saddam for those deaths, most Iraqis, while not pleased with their
president, blame the West.
</P>
<P>
   Clovis Maksoud, a former Arab League ambassador to the United
Nations and now a professor at American University in Washington,
agreed, saying: ``There is a deep dissociation with Saddam in Iraq.
But when they are attacked by the Americans, they rally around the
flag, and he happens to be the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Even analysts who urge the United States to actively promote a
coup against Saddam and consider the sanctions a useful form of
pressure on the regime say getting to the dictator will be
extremely difficult physically and politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody admires him anymore, but most Iraqis still accept and
support him,'' said Amatzia Baram, an Israeli specialist on Iraq
from Haifa University who is spending the year in Washington. ``The
only hope is to separate him from his power base, prove to his
power base that life is more dangerous with him than without him.
That is part of the point of these bombings.''
</P>
<P>
   Others counter that the bombings have little effect on people
accustomed to suffering, that they view the missiles the way a
drowning man might see rain.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's power base consists largely of portions of the Sunni
Muslim tribes and clans in central Iraq. And while it is true that
a majority of Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south
are sick of him and his rule, the chances of a rebellion even by
them are widely viewed as slim.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition groups do not exist in any organized fashion within
Iraq. Those on the outside have been heavily infiltrated by the
regime or are so splintered and inept as to offer almost no hope
for a coherent replacement regime.
</P>
<P>
   It is also entirely unclear how most Iraqis would respond to a
transparently U.S.-led putsch. One frequently heard criticism of
the Iraqi National Congress, the main umbrella opposition group
based in London, is that it is a spineless vassal of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   ``No self-respecting Iraqi would stand up with the United States
when his country is being attacked in this fashion,'' asserted an
Iraqi businessman and intellectual who is known in Iraq as an
opponent of the regime and spoke on the condition of anonymity
since he continues to live there. ``How can you side with forces
bent on destroying not just the regime but a whole country?''
</P>
<P>
   For many Iraqis, relying on the United States to replace Saddam
would be the equivalent of Palestinians asking Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to save them.

</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is a widespread feeling not only in Iraq but across the
Arab world that U.S. policy is not anti-Saddam but something more
sinister, drawing its energy from the sheer savage vigor of
supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   According to this view, the United States cannot countenance the
prospect of a rich, powerful Arab country capable of challenging
U.S. and Israeli primacy in the region. Iraq, with its vast oil
reserves, ancient culture, fertile midlands and sophisticated
technology, is simply too threatening. So keeping Saddam weak and
in office is the best alternative; the United States would make
sure that any new government would serve U.S. interests first.
</P>
<P>
   Many Arabs also say they were grievously offended by all the
decorous talk of bombing before the onset of the holy month of
Ramadan this weekend, as if hurrying to bomb Muslims before Ramadan
was a way of showing respect.
</P>
<P>
   The result of all this suspicion, fueled by howls of ``double
standard'' regarding U.S. policy toward Israel and the Arabs, is
that even Iraqi opposition figures who believe that their hope is
in Washington worry about the appearance of that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell the Americans, `Don't hug us too tight,' '' said
Ghassan Atiyyah, editor of the London-based Iraqi File, an
opposition publication.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Congress earmarked nearly $100 million for
opposition groups, a sum that seems princely until placed against
the hundreds of millions spent on military attacks this past week.
</P>
<P>
   Atiyyah met with U.S. officials some weeks ago to urge them to
finance the establishment of a new Iraqi opposition group in exile,
what he calls a ``council of wise men,'' that would draw on all
sectors of Iraqi society in exile.
</P>
<P>
   While the Iraqi National Congress has Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis,
Atiyyah said that ``the INC may have been an umbrella group, but it
is now an umbrella with too many holes in it that can't cover
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the opposition groups are missing the link to the Iraqi
center, both geographical and political. There is an acute need for
moderate, liberal and secular opposition figures, members of the
middle class, as well as Iraqis who come from the geographical
middle of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of such a group, he said, would be ``Iraqism,'' a
melting pot nationalism for all the country's ethnic and tribal
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The irony _ although it is perhaps also the strength _ of such a
goal is that it mirrors Saddam's own accomplishments. So even the
many Iraqis who despise their president worry that without him the
nation would fall apart, that Muslim fundamentalists, aided by
neighboring Iran, would gain undue influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Removing Saddam would only be a first step in dealing with
most of these issues, even if Saddam can be removed,'' argued
Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington. Any leader following Saddam, he said, would
have to maintain ``at least a quasi-authoritarian regime'' to
prevent deterioration into tribal bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the risk that assassination of Saddam would simply
lead to a takeover by one of his two brutish sons or by his chief
bodyguard and other close lieutenants, changing things not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Most Iraqis within the country lack any real sense of political
alternatives. Maksoud, the former Arab League ambassador, speaks of
their ``political illiteracy'' and Atiyyah, the London opposition
figure, asserts that ``almost anyone who can think clearly has left
the country already.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say this is untrue. Iraq is not an underdeveloped
country. Per capita, it has long had more engineers, scholars,
writers and professionals than any other Arab state. It is probably
not an accident that its scientists are the ones in the Arab world
who produced such an arsenal of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq is not Ethiopia or Somalia,'' said Radwan Abdallah, a
Jordanian political scientist. ``There is still an intelligentsia
and middle class there. It has enormous resources. To change things
requires a great deal of planning, energy and effort. You need a
strong outside hand. But it is a country with talent and
organizational skills. It is certainly not beyond hope.''

 &HT;    Computer games don't have to cost anything
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If holiday shopping has cut into your budget for
computer games, you needn't fear withdrawal. Many games are
available free for the downloading on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these games fall into the shareware category: You
download them free and then are expected to pay if you like and
continue to use the game. Many of the shareware games are
full-blown versions, while others have only a few episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Other games available for free downloading are demonstration
versions of commercial games. In that case, the games are usually
crippled to one degree or another. Either you get only a few
episodes of an elaborate game, or some of the features of the game
have been disabled. Think of these commercial demos as, at worst, a
good way to preview a game before making the sometimes-expensive
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Our first Web site has a mixture of both types _ shareware and
commercial demos. The site is called the Ultimate Game Download
site and you'll find it at http://www.skyex.com/rkonline/dwnld.htm.
Like many programs available for download on the Net, these games
come in a file that is compressed into something called a ZIP file.
That means you'll need software to decompress the ZIP file.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer users already have such a program, but if you
don't have one, just use the term ``ZIP'' as a search word and pick
from the list of unzipping programs at a site like those at
http://www.shareware.com and
</P>
<P>
   http://www.download.com.
</P>
<P>
   The ease of downloading from the Ultimate Game Download site
varies considerably from game to game. One reason for that is most
of the game downloads are not actually stored at the computer that
holds the Web site. Instead, the games are stored on sites
maintained by their publishers or owners. Some of these sites are
extremely busy and _ in extreme cases _ may refuse to make the
connection. In that case, you'll be forced to try again.
</P>
<P>
   To the good, the site has literally dozens of games, including
commercial demos of some of the most popular games.
</P>
<P>
   You'll surely want to bookmark the next site _ Game Downer.
Download games and sites at
http://starcreations.com/gamedowner/ga-dwn01.htm. You can search
for games alphabetically here, making it easier to find a specific
game. Again, most games are not stored on the site, so download
times and availability may vary.
</P>
<P>
   This is just a sampling of the game sites you can find online.
To find a list of literally hundreds of sites that offer downloads,
try using your favorite search engine with the search terms ``game
download'' and, if you try them all, you'll be so busy downloading
you won't have time to play.

 &HT;    Apple giving it the old college try
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Apple's heyday, universities and colleges were a
bedrock of support. The company sold Macs to top universities at a
steep discount, and students became Apple Computer enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Many in academia remain Apple Computer fans, but support for the
company has seriously eroded over the past several years. Macs no
longer dominate college campuses. Some colleges, such as Yale, are
even trying to steer students away from Macs.
</P>
<P>
   Now Apple Computer is making a renewed push into higher
education. It has restored its advisory council of college
officials and announced a new program designed to encourage
students to develop software for Macs.
</P>
<P>
   And the company has created focus groups of students, deans and
professors. One of the things these focus groups have been looking
at is a new, low-cost portable computer Apple Computer hopes to
release sometime next year. This portable will be marketed
especially to the college market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to wade back into higher education,'' Interim
Chief Executive Steve Jobs told a technology conference last week.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Apple Computer reigned supreme on college campuses,
and Jobs was responsible for that. During his first tenure at Apple
Computer during the 1980s, he targeted both universities and their
students as an important market for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs created a unique partnership with higher education called
the Apple University Consortium. It consisted of representatives
from 24 elite campuses.
</P>
<P>
   These colleges agreed to buy thousands of Macs at prices up to
50 percent off retail. It was a winning combination that helped
establish the Mac in its early years.
</P>
<P>
   But then Apple Computer began to take colleges for granted, and
it lost much of its share in this market. Some are skeptical Apple
Computer can regain much of the lost ground. But the company is
determined to give it the old college try.

 &HT;    Check the movie sites before you head out
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not clear when going to the movies became part of
the Christmas ritual, right up there with eggnog, mistletoe and
caroling.
</P>
<P>
   If movie reviews just don't do it for you or the malls are too
crowded, take a peek at this season's hottest offerings on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Major motion pictures seem to be the one group left that doesn't
understand packing as many applets, plug-ins and other bells and
whistles into one place does not necessarily a good Web site make.
While special effects may be a thrill in the theaters, they can be
a turnoff to movie lovers checking out movies on their home PCs.
Most of the new movie sites are inventive and informative, but be
prepared to download special tools or reboot your browser. And if
all else fails, you can always just see the movie in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who's ever had even a brief encounter with America Online
will be intrigued by the title of the new Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan film
``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   The title is a direct lift from the quasi-cheery message that
greets AOL users when they log on. The site at
http://www.youvegotmail.com offers pretty standard movie site fare
but includes some of the e-mail exchanges between the lead
characters, who go by the online screen names of Shopgirl and
NY152.
</P>
<P>
   The site also invites people who have met online to send in
their stories of real-life Net romance, which gives the movie's
plot a little more credibility as well as interesting reading. The
one trouble with the site is that it is an odd combination of a
marketing site and a creative site. It's a strange user experience,
but you'll learn something about the movie and about love online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' (http://www.prince-of-egypt.com), the
big, elaborate animated feature from DreamWorks, has an equally
big, elaborate animated Web site that really is something to see.
There's very little pointing and clicking; users can just sit and
watch the story unfold, almost like an actual movie trailer. The
site is available in several languages and offers a study guide,
special visual downloads (including a desktop music player), the
trailer for the film and a collection of images from the movie. The
brief synopsis of the film will also help parents and kids learn
more about the biblical characters before or after seeing the film.
This is a lovely site for a visually beautiful film.
</P>
<P>
   Trekkers, as they like to be called now, have probably already
bookmarked the site for the newest Star Trek feature, ``Star Trek
Insurrection.'' The builders of the Star Trek site clearly know
their audience, and the site is meant to replicate, if you will,
the computer images on the bridge of the Enterprise. This site
really is a trekker's paradise with creative tidbits such as the
``Briefing From the Federation Regarding the Prime Directive,''
desktop pictures, cast biographies (as if fans didn't already know
everything there is to know about Patrick Stewart and company),
audio interviews and more. This is a fans' site, clearly designed
for devotees of the ``Star Trek'' series and the inside references
to the series. The variety of interviews and pictures make this an
excellent promotional vehicle for the film as well as a nice
stand-alone site.
</P>
<P>
   For families that can't get enough and other grown-ups who
wonder what all the fuss is about, there is the Web site for the
Rugrats movie at http://www.rugratsmovie.com. It's easy to spend
hours on the Rugrats site, playing games, meeting the characters
(from baby Tommy's point of view), downloading screen savers and
just cooing over the characters. Since Rugrats is part of
Nickelodeon, the cable kids channel, the site is very careful to
avoid pitching products or trying to sell things to kids surfing
the site. Advertisements are clearly marked, and clicking on an ad
brings up a warning that users are about to view an ad. It's easy
to spend hours here bonding with the characters without a lot of
complicated Web gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S NEW
</P>
<P>
   Royal Archive: Prince William: This comprehensive site is packed
with info on the young royal, from his height (an impressive 6 feet
1) to his dog (a creature named Widgeon), royal genealogy, the
royal estates, etc.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.gilmer.net/royalty/william/

 &HT;    Rise of news sites on Web traced to Clinton scandal
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This was the year the Internet joined CNN as one of
the prime places we turn for breaking news.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, his Gap-garbed intern and Kenneth Starr's
tell-all of their sloppy affair get most of the credit. The January
issue of Yahoo! Internet Life tells us why. The magazine's Top of
the Net for 1998 names Sept. 11, the day the Starr report was
released on the Internet, the year's top Net traffic day. The
report sent Internet traffic to an all-time high and, since it was
released in the morning, it likely dropped office productivity to
new lows. ``It was sleazy. It was sad. It was a political
earthquake,'' according to the article's read-in.
</P>
<P>
   The best-of list named the evolution of electronic commerce, Web
communities and portalmania the top Net trends. Portals are the new
name for search engines, which are trying to recast themselves as
more than just Internet on-ramps.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo DiCaprio and Pamela Anderson Lee were the names most
often typed into search engine windows. Leo edged Clinton in a
close race between male cyber-stalkees.
</P>
<P>
   There's less Intel Inside
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the company that makes the chips that power our PCs, is
losing market share.
</P>
<P>
   Intel processors, with their ubiquitous Intel Inside icon, went
from being in about 70 percent of all desktop PCs sold to somewhere
around 40 percent. Advanced Micro Devices has picked up the slack
and now leads the retail PC market for processor chips. Cyrix is
still a distance third.
</P>
<P>
   The chart, and a short explanation, are in the January 1999
issue of PC Computing.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also offers a seven-step cure to reduce the amount of
junk e-mail in your life. Death to Spam offers tips such as hiding
or ``spoofing'' your e-mail address should you post to a newsgroup.
Such postings usually list your e-mail address and leave you open
to software programs that search the Web for addresses. To
``spoof'' your address, just add an easily recognizable phrase to
your address, something that will fool a computer but not a person.
If your address is ed(at)aol.com, ``spoofing'' it would change it
to something like ed.ignorethispart(at)aol.com.
</P>
<P>
   The article recommends simpler tricks. Like just ignoring it.
Like an annoying neighbor, responding to a junk e-mail usually
encourages more spam. Sending a return e-mail to the spam source
often just confirms yours is a valid address.
</P>
<P>
   Blabbing e-secrets
</P>
<P>
   They say telling a secret unburdens you. Depending on who is
involved, it also can louse up a friendship. An Internet site may
have split the difference, a chance to lay bare your conscience
anonymously, a scream in the a cyber-forest.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if the http://www
</P>
<P>
   .secretxchange.com postings are true? At the very least, they're
funny. This week's load-offs include ``Three Day Ordeal: I Glued
Myself to My Easy-Chair'' and ``I Threw Up on a Twenty Topping
Pizza and None of My Fraternity Brothers Even Noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret exchange idea started as a newsletter in 1994, which
led to a book, ``I Forgot to Wear Underwear on a Glass-Bottom
Boat,'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Business cards, updated
</P>
<P>
   They don't really fit into Rolodexes and are a hassle to
transcribe. But with CardScan, a software program from Corex
Technologies, you can scan your business cards and keep them on
your desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   The scanned cards create an interactive card file. If a business
card lists a Web address, CardScan lets you link directly to the
Internet site. Other features include direct modem access to any
fax numbers on the cards, the ability to merge the names with your
word processing program and the chance to add notes to the card
once its in your digital card file.
</P>
<P>
   CardScan's version 4 sells for $79. The software with a
dedicated card scanner sells for $299. The program is available in
office supply and computer stores and online at
http://www.cardscan.com.

 &HT;    All things considered, I'd rather use a mouse
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Under the heading of ``What Will They Think of Next,''
we have for our examination and amusement today the Cruise Cat from
Cirque, a touchpad device aimed at the Internet addict.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruise Cat is a modified touchpad-pointing device, a thin
little pad that connects to a serial port and does not cancel out
or confuse your mouse. It simply competes with it for your
attention.
</P>
<P>
   In case you have no experience with a touchpad device _ they
have become rather common as built-in pointing devices on laptops _
it is simply a little panel on which you lightly move your finger
to control the mouse, tap gently for a single click and double-tap
for a double-click.
</P>
<P>
   They work as well as a mouse. Whether you would prefer one to a
mouse is another matter. Personally, I have seen no alternative
device that suits me as well as a mouse. This is due in large part,
certainly, to the fact I learned to use a mouse years ago and it is
second nature.
</P>
<P>
   It was interesting to see the reaction of many of the newsroom
staff when the personal computer, in the form of Macintoshes, made
its appearance. Those who had never used a mouse had no end of
trouble for a while. Some never got used to them and wound up with
trackballs by preference. I find trackballs to be a minor torture
device.
</P>
<P>
   For me, touchpads are a decent alternative to a mouse, better
than trackballs and a lot better than those stupid stubby sticks
they put in the middle of laptop keyboards. However, if a mouse is
available, I'll use that in preference to anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruise Cat has some interesting embellishments _ chief among
them the gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this is cute. If, for instance, you want to look
at your bookmarks, you draw a little B and voila! here come your
bookmarks. If you want to close the active program, you describe an
X with your finger on the pad.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a fatal flaw here. You can't just suddenly
scribble an X on the pad and do anything but move the mouse around.
First, you must place a finger in a depression to one side of the
screen and wait for a little image of the Cruise Cat to appear.
Then you make your symbol on that image. Now, if you compare the
act of pressing the finger into a depression to produce a little
box on which you then draw an X to the simple act of seizing the
mouse, moving the cursor to the Close box with a simple little
wrist movement and clicking a button, you can see we are not
talking convenience here. We're talking gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruise Cat is doubtless the spawn of some wunderkind at
Cirque Corp. who conceived of yet another way to market the Glide
Point pad. In fact, the Cruise Cat has no particular attachment to
the Internet. You can create your own gestures, and they will work
anywhere, in any program I tried. None, however, turns out to be as
easy as using the mouse for the same task.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cruise Cat sounds really catchy, does it not? We can
carry this idea almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Why not give it a few built-in gestures to accomplish basic
tasks in Word 7 such as inserting the date or saving the file, fix
it all up and market it as Word Wompus? Tie in a few calculations
and presto! Excel Eel.
</P>
<P>
   Two or more can play this game.

 (Repeating for all needing.) 
 UNDATED: save them. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a widespread feeling not only in Iraq but across the
Arab world that U.S. policy is not anti-Saddam but something more
sinister, drawing its energy from the sheer savage vigor of
supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   According to this view, the United States cannot countenance the
prospect of a rich, powerful Arab country capable of challenging
U.S. and Israeli primacy in the region. Iraq, with its vast oil
reserves, ancient culture, fertile midlands and sophisticated
technology, is simply too threatening. So keeping Saddam weak and
in office is the best alternative; the United States would make
sure that any new government would serve U.S. interests first.
</P>
<P>
   Many Arabs also say they were grievously offended by all the
decorous talk of bombing before the onset of the holy month of
Ramadan this weekend, as if hurrying to bomb Muslims before Ramadan
was a way of showing respect.
</P>
<P>
   The result of all this suspicion, fueled by howls of ``double
standard'' regarding U.S. policy toward Israel and the Arabs, is
that even Iraqi opposition figures who believe that their hope is
in Washington worry about the appearance of that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell the Americans, `Don't hug us too tight,' '' said
Ghassan Atiyyah, editor of the London-based Iraqi File, an
opposition publication.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Congress earmarked nearly $100 million for
opposition groups, a sum that seems princely until placed against
the hundreds of millions spent on military attacks this past week.
</P>
<P>
   Atiyyah met with U.S. officials some weeks ago to urge them to
finance the establishment of a new Iraqi opposition group in exile,
what he calls a ``council of wise men,'' that would draw on all
sectors of Iraqi society in exile.
</P>
<P>
   While the Iraqi National Congress has Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis,
Atiyyah said that ``the INC may have been an umbrella group, but it
is now an umbrella with too many holes in it that can't cover
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the opposition groups are missing the link to the Iraqi
center, both geographical and political. There is an acute need for
moderate, liberal and secular opposition figures, members of the
middle class, as well as Iraqis who come from the geographical
middle of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of such a group, he said, would be ``Iraqism,'' a
melting pot nationalism for all the country's ethnic and tribal
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The irony _ although it is perhaps also the strength _ of such a
goal is that it mirrors Saddam's own accomplishments. So even the
many Iraqis who despise their president worry that without him the
nation would fall apart, that Muslim fundamentalists, aided by
neighboring Iran, would gain undue influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Removing Saddam would only be a first step in dealing with
most of these issues, even if Saddam can be removed,'' argued
Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington. Any leader following Saddam, he said, would
have to maintain ``at least a quasi-authoritarian regime'' to
prevent deterioration into tribal bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the risk that assassination of Saddam would simply
lead to a takeover by one of his two brutish sons or by his chief
bodyguard and other close lieutenants, changing things not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Most Iraqis within the country lack any real sense of political
alternatives. Maksoud, the former Arab League ambassador, speaks of
their ``political illiteracy'' and Atiyyah, the London opposition
figure, asserts that ``almost anyone who can think clearly has left
the country already.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say this is untrue. Iraq is not an underdeveloped
country. Per capita, it has long had more engineers, scholars,
writers and professionals than any other Arab state. It is probably
not an accident that its scientists are the ones in the Arab world
who produced such an arsenal of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq is not Ethiopia or Somalia,'' said Radwan Abdallah, a
Jordanian political scientist. ``There is still an intelligentsia
and middle class there. It has enormous resources. To change things
requires a great deal of planning, energy and effort. You need a
strong outside hand. But it is a country with talent and
organizational skills. It is certainly not beyond hope.''

</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled that the box is sealed in shiny plastic wrap.
Many pieces of software, even from the biggest companies, are far
from finished when shipped to stores. Most include at least some
bug, which is computerese for a glitch or feature that doesn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, most common bugs are fixable. The January issue of PC
World features a story called ``Bug Busters: Top cures &AMP; fixes for
software snarls.'' You'll find a list of the 10 worst bugs, tricks
for working around glitches and Web sites where you can download
something called a patch, which is a mini-program that fixes buggy
software.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue of PC World, you'll also find a review of the
top 10 high-resolution digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest generation of digital cameras, the article says
image quality is advancing rapidly _ and so is the list of
features. Among the cameras examined, PC World recommends Toshiba's
PDR-M1 as the best deal. The magazine says this camera offers the
most at the best price ($499).
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Girls are increasingly becoming the target of CD-ROM makers. It
seems every month brings news of yet another title to be marketed
to girls. The latest is Activision's ``Teen Digital Diva.''
Designed for the teen market, this computer CD lets girls create
their own magazine. Players do virtual makeovers, try out clothes,
generate personal horoscopes and take personality quizzes. The CD
is based on Teen magazine and comes with tons of animations, music
clips and color schemes.
</P>
<P>
   If you're serious about your flight simulators, check out the
latest from Electronic Arts called ``WWII Fighters.'' It's a game
based on designs from Jane's, the world-famous military magazine of
the same name. This game lets you fly seven famous WWII fighters.
It also includes lots of information about each of the planes and
its role in history.

   No, the Geminids meteor shower, among the largest in recorded

 &HT;    Holidays a good time to reflect on computers' magic
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Christmas has always been a confusing time for me. I
hate the months of department store carols that lead up to it, am
deeply traumatized by shopping of any kind, and have to fight a
neurotic desire to sing the only song to which I know all the
words: ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.''
</P>
<P>
   But I can't deny the magic and wouldn't if I could. I have the
same love-hate relationship with the gadgets that surround me.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year when I get pleading e-mails asking what
to give a geek for the holidays. Parents, overwhelmed by the
computer wizardry of their kids, feel helpless at a time like this.
And maybe because I have a beard and am getting past the middle of
middle age, some mistake me for Santa's high-tech adviser.
</P>
<P>
   I make a puzzling elf, they soon discover. I just finished
answering a long e-mail from a reader who explained that her child
already had a 400-megahertz computer, a paid-up membership to an
Internet service provider and access to the family's home theater.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how I answered:
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad you asked. I know a way to multiply the value of all
your gadgets and make the computer's power much more amazing. I
know you expect to spend money to do this, and that's good because
my suggestions will cost $23 and change.
</P>
<P>
   The real wonder of technology is understanding how magical it
is, and this is the right time of the year for magic. With that in
mind, I've prepared a Christmas gift list for you.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's work on increasing the power of that computer. For
$13 you can buy a book by Joel N. Shurkin for your child called
``Engines of the Mind: The Evolution of the Computer From
Mainframes to Microprocessors.'' This isn't a geeky book, and even
I know most of the words in it. The publisher is W.W. Norton and
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Once your child reads that book, he'll understand he owns a
computer more powerful than the ones that ran big businesses and
government agencies a decade ago. When he pops in his favorite
video game, he'll appreciate the magical nature of a machine that
creates entire worlds using the words, letters and symbols that
make up a computer program.
</P>
<P>
   It's better he hear it straight from a book that the
400-megahertz computer chip is mostly made of silicon, an element
common as sand. And if you told him the circuits on that chip, all
those tiny transistors, are merely photographic etchings, he might
not believe you.
</P>
<P>
   So for $10 or so, you've turned what was a good computer into a
magical machine. You can't match that for $1,000 down at the
computer store.
</P>
<P>
   If you still have $10 more to spare, we can change the Internet
into something magical, too. We can take those chat groups and Web
pages and wrap them in some paper. The paper I'm talking about
comes from another book called ``Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The
Origins of the Internet.'' It's by Katie Hafner and is published by
Touchstone Books.
</P>
<P>
   Your child will discover that many of the pioneers of the Net
weren't much older than he is. They couldn't point and click in
those days, because the mouse wasn't an option 25 years ago.
Instead, they wrote programs that let them link computers together
and _ like a bunch of harnessed mules _ learn to work together and
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time your child logs onto a chat group and says
nothing much is happening, he may remember there are still enormous
things to be done with a computer that have nothing at all to do
with telling the hangers-on at some chat channel that he's bored
beyond words.
</P>
<P>
   None of this stuff requires a battery and _ even when you factor
in the cost of wrapping paper _ you'll spend less than what a game
from the discount bin costs.
</P>
<P>
   Have a wonderful holiday.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Only Senate can abort shameless coup by House
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Make no mistake: this is a partisan coup in constitutional form.
We have entered dangerous political territory, with potentially
grave consequences for our republic.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment of a president, to be legitimate, must be the
child of necessity. The impeachment of President Bill Clinton is
the bastard of a counterfeit necessity, born of an excuse trying to
pass as a reason.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted to impeach the president not because it had to
but because it could. The vote was more nearly an attempt to
overturn the last presidential election than it was the fulfillment
of a constitutional obligation. This over-reaching is itself closer
to the high crimes the constitution would disallow than are the
misdeeds alleged against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Now only the Senate can abort this coup, and while it is widely
assumed that will be the outcome _ one reason some moderate
Republicans, figuring they were working with a net, cravenly joined
the vote _ it seemed certain, too, just weeks ago that the House
would abandon impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that changed in the interim was a political
calculation. No new charges were brought; no new evidence surfaced.
The public did not take back its opposition to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, under intense pressure from the most extreme
Republicans _ and ramrodded by Majority Whip Tom DeLay, one of the
chamber's claw-and-fang partisans _ GOP moderates came more to fear
primary challenges from their radicalized party's right if they
didn't vote to impeach than to fear general-election punishment if
they did.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute alibiing for that shift was shameless.
</P>
<P>
   The president was held by some to fatal account for giving
slippery answers to 81 questions put to him by Judiciary Committee
Republicans. But the questions were a trap to set the president up
for eventual criminal conviction for perjury. He declined to hang
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Others complained the president was not repentant enough, but he
had repeatedly apologized. The president was being held to further
fatal account for failing to prove his sincerity to members in a
position simply to doubt his sincerity if it did not suit them to
be convinced of it.
</P>
<P>
   The very open question of whether the president committed
perjury, a narrowly-defined offense, is better settled in a
post-presidency trial, if it comes to that, than by this partisan
uprising.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Clinton is at the end what it seemed at the
start: that he lied all over the place in a desperate attempt not
to admit having had sex, sort of, with an intern. It was a shabby
performance _ hanky-panky and lying both _ but if personal
misconduct involving no misuse of presidential office is elevated
to a high crime, the precedent could reduce the presidency, and
with it national stability, to unsustainable frailty.
</P>
<P>
   In refusing to permit a vote on censure and instead impeaching
with an overwhelmingly party-line vote wholly based on a
prosecutor's slanted reading of uncrossexamined testimony, the
House has brought shame on itself and peril to the political
institutions of the nation.

DESERT FISH? UH, SCRATCH THAT.

<P>
   They were going to call it Desert Viper, but the second word had
to begin with an F. Desert Fiper? Generals do not like to sound
foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what about Desert Ferret or Desert Flamingo? OK, maybe
those handles lack that certain something.
</P>
<P>
   But Desert Fox? That was the nickname of Erwin Rommel, the
fabled North African field marshal of Hitler's army.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon wanted to name the campaign against Iraq
desert-something-or-other to be consistent with names for other
operations in the Persian Gulf, like Desert Storm in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Viper may have a ferocious ring, but under Pentagon
protocol, the military command planning the operation _ in this
case, the one based at McGill Air Force Base near Tampa, Fla. _ was
supposed to choose a name beginning with D or F.
</P>
<P>
   Enter a computer data base, known at the Pentagon, the world
capital of acronyms, as the Nicaa. (Don't even ask what that stands
for.) It decided that the second word should begin with an F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiper'' is not in the dictionary, of course, and ``Desert
Fiper'' doesn't have the right ring. So high-level types at McGill
settled on fox. Eventually, Defense Secretary William Cohen
approved the name Desert Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Did anybody think of Rommel, who was portrayed by James Mason in
not one but two Hollywood films?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody,'' said Lt. Col. David Thurston, a spokesman for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``That was not in the mix. I know that it's
been speculated on by various members of the media and others, but
that did not enter into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Schneier, president of the New York Board of Rabbis,
accepted that explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure the powers that be did not associate the name with
the Nazi general,'' he said. ``And as it happens, the choice could
be something positive, because in the aftermath of this campaign,
the term Desert Fox will no longer be associated with a Nazi
officer, but instead will be associated with a determined effort to
stop a mad dictator from acquiring weapons of mass destruction.''

 &HT;    All I want for Christmas is Mustang hall
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When I made out my Christmas wish list this year,
there was one item not just for me, but for the Atlanta automotive
community at-large, especially those people who love Ford Mustangs.
I asked Santa to see what he could do about the location for the
Mustang museum.
</P>
<P>
   You are probably saying, ``What has Santa got to do with this?''
The location has been narrowed down to two finalists, Atlanta and
Orlando. It may take someone with the magic of Santa Claus to
offset the magic Orlando can bring to bear from the Disney
corporation, ABC television and even ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, on the other hand, has history in its favor. If it
weren't for a small group of Georgians who 22 years ago formed what
would grow to become the Mustang Club of America, the Mustang might
not even be in production today. Under the leadership of Dalton,
Ga., resident Bill Dillard, they launched what is today the world's
largest Mustang Club.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's first meeting was April 11, 1976, and by the
time the first Grand National show was held at Stone Mountain Park
that August, the membership had grown to 250 with more than 100
Mustangs and 1,200 enthusiasts in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   International status came quickly with over 600 names, including
many from foreign countries making up the roster at the second
Grand National event in 1977. As the club continued to grow, a
national headquarters was established in 1981 in Lithonia. Today
the Mustang Club of America has its headquarters in Stockbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are over 429 Mustang clubs worldwide and more
than 70,000 members who want to build a permanent facility as a
lasting tribute to their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, 25 metro areas were identified as potential sites.
Dillard said the mayor of Detroit even ``offered for free the land
that Tiger Stadium sits on. (But) there was no way we were going to
take responsibility for the destruction of another American icon,
even if the land was free!''
</P>
<P>
   Now the time is near to open the winning envelope. The ultimate
decision will be made by the Mustang Club of America's board of
directors next year.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 1, Ford Motor Co. donated $1.5 million toward the
museum's construction.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, while he is a fine fellow, I think Mickey Mouse has
enough coins and enough attractions. So, if you have ever owned a
Mustang, thought about owning a Mustang or even had a date in a
Mustang, let the club know how you feel. Its mailing address is
3588 Hwy. 138, Suite 365, Stockbridge, GA 30281 or e-mail at
mustang(at)mustang.org.

 &HT;    Rise of news sites on Web traced to Clinton scandal
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This was the year the Internet joined CNN as one of
the prime places we turn for breaking news.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, his Gap-garbed intern and Kenneth Starr's
tell-all of their sloppy affair get most of the credit. The January
issue of Yahoo! Internet Life tells us why. The magazine's Top of
the Net for 1998 names Sept. 11, the day the Starr report was
released on the Internet, the year's top Net traffic day. The
report sent Internet traffic to an all-time high and, since it was
released in the morning, it likely dropped office productivity to
new lows. ``It was sleazy. It was sad. It was a political
earthquake,'' according to the article's read-in.
</P>
<P>
   The best-of list named the evolution of electronic commerce, Web
communities and portalmania the top Net trends. Portals are the new
name for search engines, which are trying to recast themselves as
more than just Internet on-ramps.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo DiCaprio and Pamela Anderson Lee were the names most
often typed into search engine windows. Leo edged Clinton in a
close race between male cyber-stalkees.
</P>
<P>
   There's less Intel Inside
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the company that makes the chips that power our PCs, is
losing market share.
</P>
<P>
   Intel processors, with their ubiquitous Intel Inside icon, went
from being in about 70 percent of all desktop PCs sold to somewhere
around 40 percent. Advanced Micro Devices has picked up the slack
and now leads the retail PC market for processor chips. Cyrix is
still a distance third.
</P>
<P>
   The chart, and a short explanation, are in the January 1999
issue of PC Computing.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also offers a seven-step cure to reduce the amount of
junk e-mail in your life. Death to Spam offers tips such as hiding
or ``spoofing'' your e-mail address should you post to a newsgroup.
Such postings usually list your e-mail address and leave you open
to software programs that search the Web for addresses. To
``spoof'' your address, just add an easily recognizable phrase to
your address, something that will fool a computer but not a person.
If your address is ed(at)aol.com, ``spoofing'' it would change it
to something like ed.ignorethispart(at)aol.com.
</P>
<P>
   The article recommends simpler tricks. Like just ignoring it.
Like an annoying neighbor, responding to a junk e-mail usually
encourages more spam. Sending a return e-mail to the spam source
often just confirms yours is a valid address.
</P>
<P>
   Blabbing e-secrets
</P>
<P>
   They say telling a secret unburdens you. Depending on who is
involved, it also can louse up a friendship. An Internet site may
have split the difference, a chance to lay bare your conscience
anonymously, a scream in the a cyber-forest.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if the http://www
</P>
<P>
   .secretxchange.com postings are true? At the very least, they're
funny. This week's load-offs include ``Three Day Ordeal: I Glued
Myself to My Easy-Chair'' and ``I Threw Up on a Twenty Topping
Pizza and None of My Fraternity Brothers Even Noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret exchange idea started as a newsletter in 1994, which
led to a book, ``I Forgot to Wear Underwear on a Glass-Bottom
Boat,'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Business cards, updated
</P>
<P>
   They don't really fit into Rolodexes and are a hassle to
transcribe. But with CardScan, a software program from Corex
Technologies, you can scan your business cards and keep them on
your desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   The scanned cards create an interactive card file. If a business
card lists a Web address, CardScan lets you link directly to the
Internet site. Other features include direct modem access to any
fax numbers on the cards, the ability to merge the names with your
word processing program and the chance to add notes to the card
once its in your digital card file.
</P>
<P>
   CardScan's version 4 sells for $79. The software with a
dedicated card scanner sells for $299. The program is available in
office supply and computer stores and online at
http://www.cardscan.com.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter and I visited a new car dealership. She selected
a car and left her car as a trade-in. The papers were not signed
but we agreed on the transaction details. Later that week the
dealership called and said the deal was off. When my daughter
returned the new car, the dealer said her old car had already been
sold! She is still driving the new car. The dealership says maybe
they can make her a new deal on the car. Do we need an attorney?
_Ben Polambi
</P>
<P>
   A: No, you need the Motor Vehicle Board. Before I could finish
relating your story, Heidi Jackson, licensing director of the MVB,
said, ``And they already sold her car.'' This is de-horsing _ as in
``to take your horse (the old car) away.'' The consumer ends up
either paying more for the new car than originally agreed, settling
for a less expensive car, reaching less favorable terms or (imagine
this) with no car at all, leaving both new and used cars with the
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   De-horsing is illegal and expensive (fines up to $10,000 per day
per offense _ hello!). Do not sign anything until you have
contacted the MVB, the agency charged with overseeing car dealers.
After completing the paperwork an investigator will contact the
dealer. ``Sometimes it only takes a call from us,'' says Jackson,
and either the original deal or the old car appears. Magic.Q: I
have been searching diligently for gifts for my Jewish ``secret
pal'' for Hanukkah, but I only find Christmas things. Do you know a
store with inexpensive, appropriate gift items? I also would like
to find Jewish items _ a dreidel (a spinning top), a menorah, etc.
_ to help my students experience all types of holidays. _L.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: Linens 'N Things, Bed Bath &AMP; Beyond and Cost Plus carry
Hanukkah decorative items _ serving pieces, menorahs, tableware.
Stein Mart also has some items.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can we get Flutie Flakes, Doug Flutie's fund-raising
cereal? The proceeds benefit autism research. _J.A.N.
</P>
<P>
   A: Flutie is the talented and attractive quarterback of the
Buffalo Bills. Winner of the Heisman in 1984, Flutie played in the
Canadian Football League for several years. To purchase Flutie
Flakes call (888) BUF-GEAR or go online at buffalobills.com. The
flakes, a product of sports marketing firm PLB Sports, are $10 a
box with shipping but worth every penny, since a portion of the
proceeds goes to the Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation for Autism. Doug
Jr. was diagnosed with the neurological and developmental disorder
three years ago. Need more? How about a Flutie Flakes T-shirt? Send
a check for $15.95 to PLB Sports, P.O. Box 99185, Pittsburgh, Pa.
15233.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My home economics group is having a social, and for one of
the questions in our questionnaire, I want to use the cost of ``The
12 Days of Christmas'' for 1998. If you know where to find this,
could you tell me? _Julia Krizak
</P>
<P>
   A: According to PNC Bank, this year's 12 days of indulgence will
run $58,405.09, about a 6 percent increase over last year's cost.
One of the big winners in 1998? Nine ladies dancing received a
20-percent wage increase over last year, putting the ladies'
salaries higher than men (traditionally) in the standard song.
Sorry, lords-a-leaping, drummers drumming and pipers piping. (It's
high time, some may say.) Unfortunately maids-a-milking are still
receiving minimum wage. In a few years, automation may do in the
maids altogether. For a complete accounting, visit
www.pncbank.com/12 days.

   Q: I have a red wine stain on a light oak table. The stain has
been there since Thanksgiving of 1996 (why hurry?). Is there any
remedy other than sanding the surface and refinishing the table?
Please give me hope. _Sarah Phillips
</P>
<P>
   A: Maybe someone will spill something else and cover it up this
year? Jim Neuberger, furniture magician, says what you do depends
on the finish. You can try a dab of a water/bleach solution (just a
teaspoon of bleach in a cup of water) or Murphy's Oil Soap. Chances
are the tabletop will need a professional. If the table gets a lot
of use, ask the refinisher for a polyurethane finish to prevent
future problems.

<P>
   _ The Colin Powell doll I mentioned recently includes a display
of the America-- Division patch, not ``America-- .'' Mea culpa. The
Americal Division is the only Army division created outside the
continental United States and south of the equator, according to
Cecil A. Green of the Public Affairs Office, III Corps and Fort
Hood. Originally formed in 1942 in New Caledonia, the name
``Americal'' derives from ``American Forces in New Caledonia.'' The
blue division patch has four stars, representing the Southern
Cross, the dominant constellation in the Southern Hemisphere. Thank
you to the soldiers who served in this division in World War II and
Vietnam.

   _ Tips from ``The Old Farmer's Almanac Traditional Holiday
Recipes'' for those poinsettias decking your halls: Keep the soil
evenly moist and place the plant in a sunny location (65 to 72
degrees), away from drafts and frosty windows. If a poinsettia
drops a few leaves when you bring it into the house, check the
light level and the humidity. The air may be too dry.

 &HT;    Computer games don't have to cost anything
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If holiday shopping has cut into your budget for
computer games, you needn't fear withdrawal. Many games are
available free for the downloading on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these games fall into the shareware category: You
download them free and then are expected to pay if you like and
continue to use the game. Many of the shareware games are
full-blown versions, while others have only a few episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Other games available for free downloading are demonstration
versions of commercial games. In that case, the games are usually
crippled to one degree or another. Either you get only a few
episodes of an elaborate game, or some of the features of the game
have been disabled. Think of these commercial demos as, at worst, a
good way to preview a game before making the sometimes-expensive
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Our first Web site has a mixture of both types _ shareware and
commercial demos. The site is called the Ultimate Game Download
site and you'll find it at http://www.skyex.com/rkonline/dwnld.htm.
Like many programs available for download on the Net, these games
come in a file that is compressed into something called a ZIP file.
That means you'll need software to decompress the ZIP file.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer users already have such a program, but if you
don't have one, just use the term ``ZIP'' as a search word and pick
from the list of unzipping programs at a site like those at
http://www.shareware.com and
</P>
<P>
   http://www.download.com.
</P>
<P>
   The ease of downloading from the Ultimate Game Download site
varies considerably from game to game. One reason for that is most
of the game downloads are not actually stored at the computer that
holds the Web site. Instead, the games are stored on sites
maintained by their publishers or owners. Some of these sites are
extremely busy and _ in extreme cases _ may refuse to make the
connection. In that case, you'll be forced to try again.
</P>
<P>
   To the good, the site has literally dozens of games, including
commercial demos of some of the most popular games.
</P>
<P>
   You'll surely want to bookmark the next site _ Game Downer.
Download games and sites at
http://starcreations.com/gamedowner/ga-dwn01.htm. You can search
for games alphabetically here, making it easier to find a specific
game. Again, most games are not stored on the site, so download
times and availability may vary.
</P>
<P>
   This is just a sampling of the game sites you can find online.
To find a list of literally hundreds of sites that offer downloads,
try using your favorite search engine with the search terms ``game
download'' and, if you try them all, you'll be so busy downloading
you won't have time to play.

 &HT;    Apple giving it the old college try
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Apple's heyday, universities and colleges were a
bedrock of support. The company sold Macs to top universities at a
steep discount, and students became Apple Computer enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Many in academia remain Apple Computer fans, but support for the
company has seriously eroded over the past several years. Macs no
longer dominate college campuses. Some colleges, such as Yale, are
even trying to steer students away from Macs.
</P>
<P>
   Now Apple Computer is making a renewed push into higher
education. It has restored its advisory council of college
officials and announced a new program designed to encourage
students to develop software for Macs.
</P>
<P>
   And the company has created focus groups of students, deans and
professors. One of the things these focus groups have been looking
at is a new, low-cost portable computer Apple Computer hopes to
release sometime next year. This portable will be marketed
especially to the college market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to wade back into higher education,'' Interim
Chief Executive Steve Jobs told a technology conference last week.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Apple Computer reigned supreme on college campuses,
and Jobs was responsible for that. During his first tenure at Apple
Computer during the 1980s, he targeted both universities and their
students as an important market for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs created a unique partnership with higher education called
the Apple University Consortium. It consisted of representatives
from 24 elite campuses.
</P>
<P>
   These colleges agreed to buy thousands of Macs at prices up to
50 percent off retail. It was a winning combination that helped
establish the Mac in its early years.
</P>
<P>
   But then Apple Computer began to take colleges for granted, and
it lost much of its share in this market. Some are skeptical Apple
Computer can regain much of the lost ground. But the company is
determined to give it the old college try.

 &HT;    Check the movie sites before you head out
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not clear when going to the movies became part of
the Christmas ritual, right up there with eggnog, mistletoe and
caroling.
</P>
<P>
   If movie reviews just don't do it for you or the malls are too
crowded, take a peek at this season's hottest offerings on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Major motion pictures seem to be the one group left that doesn't
understand packing as many applets, plug-ins and other bells and
whistles into one place does not necessarily a good Web site make.
While special effects may be a thrill in the theaters, they can be
a turnoff to movie lovers checking out movies on their home PCs.
Most of the new movie sites are inventive and informative, but be
prepared to download special tools or reboot your browser. And if
all else fails, you can always just see the movie in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who's ever had even a brief encounter with America Online
will be intrigued by the title of the new Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan film
``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   The title is a direct lift from the quasi-cheery message that
greets AOL users when they log on. The site at
http://www.youvegotmail.com offers pretty standard movie site fare
but includes some of the e-mail exchanges between the lead
characters, who go by the online screen names of Shopgirl and
NY152.
</P>
<P>
   The site also invites people who have met online to send in
their stories of real-life Net romance, which gives the movie's
plot a little more credibility as well as interesting reading. The
one trouble with the site is that it is an odd combination of a
marketing site and a creative site. It's a strange user experience,
but you'll learn something about the movie and about love online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' (http://www.prince-of-egypt.com), the
big, elaborate animated feature from DreamWorks, has an equally
big, elaborate animated Web site that really is something to see.
There's very little pointing and clicking; users can just sit and
watch the story unfold, almost like an actual movie trailer. The
site is available in several languages and offers a study guide,
special visual downloads (including a desktop music player), the
trailer for the film and a collection of images from the movie. The
brief synopsis of the film will also help parents and kids learn
more about the biblical characters before or after seeing the film.
This is a lovely site for a visually beautiful film.
</P>
<P>
   Trekkers, as they like to be called now, have probably already
bookmarked the site for the newest Star Trek feature, ``Star Trek
Insurrection.'' The builders of the Star Trek site clearly know
their audience, and the site is meant to replicate, if you will,
the computer images on the bridge of the Enterprise. This site
really is a trekker's paradise with creative tidbits such as the
``Briefing From the Federation Regarding the Prime Directive,''
desktop pictures, cast biographies (as if fans didn't already know
everything there is to know about Patrick Stewart and company),
audio interviews and more. This is a fans' site, clearly designed
for devotees of the ``Star Trek'' series and the inside references
to the series. The variety of interviews and pictures make this an
excellent promotional vehicle for the film as well as a nice
stand-alone site.
</P>
<P>
   For families that can't get enough and other grown-ups who
wonder what all the fuss is about, there is the Web site for the
Rugrats movie at http://www.rugratsmovie.com. It's easy to spend
hours on the Rugrats site, playing games, meeting the characters
(from baby Tommy's point of view), downloading screen savers and
just cooing over the characters. Since Rugrats is part of
Nickelodeon, the cable kids channel, the site is very careful to
avoid pitching products or trying to sell things to kids surfing
the site. Advertisements are clearly marked, and clicking on an ad
brings up a warning that users are about to view an ad. It's easy
to spend hours here bonding with the characters without a lot of
complicated Web gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S NEW
</P>
<P>
   Royal Archive: Prince William: This comprehensive site is packed
with info on the young royal, from his height (an impressive 6 feet
1) to his dog (a creature named Widgeon), royal genealogy, the

 &HT;    Celebrating the season along with new cycles
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ My son Kristofor and I have been together for
31
</P>
<P>
   Christmases now, and we've run the gift wish list gamut from
Pooh bears and model trains to computers and cars. Even though I'll
always miss the little guy in the footy pajamas who would scuffle
into my bedroom at daybreak to announce:
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun is up and Sandy Claus has been here,'' this Christmas
promises to be the best one ever.
</P>
<P>
   Kristofor was only four months old the first time Santa came to
call. He didn't quite know what to make of the colored lights and a
tree growing in the living room, but his baby eyes danced with
excitement anyway. That was the year his grandmother gave him a
giant stuffed tiger. It was a love match at first sight and by
afternoon the pair were napping together under the Christmas tree -
the boy sprawled on top in guileless baby sleep, drooling in the
tiger's ear.
</P>
<P>
   By the time his second Christmas rolled around, Kristofor had
forgotten all about the first one so his father and I decided to
make it a big surprise. We waited until he was tucked in for the
night before putting up the tree and hauling presents down from the
attic. Somewhere around the house I have a faded Polaroid of a
curly-haired toddler on Christmas morning, all zipped up in a fuzzy
bunny sleeper and frozen in his tracks at the living room door as
he catches his first glimpse of the lighted tree.
</P>
<P>
   A second shot shows him just moments later reaching for a
particularly shiny
</P>
<P>
   ornament that has caught his fancy. The final shot is of a
puzzled little boy with his mouth in a wide-open ``O'' as he stares
at the pieces of the ornament scattered on the floor at the foot of
the tree.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, for his two-year-old Christmas, there was an easel
with a sketch pad and a king-size box of tempera paints. On the
first warm day I slipped one of his father's old T-shirts over his
sun suit and helped him set up a studio in the back yard. He said
he was going to paint the pine trees. I told him I thought that was
a dandy idea. A while later I came back to check on his progress.
There was no paint on the sketch pad but he had indeed painted the
pine trees - some yellow and a whole lot blue. It never occurred to
me to ask the obvious question in advance.
</P>
<P>
   This was also the year of the shiny red fire engine - the one
that boasted two removable ladders, and ran on a car battery with
enough juice to take him a few times around the neighborhood
fighting fires and rescuing treed cats before
</P>
<P>
   it needed recharging.
</P>
<P>
   When Kristofor was 3, he and his dad did a back-to-nature thing
and went out into the country to cut their own tree. I have a
picture of that too. He's the short one with the swagger and a
hatchet tucked into the hammer loop of his overalls. He says that
was a great year because in addition to helping his dad cut the big
tree, he was allowed to cut a sapling (which he now feels badly
about) for his very own to decorate any way he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   We've had some memorable Christmases along the way. One of our
favorites was
</P>
<P>
   spent in Cortina D'Ampezzo, a storybook village in the Italian
Alps. We remember window shopping and listening to the church bells
on Christmas Eve. No glitz just the snow and some friendly people
wishing us Merry Christmas in Italian. We answered in kind.
</P>
<P>
   As the years passed, it was easy to tell the age of the boy by
the presents under the tree. They ranged from Playskool filling
stations to archery equipment with straw targets that mildewed in
the southern humidity. Soon, chemistry sets and ant farms had given
way to requests for computers and car insurance.
</P>
<P>
   And almost before I knew it, Christmas became a brief vacation
to be spent at
</P>
<P>
   home. The holiday season signaled the arrival of duffels of
dirty laundry and a
</P>
<P>
   college boy who slept until noon and spent the rest of his time
emptying the
</P>
<P>
   refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Christmases through the years have been good for us, but this
one is going to
</P>
<P>
   be the best of them all. This year I'll be packing up the
presents and driving to Pennsylvania to spend the holidays with my
son, his fiancee, and the family
</P>
<P>
   we're going to be marrying into.
</P>
<P>
   And so the cycle begins again. New wish lists, new generations,
and eventually a new Pooh bear or two - and I intend to be the lady
carrying the tiger.

 &HT;    All things considered, I'd rather use a mouse
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Under the heading of ``What Will They Think of Next,''
we have for our examination and amusement today the Cruise Cat from
Cirque, a touchpad device aimed at the Internet addict.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruise Cat is a modified touchpad-pointing device, a thin
little pad that connects to a serial port and does not cancel out
or confuse your mouse. It simply competes with it for your
attention.
</P>
<P>
   In case you have no experience with a touchpad device _ they
have become rather common as built-in pointing devices on laptops _
it is simply a little panel on which you lightly move your finger
to control the mouse, tap gently for a single click and double-tap
for a double-click.
</P>
<P>
   They work as well as a mouse. Whether you would prefer one to a
mouse is another matter. Personally, I have seen no alternative
device that suits me as well as a mouse. This is due in large part,
certainly, to the fact I learned to use a mouse years ago and it is
second nature.
</P>
<P>
   It was interesting to see the reaction of many of the newsroom
staff when the personal computer, in the form of Macintoshes, made
its appearance. Those who had never used a mouse had no end of
trouble for a while. Some never got used to them and wound up with
trackballs by preference. I find trackballs to be a minor torture
device.
</P>
<P>
   For me, touchpads are a decent alternative to a mouse, better
than trackballs and a lot better than those stupid stubby sticks
they put in the middle of laptop keyboards. However, if a mouse is
available, I'll use that in preference to anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruise Cat has some interesting embellishments _ chief among
them the gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this is cute. If, for instance, you want to look
at your bookmarks, you draw a little B and voila! here come your
bookmarks. If you want to close the active program, you describe an
X with your finger on the pad.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a fatal flaw here. You can't just suddenly
scribble an X on the pad and do anything but move the mouse around.
First, you must place a finger in a depression to one side of the
screen and wait for a little image of the Cruise Cat to appear.
Then you make your symbol on that image. Now, if you compare the
act of pressing the finger into a depression to produce a little
box on which you then draw an X to the simple act of seizing the
mouse, moving the cursor to the Close box with a simple little
wrist movement and clicking a button, you can see we are not
talking convenience here. We're talking gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruise Cat is doubtless the spawn of some wunderkind at
Cirque Corp. who conceived of yet another way to market the Glide
Point pad. In fact, the Cruise Cat has no particular attachment to
the Internet. You can create your own gestures, and they will work
anywhere, in any program I tried. None, however, turns out to be as
easy as using the mouse for the same task.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cruise Cat sounds really catchy, does it not? We can
carry this idea almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Why not give it a few built-in gestures to accomplish basic
tasks in Word 7 such as inserting the date or saving the file, fix
it all up and market it as Word Wompus? Tie in a few calculations
and presto! Excel Eel.
</P>
<P>
   Two or more can play this game.

 &HT;    Anyone can exterminate pesky bugs
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   IN PRINT
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled that the box is sealed in shiny plastic wrap.
Many pieces of software, even from the biggest companies, are far
from finished when shipped to stores. Most include at least some
bug, which is computerese for a glitch or feature that doesn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, most common bugs are fixable. The January issue of PC
World features a story called ``Bug Busters: Top cures &AMP; fixes for
software snarls.'' You'll find a list of the 10 worst bugs, tricks
for working around glitches and Web sites where you can download
something called a patch, which is a mini-program that fixes buggy
software.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue of PC World, you'll also find a review of the
top 10 high-resolution digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest generation of digital cameras, the article says
image quality is advancing rapidly _ and so is the list of
features. Among the cameras examined, PC World recommends Toshiba's
PDR-M1 as the best deal. The magazine says this camera offers the
most at the best price ($499).
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Girls are increasingly becoming the target of CD-ROM makers. It
seems every month brings news of yet another title to be marketed
to girls. The latest is Activision's ``Teen Digital Diva.''
Designed for the teen market, this computer CD lets girls create
their own magazine. Players do virtual makeovers, try out clothes,
generate personal horoscopes and take personality quizzes. The CD
is based on Teen magazine and comes with tons of animations, music
clips and color schemes.
</P>
<P>
   If you're serious about your flight simulators, check out the
latest from Electronic Arts called ``WWII Fighters.'' It's a game
based on designs from Jane's, the world-famous military magazine of
the same name. This game lets you fly seven famous WWII fighters.
It also includes lots of information about each of the planes and
its role in history.

 &HT;    Holidays a good time to reflect on computers' magic
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Christmas has always been a confusing time for me. I
hate the months of department store carols that lead up to it, am
deeply traumatized by shopping of any kind, and have to fight a
neurotic desire to sing the only song to which I know all the
words: ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.''
</P>
<P>
   But I can't deny the magic and wouldn't if I could. I have the
same love-hate relationship with the gadgets that surround me.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year when I get pleading e-mails asking what
to give a geek for the holidays. Parents, overwhelmed by the
computer wizardry of their kids, feel helpless at a time like this.
And maybe because I have a beard and am getting past the middle of
middle age, some mistake me for Santa's high-tech adviser.
</P>
<P>
   I make a puzzling elf, they soon discover. I just finished
answering a long e-mail from a reader who explained that her child
already had a 400-megahertz computer, a paid-up membership to an
Internet service provider and access to the family's home theater.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how I answered:
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad you asked. I know a way to multiply the value of all
your gadgets and make the computer's power much more amazing. I
know you expect to spend money to do this, and that's good because
my suggestions will cost $23 and change.
</P>
<P>
   The real wonder of technology is understanding how magical it
is, and this is the right time of the year for magic. With that in
mind, I've prepared a Christmas gift list for you.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's work on increasing the power of that computer. For
$13 you can buy a book by Joel N. Shurkin for your child called
``Engines of the Mind: The Evolution of the Computer From
Mainframes to Microprocessors.'' This isn't a geeky book, and even
I know most of the words in it. The publisher is W.W. Norton and
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Once your child reads that book, he'll understand he owns a
computer more powerful than the ones that ran big businesses and
government agencies a decade ago. When he pops in his favorite
video game, he'll appreciate the magical nature of a machine that
creates entire worlds using the words, letters and symbols that
make up a computer program.
</P>
<P>
   It's better he hear it straight from a book that the
400-megahertz computer chip is mostly made of silicon, an element
common as sand. And if you told him the circuits on that chip, all
those tiny transistors, are merely photographic etchings, he might
not believe you.
</P>
<P>
   So for $10 or so, you've turned what was a good computer into a
magical machine. You can't match that for $1,000 down at the
computer store.
</P>
<P>
   If you still have $10 more to spare, we can change the Internet
into something magical, too. We can take those chat groups and Web
pages and wrap them in some paper. The paper I'm talking about
comes from another book called ``Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The
Origins of the Internet.'' It's by Katie Hafner and is published by
Touchstone Books.
</P>
<P>
   Your child will discover that many of the pioneers of the Net
weren't much older than he is. They couldn't point and click in
those days, because the mouse wasn't an option 25 years ago.
Instead, they wrote programs that let them link computers together
and _ like a bunch of harnessed mules _ learn to work together and
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time your child logs onto a chat group and says
nothing much is happening, he may remember there are still enormous
things to be done with a computer that have nothing at all to do
with telling the hangers-on at some chat channel that he's bored
beyond words.
</P>
<P>
   None of this stuff requires a battery and _ even when you factor
in the cost of wrapping paper _ you'll spend less than what a game
from the discount bin costs.
</P>
<P>
   Have a wonderful holiday.

 &HT;    Time to take crash course in brakes
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How do you know when you need new brakes? What is that
squealing noise when stopping or the chirping noises while still on
the move? Why does the brake pedal vibrate when pushing on it to
stop?
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few of the questions that come up about brakes.
</P>
<P>
   I have a rule for teaching; I won't tell anyone how to fix
something before explaining how it works. So, sit back and let's
take a crash course on brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are several combinations of brake systems, they
all basically work the same. The parts of the system attached to
each wheel that actually stops the wheels are called either brake
rotors or brake drums.
</P>
<P>
   A brake drum looks like a heavy metal cake pan and is commonly
made of cast iron. Unless the car is very old, they are only used
on the rear wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Brake rotors, also called ``discs,'' are flat metal cast iron
disks and vary in thickness depending on the size of the vehicle.
They are used on the front wheels and are becoming more predominant
in rear brake use.
</P>
<P>
   Either the brake rotor or drum rotates with the wheel. The
stopping action of the wheel is achieved when the friction material
attached to a brake shoe (for drum brakes) or brake pad (disk
brakes) is forced against the spinning drum or disk. There are two
brake shoes or brake pads used at each wheel.
</P>
<P>
   All brake systems also must have a way to move the shoes or
rotors against the drum or disk. This is accomplished
hydraulically, with brake fluid, which is contained in a closed
system of cylinders, plungers, seals and tubing. Let's talk about
how all of this works, starting at the brake pedal and working
down.
</P>
<P>
   When you step on the pedal, it moves a rod that pushes a plunger
inside a cylinder, which in turn moves the brake fluid into a
network of tubes or brake lines. The principle is the same as the
hypodermic syringe a doctor or nurse uses to give you an injection.
</P>
<P>
   In need of assistance
</P>
<P>
   The pressurized fluid moves through the brake lines into another
cylinder mounted near the wheel, where the fluid pushes against
another plunger (piston).
</P>
<P>
   In a disc-brake system, the fluid pressure moves the piston
against the back of the brake pad, forcing it against the spinning
rotor. This action causes the wheel to stop.
</P>
<P>
   On drum brakes, the piston pushes against the brake shoe, which
is thrust against the inside of the rolling brake drum, stopping it
and the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Most brake systems use some form of power assist unit. The most
common type gets its help from the engine.
</P>
<P>
   However, power assist is not a frequent source of trouble.
Anti-lock brake systems also are separate so I'll save them for
later.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, I'll answer some specific questions about brakes. You
might want to keep this column so you can refer back to the terms
I've used today.

SOCIAL INSECURITY: POOF! YOU CAN RETIRE RICH. 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine you could save the Social Security system from
bankruptcy by raising every American's retirement check _ without
increasing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the radical cure proposed by Martin Feldstein, a chief
economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan and a professor of
economics at Harvard University, who made his case earlier this
month at a conference sponsored by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the system needs to be fixed quickly,
because otherwise it will begin to run out of money early in the
next century as the baby-boom generation reaches retirement age.
But the obvious solutions _ reducing benefits, raising taxes and
postponing retirement _ are unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is privatization, which calls for part of the
current payroll tax to be steered into private retirement accounts
that would be invested in potentially high-yield stocks and bonds.
The income from these accounts could then ease the burden on the
existing Social Security system. But most privatization plans scare
politicians because they would expose retirees to the vagaries of
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Feldstein, who proposes privatization with a clever twist.
His plan calls for keeping the existing Social Security system
intact. But he would also create private investment accounts for
all workers, equal to 2 percent of their Social Security earnings,
paid for with general government revenues. At retirement, workers
would hand over the accumulated balance in their accounts to an
investment or insurance company in exchange for a lifetime annuity:
a guaranteed annual income until death.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein would pay for these private accounts by tapping about
a trillion dollars in projected federal surpluses over the next
decade. Also, workers would keep only 25 percent of the annual
income from their annuity. The balance would be returned to the
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's major selling point is that workers come out ahead no
matter how poorly their investments fare. They will begin receiving
checks at retirement equal to the amount paid by the current system
plus 25 percent of the income from their retirement annuity. The
plan would thus sidestep the criticism of other privatization
plans, most of which rely on cutting benefits, raising taxes or
subjecting retirees to the risk that their checks will sink below
current levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan reflects the magic of compound interest,'' said Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas. (Gramm has proposed a similar idea.) Henry
Aaron and Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institution have
called the plan ``imprudent,'' pointing to the large financial
risks and even larger political risks. Many of the House and Senate
onlookers at the session came away thinking more about magic than
imprudence, putting Feldstein's idea at the forefront of the
privatization debate.
</P>
<P>
   But do the numbers add up?
</P>
<P>
   According to the nonpartisan actuaries at the Social Security
Administration, the answer is sort of, kind of, maybe. In an
analysis completed this month, they concluded that the plan would
erase nearly all of the projected deficit using Feldstein's
optimistic assumptions about the profit that workers would earn on
their investment accounts and about the fees they would pay to
investment funds for administering their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But when the actuaries adopted more conservative assumptions _
estimates more in line with those of independent analysts _ the
Feldstein plan closes about two-thirds of the projected deficit.
Congress would need to close the remaining gap with tax hikes and
spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The actuarial report appears kind to Feldstein, but their
analysis also exposes the proposal's hidden pitfalls. The plan
would siphon trillions of dollars from the federal Treasury, money
that could otherwise have been used to pay off the federal debt. A
larger federal debt, in turn, requires the government to spend more
on interest payments. But Feldstein argues ``that there is no
chance that Congress would use those trillions to pay down the
debt.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Aaron and Reischauer point out, the money spent to
create private accounts is money that Congress can no longer spend
on other pressing needs _ including Medicare, whose financial
predicament is far more alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also warn that if the projected surpluses disappear,
then the government would have made reckless promises to pay
pensions that it could no longer afford.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the issue of fairness. Feldstein maintains,
correctly, that virtually every retiree's income would rise under
his plan. But the increases would raise benefits more for high-wage
workers than for low-wage workers. Critics like Aaron and
Reischauer see no reason for Congress to risk increasing the
deficit decades into the future in the service of a plan that
primarily rewards the rich.
</P>
<P>
   For many critics, the most ominous threats are political.
Consider a middle-income worker 10 years after the plan takes hold.
He notes that 12 percent of his earnings are dedicated to a public
system that produces only a trickle at retirement. But the 2
percent of his earnings that go into his private investment account
grow at a gaudy 7 percent or more a year.
</P>
<P>
   The public account looks like a poor deal because, unlike the
private accounts, it is saddled with paying off the debt from the
early years of Social Security, when the system paid far more in
benefits than it collected from workers in taxes. But economists
note that if the private accounts paid their share of this debt
burden, they too would look like lousy investments.
</P>
<P>
   However misguided, many people will demand that more of their
payroll taxes go into the high-flying private accounts. But that
would whittle away at the public system _ the part of program that
makes disproportionately large payments to low-wage workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the decision about revamping Social Security depends
as much on politics as on economics. The country must decide how
much of its income it wants to transfer to retirees. Feldstein says
the elderly ought to collect more. Critics like Reischauer and
Aaron think that as the number of workers shrinks relative to the
number of retirees, as predicted, the work force can ill afford to
spend more. Once that question is resolved, the rest is financial
engineering.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter and I visited a new car dealership. She selected
a car and left her car as a trade-in. The papers were not signed
but we agreed on the transaction details. Later that week the
dealership called and said the deal was off. When my daughter
returned the new car, the dealer said her old car had already been
sold! She is still driving the new car. The dealership says maybe
they can make her a new deal on the car. Do we need an attorney?
_Ben Polambi
</P>
<P>
   A: No, you need the Motor Vehicle Board. Before I could finish
relating your story, Heidi Jackson, licensing director of the MVB,
said, ``And they already sold her car.'' This is de-horsing _ as in
``to take your horse (the old car) away.'' The consumer ends up
either paying more for the new car than originally agreed, settling
for a less expensive car, reaching less favorable terms or (imagine
this) with no car at all, leaving both new and used cars with the
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   De-horsing is illegal and expensive (fines up to $10,000 per day
per offense _ hello!). Do not sign anything until you have
contacted the MVB, the agency charged with overseeing car dealers.
After completing the paperwork an investigator will contact the
dealer. ``Sometimes it only takes a call from us,'' says Jackson,
and either the original deal or the old car appears. Magic.Q: I
have been searching diligently for gifts for my Jewish ``secret
pal'' for Hanukkah, but I only find Christmas things. Do you know a
store with inexpensive, appropriate gift items? I also would like
to find Jewish items _ a dreidel (a spinning top), a menorah, etc.
_ to help my students experience all types of holidays. _L.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: Linens 'N Things, Bed Bath &AMP; Beyond and Cost Plus carry
Hanukkah decorative items _ serving pieces, menorahs, tableware.
Stein Mart also has some items.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can we get Flutie Flakes, Doug Flutie's fund-raising
cereal? The proceeds benefit autism research. _J.A.N.
</P>
<P>
   A: Flutie is the talented and attractive quarterback of the
Buffalo Bills. Winner of the Heisman in 1984, Flutie played in the
Canadian Football League for several years. To purchase Flutie
Flakes call (888) BUF-GEAR or go online at buffalobills.com. The
flakes, a product of sports marketing firm PLB Sports, are $10 a
box with shipping but worth every penny, since a portion of the
proceeds goes to the Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation for Autism. Doug
Jr. was diagnosed with the neurological and developmental disorder
three years ago. Need more? How about a Flutie Flakes T-shirt? Send
a check for $15.95 to PLB Sports, P.O. Box 99185, Pittsburgh, Pa.
15233.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My home economics group is having a social, and for one of
the questions in our questionnaire, I want to use the cost of ``The
12 Days of Christmas'' for 1998. If you know where to find this,
could you tell me? _Julia Krizak
</P>
<P>
   A: According to PNC Bank, this year's 12 days of indulgence will
run $58,405.09, about a 6 percent increase over last year's cost.
One of the big winners in 1998? Nine ladies dancing received a
20-percent wage increase over last year, putting the ladies'
salaries higher than men (traditionally) in the standard song.
Sorry, lords-a-leaping, drummers drumming and pipers piping. (It's
high time, some may say.) Unfortunately maids-a-milking are still
receiving minimum wage. In a few years, automation may do in the
maids altogether. For a complete accounting, visit
www.pncbank.com/12 days.
</P>

   Q: I have a red wine stain on a light oak table. The stain has
been there since Thanksgiving of 1996 (why hurry?). Is there any
remedy other than sanding the surface and refinishing the table?
Please give me hope. _Sarah Phillips
</P>
<P>
   A: Maybe someone will spill something else and cover it up this
year? Jim Neuberger, furniture magician, says what you do depends
on the finish. You can try a dab of a water/bleach solution (just a
teaspoon of bleach in a cup of water) or Murphy's Oil Soap. Chances
are the tabletop will need a professional. If the table gets a lot
of use, ask the refinisher for a polyurethane finish to prevent
future problems.

   _ The Colin Powell doll I mentioned recently includes a display
of the America-- Division patch, not ``America-- .'' Mea culpa. The
Americal Division is the only Army division created outside the
continental United States and south of the equator, according to
Cecil A. Green of the Public Affairs Office, III Corps and Fort
Hood. Originally formed in 1942 in New Caledonia, the name
``Americal'' derives from ``American Forces in New Caledonia.'' The
blue division patch has four stars, representing the Southern
Cross, the dominant constellation in the Southern Hemisphere. Thank
you to the soldiers who served in this division in World War II and
Vietnam.

   _ Tips from ``The Old Farmer's Almanac Traditional Holiday
Recipes'' for those poinsettias decking your halls: Keep the soil
evenly moist and place the plant in a sunny location (65 to 72
degrees), away from drafts and frosty windows. If a poinsettia
drops a few leaves when you bring it into the house, check the
light level and the humidity. The air may be too dry.

 &HT;    After 50 years, this popular game has legs (and eyes, ears and a
proboscis)
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's hard to believe, but we've had Cooties for
50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Not the kind you get from kissing girls. I'm talking about the
plastic ones that come disassembled in a cardboard box.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro, manufacturer of Cooties, is celebrating the golden
anniversary of the venerable children's game this year by doing a
complete makeover on the bugs that are central to the game.
</P>
<P>
   And while I'm not much of a traditionalist, I kind of wish they
had left well enough alone.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hasbro, a Minneapolis mailman carved the first
Cooties from wood in 1948. He was trying to design a fishing lure,
but Cooties attracted more kids than carp.
</P>
<P>
   The mailman carved by hand 40,000 wooden Cootie games for
children over the next year, and three years a toy company used
machinery to make 1.2 million of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro estimates about 50 million Cootie games have been
purchased in the 50-year history of the toy.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1998 Cootie is clearly different from its 1948 ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   The original Cootie had a plastic body with holes for six
plastic legs and a head. Each head had holes where two antennae,
two eyes and a proboscis could be inserted.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played by rolling a die and adding parts to your
Cootie according to what you rolled. Ones were bodies, sixes were
legs and so on. The first player with a complete Cootie won.
</P>
<P>
   Except for body color, each of the four Cooties that came with
the game were the same.
</P>
<P>
   The new Cooties are more varied. They can be built with roller
skates or gloved fingers; hair bows or antennae; kissing lips or
buck teeth.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the changes deprive the Cooties of some of their homely
charm.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fun of playing Cootie with my brothers and sister as
a child was making fun of the pathetic half-built Cooties in the
middle of the game.
</P>
<P>
   There were three-legged cripple Cooties, and cockeyed Cooties,
and stone-deaf Cooties and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The new Cooties are trying so hard to be cute, it's no fun
trashing them.
</P>
<P>
   My 8-year-old daughter played with the 1998 Cooties several
times over a recent weekend before losing interest. That's more
attention than she gives stuffed animals, but much less attention
than she gives anything with a video screen.
</P>
<P>
   She proclaimed Cooties ``OK,'' but they were no match for
Nintendo 64.

 &HT;    HEALTH: Scientists working to change genetic makeup of mosquito
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Scientists in Texas and elsewhere are working to
change the genetic makeup of a malaria-causing mosquito whose bite
kills nearly 3 million people a year worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to build a benign mosquito is considered a scientific
long shot, but the stakes are enormous. As many as 500 million
people a year in tropical Mexico, Central and South American,
Africa and Asia are infected by the Anopheles mosquitoes, according
to the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making progress quicker than we thought we could,'' said
Greg Lanzaro, a medical entomologist at the University of Texas'
Center for Tropical Diseases in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to recent genetic advances and a discovery by Lanzaro,
some mosquito project scientists say the effort might move out of
the laboratory and into the field by 2003, 15 years sooner than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a paradigm shift in approach, and experimental of course,
but so were insecticides at one time,'' said Anthony James, a
moleucular geneticist at the University of California at Irvine who
is working with Lanzaro and other project scientists. ``And we're
running out of insecticides because the mosquitoes are resistant to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say if altering mosquito genes to prevent the bugs
from spreading malaria worked in Africa, where Anopheles gambiae _
one of about 60 species of the mosquitoes _ carries the deadliest
form of the disease, the remedy could be swiftly shifted to the
Americas and to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Success not only would eliminate a scourge that's plagued
humanity for thousands of years, but could lead to similar
campaigns against other insects that spread killer diseases such as
yellow fever and dengue.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a way to engineer insects might even provide clues for
ongoing efforts to use gene therapy to reverse inherited genetic
defects in people. The attempt to build a better mosquito is not
without critics. Andrew Spielman of the Harvard School of Public
Health argues that the effort cannot succeed because genetic
engineering of even thousands of Anopheles mosquitoes, which were
then turned loose to breed in the wild, could not be sustained
through many generations of their descendents.
</P>
<P>
   Nature provides no guarantee that specific genes in any species
will be transmitted from parent to offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a major challenge of making Anopheles mosquitoes benign
is not only to find genes to prevent them from transmitting the
parasite that causes malaria, but a mechanism to insure that the
anti-parasite genes can be spread widely among their offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But, this year, researchers in the 5-year-old Anopheles
improvement project have made significant advances toward both
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at New York and Duke universities and the National
Institutes of Health have identified two characteristics that
prevent some mosquitoes from transmitting the parasite. They're
looking for the genes responsible.
</P>
<P>
   James, and a colleague at the University of Notre Dame,
meanwhile, have identified genetic mechanisms called transposable
elements, in houseflies and Mediterranean fruit flies, that might
be used to force transmission of engineered genes from parent
mosquitoes to their offspring.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers demonstrated the usefulness of the transposable
elements, also called ``gene driver systems,'' by using them to
change the eye color in 10 generations of Aedes aegypti, a mosquito
that transmits yellow fever.
</P>
<P>
   Lanzaro also has removed a potential roadblock. Previous
research suggested that the three known subgroups of Anopheles
gambiae don't interbreed. Collecting some of them in Mali, in West
Africa, and analyzing their genetic make-up, Lanzaro recently
discovered that two of the three subgroups do mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a pattern that suggests there's lots of mating
going on,'' Lanzaro said.
</P>
<P>
   While some project scientists hunt for anti-parasite genes,
others are considering alternative approaches.
</P>
<P>
   James, for instance, favors transplanting a gene from a mouse's
immune system into Anopheles gambiae to make proteins to kill the
parasites. Others are trying to figure out why the mosquito's
immune system doesn't attack the parasite, and find ways to force
it to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best solution will be adopted, or maybe two or three of
them,'' James said. ``It's hard to say what the preferred way will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenging as it is, the researchers see the effort as easier
than trying to bring the political stability and sophisticated
health care required for a sustained malaria control effort to the
poor countries of the tropical world most afflicted by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is very efficiently keeping malaria down,'' Lanzaro
said. ``If local authorities uncover transmissions, they spray
quickly. But it's getting worse every year in Central and South
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get this to work in (tropical) Africa, we can pretty
much get it to work anywhere, because the problems there are
formidable. They're very poor, there's little health infrastructure
and there's political instability.''

 &HT;    Inaugurating the gallery
 &HT;    By Janet Wilson
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lyndon Baines Johnson was sitting in the dining
room of the Driskill Hotel, anxiously awaiting a sophisticated dame
he had met at the Texas Railroad Commission the day before. Johnson
had asked her to join him for breakfast and now was worried she had
changed her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Alta ``Lady Bird'' Taylor was having second thoughts.
She had joined the strapping and intense admirer for drinks the
night before, but had a ``sort of queer moth-in-the-flame feeling
about this remarkable young man,'' she said in ``The President's
Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when she passed the hotel window and saw him sitting in
the dining room alone, Lady Bird decided to join Lyndon Johnson.
They shared a meal that August day in 1934 and then drove into the
country where the future president did everything he could,
including propose marriage, to impress this woman who had caught
his eye.
</P>
<P>
   A two-month, whirlwind courtship ensued, forever changing the
life of the shy young woman from East Texas whose ambition was to
be a teacher in some place exotic, like Alaska or Hawaii. Instead,
she traveled the world as a loving and supportive wife to the late
President Johnson, an author, a savvy businesswoman, a champion of
education and conservation and a mother, grandmother and
great-grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, a permanent exhibit opens at the LBJ Library and
Museum celebrating her life, from Lady Bird's graduation from the
University of Texas through 38 years as the wife of a consummate
politician to the legacy she created after her husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   While Lady Bird always has been included in the permanent
exhibits of the museum, the focus has been on her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've done a permanent exhibit on Mrs.
Johnson that was dedicated strictly to her,'' says curator Lisa
Royse.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady's Gallery is a loving memoir of a Southern lady
who left gentle fingerprints on America's landscape and who, as she
turns 86 tomorrow, continues to earn admiration for her dignity and
grace. It was carved out of space on the eighth floor of the
library next door to the replica of President Johnson's Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,000-square-foot hall, formerly offices for Lady Bird and
her staff, highlights programs she actively promoted while first
lady, such as Head Start, VISTA and the National Park Service, as
well as her life after the White House and today, as she champions
the importance of wildflowers through the Lady Bird Johnson
Wildflower Center.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery is being opened now because Lady Bird, whose vision
is severely limited because of macular degeneration, has decided to
curtail some of her public appearances and open her office to
museum visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area tells about the life and times of Lady Bird
Johnson,'' says her daughter, Luci Baines Johnson, walking through
the gallery and pointing to walls that hold photographs and quotes
from and about Lady Bird. ``You can't tell the story of Lyndon
Johnson without telling the story of his best friend and
helpmate.''
</P>
<P>
   The office Lady Bird used for 28 years is exactly as she left
it. The credenza is topped by photographs of family and friends,
and her desk, made of burnt orange lacquered wood and brass, offers
a sweeping view of downtown Austin, the Texas Capitol, and Darrell
K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The caboose platform Lady Bird used while campaigning for her
husband in the 1964 presidential election has been re-created, and
artifacts and memorabilia are displayed throughout. In another
area, visitors can hear Lady Bird reading previously unreleased
recordings from her book, ``A White House Diary.''
</P>
<P>
   Snippets of historic moments always attract visitors. But it's
the personal items in the exhibit _ notes she made critiquing her
husband's speeches, home movies she took of their early life
together and of daughters Luci and Lynda as children, and love
letters Lady Bird and Lyndon exchanged during their courtship _
that stir the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the letters, which Luci Johnson says show ``a wonderful
sense of youth and intimacy,'' are displayed, while others are
featured through dramatic readings performed in 1977 by Kirk
Douglas and the late Helen Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   These missives of love and devotion between Lyndon, who was in
Washington, D.C., as secretary to a congressman, and Lady Bird, who
was at her father's home in Karnack, overseeing a reconstruction
project, have an almost frantic quality, as if Lyndon feared if
they waited too long they might never be married.
</P>
<P>
   Darling, ...I haven't had a letter from you since Saturday _ it
was written Thursday . I'm not fussing, just checking up on Uncle
Sam's efficient postal service. ... Tell me you love me if you want
to and if you don't I'll believe you do anyway and keep on loving
you every minute ... Here is a big hug-kiss and the everlasting
love of Lyndon Baines.
</P>
<P>
   Austinite Nicole Nugent Covert, Lady Bird's
granddaughter,marvels that her grandparents knew one another less
than three months when they married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to Nini (Lady Bird) about their courtship and
asked her how she knew so fast that it was right,'' says Covert.
``My grandfather asked her to marry him on the first date and that
was a little too fast for her. She says he was so persistent. She
says they just knew it was right, but for her piece of mind they
needed to wait a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Covert says this is the first time she has seen most of the
letters, written when her grandparents were younger than she is
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really beautiful, like poetry,'' says Covert. ``They
flow so well.
</P>
<P>
   President Johnson, who left Washington in 1969, died at the LBJ
Ranch near Stonewall on Jan. 22, 1973. Lady Bird said then that it
would be ``ungracious not to be terribly grateful for 38 wonderful
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Their love story, spawned over coffee in a hotel dining room 64
years ago and re-created in the First Lady's Gallery, continues
today, says Lyndon Nugent, Lady Bird's grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously she's gone on with her life, but she still misses
him,'' says Nugent, an attorney in San Antonio. ``It's been a long
time, but she still gets nostalgic and a little sad that on
Christmas morning when she wakes up he won't be there to sit down
with her, or when she goes to bed and he won't be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's never gotten over it, but she's gotten used to it.''

</P>
<P>
   Dearest,
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday I set out through the woods for Mrs. Fox's in the
quite early morning _ and came upon more beautiful little glades
and hollows in the woods. And finally emerged at the cornfield that
was practically covered with the bluest blue Morning Glories! . . .
O, dear _ I do miss you so. But it's not a completely unpleasant
feeling 'cause I can look forward to when I see you again! . . .
This afternoon I took the films to be developed. If they're any
good I shall send you several. And when I go to Dallas Nov. 12 for
the API, I shall have a big, nice one made _ if you want me to. I
wouldn't here for the world. The Marshall photographer makes people
look like ogres. Here are two little ones made in my beloved Austin
in the enchanting month of April. Goodnight, my dearest. Please
write me. I love you _ Bird
</P>

</P>
<P>
   My Dear Bird,
</P>
<P>
   This morning I'm ambitious, proud, energetic and very madly in
love with you. I want to see people _ want to walk thro'the throngs
_ want to do things with a drive. If I had a box I would almost
make a speech this minute. Plans, ideas, hopes _ I'm bubbling over
with them. For fear you might think me too conceited I'll stop
there but there is so much more guiding my pen this morning than
when I wrote you of my worry about this time last week. You are
apparently always so free from concern that when I feel as I do
this morning I think how cruel it was even to let you know how
despondent I felt last week.

VITAL PIECES IN IRAQ'S ARMS PUZZLE ARE STILL MISSING

   Sometimes past is prologue. As Iraqi officials in 1995 led U.N.
arms inspectors to a large cache of documents hidden on a chicken
farm near Baghdad, a red photograph album stood out. At first
glance, the album, like the half million pages of other papers in
the shed, seemed to cast light on Iraq's secret drive to obtain
germ, chemical and nuclear arms and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But closer scrutiny revealed huge gaps. The album's dozens of
pages, for instance, offered some insights into Iraq's germ
efforts. Photo after captioned photo showed not only flasks of
deadly agents like anthrax but animal test subjects small and
large, including sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the inspectors found that the album covered germ work only
through 1989 _ before Baghdad embarked on a crash program to turn
experimentation into weapons for the 1991 gulf war, in which it
deployed germ bombs and warheads at four sites, but did not use
them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, something else was missing. The numbered pages were
interrupted where photos had been removed from the three-ring
binder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what was taken,'' one inspector said. ``My
guess? Pictures showing people'' central to building the arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seven years after President Saddam Hussein promised to
come clean about his weapons of mass destruction, the book on Iraqi
arms is still full of holes.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts in Washington and at the United Nations say the
unanswered questions are serious and legion. Still unaccounted for
are hundreds of chemical arms, tons of nerve gas, more than 100
germ weapons and parts for up to four nuclear warheads, which are
said to lack only the uranium to fuel them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are vast areas of activity that are still unknown to
us,'' said Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on
Nuclear Arms Control in Washington and an expert on Iraq's arsenal.
``The uncertainties are so great that, as far as we know, Saddam
Hussein today could have both chemical and germ warfare agents in
warheads, ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Milhollin and his staff have prepared a list of some of the main
riddles about Iraq's unconventional weapons. Their chart, below, is
lengthy. Yet Milhollin and U.N. experts note that no such list can
be exhaustive. Given Iraq's evasiveness and defiance, its
stonewalling and lies, such listings can only suggest the depth of
the remaining questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not definitive,'' one inspector said of the chart,
adding that the goal was out of reach even of the U.N. and U.S.
intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for greater illumination are bleak, analysts say,
because of both the unknown consequences of the bombing that began
Wednesday and Baghdad's obstinacy. What evidence might have been
destroyed in the bombing was unknowable, but the inspection
process, most analysts agree, had all but collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission in
charge of arms inspectors in Iraq, is more diplomatic. ``It must
regrettably be recorded again,'' he told the Security Council on
Tuesday, ``that the commission is not able to conduct the
substantive disarmament work mandated to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are potentially huge. Iraq has already confessed to
having made enough deadly microbes to kill all the people on Earth
several times over. And Saddam Hussein has used weapons of mass
destruction before.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the 1991 gulf war, Saddam, as a condition of
surrender, agreed to declare within 15 days all his nuclear,
chemical and biological arms and the missiles for delivering them,
and then to destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations set up a group to insure that he kept his
word. Until it verified destruction of the weapons, Iraq was barred
from selling oil. Later, the United Nations relented a bit and
allowed some oil exports to pay for food, medicine and war
reparations.
</P>
<P>
   To date, those sanctions have cost Iraq more than $120 billion.
Eager to escape them, Baghdad over the years has offered at least
five different ``full, final and complete'' disclosures, but the
U.N. officials have dismissed these as woefully incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   An example of Iraq's pale cooperation is demonstrated in the
1995 chicken-farm haul, which was one of the special commission's
greatest finds. While the documents were valuable, they had been
carefully culled and included nothing from the headquarters of the
Military Industrialization Corp. or the relevant archives of the
Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ugliest outstanding questions is whether Iraq tested
its germ weapons on people. Rumors and even some suggestive
photographs have come to light. But so far, there is neither proof
not admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the battle for truth about Iraq's armaments has been
crippled by diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of inspections aimed at testing Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions was an abject failure. In
interviews, inspectors told of astonishing Iraqi feints and what
one non-American inspector called a saga of ``lies and deception.''

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: A holiday gift from the bride
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My granddaughter, Mira, is 2 1/2. This was the first Chanukkah
of which she was fully aware. By about 10 o'clock, the holiday
candles long since guttered out, and drugged by gifts, attention
and fatigue, Mira retrieved a cotton baby blanket, draped it over
her head like a veil, declared herself to be a bride, and began to
dance around the room.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you're not the child's grandparent, such a performance
is usually considered insufferable, but if you are the child's
grandparent, it's delightful and extremely appealing. We started
applauding and laughing, and Mira responded by dancing even more,
even more furiously.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after a while, and the appeal of cuteness being quickly
finite, we began to lose focus. Mira, sensing that her bid for
stardom was slipping away, made a little leap, froze in place, then
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop! Please! The bride is very danceable . . . and singing!''
</P>
<P>
   No one knew what it meant, and we made the big mistake of
laughing. Once you laugh at a kid's gooniness, you've lost control.
Mira beamed. A new chapter had entered the family book of memories.
</P>
<P>
   May all your brides be danceable . . . and singing.

WHEN THE HOUSE LAST ROSE TO IMPEACH, MARK TWAIN ROSE TO THE
OCCASION

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Mark Twain may well have said that history doesn't repeat
itself; it rhymes. Or maybe someone else did. In any event, in
early 1868, while awaiting publication of ``The Innocents Abroad,''
the 32-year-old writer found himself witness to a curious piece of
history that proves the point _ the first impeachment of a
president.
</P>
<P>
   Twain was working that winter as a journalist, filing dispatches
from Washington to newspapers around the country, when Andrew
Johnson's enemies in Congress finally found ammunition they thought
would remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   A Tennessee Democrat, President Johnson had been Lincoln's
running mate in 1864 on a ``National Union'' ticket but had run
afoul of the radical Republicans since succeeding Lincoln. He
fought them often over their efforts to harshly punish the South.
Congress repeatedly sought to strip him of power and radical
Republicans tried several times to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   The climactic battle came when the president fired his secretary
of war, Edwin M. Stanton, in the face of a law designed to give
Congress control over Cabinet officers' tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Twain's opinion of politicians in general wasn't high. ``The
political and commercial morals of the United States are not merely
food for laughter, they are an entire banquet,'' he once wrote.
Impeachment gave him a lot to dine out on.
</P>
<P>
   _ By MARC D. CHARNEY
</P>
<P>
   In the months before the Stanton crisis, the second attempt to
impeach the president on charges of misusing his power fizzled.
Twain responded with a mock obituary in a feature titled ``Mark
Twain's Letter'' in The Chicago Republican of Feb. 19. He cast
impeachment as a moribund patient and House Republicans, including
the radical Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania and the more moderate
John A. Bingham of Ohio, as nurses who had squabbled over whether
to let the patient die.
</P>
<P>
   Final Defeat of the Impeachment Project in the House
</P>
<P>
   DIED
</P>
<P>
   In this city, Feb. 13, at his lodgings in the chamber of the
House Reconstruction Committee, our beloved brother, IMPEACHMENT.
The malady of deceased was general debility. A short time ago his
health had improved so much that a bright hope cheered the land
that he would soon walk forth healthful and strong; but alas! we
know not what a day may bring forth. A great fear came upon his
physicians in the crisis of his disease. The weariness of watching
overpowered the nurses, so that they fell asleep and neglected him
_ and lo! a relapse! ...
</P>
<P>
   And so, these six, that were with Mrs. Bingham, being stronger
than they that were with Mrs. Stevens, called Thad, suffered not
the medicine to pass the lips of him that lay sick.
</P>
<P>
   And in the self-same hour he died.
</P>
<P>
   So endeth the second farce. The ancient school-boy phrase best
describes the position of the Congressional bodies in this matter:
``One's afraid and 't'other darsn't.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 21 President Johnson ignited the final impeachment
crisis by dismissing Stanton. On March 1, ``Mark Twain's Letter''
treated the event as a resurrection:
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS IMPEACHMENT, COME FORTH!
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Feb. 24
</P>
<P>
   The past few days have been filled with startling interest. On
Friday the nation was electrified by the President's last and
boldest effort to dislodge Mr. Stanton. The wild excitement that
pervaded the capital that night, has not had its parallel here
since the murder of Mr. Lincoln. The air was thick with rumors of
dreadful import. Every tranquil brain, thrown from its balance by
the colossal surprise, magnified the creations of its crazed fancy
into the phantoms of anarchy, rebellion, bloody revolution! ...
</P>
<P>
   And out of the midst of the political gloom, impeachment, that
dead corpse, rose up and walked forth again! ...
</P>
<P>
   SCENE IN THE CAPITOL
</P>
<P>
   The next morning that one word, Impeachment, was upon every
tongue. ... Before 9 o'clock in the morning a multitude was
assembled in the Capitol grounds, and from all points of the
compass the clans were still gathering. ...
</P>
<P>
   The multitude of strangers were waiting for impeachment. They
did not know what impeachment was, exactly, but they had a general
idea that it would come in the form of an avalanche, or a thunder
clap, or that maybe the roof would fall in. Bye and bye a member
rose up solemnly, and every soul prepared to stand from under. But
it was a vain delusion _ he only had a speech to make about a
degraded cooking stove patent. The people were justly incensed. ...

</P>
<P>
   After an hour, Twain relates, Thaddeus Stevens rose to speak.
</P>
<P>
   All the faces were full of interest again in a moment. The
emaciated old man stood up and addressed the speaker ... and when
he finished, the profoundest stillness reigned in the House. Then
the one man upon whom all interest centered, read the resolutions
the multitude so longed to hear; and when he came to where it was
resolved that ``The President of the United States be impeached for
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' the prodigious words had something
so solemn and so awe-inspiring about them that the people seemed
inclined to think that the expected thunder-clap was about to crash
above the pictured ceiling! The strong lights and shadows, ... the
ghostly figure of the reader, the eager interest that marked the
sea of faces, the impressive silence and the historic grandeur of
the occasion, conspired to render the scene oe of the most striking
and dramatic that has ever been witnessed in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   All day yesterday, the place was densely thronged; the people
wished to hear the all-important vote taken. ... They heard strong
speeches from the Republicans, and angry protests from the
Democrats _ but these latter were not confident in tone. The
Democrats had said, themselves, that the President had made an
ill-advised move and they felt that they were fighting for a lost
cause. The ``aye'' votes, in nearly all cases, came in a clear
voice, but many of the ``nays'' were inaudible in the reporters'
gallery.

   Yesterday was reception night at the White House and several of
us went there at 10 o'clock. I confess that I went out of a
thoughtless curiosity to see how the Chief Magistrate bore himself
under these untoward circumstances, but I did not enjoy the visit.
... He looked so like a plain, simple, goodnatured old farmer, that
it was hard to conceive that this was the imperious ``tyrant''
whose deeds had been stirring the sluggish blood of thirty millions
of people. He was uneasy and restless; the smile that came and went
upon his face had distress in it; when he shook hands with a guest
he looked wistfully into the person's face, as if he sought a
friendly interest there, and yet hardly hoped to find it; he seemed
humbled _ the expression of his countenance could be made to
signify nothing else; when he ceased to smile for a moment, the
shadow of a secret anxiety fell upon his features, and then, if
ever a man looked weary and worn, and needful of rest and
forgetfulness, it was this envied President of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   I never saw a man who seemed as friendless and forsaken, and I
never felt for any man so much.

   But any sympathy Twain had for Johnson on the eve of impeachment
did not last. A year later, after a Senate trial that ended in
acquittal by one vote, the president left office in the accustomed
way, upon the inauguration of his successor, Ulysses S. Grant. On
this occasion Twain again parodied human mortality, offering The
New York Tribune an account that cast the last meeting of the
Johnson Cabinet as the funeral for an administration riddled by all
the vices that Twain deplored in politicians. The article was set
in type, but never ran.

(Emphatic assenting sobs from the Cabinet.) My emotions at this
moment are no less profound ... In quitting my high office, I am
able to look back upon my administration of its duties without
regret. By diligently violating my oath; by stultifying myself upon
every occasion; by being stubborn in the wrong, &AMP; feeble &AMP;
faithless toward the right; by obstructing the laws; by nursing
anarchy &AMP; rebellion, &AMP; by deliberate treachery to the party that

   There was not a dry eye in the house; neither was there a sore

   After an hour, Twain relates, Thaddeus Stevens rose to speak.
</P>
<P>
   All the faces were full of interest again in a moment. The
emaciated old man stood up and addressed the speaker ... and when
he finished, the profoundest stillness reigned in the House. Then
the one man upon whom all interest centered, read the resolutions
the multitude so longed to hear; and when he came to where it was
resolved that ``The President of the United States be impeached for
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' the prodigious words had something
so solemn and so awe-inspiring about them that the people seemed
inclined to think that the expected thunder-clap was about to crash
above the pictured ceiling! The strong lights and shadows, ... the
ghostly figure of the reader, the eager interest that marked the
sea of faces, the impressive silence and the historic grandeur of
the occasion, conspired to render the scene oe of the most striking
and dramatic that has ever been witnessed in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   All day yesterday, the place was densely thronged; the people
wished to hear the all-important vote taken. ... They heard strong
speeches from the Republicans, and angry protests from the
Democrats _ but these latter were not confident in tone. The
Democrats had said, themselves, that the President had made an
ill-advised move and they felt that they were fighting for a lost
cause. The ``aye'' votes, in nearly all cases, came in a clear
voice, but many of the ``nays'' were inaudible in the reporters'
gallery.

for Sunday, Dec. 20, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.

<P>
   _ in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Should congressional
Republicans' impeachment of President Clintion despite a lack of
public support really have come as a surprise? The merits of the
case against Clinton aside, the outcome might well have been
inevitable, given the political dynamics that rule Washington
today. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CULTURE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The impeachment debate
encompassed more than questions of whether Bill Clinton committed
perjury and whether lies under oath warranted impeachment. It
exposed a cultural rift, with people viewing each other
suspiciously from across the divide. The debate also quibbled over
history and whether the crisis that gripped the presidency almost a
quarter of a century ago applied to the situation now. By Frank
Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-TWAIN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mark Twain's opinion of
politicians wasn't high. ``The political and commercial morals of
the United States are not merely food for laughter, they are an
entire banquet,'' he wrote. The impeachment of President Andrew
Johnson gave him a lot to dine out on.
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING-DISORDERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some holiday shoppers
spend more than they should, for reasons they shouldn't. These
problem consumers are engaged in compulsive shopping, competitive
shopping and revenge shopping. Doctors say these feelings, which
reflect deeper psychological disturbances, may intensify around
Christmas, when people are inundated with subtle and not-so-subtle
messages to spend. By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-REVIEW (Undated) _ Imagine you could save the Social
Security system from bankruptcy by raising every American's
retirement check _ without increasing taxes. Such is the radical
cure proposed by Martin Feldstein, a chief economic adviser to
President Ronald Reagan and a professor of economics at Harvard
University, who made his case earlier this month at a conference
sponsored by the White House. By Michael M. Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-REVIEW (Undated) _ Even analysts who urge the United States
to actively promote a coup d'etat against Saddam Hussein and
consider the sanctions a useful form of pressure on the regime say
that getting to the dictator will be extremely difficult physically
and politically. Some experts note that the Iraqi people still
accept and support Saddam, and that the bombings have little effect
on people accustomed to suffering. By Youssef Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-ARMS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Seven years after Saddam Hussein
promised to come clean about his weapons of mass destruction, and
days after yet another military confrontation with the West over
his continuing refusal to do so, the book on Iraqi arms is still
riddled with holes. Military experts say the unanswered questions
are serious and legion. Still unaccounted for are hundreds of
chemical arms, tons of nerve gas, more than 100 germ weapons and
parts for up to four nuclear warheads, which are said to lack only
the uranium to fuel them. By William J. Broad and Judith Miller.

Operation Desert Fox. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   LATAM-LEADERS-REVIEW (Miami) _ All across Latin America,
presidents and party leaders are looking over their shoulders. With
his landslide victory in Venezuela's presidential election on Dec.
6, Hugo Chavez has revived an all-too-familiar specter that the
region's ruling elite thought they had safely interred: that of the
populist demagogue, the authoritarian man on horseback known as the
caudillo. By Larry Rohter.

THE CARD-CARRYING ANGST OF THE DYSFUNCTIONAL SHOPPER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By TRACIE ROZHON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As holiday shoppers clogged the thoroughfares last week,
clutching glossy bags emblazoned with status names, one 59-year-old
lawyer confided her innermost feeling: guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great year,'' said the woman, who worried that if she
gave her name, her clients would think they had paid her too much.
``In past years, I always went to Toys ``R'' Us and bought my
grandson some cheap thing. This year, I'm heading to F.A.O. Schwarz
and buying him one of those expensive motorized Legos. I don't care
how much it costs. And my daughter-in-law. She asked for a Polartec
robe. Well, I'm getting her cashmere! Then I'm going to Tiffany's
and buy my son Limoges.''
</P>
<P>
   How does she sound to you? Normal? Stressed? Over the edge? It
all depends on who's sizing up the situation. Psychiatrists who
specialize in ``shopping disorders'' might say she's at risk.
</P>
<P>
   A shopping disorder? That's when people spend more than they
should, for reasons they shouldn't. They are not the regular stripe
of holiday shoppers caught up in the wretched excesses of the
season. These problem consumers are engaged in compulsive shopping,
competitive shopping and revenge shopping (spending a loved one's
money to exact punishment, which may be seen as an indication of
caring).
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say these feelings, which reflect deeper psychological
disturbances, may intensify around Christmas, when people are
inundated with subtle and not-so-subtle messages to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holidays are particularly difficult for some patients
because these ritualistic events resonate with memories of festive
and happy times,'' explained Dr. David Krueger, a Houston
psychiatrist who wrote a book called ``Emotional Business: The
Meanings of Work, Money and Success'' (Slawson Communications,
1992), which focuses on the way people handle money.
</P>
<P>
   Some people shop to compensate for feelings of intense
loneliness, Krueger said. ``Shopping becomes a proxy,'' he said,
but the the thrill doesn't last that long. ``It's like treating
appendicitis with morphine. It doesn't resolve the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Belgray, the director of the Jewish Association for
Counseling and Psychotherapy in New York City, says patients seek
him out when ``they're to the point where they're in pain _ and the
charge cards are up to their limits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people want to get the most, give the most, get the
biggest present, give the biggest present,'' said Dr. Gail Saltz, a
clinical instructor in psychiatry at New York Hospital-Cornell
Medical Center in Manhattan. ``It's natural to want to say: `I love
you. You love me. Here's something special I picked out for you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's when you get carried away,'' she said. ``Then a lot of
resentment can build up. You've spent too much. And in your mind,
the people you gave the holiday presents to didn't pay you back
emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does anyone know if a loved one is a compulsive holiday
shopper, heading straight for a new year full of anger, resentment
and remorse?
</P>
<P>
   Krueger gives his patients a self-help quiz:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Do you go shopping to escape feeling bored, empty, angry or
scared?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Do you use shopping or spending in a way that creates
conflicts for you, or between you and others?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Do you buy things with your credit cards that you wouldn't
buy if you had the cash?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When you shop or make a purchase, does your mood change _ do
you feel euphoric or anxious?''
</P>
<P>
   (If the answer is yes to any of the questions, he writes,
patients could be using shopping as a way to regulate their
self-esteem. Not good.)
</P>
<P>
   Another hint from Krueger: If a shopper starts to feel that her
favorite salesclerk is her only friend, she might also be in real
trouble. Another psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Sehl, the director of the
Psychology Information Center in New York City, said a danger
signal was ``somebody bragging about how much they've spent and
then asking aloud: `Why did I buy that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Out of control? Sometimes it may not be your fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother comes in to complain about her grown son, who's
been running her credit cards up to the limit,'' Belgray said.
``It's our job to separate who's the adult. Why does the adult
child have use of the parents' credit cards?''
</P>
<P>
   For those who simply want to curb their spending, Sehl
recommends that they pay attention to their mood when buying for
themselves or others. ``Check the impulse. Write it down on a piece
of paper after you either buy or don't buy. If you're not in
therapy, it could be therapeutic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if you bought a gift for all the wrong reasons,
there is another solution. You can always return it.
</P>
<P>
   What about the lawyer who felt so bad about years of being
cheap?
</P>
<P>
   ``She's trying to atone,'' said Sehl, who said he would need to
see if her spending patterns repeated. ``If she only does it one
year, she actually can atone. But if she keeps depriving, atoning,
depriving, atoning, then she probably has a problem.''

and buying him one of those expensive motorized Legos. I don't care
how much it costs. And my daughter-in-law. She asked for a Polartec
robe. Well, I'm getting her cashmere! Then I'm going to Tiffany's
and buy my son Limoges.''
</P>
<P>
   How does she sound to you? Normal? Stressed? Over the edge? It
all depends on who's sizing up the situation. Psychiatrists who
specialize in ``shopping disorders'' might say she's at risk.
</P>
<P>
   A shopping disorder? That's when people spend more than they
should, for reasons they shouldn't. They are not the regular stripe
of holiday shoppers caught up in the wretched excesses of the
season. These problem consumers are engaged in compulsive shopping,
competitive shopping and revenge shopping (spending a loved one's
money to exact punishment, which may be seen as an indication of
caring).
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say these feelings, which reflect deeper psychological
disturbances, may intensify around Christmas, when people are
inundated with subtle and not-so-subtle messages to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holidays are particularly difficult for some patients
because these ritualistic events resonate with memories of festive
and happy times,'' explained Dr. David Krueger, a Houston
psychiatrist who wrote a book called ``Emotional Business: The
Meanings of Work, Money and Success'' (Slawson Communications,
1992), which focuses on the way people handle money.
</P>
<P>
   Some people shop to compensate for feelings of intense
loneliness, Krueger said. ``Shopping becomes a proxy,'' he said,
but the the thrill doesn't last that long. ``It's like treating
appendicitis with morphine. It doesn't resolve the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Belgray, the director of the Jewish Association for
Counseling and Psychotherapy in New York City, says patients seek
him out when ``they're to the point where they're in pain _ and the
charge cards are up to their limits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people want to get the most, give the most, get the
biggest present, give the biggest present,'' said Dr. Gail Saltz, a
clinical instructor in psychiatry at New York Hospital-Cornell
Medical Center in Manhattan. ``It's natural to want to say: `I love
you. You love me. Here's something special I picked out for you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's when you get carried away,'' she said. ``Then a lot of
resentment can build up. You've spent too much. And in your mind,
the people you gave the holiday presents to didn't pay you back
emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does anyone know if a loved one is a compulsive holiday
shopper, heading straight for a new year full of anger, resentment
and remorse?
</P>
<P>
   Krueger gives his patients a self-help quiz:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Do you go shopping to escape feeling bored, empty, angry or
scared?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Do you use shopping or spending in a way that creates
conflicts for you, or between you and others?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Do you buy things with your credit cards that you wouldn't
buy if you had the cash?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When you shop or make a purchase, does your mood change _ do
you feel euphoric or anxious?''
</P>
<P>
   (If the answer is yes to any of the questions, he writes,
patients could be using shopping as a way to regulate their
self-esteem. Not good.)
</P>
<P>
   Another hint from Krueger: If a shopper starts to feel that her
favorite salesclerk is her only friend, she might also be in real
trouble. Another psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Sehl, the director of the
Psychology Information Center in New York City, said a danger
signal was ``somebody bragging about how much they've spent and
then asking aloud: `Why did I buy that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Out of control? Sometimes it may not be your fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother comes in to complain about her grown son, who's
been running her credit cards up to the limit,'' Belgray said.
``It's our job to separate who's the adult. Why does the adult
child have use of the parents' credit cards?''
</P>
<P>
   For those who simply want to curb their spending, Sehl
recommends that they pay attention to their mood when buying for
themselves or others. ``Check the impulse. Write it down on a piece
of paper after you either buy or don't buy. If you're not in
therapy, it could be therapeutic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if you bought a gift for all the wrong reasons,
there is another solution. You can always return it.
</P>
<P>
   What about the lawyer who felt so bad about years of being
cheap?
</P>
<P>
   ``She's trying to atone,'' said Sehl, who said he would need to
see if her spending patterns repeated. ``If she only does it one
year, she actually can atone. But if she keeps depriving, atoning,
depriving, atoning, then she probably has a problem.''

IN CUBA, THE GRINCH TAKES A HOLIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

<P>
   A week before Thanksgiving, while Americans were busy planning
turkey feasts, people in Havana were already showing off their new
plastic Christmas trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lights are twinkling everywhere,'' said a woman reached by
phone in November as she peered from a window in her fifth-floor
walkup in the Centro Habana neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Cuban government two more weeks to announce the
obvious: Christmas had returned to the island and Cubans were, once
again, free to observe the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas is back in Cuba at least in part because technology
has improved, the Cuban government says. A recent editorial in
Granma, Cuba's Communist Party newspaper, explained that
sophisticated machines are now capable of cutting sugar cane during
December, the busiest agricultural season in the tropics, so
workers can now be spared for a day off.
</P>
<P>
   And Christmas is back for good.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Cuba, the re-emergence of Christmas has been viewed
as yet another concession to the Roman Catholic Church and, in
particular, to Pope John Paul II, who visited the island for the
first time last January.
</P>
<P>
   But some Cuba watchers and dissidents on the island say changes
had begun to occur even before the pope announced his decision to
go a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope's visit was a factor in a process, and we have yet to
see where and how it will end,'' said Marifeli Perez-Stable, a
professor of political sociology at the City University of New York
who is writing a book about Cuba in the 1950s. ``The visit itself
was possible because the government had already embarked on that
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes evident in Cuba this year are the result of a
re-evaluation of priorities that began in the early 1990s, when the
government, overwhelmed by world events and exhausted by its own
economic crisis, finally recognized that it was time to switch
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there has been a shift of power and attitude
that has enabled European countries, through the European Union, to
become more assertive about Cuba just when the United States had
begun to lose interest. An intelligence report released by the
Pentagon last May concluded that Cuba was no longer a threat to
U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
   All these elements have been present for a while, but it took
the Pope's visit to get the world's attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 11 months alone, the Spanish government named an
ambassador to Havana, and the King and Queen of Spain announced
they will visit next spring. Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien visited the island.
Guatemala and the Dominican Republic established full diplomatic
relations with Cuba. And Cuban President Fidel Castro embarked on
highly publicized tours of Portugal, Jamaica, Barbados, the
Dominican Republic and Grenada.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, President Clinton ordered a lifting of the ban
on direct flights to Cuba and increased to $1,200 the amount of
money Cubans here can send to relatives on the island each year.
And the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations voted down a
U.S.-sponsored resolution condemning Cuba's human rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government allowed the Associated Press to open a
bureau in Havana and granted exit visas to the family of the
baseball player Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 political prisoners were released and, while other
Cubans have been apprehended, the number of political prisoners is
now far lower than it has been in a long time. Two years ago, there
were about 1,000 political prisoners; today, there are anywhere
between 300 and 400, according to Elizardo Sanchez Santa Cruz, one
of the leading dissidents in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Dissidents, who have seen their work restricted inside and
outside Cuba for years, now have some freedoms. While street
demonstrations continue to be quashed, dissidents who are arrested
are likely to be released quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said he is now able to speak on the telephone to
international human rights organizations without government
officials interrupting the calls.
</P>
<P>
   He is also able to travel. In the past year, he said, he
received six invitations to visit foreign countries. All were
denied until last month, when the government honored a request from
France. He is now in Spain and said he will soon travel to Miami
and Washington before returning to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive repression, as it was defined in the first 30 years of
the Castro government, no longer seems necessary to keep tight
control of Cuban society, Sanchez said. Most people are so busy
struggling to put food on the table every day that they do not have
the time or the inclination to protest or rebel.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope's visit was successful on two other fronts: It gave
hope to the people of Cuba and it greatly improved the relationship
between the Roman Catholic Church and the Cuban government. A
cordial relationship is crucial because the church needs the
approval of the government to fulfill its mission of helping the
needy and ministering to the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Paredes, a top church official in New York who advises
Cardinal John O'Connor on Cuban matters, said the benefits to the
Catholic Church in Cuba have been numerous. For the first time in
many years, groups of priests and nuns were allowed into the
country. Also for the first time, the church has been able to
distribute aid directly to the needy, without interference from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cuba's cardinal, Jaime Ortega, was able to speak to
the nation by radio and television in March _ no small feat in a
country where the government controls all forms of communication.
The government has begun to allow the repair of old churches;
before, construction permits were routinely denied. Nuns and
priests are allowed to visit the ailing in government hospitals,
also a first.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a delegation of Catholic doctors from New York flew
to Cuba to assess how it could lend a hand in the country's medical
crisis. Earlier, the minister of health had visited Catholic
hospitals in New York. The Italian and French churches are pouring
million of dollars into Cuban universities to conduct various types
of research, and Catholic professionals are now free to attend
conferences abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, life remains the same in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The government shows no willingness to introduce democratic
reforms and many people still go to bed hungry and disheartened.
Just like everywhere else, those who have dollars live relatively
well; those who do not must struggle every day.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Christmas decorations are a permanent fixture in the
country, the differences are more noticeable than ever. With
Christmas tree prices that range from $7 to $60, most Cubans cannot
even afford a little holiday cheer.

IN LATIN AMERICA, THE STRONGMAN STIRS IN HIS GRAVE

<P>
   MIAMI _ All across Latin America, presidents and party leaders
are looking over their shoulders. With his landslide victory in
Venezuela's presidential election on Dec. 6, Hugo Chavez has
revived an all-too-familiar specter that the region's ruling elite
thought they had safely interred: that of the populist demagogue,
the authoritarian man on horseback known as the caudillo.
</P>
<P>
   A cashiered army colonel, Chavez is to be sworn into office for
a five-year term on Feb. 2, the eve of the anniversary of a bloody
but failed military coup he led in 1992. Chavez, a 44-year-old
former paratrooper, maintains that only a ``social revolution'' can
be ``the salvation of the country,'' and has vowed to convene a
constitutional assembly that would rewrite Venezuela's charter and,
in all likelihood, do away with the democratic two-party system
that has prevailed for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running scared; we have sweaty palms,'' said Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada, a former president of Bolivia who went to
Caracas as part of an international delegation of election
observers. ``Venezuela is something that will have a great
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Chavez resonates far beyond Venezuela's borders
for reasons both symbolic and practical. Venezuela was the
birthplace of Simon Bolivar, the father of South American
independence, and Chavez has presented himself as Bolivar's heir
and disciple _ despite his past disregard for the rule of law. In
addition, the overthrow of the dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez in
1958 ushered in the modern cycle of civilian democratic rule in
Latin America and made Venezuela a sort of political laboratory for
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly alarming to the political establishment is that
Chavez achieved his victory by going outside the traditional party
system and running as the independent candidate of a loose-knit
coalition called the Patriotic Pole. Discredited by years of deeply
entrenched corruption and partisan nepotism, both parties _ one
slightly left of center, the other on the right _ united at the
last moment behind Chavez's main opponent, only to find themselves
made virtually irrelevant by the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's triumph augurs ``the total disintegration of the
strongest party system in Latin America,'' according to Arturo
Valenzuela, director of the Center for Latin American Studies at
Georgetown University. ``It really is an extraordinary lesson: that
you cannot over a period of time run a political system with an
explicit or even implicit pact to divide up the spoils and rule the
country on the basis of patronage.''
</P>
<P>
   In place of the parties _ which for all their flaws have
demonstrated respect for democratic institutions _ Chavez seems
inclined to govern on the basis of a mystical bond he claims to
have established with Venezuela's 23 million people. He has also
implied that his new ``people's government'' will not need a
Congress or other institutions to interpret the popular will and
has said he prefers direct consultation with voters to the
give-and-take of building a legislative coalition through
compromise and negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trend towards government by referendum and plebiscite _
that's not democracy, and that's what worries me the most,'' said
Eduardo Gamarra, director of the Latin American and Caribbean
Center at Florida International University here. ``People in power
who are having difficulties and want to forget the niceties of
presidential democracy will be very attracted by this model of
closing down Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the gradual disappearance of military dictatorships in the
early 1980s, the basic assumption of Latin America's civilian
politicians, as well as their patrons in Washington, has been that
democracy works in tandem with open markets, privatization and free
trade. But Chavez's resounding triumph in a country with the
largest oil reserves outside the Middle East suggests a basic flaw
in that thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is growing frustration, anger and anxiety throughout
Latin America because of the unrealized promises from increasing
involvement in the global economy,'' said Jennifer Schirmer, a
Harvard University professor who is an expert on Central American
military regimes. ``If the upper classes and the elite have grown
richer, most people, including the middle class, are experiencing
economic loss, greater instability and an exponential growth in
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In that context, she added, Chavez's emergence can be seen as
``the first salvo in a class revolt'' that may not always seek
expression at the ballot box. Or as Luis Vicente Leon, head of the
Venezuelan polling firm Datanalisis, put it, Chavez's followers
``vote for him out of rage'' _ a state of mind that exists in
abundance from Guatemala to Brazil in nations whose governments
have favored policies that generate wealth but do not distribute it
equitably.
</P>
<P>
   By sending contradictory signals, Chavez has done little to calm
concerns about his intentions. Following his triumph, he disavowed
earlier statements that he would ``fry the heads'' of his
opponents, described himself as ``a man of peace,'' promised to
respect the rights of foreign investors and pledged ``a new
democracy'' free of corruption and patronage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has also invoked the spirit of Juan Peron of Argentina
and other populist dictators of the past. ``I am not the Peron of
Venezuela, I am the Chavez of Venezuela,'' he has said. ``But if
Peron worried about social justice and equality, then I agree with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Chavez could end up taking the same path as Carlos
Menem, who was elected president of Argentina in 1989 as a Peronist
but has governed as a textbook enthusiast of open markets. Then
again, he may follow the course of Alberto Fujimori of Peru, who
made good on threats to bypass the traditional political system and
has transformed himself into a strongman.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a wake-up call to the perils of cronyism and growing
income disparity has clearly been delivered to the region's
leaders. What remains to be seen is who, if anyone, will heed the
sobering message.

be ``the salvation of the country,'' and has vowed to convene a
constitutional assembly that would rewrite Venezuela's charter and,
in all likelihood, do away with the democratic two-party system
that has prevailed for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running scared; we have sweaty palms,'' said Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada, a former president of Bolivia who went to
Caracas as part of an international delegation of election
observers. ``Venezuela is something that will have a great
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Chavez resonates far beyond Venezuela's borders
for reasons both symbolic and practical. Venezuela was the
birthplace of Simon Bolivar, the father of South American
independence, and Chavez has presented himself as Bolivar's heir
and disciple _ despite his past disregard for the rule of law. In
addition, the overthrow of the dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez in
1958 ushered in the modern cycle of civilian democratic rule in
Latin America and made Venezuela a sort of political laboratory for
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly alarming to the political establishment is that
Chavez achieved his victory by going outside the traditional party
system and running as the independent candidate of a loose-knit
coalition called the Patriotic Pole. Discredited by years of deeply
entrenched corruption and partisan nepotism, both parties _ one
slightly left of center, the other on the right _ united at the
last moment behind Chavez's main opponent, only to find themselves
made virtually irrelevant by the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's triumph augurs ``the total disintegration of the
strongest party system in Latin America,'' according to Arturo
Valenzuela, director of the Center for Latin American Studies at
Georgetown University. ``It really is an extraordinary lesson: that
you cannot over a period of time run a political system with an
explicit or even implicit pact to divide up the spoils and rule the
country on the basis of patronage.''
</P>
<P>
   In place of the parties _ which for all their flaws have
demonstrated respect for democratic institutions _ Chavez seems
inclined to govern on the basis of a mystical bond he claims to
have established with Venezuela's 23 million people. He has also
implied that his new ``people's government'' will not need a
Congress or other institutions to interpret the popular will and
has said he prefers direct consultation with voters to the
give-and-take of building a legislative coalition through
compromise and negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trend towards government by referendum and plebiscite _
that's not democracy, and that's what worries me the most,'' said
Eduardo Gamarra, director of the Latin American and Caribbean
Center at Florida International University here. ``People in power
who are having difficulties and want to forget the niceties of
presidential democracy will be very attracted by this model of
closing down Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the gradual disappearance of military dictatorships in the
early 1980s, the basic assumption of Latin America's civilian
politicians, as well as their patrons in Washington, has been that
democracy works in tandem with open markets, privatization and free
trade. But Chavez's resounding triumph in a country with the
largest oil reserves outside the Middle East suggests a basic flaw
in that thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is growing frustration, anger and anxiety throughout
Latin America because of the unrealized promises from increasing
involvement in the global economy,'' said Jennifer Schirmer, a
Harvard University professor who is an expert on Central American
military regimes. ``If the upper classes and the elite have grown
richer, most people, including the middle class, are experiencing
economic loss, greater instability and an exponential growth in
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In that context, she added, Chavez's emergence can be seen as
``the first salvo in a class revolt'' that may not always seek
expression at the ballot box. Or as Luis Vicente Leon, head of the
Venezuelan polling firm Datanalisis, put it, Chavez's followers
``vote for him out of rage'' _ a state of mind that exists in
abundance from Guatemala to Brazil in nations whose governments
have favored policies that generate wealth but do not distribute it
equitably.
</P>
<P>
   By sending contradictory signals, Chavez has done little to calm
concerns about his intentions. Following his triumph, he disavowed
earlier statements that he would ``fry the heads'' of his
opponents, described himself as ``a man of peace,'' promised to
respect the rights of foreign investors and pledged ``a new
democracy'' free of corruption and patronage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has also invoked the spirit of Juan Peron of Argentina
and other populist dictators of the past. ``I am not the Peron of
Venezuela, I am the Chavez of Venezuela,'' he has said. ``But if
Peron worried about social justice and equality, then I agree with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Chavez could end up taking the same path as Carlos
Menem, who was elected president of Argentina in 1989 as a Peronist
but has governed as a textbook enthusiast of open markets. Then
again, he may follow the course of Alberto Fujimori of Peru, who
made good on threats to bypass the traditional political system and
has transformed himself into a strongman.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a wake-up call to the perils of cronyism and growing
income disparity has clearly been delivered to the region's
leaders. What remains to be seen is who, if anyone, will heed the
sobering message.

   Netanyahu Threatens To Force Elections
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to call new
elections to avoid the humiliation of being tossed out of office by
Parliament. But he said he would try one final time to get a
majority of Parliament to stand behind his tough posture toward the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-day summit with President Clinton and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, Netanyahu had made clear that he was unlikely
to abide by the timetable of the Wye peace accord for another troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   It was a disappointment for the Palestinians and the visiting
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Clinton pronounced the trip a success in putting the
derailed peace effort ``back on track.''

   Hudson Foods Indicted In Meat Contamination
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in Omaha indicted Hudson Foods Inc. and two
employees for lying to investigators about the contamination of
hamburgers produced at Hudson's beef plant in Columbus, Neb., last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the tainted hamburgers, which are believed to
have sickened 16 people in Colorado and Kentucky in August 1997,
prompted the recall of 25 million pounds of ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   The plant manager and the director of customer relations and
quality control falsely told investigators from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture that the company had been able to trace the infected
beef to a single lot of hamburgers even though they knew that the
problem was more widespread, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the charges, as did a lawyer for the
plant manager. The other employee's lawyer has declined to comment.

   Questions About Truth Of Nobel Winner's Book
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, Rigoberta Menchu of
Guatemala, has had her reputation tarnished a bit as a result of a
new book, written by an American anthropologist, that questions the
truthfulness of the autobiography that made her famous.
</P>
<P>
   David Stoll of Middlebury College spent nearly a decade
researching Ms. Menchu's account, and found that the Nobel laureate
fabricated the circumstances in which some relatives died, received
an education she claimed not to have and comes from a family that
owned land she claimed it never possessed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Menchu responded angrily to the accusations, saying, ``This
is my testimony and I will defend it.''

   Koreans Clone Human Cell
</P>
<P>
   South Korean scientists said they had cloned a human cell from
an infertile woman, creating an embryo that theoretically could
have grown into an identical replica of the woman. But because of
the legal and ethical implications of their work, they said, they
stopped the experiment and did not try to create a human clone. The
research has already caused controversy. Korean groups are calling
for a ban on such experiments.

   In Puerto Rican Vote, None of the Above
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in six years, Puerto Ricans rebuffed their
Governor's efforts to win statehood. In a referendum, ``None of the
above'' was their top choice, a selection promoted as a protest by
those who want to maintain the current commonwealth relationship
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The other options were commonwealth, ``free association'' (a
form of independence that delegates certain powers by treaty to the
United States), statehood and independence. The winning option got
50.2 percent of the vote, compared with 46.5 percent for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Historically divided over whether to seek a closer association
with the United States through statehood or to remain distinctly
self-governing, the electorate this time was split among options
that confused some voters and angered many others. The small vote
for the option to maintain commonwealth status was evidence of
this, reflecting a boycott by the pro-commonwealth Popular
Democratic Party, which claimed the definition of that option was
misleading.

   Charges in Disappearance Of New York Millionaire
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charged the lead suspects in the disappearance of an
elderly Manhattan woman with murder, setting the stage for a trial
next year that would be one of the rare cases where a murder is
prosecuted without the victim's body being found.
</P>
<P>
   Sante Kimes, 64, and her son Kenneth, 24, carried out a
sophisticated scheme to defraud Irene Silverman of her ornate Upper
East Side Manhattan mansion, according to an 84-count indictment.
And they left a detailed paper trail, including notes about the
scheme and a forged deed transferring the mansion to a corporation
they control, according to the charges.

   Unraveling the Hiss Case

   Was Alger Hiss a spy, or was he steamrolled by McCarthyism? That
question has gnawed at the country for half a century, and despite
seemingly damning evidence from Soviet archives, there's no firm
answer.

   Now, in yet another effort to nibble away at this mystery, a

   Happy Christmas, Merry New Year
</P>
<P>
   In China, a growing passion for things Western has in recent
years meant a special interest in Christmas, especially among
fashion-conscious young people.
</P>
<P>
   Friends exchange gifts, stores force sales clerks to wear Santa
suits _ young women are often persuaded to wear the miniskirt
version _ and there is a lively trade in Christmas cards.
</P>
<P>
   With such a large cultural divide between East and West, perhaps
it is inevitable that something gets lost in translation. A typical
card reads: ``Wish you all the luck in the Uorld!'' and the
accompanying message says: ``You're here, There's nothing I fear,
And I know that my heart will go on, We'll stay forever this way,
You are safe in my heart, And my heart mill go on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   In another card, Santa is pictured on the Western side of the
Earth exchanging gazes with a Chinese god of fortune in the East,
with the message: ``As the world is round, the far end of East is
West and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   A card entitled ``Friendship,'' displays champagne and flowers,
with the message, translated from Chinese: ``Time is like flowing
water _ once passed it cannot be recovered. Friends are like old
wine; getting better with age.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing about Christmas or the New Year on this card,
but hey, it's the thought that counts.

   Lord Lloyd Webber for the Defense
</P>
<P>
   Does it often seem that Andrew Lloyd Webber is everywhere? Well,
it's more serious than you thought.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do his musicals _ so many of them! _ hang around
Broadway just about forever, but he could recently be found in a
New York courtroom giving a piano rendition of a snippet from
``Phantom of the Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   A little moonlighting, perhaps? A midday gig to soften jurors'
hearts? No, it turns out that nearly a decade ago _ a mere blip in
the typical run of a Lloyd Webber blockbuster _ a composer named
Ray Repp was listening to a ``Phantom'' CD and said: ``Holy Cow! He
stole my song.''
</P>
<P>
   Or so he asserted near the end of an eight-year legal battle to
prove that Lloyd Webber stole a passage from his 1978 song ``Till
You'' (sales: $75.87) and made it the main theme of ``Phantom''
(sales: $1 billion or so).
</P>
<P>
   So Lord Lloyd Webber took to the keyboard himself as he gave his
version of the birth of the song.
</P>
<P>
   On Repp's behalf, two music professors testified to the
compositions' similarities. But with composers great and small
routinely borrowing phrases, the whole notion of tracing musical
lineage is frightfully slippery _ DNA evidence is no help whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber, in fact, countersued in 1991, saying Repp had in
fact stolen one of HIS tunes. He lost, as did Repp this time. In
little more than an hour, the jury bestowed originality on Lloyd
Webber.

BEHIND THE IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-controlled House's impeachment of
President Clinton, in the face of considerable evidence that the
American public is firmly in Clinton's corner, would appear to be
either astonishingly principled or stunningly ill-advised. It is
hard to recall a moment in the nation's history when Congress so
completely defied public sentiment, disregarding warnings about the
political repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   But should the sight of the Republicans in the 105th Congress
impeaching the president really have come as a surprise? The merits
of the case against Clinton aside _ even many Democrats acknowledge
that most Republicans are acting out of genuine conviction _ the
outcome suddenly seems almost inevitable, given the political
dynamics that rule this city today (and despite all those shrewd
predictions to the contrary just a few weeks ago).
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the polls invoked by Democrats in arguing against
impeachment, and by pundits in predicting that it never would
happen, obscured rather than illuminated what was taking place on
Capitol Hill as the lawmakers began to cast their votes on
impeachment. The polls failed to account for the forces that shaped
the president's catastrophic week: the depth of Republican anger at
Clinton, the tepidness of the nation's support for him and, most of
all, the fact that when it comes to Congress, all politics really
is local.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the polls. There is a huge gap between the public and
congressional Republicans in their views both of Clinton and the
penalty he should pay for his attempts to cover up his liaison with
Monica Lewinsky. The public has been unwavering in its opposition
to impeachment _ two-thirds oppose it, according to the most recent
New York Times/CBS Poll, completed Thursday night. Clinton's
approval rating remains as robust as ever, and the public's view of
Republicans is as low as it's been in the 14 years that the
Times/CBS Poll has been asking the question.
</P>
<P>
   But these are national polls, and when it comes to the actual
districts that members of Congress represent, and where they have
to run, opinions about Clinton can be quite different.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you actually break it down, probably 180 Republican
districts _ 180 out of 228 _ are solidly Republican districts, and
they would be solidly anti-Clinton districts,'' said Rep. Peter
King, R-N.Y., who advocated censure instead of impeachment. ``In
those 180 districts, there's no damage in voting for impeachment.
In fact, it would be very popular.''
</P>
<P>
   David Moore, the managing editor of the Gallup Poll, said his
polls consistently found a sharp partisan division on impeachment:
Republicans, particularly conservative ones, and the people most
likely to actually vote, were the most vigorous advocates of
Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   That district-by-district variance with national sentiment
offers an explanation for the reaction of some Republican House
members to the notion they were defying public opinion. ``Please
don't let anyone suggest that public opinion wasn't weighed in the
final decision,'' said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York, one of
the last of the moderate Republicans to come out in favor of
impeachment. ``I certainly gave public opinion from the people I
represent thought and consideration. But what do you do when public
opinion is evenly divided, give or take a few points? We do what we
were elected to do. Deliberate. Consult. Consider. Vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, for the Republicans who considered their decision
in purely political terms _ not something that anyone was publicly
admitting last week _ the case for impeachment was even more
compelling. Republicans who voted against impeachment were
explicitly defying the position of the congressional leadership.
They were inviting retribution from the domineering right wing of
the Republican party: a primary challenger in two years or a drying
up of campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   And this Democratic president was particularly ill-equipped to
counter those pressures. Clinton has throughout his career done
better with voters than with legislators, and he has had especially
bad relations with Congress. There are many Republicans in this
Congress, which has always been fiercely partisan, who think
Clinton has simply been caught doing before a grand jury what he
has been doing to Congress and the public for years. The Judiciary
Committee portrait of the president as fundamentally dishonest
simply gave legal force to their own view of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a deep animosity to Clinton,'' said the Rev. Robert
Drinan, a former Democratic congressman from Massachusetts who is a
law professor at Georgetown University. ``And more and more I think
it's cultural. These people say that Clinton is responsible for
abortion and homosexuality. They just dump on him.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse for Clinton, his own support seems, while
broad, perfunctory. There is no evidence of a fervor that may have
made Republicans think twice. ``They are firm in their view that he
should not go,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research
Center for People and the Press. ``But I do not think they are
emotionally involved with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Weicker, the former Connecticut senator who was one of
the first Republicans in 1974 to urge the impeachment of Richard M.
Nixon, and who supports Clinton's impeachment, said the president's
position in the polls was a testimony more to the way women and
minorities viewed the Republican Party than to Clinton himself.
``If you are women, if you are a minority, why would you want to
kick out a man that you perceive as your friend and put yourself in
the hands of a political party governed by the religious right?''
Weicker said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In this context, these countervailing forces _ House Republicans
on one hand and public sentiment on the other _ have produced a
political climate here that is very different from the one that
prevailed the last time impeachment proceedings were moving against
a president. By the summer of 1974, when the House Judiciary
Committee voted to recommend the impeachment of Nixon, the public
decisively supported that course of action. It was a bipartisan
removal; Republicans and Democrats alike had urged Nixon's
impeachment (in contrast to the more partisan impeachment of Andrew
Johnson in 1868).
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of that, when the House Judiciary Committee voted
for impeachment, and Nixon resigned, the country came together,''
said Kurt Lang, a political science professor who, with his wife,
Gladys Engel, wrote ``The Battle for Public Opinion'' (Columbia
University Press, 1983), examining the interplay of public opinion
and Watergate. ``Everybody felt good. There was real euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this instance, impeachment is unlikely to have the same
positive reaction. And it is likely to feed the cynicism of the
public, with regard to congressional behavior in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman, D-N.Y., who as a member of the
House Judiciary Committee voted to recommend Nixon's impeachment,
said the critical difference between now and then _ the absence of
public support for the removal of a president _ should give the
Republicans pause. ``Public sentiment is crucial in so far that you
really need public acceptance to go forward with the removal of the
president of the United States _ because of the disruption that's
entailed, and the ultimate trial,'' Ms. Holtzman said. ``You need
to have public support.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have heard all this for weeks. They have
responded by saying they were sent here to vote their principles.
``We can not govern this country by polls,'' Rep. Ed Bryant,
R-Tenn., said from the House floor on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is not alone among Republicans in making that argument
(it is not exactly a new debate in Washington) and several
Republicans have predicted that public opinion will soon follow
them. Lawmakers have defied the polls before and survived the next
election as public views changed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps by the end of this process, the Republicans will succeed
in convincing the American public that Clinton truly deserves to be
removed from office for his misdeeds, and that this was not a
partisan assassination orchestrated by the Republican Party against
a popular president.
</P>
<P>
   But as lawmakers prepared to adjourn and head home for the
holidays, there was no sign of that happening any time soon.

BEHIND THE IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-controlled House's impeachment of
President Clinton, in the face of considerable evidence that the
American public is firmly in Clinton's corner, would appear to be
either astonishingly principled or stunningly ill-advised. It is
hard to recall a moment in the nation's history when Congress so
completely defied public sentiment, disregarding warnings about the
political repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   But should the sight of the Republicans in the 105th Congress
impeaching the president really have come as a surprise? The merits
of the case against Clinton aside _ even many Democrats acknowledge
that most Republicans are acting out of genuine conviction _ the
outcome suddenly seems almost inevitable, given the political
dynamics that rule this city today (and despite all those shrewd
predictions to the contrary just a few weeks ago).
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the polls invoked by Democrats in arguing against
impeachment, and by pundits in predicting that it never would
happen, obscured rather than illuminated what was taking place on
Capitol Hill as the lawmakers began to cast their votes on
impeachment. The polls failed to account for the forces that shaped
the president's catastrophic week: the depth of Republican anger at
Clinton, the tepidness of the nation's support for him and, most of
all, the fact that when it comes to Congress, all politics really
is local.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the polls. There is a huge gap between the public and
congressional Republicans in their views both of Clinton and the
penalty he should pay for his attempts to cover up his liaison with
Monica Lewinsky. The public has been unwavering in its opposition
to impeachment _ two-thirds oppose it, according to the most recent
New York Times/CBS Poll, completed Thursday night. Clinton's
approval rating remains as robust as ever, and the public's view of
Republicans is as low as it's been in the 14 years that the
Times/CBS Poll has been asking the question.
</P>
<P>
   But these are national polls, and when it comes to the actual
districts that members of Congress represent, and where they have
to run, opinions about Clinton can be quite different.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you actually break it down, probably 180 Republican
districts _ 180 out of 228 _ are solidly Republican districts, and
they would be solidly anti-Clinton districts,'' said Rep. Peter
King, R-N.Y., who advocated censure instead of impeachment. ``In
those 180 districts, there's no damage in voting for impeachment.
In fact, it would be very popular.''
</P>
<P>
   David Moore, the managing editor of the Gallup Poll, said his
polls consistently found a sharp partisan division on impeachment:
Republicans, particularly conservative ones, and the people most
likely to actually vote, were the most vigorous advocates of
Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   That district-by-district variance with national sentiment
offers an explanation for the reaction of some Republican House
members to the notion they were defying public opinion. ``Please
don't let anyone suggest that public opinion wasn't weighed in the
final decision,'' said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York, one of
the last of the moderate Republicans to come out in favor of
impeachment. ``I certainly gave public opinion from the people I
represent thought and consideration. But what do you do when public
opinion is evenly divided, give or take a few points? We do what we
were elected to do. Deliberate. Consult. Consider. Vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, for the Republicans who considered their decision
in purely political terms _ not something that anyone was publicly
admitting last week _ the case for impeachment was even more
compelling. Republicans who voted against impeachment were
explicitly defying the position of the congressional leadership.
They were inviting retribution from the domineering right wing of
the Republican party: a primary challenger in two years or a drying
up of campaign contributions.

A DEBATE ON SOMETHING BIGGER THAN WORDS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On one side of the aisle, dropping phrases like
``Christian country'' and ``the real America,'' lawmakers rued the
decline of absolutes in a permissive age. On the other side,
invoking images of ``lynch mobs'' and ``good old boys,'' they
warned of a right-wing coup.
</P>
<P>
   From one camp came allusions to Watergate that found
similarities between the transgressions of Presidents Nixon and
Clinton. From the other came gasps that such analogies were
ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans brought the country to a presidential impeachment
and Democrats fought to resist it, the debate encompassed more than
questions of whether Bill Clinton committed perjury and whether
lies under oath warranted impeachment. It exposed a cultural rift,
with people viewing each other suspiciously from across the divide.
The debate also quibbled over history and whether the crisis that
gripped the presidency almost a quarter of a century ago applied to
the situation now.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said that some Republicans who were
fighting for Clinton's removal from office were motivated in part
by his embrace of minorities, which they found threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that America should look like they look _ white,''
Rangel said in an interview last week. He noted that the Republican
side of the House Judiciary Committee was all white with only one
woman, while the Democratic side had five blacks, three women and
an openly gay man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a political lynch mob,'' Rangel said of the Republicans
pushing impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said accusations of racial or sexual animus were
absurd. What propelled them, they said, was outrage over the
specific actions alleged in the articles of impeachment against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans' comments also reflected qualms about a
departure from traditional mores in society symbolized by Clinton,
who avoided military service, smoked marijuana and repeatedly
cheated on his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., used one of his speeches during the
House Judiciary Committee hearings to attack moral relativism,
which conservatives often attribute to liberals. ``One view is that
there is absolute truth,'' Inglis said. ``The other view is that
everything is relative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And really what we're seeing here in President Clinton, I
believe, is the culmination of that,'' he said. ``He is the perfect
embodiment of everything being relative.''
</P>
<P>
   For several Republicans, there were clear parallels between
Nixon's abuse of power in covering up the burglary of a Democratic
political office and Clinton's attempts to keep secret his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston, who until Saturday had been designated as
the next speaker of the House, noted that Nixon tried to conceal
the actions of others but Clinton tried to conceal his own. ``So
why was impeachment the remedy for Nixon and not for Clinton?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., implied that Clinton's actions were
graver than Nixon's. ``In Watergate, the president did not commit
perjury,'' Bliley said during the impeachment debate Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats wondered aloud if Republicans were engaging in a
sort of payback for the 1974 House Judiciary Committee's vote to
send articles of impeachment against Nixon to the full House. Nixon
resigned before the House could vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to believe that Speaker Livingston has not gotten over
Watergate,'' Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., said in an interview
Wednesday, before the Louisiana congressman's announcement Saturday
that he would not accept the speaker's post. ``It appears that some
on the Republican side still feel that Richard Nixon got a bad deal
and that somehow the score needs to be evened.''
</P>
<P>
   The advocates and opponents of the impeachment process were
separated by cultural, racial and even regional rivalries and
suspicions, which were made clear not only in the back-and-forth
between lawmakers but also in the voices of Americans trying to be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives' language reflected a desire to keep at bay
the hair-splitting, religion-flouting intelligentsia Clinton
sometimes turned to for counsel. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., best
articulated that wish earlier in the month during a Judiciary
Committee hearing, taking on several lawyers and scholars who
testified on the president's behalf. Barr was not depressed by
their arguments, he said, because ``I think there are two Americas,
and there is a real America out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it is that America that I have great faith in, because
it's that America that understands what perjury is,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, spoke of America as a
``Christian country'' when announcing his support for impeachment,
it seemed to echo Barr's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of the people protesting the impeachment
process represented movements and groups demonized by
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent feminists marched on the office of Livingston last
week to demand a meeting, after which one of them, Betty Friedan,
called the leaders of the impeachment effort ``a bunch of dirty old
white men.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers like Toni Morrison and E.L. Doctorow spoke at
anti-impeachment rallies and, inevitably, Hollywood celebrities
added their voices, with actor Robert De Niro personally calling a
politician or two to sway their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Like their political opponents, they had come to see impeachment
as a referendum on something more than a series of actions by the
president, and their positions were informed by something larger
than party fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   The words of one Democratic congresswoman during the House
debate Friday captured their perspective well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is indeed a Republican coup d'etat,'' said Rep. Maxine
Waters, D-Calif. ``Republicans are the vehicles being used by the
right-wing Christian Coalition to direct and control our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Her audience, both inside and outside the U.S. Capitol, included
people who felt that she and some Democrats were trying to seize
the reins in just the same way.

   It is proverbial that old men plant trees as an act of faith,

aside political differences and plant seeds of justice and
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for this, for during our presidencies each of

<P>
   In the wake of President Clinton's impeachment by the House of
Representatives, America once again suffers from a grievous and
deepening wound. Our people are angrily divided. Our political
institutions are called into question. Public confidence erodes
under waves of personal smearmongering.
</P>
<P>
   Against such a backdrop of inflamed emotions, we are convinced
that the public good requires a prompt and fair resolution of the
impeachment issue. While our acts of pardon or clemency are not
directly analogous to the decision pending before the Senate, how
that body resolves the issue can have similar benefits of healing
and finality.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Senate procedures, through their flexibility and
freedom, provide the means to end this national ordeal in ways that
can uphold the rule of law without permanently damaging the
presidency. Before the senators make history, we hope they will
first turn to history for help in devising what would be, in
effect, a unique punishment for a unique set of offenses.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred and thirty years have passed since the last
impeachment of an American president. At the time of President
Andrew Johnson's 1868 trial, as now, Senate Standing Rules and the
Rules of Impeachment permitted almost all motions and matters of
evidence to be determined by a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   (By way of example, early in the proceedings, Chief Justice
Salmon Chase, who presided over Johnson's Senate trial, put to a
vote the question of whether to delay the trial for 40 days as
requested by Johnson's lawyers. Members responded by granting only
10 days.)
</P>
<P>
   Most recent impeachment cases involving judges have been
resolved expeditiously by having a trusted bipartisan committee
hear the evidence, either in public or private sessions, before
making a recommendation to the full body for its consideration. How
might all this bear on the current situation? In addition to
immediate dismissal of the charges against Clinton, there are four
alternatives for the Senate to weigh: a trial followed by
acquittal; a trial followed by conviction and removal from office;
a trial followed by censure; or censure without a trial.
</P>
<P>
   As intended by the founders, a two-thirds majority presents a
formidable obstacle for the advocates of conviction and removal.
Moreover, the sharp divisions rending the House, though sincerely
held and based on principle, do not bode well for a quick or clear
decision on either acquittal or removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   However one now supposes a trial may end, it seems inevitable
that by rehashing the lurid evidence of Clinton's misconduct, we
will only exacerbate the jagged divisions that are tearing at our
national fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow we must reach a conclusion that most Americans can
embrace and that posterity will approve. Make no mistake, the
judgment of history does matter. It matters profoundly. And
impeachment by the full House has already brought profound disgrace
to Clinton. Whatever happens in the near future will do little to
affect history's judgment of him.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not alone in standing before the bar of judgment. Our
political system too is on trial. Can we find within ourselves the
will, the vision, the generosity and, yes, the courage to resolve
the present crisis in a way that makes Americans proud of their
leaders, their institutions and themselves?
</P>
<P>
   It is with this in mind that we personally favor a bipartisan
resolution of censure by the Senate. Under such a plan, Clinton
would have to accept rebuke while acknowledging his wrongdoing and
the very real harm he has caused.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional resolution should contain language stipulating
that the president's acceptance of these findings _ including a
public acknowledgment that he did not tell the truth under oath _
cannot be used in any future criminal trial to which he may be
subject. It may even be possible for the special prosecutor
publicly to forgo the option of bringing such charges against the
president when Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Some may object that a censure can be repealed by a future
Congress, and is thus rendered meaningless. They underestimate the
power of the modern news media to foster indelible images in the
public memory. In any event, no one can undo Clinton's impeachment
by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   It is the genius of our Constitution that its authors provided
us a governing charter whose legal mechanisms permit the nation to
heal itself, so long as the end result is both justice and grace.
Clearly, the American people expect and desire an outcome that is
firm, fair and untainted by partisan advantage. That is the
challenge before us. How we meet that challenge will go a long way
toward healing our divided nation.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a controversial and partisan vote, the
Republican-majority House of Representatives has voted to impeach
Santa Claus, aka ``Kris Kringle,'' aka ``St. Nick,'' aka ``Jolly
Old Nick.''
</P>
<P>
   The grounds? Perjury, obstruction of justice, eavesdropping,
mail fraud, operating an illegal monopoly ... and other ``high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first time in modern history that a fabled holiday
character has been impeached. (Of course, The Grinch Who
 &UR; allegedly &LR;  Stole Christmas would have faced an impeachment hearing
and almost-certain conviction in 1957 had he not experienced a
change of heart and returned an estimated $1.2 million in gifts and
personal possessions to the constituents of Whoville.)
</P>
<P>
   Claus has perennially achieved astronomical approval ratings
with the public, but he has also been the subject of rumors and
innuendo about the way he conducts his seasonal gift-giving
business _ including almost-yearly allegations that his North Pole
headquarters are ``gingerbread sweatshops,'' as one workers' rights
group once put it.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years there also have been pointed questions and
numerous inquiries into the near-total monopoly on business enjoyed
by Claus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy makes Bill Gates look like a social worker,'' said
Rep. Henry Hyde (R.-Ill.), who led the charge to impeach Claus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sees you when you're sleeping, he knows when you're
awake!'' cried Rep. Dan Burton (R.-Ind.), who called for the
ambassador to the North Pole to immediately return to the United
States as a safety measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like people seeing me when I'm sleeping, and I sure as
heck don't want 'em to know when I'm awake!'' Burton said. ``Big
Brother is alive and well, apparently.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day marked by stunning developments, prompting the
cable networks CNN, MSNBC and Fox News to cancel regularly
scheduled programming in favor of nonstop coverage. (The original
Big Three networks provided frequent updates, while Fox TV carried
on with its planned lineup, including a two-hour special, ``When
Animals Attack Criminals Who Are Caught on Tape in the Act of
Stealing From Strippers' Dressing Rooms.'')
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders filled the air with passionate rhetoric. In a
press conference after the vote was held, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R.-Miss.), who is pushing for a Jan. 6 trial date,
thundered: `WHAT did Claus know and WHEN did he know it!!!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a lawyer, but I have questions about this whole
chimney thing,'' said Rep. Mary Bono (R.-Calif.), who tried
unsuccessfully to get colleagues to join her in a rendition of
``Let it Snow'' before the articles of impeachment were voted upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I don't even have a chimney and I always find gifts
under the tree!'' Bono added. ``What's THAT about?''
</P>
<P>
   Equally stunning was the surprise resignation of Claus' head
elf, Jimmy ``The Fixer'' Spritely, who announced he would be
leaving his post in the wake of an Internet report alleging
numerous extra-elfin affairs over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot in good conscience ask for Mr. Claus to resign if I
do not lead by example,'' said Spritely. ``As much as it pains me
and my family to admit this, I did indeed stray from the path of
fidelity years ago, indulging in youthful indiscretions with, oh,
about 11 or 12 elfin interns.__ OW!!''
</P>
<P>
   (Spritely's ``Ow!'' remark was apparently in reaction to the
kick in the shins he received from his wife, Lonnie, who was
standing next to him during his announcement.)
</P>
<P>
   The Spritely story was published in the on-line version of
Barely Legal magazine and was then picked up by The Washington
Post. A spokesman for the newspaper said the fact that Barely Legal
had already gone with the story compelled it to do follow-up
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was already out there for the whole world to see,'' The
Post's spokesman said. ``What are we supposed to do, ignore it?''
</P>
<P>
   Barely Legal's on-line site has a daily readership of
approximately 143, according to a Barely Legal spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mr. Claus, he issued a defiant statement vowing never to
resign and to continue his job: the business of ``manufacturing
toys for good girls and boys the world over.'' While Congress
debated his fate, Claus and Mrs. Claus followed a business-as-usual
routine. This included ``making a list and checking it twice,''
according to a North Pole spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   When Claus appeared briefly in public to feed his reindeer, he
ignored the shouted questions of reporters _ although some
observers claimed he bellowed a hearty ``Ho ho ho!'' in the
direction of Sam Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was an editorial comment,'' said the North Pole
spokesman, who refused to elaborate.

 Includes a color slide of Joseph Fiennes in a scene from
``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ralph Fiennes may do Shakespeare, but Joseph Fiennes is
Shakespeare.
 &HT;    Well, at least in his current movie. Playing the immortal bard
in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' opening nationwide Dec. 25, the younger
Fiennes once and for all escapes his brother's shadow, proving his
own merit as a master of light comedy and passionate romance alike
_ and, oh yes, as a Hollywood hunk to boot.
 &HT;    After all, the man currently sitting down for an interview at
Manhattan's Parker Meridian Hotel, flashing long, seductive
eyelashes and a boy's mischievous smile, can be seen romping au
naturel with Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow in his first two
films, both currently playing.
 &HT;    That would include the critically acclaimed period drama
``Elizabeth,'' in which Fiennes as the lustful Earl of Leicester
engages in some anything-but-chaste revels with the so-called
``virgin queen,'' and ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a romantic comedy in
which Fiennes plays a lovesick bard struggling with writer's block
as he tries to pen a new play, ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's
Daughter.''
 &HT;    And romping around with a naked Paltrow, which is a heck of a
way to start a big-screen career.
 &HT;    ``Oh, it's not as glamorous as one might think,'' Fiennes
insists. ``I'm so shy that these scenes were torture for me. Give
me a sword fight any day.''
 &HT;    Believe it or not, he's serious.
 &HT;    ``Let's start with the fact that Gwyneth's boyfriend, Ben
Affleck, is in this movie,'' the actor says. ``And he's a big guy.
You don't want to get on the wrong side of Ben and say, `Guess
what? I will be spending the duration of the day in a bed with your
girlfriend.'
 &HT;    ``Thankfully, our director, John Madden, placed the love scenes
in the middle of shooting,'' he adds, ``and Gwyneth and I already
got on like a house on fire. Still, we had a bit of a laugh when we
had to get into bed. It was so surreal. But then we just got on
with it.''
 &HT;    Actually, Fiennes says, he didn't expect to wind up anywhere
near that bed.
 &HT;    ``I blew the audition for this movie,'' he recalls. ``I gave a
horrendous reading of the script when I first read for John. About
a month later he called, saying he managed to squeeze some
potential out of it.''
 &HT;    A screen test with Paltrow followed, and he was suddenly faced
with the challenge of being Shakespeare.
 &HT;    ``In one sense, he's sacred ground to so many people like
academics and theater-goers,'' Fiennes says. ``On the other hand,
from the little research that I did, William Shakespeare is a blank
sheet _ no one really knows anything about him as a man. So it was
a bit of a can of worms.
 &HT;    ``You can profile him from the sonnets and from the plays, but
his faith, his politics, his sexuality and his take on life is a
mystery,'' the actor says. ``From my sense, that's great. No one
can say that I did it right or wrong.''
 &HT;    For insight on a writer's mind, Fiennes turned to his novelist
mother.
 &HT;    ``My mother told me that writing was one of the most isolating
ways to spend a life,'' he says. ``She felt that the huge amount of
solitude put a shadow on a person, which is what I thought of when
I played William Shakespeare.''
 &HT;    Otherwise, it was a case of working from the script.
 &HT;    ``I figured Shakespeare was a genius who didn't quite know it,''
Fiennes says. ``He knew he was a pretty damn good writer, but he
was also a man who had to pay the rent. He's got writer's block.
All of this indicated to me someone who was knocking out his plays
to pay the rent. He was a survivor.''
 &HT;    The same applies to the actor, who comes from a family of
survivors. The youngest of six children _ his fraternal twin Jacob,
now a gamekeeper, is minutes older _ he grew up in a family
constantly on the go, as a child moving a dozen times to various
spots in both Ireland and England. His father was a sculptor, while
his mother was a writer.
 &HT;    ``Being the youngest makes you long for more of a voice,'' he
says. ``You find that voice early in theatrics of the kitchen. I
was the one screaming, `Hey, where is my food?'''
 &HT;    Given their genes, it's perhaps not surprising that the six
children include three actors and a director among them.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what it is that made us all find careers of
expression,'' Fiennes says. ``Maybe it has something to do with my
mother and father having careers that were creative. There was
never a lack of stimulus in terms of literature or painting and
drawing.''
 &HT;    He pauses.
 &HT;    ``I know I'm making it sound so romantic and bohemian,'' he
says. ``It wasn't. It was chaotic, dirty and noisy. I couldn't wait
to get out. I guess that was the stimulus.''
 &HT;    For this Fiennes, the path to independence started with his
theatrical debut, in a third-grade production of ``Joseph and the
Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.''
 &HT;    ``The only bad thing is my teacher didn't want me to sing,'' he
recalls. ``She told me to mime it. It hurt my feelings.''
 &HT;    But by age 9 he was on his way, performing in youth theater at
the Young Vic. Two years later he was studying at the Guild Hall of
Music and Drama in London, where he spent three years training for
the stage.
 &HT;    After a year off in Italy, where he worked on the reconstruction
of a 12th-century villa, Fiennes returned to England and the
theater.
 &HT;    ``Ever since I've been battling for parts,'' he says.
 &HT;    Ironically, his rise to stardom may have been slowed by his
brother's own ascent. Seeing the public spotlight that has followed
Ralph Fiennes since ``Schindler's List'' (1993) left his shyer
brother feeling awkward.
 &HT;    ``I keep thinking about what that costs in terms of your persona
and how much you would like to keep your persona under wraps,'' he
says. ``Unfortunately, to a certain degree you've got to let a
little bit of it go. That's rough for me, because deep down I am
shy.''
 &HT;    Well, maybe. His brother also once claimed to be shy, only to
turn up on the cover of Vanity Fair shirtless and wild-haired in
leather pants.
 &HT;    ``That was just too many vodkas,'' Joseph Fiennes says,
laughing.
 &HT;    His two Elizabethan adventures just might make Fiennes the most
popular member of the family. But the actor, who is single and
lives in London, isn't making any such plans.
 &HT;    ``I don't know where I'm going,'' he says, not apparently overly
concerned about it. ``Any job I've ever taken has not been about
pursuing fame. The only thing I can do is respond to certain
material. If that leads to a career, then so be it.''

 Includes a color slide of Randy Owen, Teddy Gentry, Jeff Cook and
Mark Herndon of the country band Alabama. 
 By JANET E. WILLIAMS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Since their 1980 debut, Alabama has received virtually every
accolade the music business has to offer: gold albums, platinum
albums, multiplatinum albums, Grammy Awards, American Music Awards
and more.
 &HT;    They've also proven their durability. With 41 No. 1 records _
probably 42 by the time you read this _ to their credit, the four
members of Alabama continue to tour, playing to sold-out crowds
year after year.
 &HT;    In 1998, Randy Owen, Teddy Gentry, Jeff Cook and Mark Herndon
commemorated their success with ``For the Record,'' a 45-song
retrospective that featured all 41 chart-topping hits, plus three
new tunes. The first single from the two-CD set, ``How Do You Fall
In Love?,'' was an instant hit.
 &HT;    And, just as the Fort Payne, Ala.-reared foursome hit the
concert trail for the new album, they learned that they would be
honored with a star on the legendary Hollywood Walk of Fame.
 &HT;    All in all, they're entitled to rest on their laurels, but show
no inclination to do so. Even if they did, Cook claims, they
couldn't, because they need the money.
 &HT;    ``We're at the awkward time in our lives when we're too old to
work and too broke to quit,'' he says. ``We're driven to work.''
 &HT;    `` ... by our moms,'' adds Herndon, the group's jokester.
 &HT;    Actually, Owen says in all seriousness, the band is driven.
 &HT;    ``It's a motivation for excellence,'' he says. ``Excellence
meaning success, musical success. I realized after about three or
four years in the music business, having all these No. 1 records,
you're not ever going to be a rich person. You have four guys in a
band, you have many people that work for you, you have the
government who is more than willing to take ... ''
 &HT;    `` ... all of your money,'' Gentry finishes the sentence.
 &HT;    ``Or at least half of it,'' Cook says with a straight face.
 &HT;    ``I mean really, this is true,'' Owen insists, undistracted.
``We've made lots of gross money, as a band. Now, if you was one
guy or one girl, it'd be different.''
 &HT;    ``You'd wind up giving even more to the government,'' Herndon
adds, laughing.
 &HT;    ``We could retire and all of us go home and be comfortable the
rest of our lives,'' Gentry admits. ``But be rich?
 &HT;    ``I relate to Michael Jordan,'' he says. ``Does Michael want to
win any less than he did back six years ago? You can see it on his
face _ he wants to win even more, I think. When he comes down on
the floor, he doesn't make that shot because of his salary. If he
didn't make that shot, he would still draw the salary.
 &HT;    ``I think it's the pride _ it's the pride you have, we have of
putting out good product,'' the musician concludes. ``I think if we
didn't believe we had a good product, we wouldn't want to put it
out.''
 &HT;    In almost 20 years in the music business, the band says, nothing
much has gotten easier.
 &HT;    ``The deck's stacked against us now,'' Gentry says. ``Why I say
that is because when we broke in, we were the darlings of the
business. Like Minnie Pearl told Randy, `Right now you're the
little darlings, but as soon as everybody knows you, after you've
been successful for a number of years,' she said, `that's when the
industry is ready to write you off.'
 &HT;    ``I think we've lived through all that,'' he adds, ``and we're
still around because of one reason _ the fans and our own
determination to do what we're doing.''
 &HT;    ``I think the industry expects you to become more complacent,''
Gentry concludes. ``Or I guess, after all the success, they think
you should reach a point where you don't care, you don't have the
pride or the drive to do it at the level you've been doing it at.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, in an industry often rife with exploitation and
underhandedness, Alabama enjoys a healthy respect pretty much
across the board.
 &HT;    ``I think the industry knows that we haven't cut every song that
we've wrote over the years, that we've really looked to try to keep
our career up by cutting the best songs available to us,'' Gentry
says. ``We've made a lot of young songwriters' lives by going out
and cutting a song and it being on an album or being a single.
 &HT;    ``I think we have a reputation among the publishers in town that
we're all fair people,'' he adds, ``that if you write a hit song
and Alabama gets it in their hands, political reasons won't keep
them from cutting it if they believe it's a hit.''
 &HT;    Though many of their hits were written by others, ``How Do You
Fall In Love?'' is a collaboration between Gentry, Owen and road
manager Greg Fowler.
 &HT;    ``We were working on this song two or three different times on
the bus,'' Owen recalls, ``and then, I guess on the highway coming
back from Seattle, we kind of finalized it.''
 &HT;    ``I carried the melody around for several months and had no idea
what to put to it,'' Gentry says. ``Greg, me and Randy was supposed
to get together and write one day, and Greg said, `I just jotted
down some lines the other night.' He just wrote down some things he
was thinking about.
 &HT;    ``The title was one of the lines that was in the verse,'' he
continues. ``We took that line and it fit the hook, and from there
we got together and started working on it.
 &HT;    ``It seemed so simple when we finished it,'' Gentry adds. ``The
mark of a really great song, to me, is it felt like it didn't need
anything else, at 2 1/2, not quite three minutes long.''
 &HT;    Early ``test audiences'' confirmed that the song would work.
 &HT;    ``I went in and sang it for my kids,'' Owen says. ``They said,
`You are gonna cut that ballad, aren't you?' My son told me, `I'm
really excited about this.'''
 &HT;    Some country purists have complained that the arrangement is a
bit heavier on strings that the usual Alabama fare.
 &HT;    ``It's what the song calls for,'' Gentry says calmly. ``First
time I heard it, when they played it back to us in the studio, I
went, `Whoa! This is a little strong for Alabama.' In fact, I
wanted to come back in and remix it.
 &HT;    ``I called Randy on Saturday morning and we was talking, and he
said, `I've listened to it a few times, and I'm kind of starting to
like it.' So I backed off for a couple of days.
 &HT;    ``It sounds really new for Alabama, a little different place
than where we've been before,'' he admits. ``Which is what we've
got to keep doing. You've got to try to pave a new road.''
 &HT;    That was the idea of ``For the Record,'' Gentry says, a
greatest-hits album that was as much about the future as the past.
 &HT;    ``The whole thing starts out with these three new songs,''
Gentry says. ``To me, let's start with where Alabama's at now, and
then we'll reflect back on where we've been. You think back about
where you was at and what you was doing that year.''
 &HT;    Owen agrees.
 &HT;    ``I guess for me it's futuristic,'' he says, ``looking for the
future.''

ROBERT RODRIGUEZ: A `FACULTY' FOR FEAR

 Includes a color slide of Robert Rodriguez directing Jon Stewart in
a scene from ``The Faculty.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Blame it on the aliens.
 &HT;    If it weren't for creatures from beyond, we might not have
Robert Rodriguez and such films as ``El Mariachi'' (1992),
``Desperado'' (1995) and ``From Dusk Till Dawn'' (1996).
 &HT;    Really.
 &HT;    ``The movies that were the most important to me, the ones that
were my favorites _ like `Blade Runner' (1982), `The Thing' (1982),
`Alien' (1979), `Escape from New York' (1981), `Road Warrior'
(1981), Sam Raimi and David Cronenberg movies _ all came out when I
was about 12 or 13,'' the director says with boyish energy during a
conversation at Beverly Hills' Four Season Hotel. ``That's when
everything opened up for me.
 &HT;    ``That's when I realized, `Well, I could maybe make movies, too.
I want to do that. I think I'm going to try.'''
 &HT;    And now, as of Christmas Day, Rodriguez is back where it all
began. That's when his latest film, ``The Faculty,'' is set to
debut.
 &HT;    The science-fiction movie, a sort of ``Body Snatchers Go to High
School,'' has everything that it takes to generate pre-release
buzz, including a script by red-hot ``Scream'' scribe Kevin
Williamson, a cast that's part gorgeous newcomers and part familiar
veterans, and of course Rodriguez's trademark restless camerawork,
nifty editing and booming soundscape.
 &HT;    Life at Herrington High resembles that of any high school. The
faculty (including Robert Patrick, Piper Laurie, Bebe Neuwirth and
Salma Hayek) may be a bit out of touch, and the students range from
jock (Shawn Hatosy) to geek (Elijah Wood) to brilliant drug dealer
(Josh Hartnett), and from bitchy cheerleader (Jordana Brewster) to
outsider (Clea Duvall) to eager-to-please new girl in town (Laura
Harris).
 &HT;    Everything turns upside down, however, when aliens take over the
faculty and it's up to the students to save themselves, their
school and _ oh yeah _ mankind from the hideous extraterrestrials.
 &HT;    ``I recreated my high school, right down to the mascot, the
colors, the way the teachers looked and dressed, and even some of
the lines they said,'' says Rodriguez, who was born and raised in
San Antonio, Texas. ``I was a combination of the characters played
by Elijah and Shawn.
 &HT;    ``I was Shawn because I was really big at that age,'' he
explains. ``My school was small, and they needed people to play on
the sports teams. My brother was good at sports, but I hated them
and never felt comfortable. I liked drawing and making videos.
 &HT;    ``In that sense I was like Elijah's character, the guy always
taking pictures,'' he says. ``The girls never even looked at me.
They'd say, `Oh, he's going to marry his camera someday.' I was
more the loner.''
 &HT;    The sets may have looked familiar to Rodriguez, but everything
else about ``The Faculty'' was alien territory. It was more or less
the first time he'd worked with a script which he hadn't at least
co-written. The budget was $20 million, modest by Hollywood
standards but vastly beyond any of his previous films. And never
before had he put so large a cast through its paces.
 &HT;    Still ...
 &HT;    ``This was probably the most fun I've had on a movie,'' he says.
``I had a lot of freedom and got to do the movie my way. We knew it
would be entertaining if we did it right. There was so much going
on on the set, so much variety.
 &HT;    ``For two weeks straight I worked just with the kids,'' the
director recalls, ``and they were all fresh, really there, and did
whatever I asked. They didn't know what it was supposed to be like
yet.
 &HT;    ``Then for the next two weeks I worked with all these
professionals, like Piper and Bebe and Robert, who gave the set a
different vibe,'' he says. ``I felt like I was making five
different movies, between the young actors, the veterans, the
special-effect sequences and all of that.''
 &HT;    Like many veterans of independent films, Rodriguez doesn't
aspire to helm mega-budget blockbusters. The $20 million
``Faculty'' was about his speed, he says.
 &HT;    ``I understand why movies can cost $80 million,'' he admits.
``It's not always a matter of effects or big stars, but it can be a
lack of planning or of getting too much of what you want rather
than just what you need.
 &HT;    ``It's better not to get everything you want,'' the director
adds. ``It makes you think, `How do I achieve this without turning
on the money hose?' You have to be creative.''
 &HT;    Rodriguez has been making movies since he got his first
home-movie camera in childhood. He studied film at the University
of Texas in Austin, and first displayed his creativity with ``El
Mariachi,'' an acclaimed action thriller about a musician mistaken
for a murderous outlaw.
 &HT;    It was a prototypical low-budget film: Rodriguez not only
directed but also served as writer, camera operator and editor, and
the final tab came to an astounding $7,000.
 &HT;    On the heels of its success came ``Roadracers'' (1994), a
cable-TV movie with Salma Hayek and David Arquette, and
``Desperado,'' a ``Mariachi'' sequel starring Hayek and Antonio
Banderas. Rodriguez followed those with ``The Misbehavers,'' a
segment of the misbegotten 1995 anthology ``Four Rooms,'' and
``From Dusk Till Dawn,'' the over-the-top vampire thriller with
George Clooney, Harvey Keitel and Quentin Tarantino.
 &HT;    ``It's funny, but as much as I've done since `El Mariachi,' I
almost want to try to go back to the simplicity of that film,''
Rodriguez says. ``I want to go back to the art of just creating
something with complete abandon, as I did on that movie.
 &HT;    ``I didn't think anybody would ever see `El Mariachi,''' he
adds. ``I made choices that were my own, and I didn't think about
an audience, critics or a studio looking over my shoulder.
 &HT;    ```Desperado' was for a studio. We did it in 35 millimeter and I
had a crew. And I've kept going from there. I hope I've grown and
that I keep growing.''
 &HT;    Rodriguez, who lives in Austin, Texas, with his wife/producer
Elizabeth Avellan and their two sons _ a third is due in January _
is currently writing a family feature that he plans to direct in
March. He's also executive-produced two completed films, ``The
Hangman's Daughter'' and ``Texas Blood Money,'' a prequel and a
sequel, respectively, to ``From Dusk Till Dawn.'' Both films were
made for direct-to-video release, and should be out in early 1999.
 &HT;    This sort of unpretentious, low-profile work feeds the
occasional criticisms of Rodriguez: He's an undeniable talent, some
say, who is frivoling it away on unworthy projects.
 &HT;    The director shrugs.
 &HT;    ``I enjoy making entertainment,'' he says. ``I enjoy making
entertainment totally as a learning device. I think I learn more by
making the kinds of movies I'm making than I would if I just went
and made a drama that represents the script.''
 &HT;    Rodriguez shakes his head, groping for words.
 &HT;    ``That kind of movie, it's all there on the page,'' he says.
``It might be a good movie, but you have nothing to do for the next
10 months. I don't think I'd learn from that.
 &HT;    ``If I get a piece of material that I want to see exist as a
movie, I might do it for the sake of the movie, not for the sake of
the craft,'' he adds. ``The craft itself is more fun, more creative
and more satisfying when it's some type of entertainment that needs
to be completely created.
 &HT;    ``I like to create a moment with shots and angles and edits and
sounds, rather than just shoot a moment on film. And I don't think
that will ever change.''

   He's a tad heavier, his hair's snow white and there's an equally
white mustache now, but those blue eyes still sparkle, and when Van
Dyke laughs he still sounds like Rob chuckling at his dizzy wife
Laura or cracking up at a Buddy Sorell one-liner.
</P>
<P>
   And, since he who laughs last laughs best, these days Van Dyke
is laughing a lot. At 73, he's the star of one of television's most
popular hour-long dramas, ``Diagnosis Murder,'' which is a top-30
show for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   That he's playing Dr. Dick Sloan, who doubles as a suave senior
sleuth, is worth a laugh, Van Dyke adds. In real life, he says, he
has never been a fan of medical or mystery dramas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a business!'' he says, chuckling. ``I have no idea how I
ended up playing a doctor and a sleuth. We did a few
movies-of-the-week, it turned into a series and now it's been six
straight years of episodic television. The show's a hit, and it's
the one time in my entire career when I can't figure out exactly
why. I have no idea, but I'm having a terrific time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Diagnosis Murder'' is unabashedly wholesome, clean family fare
that manages to tell crime stories without any of the violence, sex
or nudity that abounds elsewhere in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the stuff on TV, I just think, `My God, so much
trash,''' Van Dyke says, his laughter fading. ``What are the kids
taking out of this? And the producers and networks and movie
studios keep saying: `We are simply reflecting the culture.' Well,
they're not _ they're shaping the culture. They're getting to these
kids, because they have all the money to spend on advertising, and
they're shaping the way they think.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a family show,'' he adds, ``and I know there are a lot
of young people watching us, along with the older viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyke is entitled to assess the state of the televised art.
After more than 40 years on the small screen, he's a genuine
television icon, but still the lanky, likeable Montana boy who grew
up idolizing silent comedians such as Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy and
Buster Keaton.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Air Force during World War II, Van Dyke
first made a failed attempt to launch an ad agency, then decided to
go into show business. After winning his spurs in 1950s radio, he
graduated to the then-fledgling medium of television, hosting ``CBS
Cartoon Theatre'' and appearing as a regular on ABC's ``The Andy
Williams Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile he was also working in the theater. The 1960 Broadway
hit ``Bye-Bye Birdie'' won him a Tony Award, and in turn caught the
eye of writer/comedian Carl Reiner, who was putting together an
innovative sitcom based on his own career as a comedy writer and
New Rochelle suburbanite.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, is television history. Van Dyke became
Rob Petrie and the show became a hit, earning him three Emmy Awards
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV comedy is the toughest,'' he says in retrospect. ``It's the
most fun, but it's the toughest. Carl Reiner was really the one
responsible for it all. You have to have that one brilliant,
creative person in charge, and that was Carl.''
</P>
<P>
   His version of Rob was based primarily on his childhood hero,
Stan Laurel, Van Dyke says. During the show's run he had the chance
to meet Laurel, and told him so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I've stolen a lot from you over the years,''' Van
Dyke recalls, ``and he said, `I know!' But I think he was
flattered.''
</P>
<P>
   During ``The Dick Van Dyke Show's'' six-year run and immediately
after, its namesake acted in more than a dozen movies, but he never
quite became a film star. Forgettable comedies such as ``What A Way
To Go!'' (1964), ``The Art of Love'' (1965) and ``Fitzwilly''
(1967) were mixed with a few classics, such as ``Chitty Chitty Bang
Bang'' (1968) and, particularly, ``Mary Poppins'' (1964).
</P>
<P>
   ``What fun that was,'' he says, grinning at the memory. ``It was
all done on Walt Disney's sound stage, and there's not an outdoor
shot in it. In the scenes where I was dancing with the penguins,
the animators were right there, telling me how high and how far
away the birds were. It was meticulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walt was planning a sequel around the same time he died,'' Van
Dyke adds. ``And the whole project fell through.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyke was always a physical comedian who liked to toss his
body around with abandon. The pratfall he takes in the opening
credits of ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' was the least of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't hurt at the time,'' he says. ``I took so many falls
in my life that my spine looked like the Colorado River. So I've
got some arthritis now. But I swim, I do weight exercises three
times a week and I do yoga stretching. I exercise by keeping moving
_ it's the best guard against arthritis.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there have been other struggles for Van Dyke over
his career. In 1972, he admitted publicly that he was an alcoholic.
Shortly after completing rehabilitation, he used the experience in
an award-winning television movie, ``The Morning After,'' in which
he played a middle-aged businessman whose life falls apart because
of the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, because of that film, I get more mail from people
who've been in rehab and saw it there,'' he says. ``They use it
because of its authenticity. I'm so proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Van Dyke is enjoying one of the best stretches of
his career. The ``Diagnosis'' set is only a few miles from his
Malibu home, where he lives with his longtime mate, Michelle
Marvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a five-minute commute for me, so it's ideal,'' he says.
``And, out of deference to my age, they limit the amount of hours I
have to work, which is lovely.''
</P>
<P>
   Another perk is getting to work with his son, Barry Van Dyke,
who has a regular role as Detective Steve Sloan on ``Diagnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good-looking guy, and he does a great job,'' Van Dyke
Sr. says proudly. ``He's actually very funny, and I wish they would
show that more, but there's not much opportunity for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, ``Diagnosis Murder'' will run, Van Dyke promises,
``as long as I'm still standing and can make it to work.''
</P>
<P>
   He still keeps in touch with his old ``Dick Van Dyke Show''
pals, including Mary Tyler Moore and especially Reiner, who lives
near him. But he admits to disappointment that ``Mary and Rhoda,''
the long-awaited, much-hyped CBS sitcom reuniting Moore and Valerie
Harper, has apparently fallen by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows she had a pilot with Valerie, and I guess it
just didn't go,'' he says, sighing. ``There again, it wasn't the
quality of the show, it was the fact that it skewed older. The
networks say advertisers won't buy commercials directed at an older
audience. I think they're wrong, because the yuppie generation is
turning 50 now, and they control all the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkable we're still on the air,'' he concludes, ``but
there has to be room out there for a family show.''

 &HT;    COST OF A PRESIDENTIAL BID: $2,500 AN HOUR THROUGHOUT 1999

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Any presidential candidate who wants to win a major
party's nomination in 2000 will have to raise at least $22 million
in 1999, campaign finance experts say.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republican or Democratic hopeful who starts New Year's
Day, that comes to more than $2,500 an hour, 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising that much doesn't mean you're going to win, but it
means you have a chance,'' said political scientist Herbert
Alexander, who has published book-length studies of the financing
of each presidential election since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some scholars have come to regard fund-raising in the
pre-election year as the invisible primary,'' agreed John Green,
director of the University of Akron's Bliss School of Applied
Politics.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who raised the most early money has captured his
party's nomination in every presidential election since 1976, when
reporting of pre-primary finances was first required.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard reality that will drive next year's quest for money
is that candidates will be so busy campaigning during the heart of
the 2000 primary season that they simply won't have much time to
raise funds.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 states may hold their caucuses or primaries on or
before March 11, 2000. If they do, candidates will have to appeal
to three-fourths of the nation's voters by that date.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous election years, candidates won't be able to
concentrate solely on the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire
primary for the first two months. They'll have to buy lots of ads
or make expensive campaign trips to attract news coverage in huge
states such as California, Florida and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you do well in Iowa or New Hampshire, you'll have only
a week or two before New York and California,'' Alexander said.
``You can't possibly raise big bucks in that short a time, so
you'll need money in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander set the realistic minimum to be raised in 1999 by ``a
serious contender'' at $25 million. The $22 million estimate came
from accountant Stan Huckaby, whose Virginia-based firm has kept
the books for hundreds of Republican campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Democrat and two Republicans definitely could raise
that much in 1999, said political scientist Paul Herrnson(cq) of
the University of Maryland. The Democrat is Vice President Al Gore
of Tennessee. The Republicans are Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and
publisher Malcolm ``Steve'' Forbes of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Al Gore has a national network of people he can call
on, and the same is true of George W. (Bush), who will inherit the
Bush dynasty'' from his father, former President George H.W. Bush,
Herrnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has spent the last two years honing his fund-raising
ability and is rich enough to use his own money if he comes up
short, Herrnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other hopefuls believe they would have a chance if they
raise at least $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can be viable with $15 million to $20 million,
(if) you husband your resources and don't spend them on straw polls
and other distractions in 1999,'' said Ed Gillespie, communications
director for the leadership PAC of Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio. ``If
John runs, we'd hope to have $12 million on hand on Jan. 1, 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans whose records indicate they might raise that
much include conservative activist Gary Bauer of Virginia, former
Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, former Vice President Dan Quayle
of Arizona, and Sens. John McCain of Arizona and John Ashcroft of
Missouri. All have raised at least $3 million for their own
campaigns or their personal political organizations in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats with a solid national fund-raising reputation include
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. John Kerry
of Massachusetts, who met the $3 million threshold in the past two
years, as well as two others who raised that much in the past. The
two are former Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Paul Wellstone
of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're outspent four to one, you're cooked,'' Wellstone's
campaign manager, Dan Lucas, said. ``But if you're only outspent
two to one, you're in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   All those calculations include only ``hard'' money, which under
federal rules can be raised from individuals giving no more than
$1,000 apiece, plus federal funds to match the first $250 from any
of those donors.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement of campaign finance laws has become so lax and
haphazard that Green said he can't even guess at how much
unregulated ``soft'' money will be raised for indirect help to some
of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing fast and loose with the rules will be easier than ever
in 2000,'' Green predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of financing their political travels during 1998 solely
through the small hard-money contributions raised by their
federally regulated committees, at least six hopefuls also formed
state committees or taxable corporations to help out. The federal
committees could accept only non-corporate gifts of $5,000 or less,
but the other organizations could accept soft money from any source
in any amount. Some may use these unregulated organizations to
finance activities in 1999 as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft money's been useful before,'' Green said. Democrat
``Walter Mondale spent a lot early in 1984, but then Gary Hart came
out of nowhere in mid-spring when Mondale was almost out of money.
So labor unions (spending an estimated $5 million) bankrolled
Mondale delegates in various states.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said, ``I just see the creative use of soft money in 2000
as being like 1984 or 1996, but squared or cubed.''

EXERCISE WHEN YOU'RE SICK?
</HEADLINE>
  By KEN MCALPINE 
 c.1998 Ken McAlpine 
 World rights 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many studies have been undertaken to ferret out the machinations
of the common cold, but few were as bluntly simple as one conducted
at the Common Cold Clinic in Salisbury, England. Are colds caused
by cold temperature, mused researchers? No, they concluded, when
not a single subject got sick after researchers doused them with
water and had them stand outdoors naked.
</P>
<P>
   A nod to British practicality and stoicism, the study
illustrated two important points. First, it is better to be a
researcher than a subject. Second, contrary to folk wisdom, colds,
flus and their attendant miseries _ goopy heads, sniffly noses,
achy muscles and a basset-faced population that shares them all
with you _ are not caused by being cold. They are caused by viruses
and bacteria. Ruthlessly effective viruses and bacteria that, given
an iota of opening, will lay you low. According to the National
Center for Health Statistics, 90 out of 100 of us are leveled by a
cold each year.
</P>
<P>
   Why does this happen more often during winter? Because we're
jammed together indoors, infector and infectee, flip flopping
roles. But there's another critical piece of the equation. A strong
immune system can rebuff viruses and bacteria. If your immune
system is at its peak, it wins the day and you don't get sick. And
exercise, done wisely, seems to give the immune system a tremendous
boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moderate activity actually ends up improving
immunosurveillance, the ability of the immune system to to protect
you against viruses and bacteria,'' says David C. Nieman, professor
of health and exercise science at Appalachian State University in
Boone, N.C., and one of the leading researchers in the field of
exercise immunology. ``During these times of year where viruses and
bacteria are widespread, a moderate, daily exercise bout might be
as good a medicine as you can take.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies by Nieman and his fellow researchers have shown that
moderate walking, swimming, cycling and running can boost the
levels and effectiveness of some of the immune system's most
valuable defenders, in some cases dramatically. In a recent study,
a large group of women who walked briskly five days a week, 45
minutes a day, for 12 weeks lowered the number of days they
suffered from colds and flu by half. Perhaps those dampened British
subjects were jogging in place when the researchers weren't
looking.
</P>
<P>
   These same studies also highlight another important point. The
immune boost of exercise is only temporary, a matter of hours at
most. So it behooves you, as Nieman's ladies did, to exercise
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a really good housekeeper come in for 30
minutes each day,'' says Nieman. ``The killer cells tidy up the
body and everything stays much cleaner.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately when it comes to fighting off colds and flu,
exercise can also be a curse. Examining exercise and its effect on
immune function, Nieman has also noted several adverse thresholds,
points where exercise swings from benefit to detriment - in short,
weakening the immune system enough to turn you into one of the
mucus minions.
</P>
<P>
   Observing the training habits of over 2,000 marathoners, Nieman
noticed that runners who logged more than 60 miles a week doubled
their odds of getting sick. On a broader scope, in a variety of
sports Nieman found that athletes' immune systems began to show
marked negative effects when they pushed too hard for too long, as
a rule for more than 90 minutes at effort levels above 70 percent
of their maximum.
</P>
<P>
   These immune system suppressions were only temporary. But cold
and flu viruses need only the barest of windows. More often than
not, subjects who exercised hard and long got sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exercising for as long as an hour and twenty minutes at a
solid pace seems to be safe,'' says Nieman. ``But if you work the
body harder, you're taking a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished marathoner himself, Nieman is well aware that
many athletes view moderation in the same light that Beverly Hills
residents view a credit check. Which may be why he recently
conducted a series of studies with elite athletes, studies whose
definitive results shocked even Nieman.
</P>
<P>
   In the depths of cold and flu season, Nieman and his fellow
researchers exercised athletes hard, but had some of them drink a
6-percent carbohydrate sports drink while they did so _ roughly a
liter an hour of the stuff. Almost without exception, the athletes
who got the carbs remained healthy. Those who didn't get the
carbohydrate injection got yucky sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those `Eureka!' moments in research,'' says
Nieman happily. ``It was just unreal the difference. There is every
reason to believe that if athletes keep carbohydrate feeding during
prolonged and heavy exertion, there is less physiological stress to
their immune system.''
</P>
<P>
   In his studies, Nieman used Gatorade, but any sports drink
that's 6 to 8 percent carbohydrate will do _ so will a mix that's
half water and half 100 percent fruit juice (fruit juices alone are
about 12 percent carbohydrate, too concentrated for the body to get
what it needs quickly).
</P>
<P>
   What if it's already too late? What about exercising when you're
already sick? It's a winter dilemma we've all wrestled with. On the
one hand, the need to get the hell out of the house. One the other,
a head clotted with goo.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when exercise of any kind is out of the
question. How sick is too sick?
</P>
<P>
   Flu is too sick, says Nieman. Ditto for fever, extreme
tiredness, muscle aches and swollen lymph glands. These are
symptoms of serious illness, and they demand rest, not activity, if
your immune system is to stamp out the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will exercising with the flu prolong recovery, says
Nieman, it could be dangerous. In some instances the virus spreads
to the heart, where it can cause potentially fatal infection.
</P>
<P>
   For the flu Nieman prescribes unadulterated rest until the
symptoms are completely gone, then nothing but very easy effort for
at least two weeks. Push too hard too soon and you could relapse.
Viral warfare forgives few mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Good news, though, for those who can't stomach idleness. If you
have a cold, a minor headache, a mild sore throat, or all three,
measured activity may be the best remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The science here is sketchy as research institutions are
reluctant to give their scientists the go ahead to shoot viruses up
the noses of human subjects. But from the few studies that have
been done, it appears that the same light activity that boosts your
immune system when you are healthy may also shore up your defenses
when you're already sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still largely theory,'' says Nieman. ``But based on what
I've seen, during the height of a cold moderate activity like a
walk or an easy bike ride is more help than complete rest. But
nothing severe. The intensity should be way down. It's better to
keep it moderate and not push your luck.''

OVARIAN CANCER'S SUBTLE SIGNS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It could begin as an extra trip to the bathroom every night or a
touch of constipation that doesn't go away. Maybe the waist band of
your skirt is getting tight even though you haven't gained weight.
</P>
<P>
   These small symptoms, easily brushed aside as insignificant,
could influence the course of a woman's life. They may be the only
clues you are going to get about the condition of your ovaries.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden deep inside the pelvis where they can't be seen and
sometimes can't be felt, ovaries can develop malignant tumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike cervical cancer which can be caught at a precancerous
stage with a pap test, for ovarian cancer there is no way to find
the precancerous condition. It just suddenly happens and there is
no way to screen for it,'' said Dr. Edgardo Yordan, gynocologic
oncologist at Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Yordan, a top ovarian cancer clinician trained at the
prestigious Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York and
the University of Southern California, deals with up to 60 cases of
ovarian cancer every year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Cancer Institute, 1 in 70 women will
develop ovarian cancer, most cases occuring in women over age 50.
Risks are higher for women with close relatives who have had the
disease, who have no children, or have had breast cancer. Taking
oral contraceptives appears to reduce the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Ovarian cancer is highly treatable and can have a cure rate as
high as 90 to 95 percent, but must be caught at an early stage. If
it spreads undetected, it can metastasize to the abdominal cavity
or occasionally beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treatment of ovarian cancer is very frustrating,'' Yordan
said. ``The best chance is early diagnosis but most people are not
so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in advanced stages of the disease, the norm, the cancer
is treatable with expert surgery and chemotherapy. In fact, the
response rate is among the highest for solid tumors. Unfortunately,
recurrence is frequent and permanent remissions are relatively
few,'' Yordan said.
</P>
<P>
   This is why it's important to be alert to subtle changes, such
as the following, that might be caused by your ovaries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expanding waist line
</P>
<P>
   _ Frequent urination
</P>
<P>
   _ Change in bowel habits
</P>
<P>
   _ Indigestion
</P>
<P>
   _ Loss of appetite
</P>
<P>
   _ Abdominal bloating
</P>
<P>
   _ Pelvic pressure
</P>
<P>
   _ Pain with intercourse
</P>
<P>
   _ Change in menstrual pattern
</P>
<P>
   _ Foul smell to menstrual flow
</P>
<P>
   _ Unusual cramping or pain before menstruation or at ovulation
</P>
<P>
   ``If you develop these symptoms, it's important to follow up,''
said Yordan.
</P>
<P>
   Gynecologists can check the size of the ovaries with a pelvic
exam. They may request a C-125 blood test, which measures a hormone
released by some ovarian cancers, but which can show false
positives or negatives. Ultrasound scans of the pelvis can provide
a picture of the ovaries and even give an idea of whether a cyst is
solid or fluid-filled.
</P>
<P>
   But for the actual diagnosis of cancerous or benign cyst,
surgeons must go in for a look. This sometimes can be done with
minimally-invasive laparoscopy using small scopes inserted through
tiny incisions in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Should cancer be found, major surgery including a total
hysterectomy is needed to remove any visible tumor and sample other
tissues to determine the extent of spread. Statistically, best
results at this stage come from having a gynocologic oncologist on
the surgery team rather than relying exclusively on a gynecologist
or general surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining cancer cells, lingering individuals too small to be
detected surgically or tumors that could not be completely removed,
are eradicated or minimized with chemotherapy. Cure rates have
risen dramatically with the advent of aggressive new chemotherapy
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '70s, ovarian cancer was battled with a single
agent such as cyclophosphamide. The response rate was modest and
the cure rate was zero for advance stage cancer,'' Yordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Now chemotherapeutic agents are teamed up to catch and kill the
maximum number of cancer cells. Currently, taxol with cisplatin has
proven to be the most effective in trials conducted by the
Gynecologic Oncology Group, a collaborative clinical research
group. Carboplatin with taxol is expected to prove equally
effective and safer than cisplatin in current trials.
</P>
<P>
   Chemotherapy also can be injected directly into the abdomen, a
protocol developed in part by Yordan.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful therapy, however, begins with early
diagnosis and prompt attention to subtle body signs, a
responsibility every woman can attend to.
</P>

   SIDEBAR: SUPPORT FOR WOMEN WITH OVARIAN CANCER
</P>
<P>
   When Gilda Radner, 1980s Saturday Night Live comedienne, died of
ovarian cancer at age 40 she left behind a legacy that benefits
cancer patients and survivors today. While dealing with advanced
stage cancer, she found comfort in interacting with people facing
similar struggles.
</P>
<P>
   After her death her husband, actor Gene Wilder, and her
psychotherapist, Joanna Bull, established Gilda's Club to help
support all people living with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Located in major cities across America, Gilda's Club offers free
wellness groups, support for children and teens, networking for
different kinds of cancer, lectures by specialists, enrichment
workshops and stress management, social activies.

SUCCESS AND THE SINGLE MOM
</HEADLINE>
  By MELINDA BLAU 
 c.1998 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You hear about the ``plight'' of the single mother all the time.
She's alone. She's broke. She's exhausted. But chances are you know
at least one single mom who defies that stereotype. She's focused
and in charge; her kids are thriving and happy. So what's the real
story?
</P>
<P>
   There are some 10 million single mothers-divorced and widowed
women and, increasingly, women who choose solo motherhood-in the
United States today. In 1997, they represented 27 percent of all
families with children, compared with 11.5 percent in 1970. Beyond
their growth in numbers, these women are savvy, strong and worth
listening to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see many single mothers who are inspiring for their
resilience, strength, courage, sense of humor and dedication to
their children,'' observes Miriam Galper Cohen, a psychotherapist
based in Philadelphia and author of ``The Joint Custody Handbook.''
The challenges that single moms face _ more hectic schedules, less
money and fewer resources than mothers in two-parent homes have _
often spur them to come up with highly creative, kid-centered
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly difficulties,'' Cohen acknowledges. ``But
with supportive families and friends, these women provide their
children with homes filled with love-the key ingredient in raising
well-adjusted kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are four their most successful strategies:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BANISH MORNING MADNESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Because they alone steer their families through the morning,
single moms tend to wake everyone up early. ``An hour before we
walk out the door, we're all sitting at the table,'' says Val
Jones, a fund-raiser in Media, Pa., and the mother of Spencer, 9,
and Lucy, 6. The key, she says, is an unvarying routine: getting
dressed, then brushing teeth, then making beds. That way, the kids
know exactly what's expected of them.
</P>
<P>
   Getting input from the children is also important because giving
them a say engages their support. Shoshana Alexander, author of
``In Praise of Single Parents,'' enlisted the help of her
9-year-old son, Elias, to plan their morning routine. Together they
made a checklist: wash face, brush teeth, comb hair, feed pets,
make lunch. If he finishes early, Elias is rewarded with extra time
with his friends before school. ``Me bonus for me is that I don't
have to goad him, and I get time to do something calming for
myself,'' comments Alexander, who meditates in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Leah Klungness, co-author of ``The Complete Single
Mother,'' divorced when her children, Andrew and Sarah, were 8 and
3. She notes the importance of anticipating children's needs. The
night before a school day, she would lay out clothes, get book bags
ready and pack lunches.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a last-minute rush _ and the nagging that goes with it
_ Pat Dell-Ross, a clinical social worker in Boston, sets a timer
to ring 10 minutes before 10-year-old Jesse's bus arrives.
``Otherwise, he dawdles until the bus is here and then relies on me
to grab everything he needs,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Similar strategies are crucial at night too, when tired single
moms are forced to be especially resourceful. After all, there is
no one else around to take the baby or help with homework. For her
part, Jones prohibits television at night. ``It just sucks up time,
and we don't have that much,'' she says. And dinner is always eaten
by candlelight. ``Even if we're having macaroni and cheese,'' she
says, ``it makes the meal more civilized. Sitting down to dinner,
reading stories and snuggling before bed are the best parts of the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STICK TO A SCHEDULE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A finely honed daily routine is the cornerstone of family life,
especially for single mothers. Jones breaks up her day into blocks
of time. She leaves work at 5 p.m. and picks up Lucy at daycare by
5:45 and Spencer from his dad's by 6. She's home by 6:15. Between
6:30 and 7, dinner goes on the table; at 7:30, she and the kids
play a game or do a puzzle; bath and bedtime come soon afterward.
``There's a lot of nudging along the way,'' Jones admits, ``but
it's important for children to have structure. Otherwise, I become
Sergeant Mom!''
</P>
<P>
   Routine not only helps you avoid becoming a cop but also teaches
your kids important lessons about responsibility and independence.
Many single moms, like Dell-Ross, rely on blackboards and timers,
which motivate kids in a nonthreatening way. ``Developmentally,
young children don't have a good notion of time,'' Dr. Klungness
explains. ``Timers and calendars teach them about time
management.'' Dell-Ross adds, ``Because the timer is an outside
arbiter, it's easier for Jesse to accept''
</P>
<P>
   Being organized is also critical, says Klungness. She suggests,
``Run your home like a business.'' Set times for meals, homework,
and chores. Keep a calendar, and use a different color pen for each
child's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Because the job of running a household falls squarely on their
shoulders, single mothers start doling out responsibility early.
Dell-Ross, for example, encourages Jesse to take part in dinner
preparation. Even as a preschooler, he could do simple tasks like
helping to make a salad and stirring cake batter. Now he also
pitches in with grocery shopping and recycling. Sharing tasks is
particularly important in single-parent families, says Stephanie
Coontz, author of ``The Way We Really Are: Coming to Terms With
America's Changing Families.'' ``Working side by side is great. It
makes the child feel like part of the family team,'' she reports.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DON'T BE `BEST FRIENDS' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Mom is the only parent at home, she tends to have an
especially close relationship with her children. ``It's an
intimate, almost blurred generational bond,'' says Coontz. These
moms have to sidestep the trap of becoming ``best friends'' with
their kids. The key is to set limits, because that establishes your
role as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids feel secure when they know there are limits,'' Klungness
agrees. ``You can say yes more and no less if you anticipate
debates and give children a choice ahead of time.'' For instance,
when you need to go to the supermarket, let your child help you
make out the shopping list, but stay in charge by saying, ``We can
buy ice cream-what flavor do you want?'' Or, before a birthday
celebration, say: ``Which two friends do you want to invite?''
</P>
<P>
   With children over the age of 3, regular ``house meetings'' can
be very helpful in limit setting as well. ``The formal context
gives a child the safety to express whats bothering him, to say
what he thinks is or isn't fair,'' Alexander says. ``And a meeting
is an important external authority that takes pressure off Mom. It
says, `We both have to live by this.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEARN TO HANDLE YOUR ANGER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Single moms know they can't afford to lose it _ there's no one
else around to step in. But if you've set clear limits and
established expectations of your child, even if he's a toddler,
``your anger is less likely to get out of control,'' maintains Jane
Mattes, author of ``Single Mothers by Choice'' and mother of a son,
Eric.
</P>
<P>
   Most single moms try to calm themselves before their anger
spirals out of control. If Jones has a rough day or feels that the
walls are closing in on her at home, she takes a walk outside or
goes into her bedroom to listen to music for a bit. Her children,
at 6 and 9, are old enough to play by themselves for a while.
</P>
<P>
   With children under the age of 2, try to change the scene. Put
your child in the stroller and go outside or walk around inside
your house, suggests Mattes. ``With older children, reassure them
by saying, 'I'm just grouchy. I'm not mad at you.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of overload, instead of feeling beaten down and
resentful, Alexander's best remedy is to play a game or sit down
and read with Elias. Or they turn on the radio and dance. ``It
always brings me back to the here and now,'' she explains.

HYPERTEXT FICTION ADDS A THIRD DIMENSION 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 c.1998 CyberTimes 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hypertext fiction was born in the mid-1980s when writers tried
to expand the boundaries of literature by using computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
   But technology's boundaries have expanded since then, so
hypertext-fiction authors are now experimenting with techniques
that literally introduce a new dimension into their work.
</P>
<P>
   Holo-X and Waxweb, a pair of Web-based projects that were
launched independently on Thursday, employ Virtual Reality Markup
Language (VRML) software to create three-dimensional environments
for their words and images. The Tomb Robbers, a work-in-progress
that was put online last week, incorporates 360-degree QuickTime VR
panoramas that serve both as illustrations and story-navigation
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Moulthrop, author of ``The Tomb Robbers'' and a
hypertext-fiction pioneer, said, ``I feel pretty strongly that
virtual space has profound aesthetic possibilities. These may not
be narrative so much as something else, but stories are a way to
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Most examples of hypertext fiction, whether disk- or Web-based,
expect readers to immerse themselves in a story by clicking on
highlighted words, which are in turn linked to other written
passages.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, though, high-tech wordsmiths have routinely
employed drawings, photographs and other two-dimensional graphics
to lend meaning to their on-screen tales, so 3-D software was an
inevitable addition to the genre's ever-expanding palette of
multimedia tools.
</P>
<P>
   Those who intend to visit Holo-X must be forewarned that its
language is as rude as its graphics are crude. The writing on the
site is hyperlinked erotica, and while much of it strays down
conceptual pathways, there are still plenty of explicit
descriptions and more than a few naughty words. At the same time,
the graphics sport the cartoonish look that currently characterizes
VRML.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are able to enjoy or overlook the content, Holo-X
offers a fascinating glimpse at the future of hypertext. At its
best, fiction creates a world of its own. Here, it is embodied by
one, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Albeit a simple one. Once the Holo-X site loads on a browser
that has been configured with the correct VRML plug-in, a 3-D
rendering of a single room appears on the screen. Visitors can
twirl around the space and zoom in on objects like a diary or a
wall socket that are connected to pop-up windows filled with
hyperlinked text. The site also contains a number of multimedia
elements, like a boom box that leads to music files.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovative aspect of the site is a ``dialogue engine''
that generates the comments of the site's shapely protagonist, the
Sorceress of Language in Uncharted Territories (you can work out
the acronym yourself). Her comments, which appear as text, are
generated randomly, but the choices have been carefully programmed
so as not to lose the thread of meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a substantial amount of writing,'' said Jay
Dillemuth, one of Holo-X's authors, in an interview from his
Berkeley, Calif., office. ``If it was all played linearly, there
would be over two-and-a-half hours of her talking.'' Instead, each
of the 20 possible scenes lasts 1 to 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The prose was penned by a half-dozen contributors, including
Dillemuth, Alex Cory and Caroline E. White, the site's principal
partners, and Mark Amerika, author of the hypertext fiction
Grammatron. When not romping in the gutter, the writing often
aspires to the poetic, as in this example: ``The joyful night in
inky spasms descends upon the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Holo-X's function is somewhat akin to that of a mink stole on a
prostitute: the high-toned site is designed to lure readers to
XRave, an adult-oriented virtual community that the partners plan
to open on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   But Dillemuth maintained that Holo-X also represents an honest
effort to find a wider audience for experimental poetry and
hypertext fiction. ``That's where the sex comes from,'' he said.
``It's a way to bring users in and then undermine their
expectations by having it be smarter than it normally would be.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, David Blair's Waxweb became the first hypertext
fiction with VRML elements to be published on the Web. A
science-fiction story about an engineer who keeps bees that
eventually keep him, Waxweb began life as a full-length feature
film in 1992. The film was the first to be transmitted on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Blair launched a final, considerably more elaborate
version of the project. He also unveiled a preview site for his
next film- and VRML-based project, the abbreviated title of which
is The Telepathic Motion Picture of the Lost Tribes.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1995 iteration of the Waxweb site, Blair took objects
from the movie, rendered them in 3-D and transformed them into
navigation devices. They continue to work in this fashion in the
new incarnation, but the New York artist has created new animation
for the objects and integrated them with the site's text and a
streaming-video version of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the site's complexity can be daunting, but once its
icon-driven commands are mastered, Waxweb's world of evocative
imagery comes alive, in part because it demands a high level of
user involvement.
</P>
<P>
   For Blair, the spatial attributes of VRML are essential to the
aesthetic mix, plunging his viewers into ``the short, constantly
crossed distance from text to space to moving picture -- time into
space, and back again, with story in both.''
</P>
<P>
   Moulthrop described his ``Tomb Robbers'' demo as a sketch, most
of it less than a week old. ``I can't swear there is a story in the
current version, or if it is the right story,'' he cheerfully
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   The demo allows navigation through colorful panoramas or their
accompanying text, but the circular illustrations are clearly the
more attractive device for traveling through the imaginary realm. A
few of Moulthrop's students at the University of Baltimore are also
tinkering with QTVR panoramas as narrative tools.
</P>
<P>
   Moulthrop said he has always enjoyed the crossbreeding of text
and graphics found, for example, in comics and concrete poetry, and
that QTVR technology might appeal to him as a hypertext-fiction
author for the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or you could come at the problem from hypertext theory,
arguing that some illusion of geometry is necessary to compensate
for the invisible complexity that underlies these machineries,'' he
said. ``But these are rationalizations for what is in fact a deeply
irrational affinity. I'm playing with QTVR right now because it
feels like a good thing to do. It seems to affect my brain in
interesting ways.''

<P>
   Santa Claus may be able to travel around the world in a single
night, but when it comes to his health, he's no Superman, according
to the latest medical research. That bowl full of jelly, a diet
rich in fatty cookies and a lack of regular exercise all put Santa
at risk for a number of health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But adopting a healthier lifestyle won't be as difficult for
Santa as it may sound, according to Dr. Joseph A. Lieberman, the
chairman of the department of family and community medicine at the
Christiana Care Health System in Wilmington, Del., and a clinical
professor of family medicine at Jefferson Medical College in
Philadelphia. And Santa's jolly nature already gives him a head
start on improving his health, he said. While Lieberman has never
examined Santa himself, he has taken a peek at the Jolly One's
medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Medical Tribune News Service's annual review of the
state of Santa's health.
</P>
<P>
   --Santa needs to trim a few pounds. This may seem obvious, but
the importance of weight loss continues to be a subject of debate
in the medical community.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, the editors of a prestigious medical journal,
The New England Journal of Medicine, published an editorial stating
that Americans are too obsessed with trying to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   But in the spring, the American Heart Association placed obesity
in the same risk-factor class as smoking, high cholesterol, high
blood pressure and a sedentary lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda,
Md., announced new obesity guidelines, which declared that 55
percent of American adults need to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with these mixed messages, Santa should stay calm,
according to Lieberman. The Delaware expert recommended that St.
Nick ``use an exercise program and dietary discretion to keep his
weight under control,'' but that he should ``not be so obsessed
that it affects his jolly disposition.''
</P>
<P>
   --Year-round exercise can boost Santa's health. Besides helping
him trim down his bowl full of jelly, research published this year
has highlighted a number of exercise's health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A Finnish study of about 8,000 sets of twins found that those
who walked or jogged for just 30 minutes six or more times a month
had a 43 percent lower risk of death than sedentary people.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise may also help ward off Alzheimer's disease, according
to a study conducted at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland. In a group of 370 people, those who did not have
Alzheimer's had engaged in significantly more exercise during their
lifetimes than people with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Santa may not have much room for error, since ``he's already
making his list and checking it twice,'' Lieberman commented. ``We
want to insure that he forestalls the development of Alzheimer's,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman recommended that Santa exercise for 20 minutes at
least three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   --Lay off the cookies. ``An occasional indulgence in cookies is
OK, but kiddies may also want to put out other things,'' Lieberman
advised.
</P>
<P>
   Veggies may be good substitutes, since they are rich in
nutrients and fiber. And a study from Italy found that some
vegetables, carrots in particular, may help prevent certain types
of cancer. Vegetables and fruits rich in potassium, such as
bananas, may also lower the risk of stroke, according to a Harvard
study of more than 44,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   --Have an occasional glass of wine. While earlier research has
shown that a daily drink or two -- especially red wine -- may help
protect the heart, the habit may also help preserve Santa's sight,
according to a study of more than 3,000 adults that found that
moderate wine drinkers were less likely to develop age-related
macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness among the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman agreed, but he warned against drinking while behind
the reins. ``It would be wonderful to have wine, but not while he's
driving the sled,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   --That jolly disposition counts for something. University of
Kentucky researchers have discovered that optimism may improve more
than a person's mood: it may also boost the immune system. ``We
should learn a lesson from Santa that a pleasant disposition may
prolong life,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa's outlook may be getting rosier. In a nationwide poll of
2,727 people ages 25 to 74, older men and women were more likely
than younger folks to say that they had felt happy, cheerful or
satisfied in the last month.

   SIDEBAR: A HEAD-TO-TOE ASSESSMENT OF SANTA'S HEALTH
</P>
<P>
   EDITORS: This sidebar is designed to accompany a full-length
graphic of Santa. Each blurb should point to the particular area of
Santa's body.
</P>
<P>
   --Eyes. Elderly people are at risk for a number of eye diseases,
including cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. The San
Francisco-based American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends a
complete eye exam every one to two years for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   --Nose. That red honker may mean that Santa likes to unwind with
a drink every now and then. While a drink or two a day can be a
boost for the heart, Santa should not overdo it, since excessive
drinking may lead to liver problems.
</P>
<P>
   --Smile. Santa's cheery attitude may help keep his immune system
strong.
</P>
<P>
   --Pipe. Besides increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke,
smoking a pipe increases Santa's odds of developing mouth and
throat cancers.
</P>
<P>
   --Heart. Fatty cookies and lack of regular exercise makes life
tougher for Santa's ticker.
</P>
<P>
   --Belly. It may jiggle when he laughs, but that spare tire
increases Santa's chance of heart attack, stroke, diabetes and a
number of other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   --Knee. Unless he sheds a few pounds, Santa's extra weight may
lead to a painful joint disease known as osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   --Hat/Hands/Feet. To protect himself against frostbite and
hypothermia, St. Nick must not forget to wear gloves, hat and
snow-proof boots.
</P>
<P>
   --Bones. To help keep Santa's bones strong, kids should leave
out glasses of milk -- skim, of course.

 &HT;    TIME RUNNING OUT TO EXTERMINATE Y2K BUG
 &HT;    With Y2K-DATA, Y2K-CONSUMERS, Y2K-CONSUMERS-DATA AND
Y2K-LAWSUITS. Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Saturday, Dec. 26.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Millennium Bug's sting only a year away,
businesses and governments haven't completed the expensive task of
fixing computer systems nationwide, and experts can't rule out
major disruptions from the software glitch.
</P>
<P>
   For years, programmers have been scrambling to fix trillions of
lines of code that assume every date begins with the digits ``19.''
Unless the errors are fixed before the year 2000, the so-called Y2K
bug threatens to send computer systems around the globe into a
state of paralyzing confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Horror stories abound. Some activists fear that elevators will
trap riders, electricity and water won't flow to homes, mass
transportation systems will be halted and airplane pilots will be
unable to communicate with air traffic controllers. Some people are
hoarding food, water and medicine out of fear that the basic
machinery of society will break down.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say that such scenarios are wildly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say exactly what's going to happen,'' said Joel
Willemssen, director of Civil Agencies Information Systems for the
General Accounting Office. ``But there are likely to be some
disruptions in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Americans might see Y2K ripples much sooner than
midnight on Dec. 31, 1999. For example, because unemployment
insurance benefits are typically calculated a year in advance, the
Labor Department estimates that some state systems will fail when
new claims are filed Jan. 4. So some states may not be able to
process unemployment claims, or they may cut checks for the wrong
amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest misconception is that this will be a one-day
blip,'' said Lou Marcoccio, managing partner for the Gartner Group,
a U.S. information technology firm. ``We're going to be dealing
with this well into 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   In the race to fix the world's computer code, here's the
situation:
</P>
<P>
   _ GLOBAL OVERVIEW: The United States, Canada and much of Europe
are leading efforts worldwide to fix computer code, but the Gartner
Group still estimates that at least 15 percent of companies in
these developed nations will experience one ``mission critical''
failure _ severe enough to disrupt businesses or services. In
developing countries such as China and Pakistan, it's estimated a
dismal 66 percent of companies will experience such a computer
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   _ U.S. GOVERNMENT. In February, the White House appointed a
corporate turnaround artist, John Koskinen, to coordinate 24
federal agencies. As of Dec. 8, he reported, 61 percent of 7,000
federal mission-critical computer systems had been fixed and
tested. However, only 43 percent in major agencies such as the
Department of Defense, Department of Energy and Department of
Health and Human Services had been tested and replaced.
</P>
<P>
   _ CORPORATIONS. The nation's corporate giants are in good shape,
with industries such as banking, investments and pharmaceuticals
leading the pack. But such progress comes at a high cost. The
Federal Reserve estimates the 500 largest companies will spend
between $40 billion and $50 billion over four years to fix the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ SMALL BUSINESS. Thousands of smaller companies are causing
concern. International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass. technology
firm, surveyed 400 companies for Y2K readiness in January. Of those
companies, one-third hadn't evaluated or started Y2K fixes. Of the
laggards, nearly all were smaller businesses with revenues of less
than $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. They are in bad shape too. The 49
states, for example, use 421 separate computer systems to
administer federal money through Medicaid, welfare and food stamp
programs. Of those, only one-third now are fixed, according to GAO.
Worse, the National Association of Counties says half the counties
nationwide lack plans to tackle Y2K trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest impact is likely to be the cost to the economy.
Today, the Y2K computer problem is devouring 60 percent of the
world's information technology resources. And the price tag for
fixing Y2K glitches is expected to surpass $1.2 trillion worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Economists don't agree on the implications of the resource
drain, but at least one prominent economist, Edward Yardeni, chief
economist at Deutsche Banks Securities Inc. in New York, has put
chances of the Y2K bug causing a global recession at 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni has examined the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) disclosure statements of 400 publicly traded companies. He
says these corporate giants alone will spend $29 billion fixing Y2K
glitches. Bell South, for example, expects to spend between $250
million and $350 million, but has only expended $40 million as of
September 30.
</P>
<P>
   The financial industry says most banks are on track to have
systems tested and replaced by June. The U.S. stock exchanges have
conducted dress rehearsals to simulate year 2000 scenarios, and
reported no glitches in stock trading. Still, the Federal Reserve
is printing $50 billion in extra dollars to prepare against
shortages if people start withdrawing cash from their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Another trouble spot is the global interconnections in today's
business markets. Dell Computer Corp., for example, relies on 70
key suppliers to manufacture parts for its computers. The chemical
giant du Pont has surveyed one-third of its suppliers to find 40
percent at high risk for Y2K failures, according to SEC documents.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell and du Pont may have solved their internal Y2K
problems, ``the failure of the supply chains could bring everything
to a halt,'' said Michael P. Harden, president and CEO of Century
Technology Service Inc. of McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The same supply-line dependencies threaten public services such
as natural-gas transmission lines, experts warn. This worries
officials who realize that local governments, which typically have
responsibility for emergency response teams, are laggards in the
Y2K repair race.
</P>
<P>
   Steven D. Davis, budget manager for Montgomery County, Md.,
estimates that 73 percent of local governments nationwide lack
emergency response plans for Y2K emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local governments have been slow to deal with this,'' Davis
said. ``First we thought this was a computer problem. Then we
though it was a community problem. Now we realize it's an emergency
response problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, President Clinton's Y2K czar, Koskinen, is urging
community leaders and business executives put their energy into
solving remaining problems, rather than fretting about unlikely
disaster scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to use common sense,'' said Koskinen. ``Just
because you are know a hurricane is coming, you don't go out and
stock up on five months of food.''

 &HT;    WORRIED CITIZENS MOBILIZE FOR THE COMPUTER MILLENNIUM
 &HT;    With Y2K AND Y2K-CONSUMERS-DATA. Repeating for all needing in

Dec. 26.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lisa Zach isn't one to be scared by computer
problems. A 1987 graduate of Texas A&AMP;M University, the computer
scientist runs her own 10-person firm in Texarkana, Tex.,
designing, servicing and fixing computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   But when Zach began investigating the Year 2000 computer
problem, her knees got weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot bigger than fixing people's computers,'' said
Zach. ``It could touch every aspect of our lives. And the potential
for a chain reaction is great.''
</P>
<P>
   So Zach launched her own campaign to get Texarkana officials to
begin planning for computer malfunctioning linked to the century's
date change. In January, her company will co-host a meeting to
discuss everything from backup water supplies to alternative heat
sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to give extra blankets to the elderly, but
that's about it,'' Zach said.
</P>
<P>
   Texarkana residents aren't alone. According to a November survey
by the National Association of Counties, half the nation's counties
lack plans to deal with Year 2000 problems. Perhaps most troubling,
these counties are responsible for services as basic as 911
emergency-response systems, which are at risk because no one has
checked to see whether they are Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of this bureaucratic malaise, a grassroots movement
is rising nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K activists appear to fall into two camps: On one side,
individuals are stockpiling food and preparing for serious
disruptions of life's necessities. On the other, about 200 citizens
groups nationwide are pressuring leaders to prepare for a
hurricane-like disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is not talking to the American people about
potential problems,'' said Paloma O'Riley, a computer expert turned
activist. ``I'm not saying we need to freak out, but we need to be
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Riley founded the non-profit Cassandra Project in 1997 to
address Y2K public health threats. She keeps in touch with
activists through her Internet site
(http://www.cassandraproject.org), where many groups are listed.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Bill Lynes is trying to be sensible. He said some of
his friends are heading to the mountains, but he plans to stay put
with his wife and three children near Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Family members have spent about $6,000 canning their own food in
anticipation of widespread shortages. And they are stashing dozens
of water-filled plastic milk jugs in their basement. Next project:
a solar-powered generator as a backup for electricity to run lights
and a pump for more water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got friends heading for a commune,'' Lynes said. ``But we
want to be prepared to survive right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Zach, in Texas, is taking precautions. She estimates her
family has spent $8,000 on freeze-dried food and distilled water
for their pantry. They also have purchased a backup generator,
propane stove and even a four-person solar-powered tub for bathing.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Marcoccio, managing partner of the Gartner Group, an
internationally known consulting group, said some of these measures
may be unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, some of this is overblown, at least in the
United States,'' said Marcoccio. ``We don't expect widespread power
failures or telephone outages.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Marcoccio says citizens should take some precautions
heading into the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   He advises that people take a look at their investment
portfolios. It's widely known, for example, that some countries
such as the Philippines and Thailand could be hit very hard by Y2K
disturbances. That may drag down the value of emerging market
mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is medicine. People who take medicines such as
insulin should make certain there won't be a disruption in supply
because of insurance or production issues.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Marcoccio said the public should not panic _
especially about the financial markets. Most U.S. banks have
completed Y2K fixes. The stock exchanges have already conducted one
dress rehearsal that resulted in no failures.
</P>
<P>
   The big unknown, however, remains the impact of global markets
on local communities like Texarkana, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Zach continues to stock her pantry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's the end of the world,'' she said. ``It's a
man-made error that was created years ago. It's just going to cause
a few bumps in the road.''

 &HT;    A CONSUMER'S CHECKLIST FOR Y2K PREPAREDNESS
 &HT;    With Y2K-CONSUMERS. Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington
and (f) financial categories for release Saturday, Dec, 26.
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some issues that consumers should be aware of in
connection with the Year 2000 (Y2K) computer problem:
</P>
<P>
   AIR TRAVEL: Consider staying home for the millennium weekend.
Airplanes are expected to be safe, but airports will be crowded.
Globally, airplane reservations already are up 300 percent for that
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   HOSPITAL SERVICES: Discuss hospital services with your doctor.
Health care facilities are lagging behind other industries in Y2K
preparedness. Consider scheduling elective surgery before the end
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL ADVICE: Make certain you have contracts, including real
estate, wills and investments, reviewed to make sure you are
protected in case a Y2K issue affects the transaction. Many law
firms have Y2K experts on staff.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICINE: Take stock of medical supplies, especially if you need
routine medicine such as insulin or others produced by a limited
number of suppliers. Doctors are urging patients not to hoard
supplies, though.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL COMPUTERS: Contact the manufacturer of your PC or
Macintosh. Most PC should be Y2K compliant, unless they are very
old. Recent versions of popular software should be fine too.
</P>
<P>
   PORTFOLIOS: Review investments and retirement accounts to make
certain you aren't heavily invested in companies or countries
expected to be hit hard by Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Y2K COMPUTER BUG COULD TAKE MANY INTO COURT
 &HT;    With Y2K. Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Saturday, Dec. 26.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When credit cards imprinted with an ``00''
expiration date were scanned by cash registers in two Michigan
groceries last year, they jammed the machinery and triggered a
lawsuit that flashed an early warning signal to the computerized
world.
</P>
<P>
   Not only may businesses and government agencies find their
operations disrupted by computer chips that fail to recognize the
turn of the century, but the aftermath could be a barrage of
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the single largest legal event in history,'' said
Eric Schmidt, the Year 2000 coordinator for Bricker and Eckler of
Columbus, Ohio, one of many law firms setting up specialty offices
and advertising on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see a lot of people pointing
fingers,'' Schmidt said. ``And a lot of people are not taking this
seriously,'' he added, echoing a widespread view that computer
industry executives are not doing enough to prepare and could be
held liable.
</P>
<P>
   In the grocers' case, Produce Palace International reached a
$250,000 settlement last September from Tec America, the
Atlanta-based company that provided the cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 more lawsuits have been filed seeking damages over
software or equipment that is not ready for the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit Inc., maker of the widely used Quicken bookkeeping
software, has been the target of five lawsuits from customers who
owned versions that weren't 21st century-ready. Intuit won
dismissals of the suits and has announced that it will provide free
repairs, a service that the company says it had planned all along.
</P>
<P>
   The real test, of course, will come on Jan. 1, 2000. If
billings, orders, bank accounts, payrolls, emergency alarms, and
assembly lines are disrupted, the court dockets could be filled
with petitions from customers and stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   However, the risks can be reduced greatly if companies take the
proper steps, say experts who publish advice on an Internet site
(http://www.year2000.com). The site has become a national bulletin
board for both fixing the problem and reducing the threat of
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Warren S. Reid, managing director of WSR Consulting Group of
Encino, Calif., advised in a posting on the site that businesses
take inventory of their technology problem, set up an action plan,
offer frank and accurate status reports, and document the whole
effort.
</P>
<P>
   He also urges executives, lawmakers and industries as a whole to
work together. ``If you think it isn't going to be pretty the way
you understand it now, just think about trying to work this out in
a courtroom environment,'' he said. ``The good news is that if you
address the problem in a planned and professional manner you will
most likely be in fine shape.''
</P>
<P>
   From his Columbus office, Schmidt said he has been volunteering
to speak to businesses and societies and even churches about how
they can avoid that pitfall. ``My objective is that you do not
become part of the $1 trillion in litigation'' that some experts
predict for the computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   Executives could face personal legal risks if they fail to make
diligent efforts to resolve the problem. Even the technology
professionals working on fixing the problem could become the target
of a whole new category of malpractice lawsuits, legal experts
warn.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials are poring over their insurance policies to
see if they offer protection. ``It's important to understand that
out of the Year 2000 problem, there will be things that are covered
by traditional coverage and some that will not,'' said Gary
Gibbler, an official with Cincinnati Insurance Co. in Fairfield,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Insurance asked a court Dec. 4 to exempt it from
defending one of its clients, a software company. A hospital that
bought the software and then discovered it was not equipped to
handle the century change has filed a lawsuit, said to be the first
insurance dispute over the Year 2000 problem to actually reach
court.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbler, who oversees claims for the company, said that the
coverage questions will be ``very complex,'' but that insurers
generally cover accidents, not technological malfunctions. He said
that a few companies will pay high premiums for complete indemnity
from the computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``For average Main Street businesses, there is no miracle
coverage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislatures have taken some action to reduce legal exposure.
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Nevada and Virginia have moved to limit
their liability if state agencies experience Year 2000 breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   A federal ``good Samaritan'' law was enacted this year to give
private companies an exemption from antitrust laws to exchange
information about the computer problem. The law also established a
limited legal shield for companies that published information about
their products' Year 2000 problems by Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gribben, spokesman for the Year 2000 Conversion at the
White House, said there is ``anecdotal evidence,'' especially among
medical equipment manufacturers, that the law has encouraged more
disclosures about products.
</P>
<P>
   As for the expected deluge of litigation, Gribben said it was
too soon to predict. ``The evidence is that we see a lot of people
preparing for lawsuits, but there are not a lot of people preparing
to file,'' he said.

 &HT;    TIME RUNNING OUT TO EXTERMINATE Y2K BUG
 &HT;    With Y2K-DATA, Y2K-CONSUMERS, Y2K-CONSUMERS-DATA AND
Y2K-LAWSUITS. Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Saturday, Dec. 26.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Millennium Bug's sting only a year away,
businesses and governments haven't completed the expensive task of
fixing computer systems nationwide, and experts can't rule out
major disruptions from the software glitch.
</P>
<P>
   For years, programmers have been scrambling to fix trillions of
lines of code that assume every date begins with the digits ``19.''
Unless the errors are fixed before the year 2000, the so-called Y2K
bug threatens to send computer systems around the globe into a
state of paralyzing confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Horror stories abound. Some activists fear that elevators will
trap riders, electricity and water won't flow to homes, mass
transportation systems will be halted and airplane pilots will be
unable to communicate with air traffic controllers. Some people are
hoarding food, water and medicine out of fear that the basic
machinery of society will break down.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say that such scenarios are wildly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say exactly what's going to happen,'' said Joel
Willemssen, director of Civil Agencies Information Systems for the
General Accounting Office. ``But there are likely to be some
disruptions in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Americans might see Y2K ripples much sooner than
midnight on Dec. 31, 1999. For example, because unemployment
insurance benefits are typically calculated a year in advance, the
Labor Department estimates that some state systems will fail when
new claims are filed Jan. 4. So some states may not be able to
process unemployment claims, or they may cut checks for the wrong
amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest misconception is that this will be a one-day
blip,'' said Lou Marcoccio, managing partner for the Gartner Group,
a U.S. information technology firm. ``We're going to be dealing
with this well into 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   In the race to fix the world's computer code, here's the
situation:
</P>
<P>
   _ GLOBAL OVERVIEW: The United States, Canada and much of Europe
are leading efforts worldwide to fix computer code, but the Gartner
Group still estimates that at least 15 percent of companies in
these developed nations will experience one ``mission critical''
failure _ severe enough to disrupt businesses or services. In
developing countries such as China and Pakistan, it's estimated a
dismal 66 percent of companies will experience such a computer
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   _ U.S. GOVERNMENT. In February, the White House appointed a
corporate turnaround artist, John Koskinen, to coordinate 24
federal agencies. As of Dec. 8, he reported, 61 percent of 7,000
federal mission-critical computer systems had been fixed and
tested. However, only 43 percent in major agencies such as the
Department of Defense, Department of Energy and Department of
Health and Human Services had been tested and replaced.
</P>
<P>
   _ CORPORATIONS. The nation's corporate giants are in good shape,
with industries such as banking, investments and pharmaceuticals
leading the pack. But such progress comes at a high cost. The
Federal Reserve estimates the 500 largest companies will spend
between $40 billion and $50 billion over four years to fix the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ SMALL BUSINESS. Thousands of smaller companies are causing
concern. International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass. technology
firm, surveyed 400 companies for Y2K readiness in January. Of those
companies, one-third hadn't evaluated or started Y2K fixes. Of the
laggards, nearly all were smaller businesses with revenues of less
than $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. They are in bad shape too. The 49
states, for example, use 421 separate computer systems to
administer federal money through Medicaid, welfare and food stamp
programs. Of those, only one-third now are fixed, according to GAO.
Worse, the National Association of Counties says half the counties
nationwide lack plans to tackle Y2K trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest impact is likely to be the cost to the economy.
Today, the Y2K computer problem is devouring 60 percent of the
world's information technology resources. And the price tag for
fixing Y2K glitches is expected to surpass $1.2 trillion worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Economists don't agree on the implications of the resource
drain, but at least one prominent economist, Edward Yardeni, chief
economist at Deutsche Banks Securities Inc. in New York, has put
chances of the Y2K bug causing a global recession at 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni has examined the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) disclosure statements of 400 publicly traded companies. He
says these corporate giants alone will spend $29 billion fixing Y2K
glitches. Bell South, for example, expects to spend between $250
million and $350 million, but has only expended $40 million as of
September 30.
</P>
<P>
   The financial industry says most banks are on track to have
systems tested and replaced by June. The U.S. stock exchanges have
conducted dress rehearsals to simulate year 2000 scenarios, and
reported no glitches in stock trading. Still, the Federal Reserve
is printing $50 billion in extra dollars to prepare against
shortages if people start withdrawing cash from their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Another trouble spot is the global interconnections in today's
business markets. Dell Computer Corp., for example, relies on 70
key suppliers to manufacture parts for its computers. The chemical
giant du Pont has surveyed one-third of its suppliers to find 40
percent at high risk for Y2K failures, according to SEC documents.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell and du Pont may have solved their internal Y2K
problems, ``the failure of the supply chains could bring everything
to a halt,'' said Michael P. Harden, president and CEO of Century
Technology Service Inc. of McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The same supply-line dependencies threaten public services such
as natural-gas transmission lines, experts warn. This worries
officials who realize that local governments, which typically have
responsibility for emergency response teams, are laggards in the
Y2K repair race.
</P>
<P>
   Steven D. Davis, budget manager for Montgomery County, Md.,
estimates that 73 percent of local governments nationwide lack
emergency response plans for Y2K emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local governments have been slow to deal with this,'' Davis
said. ``First we thought this was a computer problem. Then we
though it was a community problem. Now we realize it's an emergency
response problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, President Clinton's Y2K czar, Koskinen, is urging
community leaders and business executives put their energy into
solving remaining problems, rather than fretting about unlikely
disaster scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to use common sense,'' said Koskinen. ``Just
because you are know a hurricane is coming, you don't go out and
stock up on five months of food.''

 &HT;    WORRIED CITIZENS MOBILIZE FOR THE COMPUTER MILLENNIUM
 &HT;    With Y2K AND Y2K-CONSUMERS-DATA. Repeating for all needing in

 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lisa Zach isn't one to be scared by computer
problems. A 1987 graduate of Texas A&AMP;M University, the computer
scientist runs her own 10-person firm in Texarkana, Tex.,
designing, servicing and fixing computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   But when Zach began investigating the Year 2000 computer
problem, her knees got weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot bigger than fixing people's computers,'' said
Zach. ``It could touch every aspect of our lives. And the potential
for a chain reaction is great.''
</P>
<P>
   So Zach launched her own campaign to get Texarkana officials to
begin planning for computer malfunctioning linked to the century's
date change. In January, her company will co-host a meeting to
discuss everything from backup water supplies to alternative heat
sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to give extra blankets to the elderly, but
that's about it,'' Zach said.
</P>
<P>
   Texarkana residents aren't alone. According to a November survey
by the National Association of Counties, half the nation's counties
lack plans to deal with Year 2000 problems. Perhaps most troubling,
these counties are responsible for services as basic as 911
emergency-response systems, which are at risk because no one has
checked to see whether they are Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of this bureaucratic malaise, a grassroots movement
is rising nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K activists appear to fall into two camps: On one side,
individuals are stockpiling food and preparing for serious
disruptions of life's necessities. On the other, about 200 citizens
groups nationwide are pressuring leaders to prepare for a
hurricane-like disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is not talking to the American people about
potential problems,'' said Paloma O'Riley, a computer expert turned
activist. ``I'm not saying we need to freak out, but we need to be
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Riley founded the non-profit Cassandra Project in 1997 to
address Y2K public health threats. She keeps in touch with
activists through her Internet site
(http://www.cassandraproject.org), where many groups are listed.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Bill Lynes is trying to be sensible. He said some of
his friends are heading to the mountains, but he plans to stay put
with his wife and three children near Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Family members have spent about $6,000 canning their own food in
anticipation of widespread shortages. And they are stashing dozens
of water-filled plastic milk jugs in their basement. Next project:
a solar-powered generator as a backup for electricity to run lights
and a pump for more water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got friends heading for a commune,'' Lynes said. ``But we
want to be prepared to survive right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Zach, in Texas, is taking precautions. She estimates her
family has spent $8,000 on freeze-dried food and distilled water
for their pantry. They also have purchased a backup generator,
propane stove and even a four-person solar-powered tub for bathing.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Marcoccio, managing partner of the Gartner Group, an
internationally known consulting group, said some of these measures
may be unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, some of this is overblown, at least in the
United States,'' said Marcoccio. ``We don't expect widespread power
failures or telephone outages.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Marcoccio says citizens should take some precautions
heading into the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   He advises that people take a look at their investment
portfolios. It's widely known, for example, that some countries
such as the Philippines and Thailand could be hit very hard by Y2K
disturbances. That may drag down the value of emerging market
mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is medicine. People who take medicines such as
insulin should make certain there won't be a disruption in supply
because of insurance or production issues.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Marcoccio said the public should not panic _
especially about the financial markets. Most U.S. banks have
completed Y2K fixes. The stock exchanges have already conducted one
dress rehearsal that resulted in no failures.
</P>
<P>
   The big unknown, however, remains the impact of global markets
on local communities like Texarkana, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Zach continues to stock her pantry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's the end of the world,'' she said. ``It's a
man-made error that was created years ago. It's just going to cause
a few bumps in the road.''

<P>
   Here are some issues that consumers should be aware of in
connection with the Year 2000 (Y2K) computer problem:
</P>
<P>
   AIR TRAVEL: Consider staying home for the millennium weekend.
Airplanes are expected to be safe, but airports will be crowded.
Globally, airplane reservations already are up 300 percent for that
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   HOSPITAL SERVICES: Discuss hospital services with your doctor.
Health care facilities are lagging behind other industries in Y2K
preparedness. Consider scheduling elective surgery before the end
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL ADVICE: Make certain you have contracts, including real
estate, wills and investments, reviewed to make sure you are
protected in case a Y2K issue affects the transaction. Many law
firms have Y2K experts on staff.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICINE: Take stock of medical supplies, especially if you need
routine medicine such as insulin or others produced by a limited
number of suppliers. Doctors are urging patients not to hoard
supplies, though.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL COMPUTERS: Contact the manufacturer of your PC or
Macintosh. Most PC should be Y2K compliant, unless they are very
old. Recent versions of popular software should be fine too.
</P>
<P>
   PORTFOLIOS: Review investments and retirement accounts to make
certain you aren't heavily invested in companies or countries
expected to be hit hard by Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL BUSINESSES: Assess business-related systems. The Small
Business Administration will guarantee loans to fix Y2K programs
for companies employing fewer than 500 people or generating less
than $5 million annually. For information, call 800-827-5722.
</P>
<P>
   VOLUNTEER SERVICES: Volunteer to help sick or elderly persons
with medical or financial transactions. Experts warn that some
individuals may use Y2K as a scare tactic to swindle others out of
money or property.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Y2K COMPUTER BUG COULD TAKE MANY INTO COURT
 &HT;    With Y2K. Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Saturday, Dec. 26.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When credit cards imprinted with an ``00''
expiration date were scanned by cash registers in two Michigan
groceries last year, they jammed the machinery and triggered a
lawsuit that flashed an early warning signal to the computerized
world.
</P>
<P>
   Not only may businesses and government agencies find their
operations disrupted by computer chips that fail to recognize the
turn of the century, but the aftermath could be a barrage of
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the single largest legal event in history,'' said
Eric Schmidt, the Year 2000 coordinator for Bricker and Eckler of
Columbus, Ohio, one of many law firms setting up specialty offices
and advertising on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see a lot of people pointing
fingers,'' Schmidt said. ``And a lot of people are not taking this
seriously,'' he added, echoing a widespread view that computer
industry executives are not doing enough to prepare and could be
held liable.
</P>
<P>
   In the grocers' case, Produce Palace International reached a
$250,000 settlement last September from Tec America, the
Atlanta-based company that provided the cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 more lawsuits have been filed seeking damages over
software or equipment that is not ready for the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit Inc., maker of the widely used Quicken bookkeeping
software, has been the target of five lawsuits from customers who
owned versions that weren't 21st century-ready. Intuit won
dismissals of the suits and has announced that it will provide free
repairs, a service that the company says it had planned all along.
</P>
<P>
   The real test, of course, will come on Jan. 1, 2000. If
billings, orders, bank accounts, payrolls, emergency alarms, and
assembly lines are disrupted, the court dockets could be filled
with petitions from customers and stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   However, the risks can be reduced greatly if companies take the
proper steps, say experts who publish advice on an Internet site
(http://www.year2000.com). The site has become a national bulletin
board for both fixing the problem and reducing the threat of
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Warren S. Reid, managing director of WSR Consulting Group of
Encino, Calif., advised in a posting on the site that businesses
take inventory of their technology problem, set up an action plan,
offer frank and accurate status reports, and document the whole
effort.
</P>
<P>
   He also urges executives, lawmakers and industries as a whole to
work together. ``If you think it isn't going to be pretty the way
you understand it now, just think about trying to work this out in
a courtroom environment,'' he said. ``The good news is that if you
address the problem in a planned and professional manner you will
most likely be in fine shape.''
</P>
<P>
   From his Columbus office, Schmidt said he has been volunteering
to speak to businesses and societies and even churches about how
they can avoid that pitfall. ``My objective is that you do not
become part of the $1 trillion in litigation'' that some experts
predict for the computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   Executives could face personal legal risks if they fail to make
diligent efforts to resolve the problem. Even the technology
professionals working on fixing the problem could become the target
of a whole new category of malpractice lawsuits, legal experts
warn.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials are poring over their insurance policies to
see if they offer protection. ``It's important to understand that
out of the Year 2000 problem, there will be things that are covered
by traditional coverage and some that will not,'' said Gary
Gibbler, an official with Cincinnati Insurance Co. in Fairfield,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Insurance asked a court Dec. 4 to exempt it from
defending one of its clients, a software company. A hospital that
bought the software and then discovered it was not equipped to
handle the century change has filed a lawsuit, said to be the first
insurance dispute over the Year 2000 problem to actually reach
court.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbler, who oversees claims for the company, said that the
coverage questions will be ``very complex,'' but that insurers
generally cover accidents, not technological malfunctions. He said
that a few companies will pay high premiums for complete indemnity
from the computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``For average Main Street businesses, there is no miracle
coverage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislatures have taken some action to reduce legal exposure.
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Nevada and Virginia have moved to limit
their liability if state agencies experience Year 2000 breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   A federal ``good Samaritan'' law was enacted this year to give
private companies an exemption from antitrust laws to exchange
information about the computer problem. The law also established a
limited legal shield for companies that published information about
their products' Year 2000 problems by Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gribben, spokesman for the Year 2000 Conversion at the
White House, said there is ``anecdotal evidence,'' especially among
medical equipment manufacturers, that the law has encouraged more
disclosures about products.
</P>
<P>
   As for the expected deluge of litigation, Gribben said it was
too soon to predict. ``The evidence is that we see a lot of people
preparing for lawsuits, but there are not a lot of people preparing
to file,'' he said.

 &HT;    WILLIE NELSON HONORED AT 'WASHINGTON'S OSCARS'
 &HT;    620&AMP;add. For release Monday, Dec. 28.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attire for the Kennedy Center Honors is always
unflinchingly formal, so Willie Nelson arrived in a spiffy black
cowboy hat, shined black boots and black velvet binding the ends of
his braided reddish-gray hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember the last time'' he was so dressed up,
admitted the tuxedoed Texas troubador, who was among this year's
honorees. ``But they sent me a little piece of paper that said,
'You will wear black tie.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Along with Nelson, the Kennedy Center's 21st annual recognition
for lifetime achievement in the performing arts went to Bill Cosby,
Shirley Temple Black, conductor Andre Previn and Broadway composer
John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb. The star-studded salute to the
honorees was videotaped Dec. 6 and will be broadcast on the CBS
television network on Wednesday (Dec. 30) at 9 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called ``Washington's Oscars,'' the Kennedy Center
Honors have recognized 111 American artists ranging from Bob Hope
and Lucille Ball to Paul Newman and Roy Acuff over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   After hosting this year's honorees at a White House reception,
President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton joined them
in box seats at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts
to watch a stage show recalling the winners' artistic careers.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Academy Awards, the evening begins with fans and TV
crews gathered on both sides of a red-carpeted foyer to see the
honorees and other celebrities walk from their limousines to their
theater seats. This promenade featured familiar faces from Capitol
Hill and Hollywood, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., Dennis Hopper; Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; Michelle Lee;
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jack Lemmon. Interesting
couples ranged from Dwight Yoakam and Bridget Fonda to Howard Baker
and Nancy Kassenbaum Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only in Washington _ and certainly only in booming
economic times _ would some of the loudest applause go to Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. ``You da man,
Alan,'' shouted one onlooker as Greenspan passed, looking slightly
perplexed as he walked with his wife, NBC-TV correspondent Andrea
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Cronkite anchored the gala, which featured a videotaped
recap of the achievements of each honoree and then salutes from
their performing peers.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his outlaw brand of country music, Nelson has had some
well-publicized run-ins with the law over marijuana and with the
IRS over unpaid taxes. On this night, though, a lyrical Cronkite
called him ``a Texan whose Dust Bowl voice and songs in the neon
night made him a Walt Whitman of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows who he is _ and he knows he's from someplace _ and he
knows where that place is,'' observed Tommy Lee Jones, a fellow
Texan. ``That big bus is always going back to the Hill Country.''
</P>
<P>
   On this night, though, Nelson's tour bus, the Honeysuckle Rose,
was rolled onto the reinforced Kennedy Center stage for the segment
honoring the Red-Haired Stranger. Then Nelson was serenaded with
his own songs.
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam sang ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain'' and ``Hello
Walls.'' Lyle Lovett sang ``Night Life.'' Shelby Lynne sang
``Crazy'' and provoked some nervous giggles in the audience when
the TV monitors showed the Clintons in their box listening to the
lyrics ``crazy for trying and crazy for crying and crazy for loving
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Kris Kristofferson strolled out, declaring ``Of all of
Willie's songs, this is probably the best epitaph'' and launching
into ``On the Road Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nelson earlier told reporters he was taking his bus back
to Texas and might just drape his seven-ribboned Kennedy Center
Honors medal from the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For this one evening, record producer Don Was put together ``The
Willie Nelson Tribute Band'' featuring himself on bass, Mickey
Raphael from Willie's ``Family'' on harmonica, G.E. Smith from
``Saturday Night Live'' and Reggie Young on guitar, Clifford Carter
on keyboards and Steve Jordan on guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the show include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Broadway salute to Kander and Ebb featuring songs from two
of their top hits, ``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago.'' Bebe Neuwirth
(familiar as Lillith from ``Cheers'' and ``Frazier'') and Chita
Rivera dance and sing a ``Chicago'' medley and Joel Gray and Liza
Minelli reprise their ``Cabaret'' roles for a nostalgic number.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sinbad's hilarious rag on Cosby. On an evening of effusive
praise, Sinbad's outrageous tales of sharing a foxhole in Vietnam
with Cosby, saving his life and then being treated abominably by
the beloved comedian had Cosby pretending to climb out of his box
seat and later waving a white flag of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   _ A heartfelt tribute to Previn by Mia Farrow, his ex-wife.
``Thanks for the music, Toots, and for the memories,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cronkite recalled Shirley Temple Black from the era of the
Great Depression as ``a little child who lit up the screen, lifted
up the nation and will always be America's princess.'' Later, Jack
Lemmon added his deadpan salute: ``The first drink I ever had was a
Shirley Temple.'' And Henry Kissinger remembered being secretary of
state while the former child star served as U.S. ambassador to
Ghana. Growing up, he had her movies dubbed in German, Kissinger
said, ``so I was surprised when she spoke English _ and without an
accent.''
</P>
<P>
   The show concludes with a bemused Cronkite sharing a stage with
scores of tap-dancing kids as the U.S. Air Force Band plays ``On
the Good Ship Lollipop'' and hundreds of red, white and blue
balloons fall from the ceiling.

   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, began fomenting the
current impeachment madness two years ago. His earlier target was
the federal judiciary, later he elevated his sights _ to the
presidency. DeLay is acknowledged to be the force behind lining up
Republican votes to impeach President Clinton. He has cajoled,
threatened and pulled in favors in order to fuel a radical
revolution aimed at overturning democracy as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-March of 1997, DeLay proclaimed, ``As part of our
conservative efforts against judicial activism, we are going after
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay took his script from James Dobson of Focus on the Family,
Pat Buchanan, Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council, right-wing
activist David Barton, Pat Robertson and the Christian Coalition.
They all bemoaned what they called ``judicial tyranny'' and the
``imperial judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, DeLay targeted three federal judges for impeachment
_ Harold Baer Jr. of the U.S. District Court of Manhattan, Fred
Biery of the U.S. District Court in San Antonio and Chief Judge
Thelton Henderson of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco _
because DeLay didn't like decisions they had handed down. He
claimed that ``articles of impeachment are being written right
now'' against Judge Biery.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative National Legal Foundation endorsed DeLay's call
for impeaching federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL even urged Congress to impeach the six U.S. Supreme
Court justices who had voted against Colorado's anti-gay amendment
in 1996, ruling it was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay promised more federal judges would be added to his hit
list. ``We have a whole big file cabinet full. We are receiving
nominations from all across the country of judges that could be
prime candidates for the first impeachment.'' DeLay made this
statement even before he had any evidence of impeachable crimes
against these judges. And then Clinton fell into his lap.
</P>
<P>
   It should be no surprise that Bob Barr, R-Ga., is the other
member of the U.S. House who caught the impeachment fever early.
He, too, has been a major voice behind the scenes orchestrating the
GOP impeachment of the president. Last year he was making speeches
in favor of impeaching judges, claiming that just the threat of
impeachment would keep the federal judiciary in line.
</P>
<P>
   We can expect these same voices to clamor for the heads of
judges as soon as the presidential impeachment has been played out.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications of this impeachment madness are likely to be
profound. If Congress can impose its will upon the judiciary, the
system of checks and balances among the three branches of
government will crumble. An independent judiciary is the foundation
of our constitutional form of government. The judiciary has the
duty to guard the Constitution from legislative and executive
encroachment. It has the duty to protect the civil liberties of
every individual from the tyranny of the majority.
</P>
<P>
   The framers of the Constitution considered the independence of
the federal judges so important to our system of government that
judges hold office for life and their pay cannot be reduced as long
as they serve in ``good behavior.'' Judges cannot be removed for
rendering unpopular decisions. They cannot be legitimately removed
for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The irony here is that one of the most conservative Chief
Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, William Rehnquist, stands firm
against the right-wing radicals who would destroy the independence
of the judiciary and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1991 law review article, ``The Impeachment Clause: A Wild
Card in the Constitution,'' Rehnquist wrote: ``If one were to
select the two major contributions to the art of government made by
the Founding Fathers in Philadelphia in 1778, I think one would
have to select: first, the separation of the executive from the
legislative power, and second, the creation of the independent
judiciary with the power of judicial review. Article II of the
Constitution establishes the President as the Chief Executive in
his own right, without any dependency on Congress such as that of a
Prime Minister in a parliamentary system. This article confers upon
the President powers which Congress cannot take away.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist ends the article stating: ``The principle of
separation of powers was not `home free' simply because it was
embodied in the Constitution, so long as the Impeachment Clauses
were also in that document. Battles were to be fought in the
succeeding two hundred years to preserve the principle of
separation of powers, and two of the most important of those
battles were waged outside the courts: the trial of ((U.S. Supreme
Court Justice)) Samuel Chase in the Senate in 1805, and the trial
of ((President)) Andrew Johnson in 1868.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither was convicted of any articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   We see a Congress deeply divided and troubled. There is a
partisan frenzy to impeach and impeach. Conservative GOP members of
Congress have watched their agenda blunted by the federal courts or
fragmented by the president. And now, in frustration, these
short-sighted elected officials are willing to destroy the
foundation of our system of government in order to get their way.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the statesmen who understand what is being done? The
nation needs them desperately.

PARTISAN POLITICS IS THE REAL CRIMINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ To grasp just how troubled are our times, all
that was needed was to listen to the debate over the impeachment of
President Clinton. As the hours of debate droned on, speaker after
speaker invoked the name of God on behalf of his or her argument.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians taking the name of the Lord in vain on behalf of
nothing more noble than their political self-interest is nothing
new. In this regard, the marathon of speeches in the House of
Representatives was special only because of the repetitiveness with
which the divine was enlisted in dogmatic political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   As the Republicans bulldozed toward their party-line vote, they
were disdainful of arguments that impeachment would gridlock the
work of the Senate and the Supreme Court during the trial of
Clinton. But once their doubting moderates fell into line, and it
became clear that their effort was sure to succeed, they attempted
to turn the argument they had earlier rejected to their own
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they solemnly intoned, it was up to Clinton to spare the
country the continuing spectacle and disruption of a Senate trial.
And he could do so simply by resigning his office. So once again,
as so often in the past, the affairs of men, begun as tragedy,
resolve themselves as farce. The Republican appeals for Clinton to
make the nation whole by resigning, recalls the son who, having
murdered his mother and father, asks mercy of the court because he
is an orphan.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Republicans resorting to dubious legal tactics of an
independent counsel especially chosen for the task of getting the
president, if not one way then another, that brought us to this
state of affairs. They created the crisis, and they have never
relented in their goal, which some of them have harbored and even
publicly declaimed before Clinton's affair with a White House
intern became known. To prove out that assertion, merely ask
yourselves what would have the Republicans said and done if the
president in question had been a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' attempt to stampede Clinton into collaborating
in his removal from office, exploiting the last-minute resignation
of their designated speaker because of sexual misconduct, is in
keeping with their purpose from the beginning. For the sake of the
nation, and not for his own sake or public ambition, it is
imperative that Clinton demonstrate that he will not give way, that
his backbone will not bend, that on this crucial decision he will
not retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan political adventure that has brought the nation to
this historical juncture must not be crowned with success. To
Clinton, resignation might appear more tempting than a prolonged
trial in the Senate on the embarrassing charges that already are
all too well known in their lurid detail to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   But this is an issue far surpassing the personal situation of
Clinton, whose reckless and compulsive conduct in having and then
covering up a consensual sexual affair invested the political
campaign against him with the trappings of plausibility. He must
stay the course, not for his own and his family's comfort, but for
the welfare of the nation. Were the Republicans to win now, the
signposts have long been clear. Republicans would be encouraged to
try again. Democrats, looking toward the Clinton precedent, would
be tempted to seize the first opportunity to revenge themselves on
a future Republican president.
</P>
<P>
   The abuses of congressional prerogatives would enshrine a new
anti-democratic politics, in which the will of the electorate as
voiced in presidential elections could be thwarted by a determined
and partisan Congress. These are grievous times, because a
one-sided political effort is on the verge of removing a president
from office for the commission of offenses in his private conduct
which do not merit the constitutional sanction of removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   While the Senate is widely expected not to convict Clinton if it
comes to trial, no one can be sure of how developments will unfold.
The most respectable argument made by Republicans on behalf of
impeachment was that a president is not above the law. It should be
beyond dispute that Clinton should face the same sort of penalties
that an ordinary citizens would. But as the Constitution does not
provide for punishing a sitting president for low crimes, his day
in court has to be postponed until he leaves office. Therefore, the
president is not above the law. Neither should he below the law,
sustaining legal disabilities that ordinary citizens would not.
</P>
<P>
   In this consideration, the endless repetition of perjury
allegations against him remain only allegations. They have not been
proved and many legal experts have testified that the particulars
of perjury with which Clinton is accused and of which he stands
impeached, would not stand up in court. Proving obstruction of
justice would also be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   If sanity prevails, and the welfare of the nation is honored,
then we should be able to discover the merit of these allegations
sometime after Jan. 20, 2001.

TAKING SHELTER FROM BOMBS AND BOMBAST 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I went to a homeless shelter and found sanity.
</P>
<P>
   The dining room and dormitory in the basement of St. Boniface
Catholic Church in San Francisco are a winter shelter for about 40
men. Last week they talked and laughed quietly while eating dinner
brought from St. Anthony's Dining Room next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the churches I know, this is the only one that opens up
for people to go to keep out of the rain,'' said Jaime Patino, who
helps out at the shelter. ``It's truly a sanctuary.''
</P>
<P>
   The warm spaces of St. Boniface also offered sanctuary from the
nation's nervous breakdown. There was no television set showing
bomb blasts in Baghdad and bombast in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   St. Boniface is a growing parish, but the magnificent
111-year-old building must be retrofitted or be torn down. The
Franciscan friars need to raise $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   The many Vietnamese parishioners fast on Fridays and donate
their grocery money to the cause. As the Rev. Louis Vitale says,
``They don't have a lot of body weight to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot for a poor parish to raise, the equivalent of 11
cruise missiles or a quarter of the report by special prosecutor
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Giving is an antidote to both of those.
</P>
<P>
   I went home and found sanity.
</P>
<P>
   We sat in front of the fire with hot cider and avoided the
images of blustering politicians and Baghdad through green lenses.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, though, we got up early to watch the
impeachment. It was a historic event, we told ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   My wife couldn't take listening to men in suits, known liars and
adulterers, using words like ``perjury'' and ``reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember junior high and only the weenies ran for student
council?'' she said. ``Well, the weenies are running the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   She quit watching. I took a break to get some tea, and when I
came back Saddam Hussein was on the screen. He fit right in with
the congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's version of Henry Kissinger, Tariq Aziz, said: ``They
attacked radio and television stations. They are not weapons of
mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, they are. In this country at least. In the toxic
electronic cloud, there have been only a few breaths of fresh air,
like the caller to a San Francisco talk show who said she was going
to lead a ``Million Mistress March'' on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   I went Christmas shopping and found sanity. Yes, even Christmas
shopping is a relief.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby of San Francisco Centre I found a group of students
from the Barnard White Middle School in Union City. These polite,
happy kids had been shopping, and were looking forward to pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Their principal, Judy Silver, told me that many of these kids
were poor and had never been to San Francisco. They earned this
trip on the first day of their Christmas vacation by maintaining a
high grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have low expectations for teen-agers, they'll meet
them,'' Silver said. ``But if we have high expectations, they'll
meet those.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that should go for politicians, too. I asked Silver how
the kids were taking the weirdness in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and I think it's weird? It's very weird for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver invited me to join them for pizza. It seemed a good way
to get away from CNN, but I had to say no. I just didn't have an
appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one antidote to impeachment and bombing madness. When you
get off a bus, or thank a salesclerk, smile and say, ``Merry
Christmas,'' ``Happy Holidays'' or the holiday greeting of your
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure not to use the phrases ``rule of law,'' ``history will
not be kind'' or ``Operation Desert Fox.'' Some bozo in the
Pentagon never heard of Nazi Gen. Erwin Rommel.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer to call the attacks on Iraq ``Operation Desert
Weasel.''
</P>
<P>
   And please, no more generals using the word ``degradation'' when
speaking of blowing up things in Iraq. It's an apt word, but ask
not which nation is most degraded this Christmastime.
</P>

AFTER IMPEACHMENT VOTE, STARR MAKES WEEKLY CALL TO HIS MOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Hours after the House of Representatives voted to
impeach President Clinton, independent council Kenneth Starr called
his mother. Yet the conversation never touched on the president,
Monica Lewinsky or impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't talk about business,'' Vannie Mae Starr, 91, said
Sunday at her home in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Starr _ who with Clinton will share the cover of Time
magazine this week as the Men of the Year _ focused on personal
matters in his weekly telephone call to his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was tired and he was going to bed early,'' Vannie
Starr said of her son, who phoned home on Saturday after a divided
House voted to impeach Clinton based on charges made by the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a day like no other in U.S. history _ Clinton became
the first elected president to be impeached _ but Starr's mother
said their conversation wasn't any different than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a 1964 graduate of Sam Houston High School in San
Antonio, grew up in the same tiny, white house on the city's East
Side where his mother still lives.
</P>
<P>
   Vannie Starr said she was proud of her son's accomplishments as
a lawyer and judge. She said she followed the House impeachment
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``My television's been acting up and I got most of it on
radio,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Often when reporters call, Vannie Starr refers them to former
Sam Houston teacher Roberta Mahan, 81.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know his mother until (about two years ago) when she
called me and asked what to do about all the reporters that were
calling,'' Mahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Mahan has been interviewed often about Starr's
student days.
</P>
<P>
   Mahan tells them Starr was a hard-working, academically talented
student who was well liked by classmates. Starr was in Mahan's
English and journalism classes in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In May, when he was in San Antonio to speak at a Law Day
luncheon, Starr arranged for his mother and Mahan to be in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Mahan recalled Starr rallying classmates to subscribe to the
school newspaper, The Raven. He wrote a number of stories and
editorials on a variety of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   In a teaching career that spanned a half century, Mahan said,
she had many talented students. Only one has been named a Time
``Man of the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to death,'' she said.

   WASHINGTON _ When credit cards imprinted with an ``00''
expiration date were scanned by cash registers in two Michigan
groceries last year, they jammed the machinery and triggered a
lawsuit that flashed an early warning signal to the computerized
world.
</P>
<P>
   Not only may businesses and government agencies find their
operations disrupted by computer chips that fail to recognize the
turn of the century, but the aftermath could be a barrage of
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the single largest legal event in history,'' said
Eric Schmidt, the Year 2000 coordinator for Bricker and Eckler of
Columbus, Ohio, one of many law firms setting up specialty offices
and advertising on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see a lot of people pointing
fingers,'' Schmidt said. ``And a lot of people are not taking this
seriously,'' he added, echoing a widespread view that computer
industry executives are not doing enough to prepare and could be
held liable.
</P>
<P>
   In the grocers' case, Produce Palace International reached a
$250,000 settlement last September from Tec America, the
Atlanta-based company that provided the cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 more lawsuits have been filed seeking damages over
software or equipment that is not ready for the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit Inc., maker of the widely used Quicken bookkeeping
software, has been the target of five lawsuits from customers who
owned versions that weren't 21st century-ready. Intuit won
dismissals of the suits and has announced that it will provide free
repairs, a service that the company says it had planned all along.
</P>
<P>
   The real test, of course, will come on Jan. 1, 2000. If
billings, orders, bank accounts, payrolls, emergency alarms, and
assembly lines are disrupted, the court dockets could be filled
with petitions from customers and stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   However, the risks can be reduced greatly if companies take the
proper steps, say experts who publish advice on an Internet site
(http://www.year2000.com). The site has become a national bulletin
board for both fixing the problem and reducing the threat of
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Warren S. Reid, managing director of WSR Consulting Group of
Encino, Calif., advised in a posting on the site that businesses
take inventory of their technology problem, set up an action plan,
offer frank and accurate status reports, and document the whole
effort.
</P>
<P>
   He also urges executives, lawmakers and industries as a whole to
work together. ``If you think it isn't going to be pretty the way
you understand it now, just think about trying to work this out in
a courtroom environment,'' he said. ``The good news is that if you
address the problem in a planned and professional manner you will
most likely be in fine shape.''
</P>
<P>
   From his Columbus office, Schmidt said he has been volunteering
to speak to businesses and societies and even churches about how
they can avoid that pitfall. ``My objective is that you do not
become part of the $1 trillion in litigation'' that some experts
predict for the computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   Executives could face personal legal risks if they fail to make
diligent efforts to resolve the problem. Even the technology
professionals working on fixing the problem could become the target
of a whole new category of malpractice lawsuits, legal experts
warn.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials are poring over their insurance policies to
see if they offer protection. ``It's important to understand that
out of the Year 2000 problem, there will be things that are covered
by traditional coverage and some that will not,'' said Gary
Gibbler, an official with Cincinnati Insurance Co. in Fairfield,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Insurance asked a court Dec. 4 to exempt it from
defending one of its clients, a software company. A hospital that
bought the software and then discovered it was not equipped to
handle the century change has filed a lawsuit, said to be the first
insurance dispute over the Year 2000 problem to actually reach
court.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbler, who oversees claims for the company, said that the
coverage questions will be ``very complex,'' but that insurers
generally cover accidents, not technological malfunctions. He said
that a few companies will pay high premiums for complete indemnity
from the computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``For average Main Street businesses, there is no miracle
coverage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislatures have taken some action to reduce legal exposure.
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Nevada and Virginia have moved to limit
their liability if state agencies experience Year 2000 breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   A federal ``good Samaritan'' law was enacted this year to give
private companies an exemption from antitrust laws to exchange
information about the computer problem. The law also established a
limited legal shield for companies that published information about
their products' Year 2000 problems by Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce will seek even stronger measures in
the next Congress, Congrewssional Quarterly reported Monday. The
publication said the business group would lobby for limits on
companies' legal liability, special courts to try Year 2000-related
cass, tax breaks to offset the financial burden of ensuring Year
2000 compliance, and laws assuring the private sector's liability
will be no higher than that of the federal government's.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gribben, spokesman for the Year 2000 Conversion at the
White House, said there is ``anecdotal evidence,'' especially among
medical equipment manufacturers, that the law has encouraged more
disclosures about products.
</P>
<P>
   As for the expected deluge of litigation, Gribben said it was
too soon to predict. ``The evidence is that we see a lot of people
preparing for lawsuits, but there are not a lot of people preparing
to file,'' he said.

 &HT;    
 By GLORIA STEINEM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It is time to register outraged and principled opposition to the
impeachment charade now going on in Washington.
 &HT;    We know that the huge majority opposes President Clinton's
impeachment. Too often, the press has attributed this irrefutable
fact, which is shown clearly in the public-opinion polls, to some
notion of economic comfort, as if Clinton were being supported only
out of the selfishness created by a good economy.
 &HT;    In fact, those who support Clinton the MOST are those who
benefit from our economy the LEAST.
 &HT;    Opposition to impeachment exists because people around the
country are smart enough to know that ``Impeach Clinton'' and even
``Impeach Hillary'' bumper stickers have been sported and sold ever
since the Clintons entered the White House, by many of the same
right-wing groups who now stand for his impeachment.
 &HT;    People are smart enough to figure out that the Congress members
voting for impeachment have a suspiciously high correlation to
those owned by such obsessed minority lobbies as the tobacco
industry, the National Rifle Association and anti-abortion
organizations _ all sworn enemies of Clinton and his majoritarian
policies.
 &HT;    Do I agree with all of Clinton's policies? Of course not. I'll
never forgive him for signing the welfare bill. I'm proud of the
National Organization for Women and other women's groups who staged
a hunger strike outside the White House in the vain hope of
dissuading him.
 &HT;    But I also know that he has stood for equal economic and human
rights far more than the so-called Republican opponents _ and I
know what interests that angers.
 &HT;    I also know that even if President Reagan or President Bush had
been guilty of the same sexual misjudgment _ and then tried to
conceal it _ I wouldn't have supported their impeachment either.
Indeed, when the right-wing congressman Bob Bauman (of Maryland)
was accused of a sexual episode with a young man, the only question
I and other feminists asked was: Was this welcome sex or not?
Because if it was welcome, then it wasn't sexual harassment. And it
wasn't our business.
 &HT;    My fear is that the right wing is distorting and defeating
sexual-harassment law in much the same way that they have tried to
distort and defeat affirmative-action law.
 &HT;    Remember, these are the same folks who opposed sexual-harassment
law in the first place. Phyllis Schlafly testified in Congress
against it and insisted that if women just dressed and behaved like
ladies, they wouldn't have this problem.
 &HT;    But now, the right wing is trying to use its version of the law
to peacefully assassinate a president. In the process, they have
convinced more than 60 percent of Americans that sexual-harassment
law has gone too far; that it forbids all sex in the workplace, all
sex between unequals, even all sex outside of marriage _ none of
which it does or should do.
 &HT;    In fact, sexual-harassment law has nothing to do with welcome
sex. The use of the word ``welcome'' is an innovation of this law.
``Consent'' can be coerced. ``Welcomeness'' cannot. It's the
religious right wing that is the Ayatollah here, not the creators
and supporters of sexual-harassment law.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton should not have had to testify about Monica
Lewinsky at all. The enjoyment of mutually welcome sex does not
constitute a ``pattern and practice'' of unwelcome sex. Unequal
status may be an index of suspicion, but it is not dispositive, as
lawyers say. We who support sexual-harassment law are not the sex
police. Any idea that this law allows such policing will only
defeat a good and much-needed statute.
 &HT;    We should also call for an end to the humiliation of Monica
Lewinsky. This young woman broke no law, yet found herself
surrounded by FBI agents and denied access to her own lawyer. She
has been forced to reveal the most intimate details of her private
life _ under threat of her own imprisonment, and even the
imprisonment of her mother.
 &HT;    We owe it to her and ourselves to protest against the jokes,
humiliation and ridicule she has suffered. She has the right to
privacy, sexual expression and legal protection _ and if she does
not, neither do we.
 &HT;    We should also admit that we may be projecting our own
experience. For example, I have two women friends who were sexually
abused by their fathers. They have a hard time believing that
Monica could have been there voluntarily. I know another woman who
was done in by a faithless husband. Clinton's example hits a
bruise, and she reacts with pain and anger. I've been lucky enough
to have neither experience, and so can believe that Monica was
there voluntarily.
 &HT;    I don't even believe that power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.
When I was Monica's age, Eisenhower was president. I wouldn't have
gone to bed with Eisenhower, would you? I rest my case.
 &HT;    It's clear that many men and some women in the media hate
Clinton for reasons of the culture wars, even though they agree
with him on issues more than I do. It drives them crazy that
Clinton has won the most powerful position in the world without the
proper ``masculine'' behavior.
 &HT;    For example, his origins were lower-class (the same guys seem to
feel differently about the philandering of President Kennedy or
President Bush); he loved and remained close to his mother; he
married a wife who was at least his equal; he refused to go to war;
and he actually listens.
 &HT;    In other words, Clinton refused to play the usual male game _
and won anyway.
 &HT;    But none of these personal reasons can justify impeachment.
Clinton's behavior _ self-defeating and reckless as it was _ does
not constitute ``treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
 &HT;    The only thing that might be gained here is an understanding
that the religious right wing has won a disproportionate control of
Congress because so few Americans vote. If we get mad enough to
stop being the democracy with the lowest voter turnout in the
world, even this painful charade may have been worth it.

``Impeach Hillary'' bumper stickers have been sported and sold ever
since the Clintons entered the White House, by many of the same
right-wing groups who now stand for his impeachment.
 &HT;    People are smart enough to figure out that the Congress members
voting for impeachment have a suspiciously high correlation to
those owned by such obsessed minority lobbies as the tobacco
industry, the National Rifle Association and anti-abortion
organizations _ all sworn enemies of Clinton and his majoritarian
policies.
 &HT;    Do I agree with all of Clinton's policies? Of course not. I'll
never forgive him for signing the welfare bill. I'm proud of the
National Organization for Women and other women's groups who staged
a hunger strike outside the White House in the vain hope of
dissuading him.
 &HT;    But I also know that he has stood for equal economic and human
rights far more than the so-called Republican opponents _ and I
know what interests that angers.
 &HT;    I also know that even if President Reagan or President Bush had
been guilty of the same sexual misjudgment _ and then tried to
conceal it _ I wouldn't have supported their impeachment either.
Indeed, when the right-wing congressman Bob Bauman (of Maryland)
was accused of a sexual episode with a young man, the only question
I and other feminists asked was: Was this welcome sex or not?
Because if it was welcome, then it wasn't sexual harassment. And it
wasn't our business.
 &HT;    My fear is that the right wing is distorting and defeating
sexual-harassment law in much the same way that they have tried to
distort and defeat affirmative-action law.
 &HT;    Remember, these are the same folks who opposed sexual-harassment
law in the first place. Phyllis Schlafly testified in Congress
against it and insisted that if women just dressed and behaved like
ladies, they wouldn't have this problem.
 &HT;    But now, the right wing is trying to use its version of the law
to peacefully assassinate a president. In the process, they have
convinced more than 60 percent of Americans that sexual-harassment
law has gone too far; that it forbids all sex in the workplace, all
sex between unequals, even all sex outside of marriage _ none of
which it does or should do.
 &HT;    In fact, sexual-harassment law has nothing to do with welcome
sex. The use of the word ``welcome'' is an innovation of this law.
``Consent'' can be coerced. ``Welcomeness'' cannot. It's the
religious right wing that is the Ayatollah here, not the creators
and supporters of sexual-harassment law.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton should not have had to testify about Monica
Lewinsky at all. The enjoyment of mutually welcome sex does not
constitute a ``pattern and practice'' of unwelcome sex. Unequal
status may be an index of suspicion, but it is not dispositive, as
lawyers say. We who support sexual-harassment law are not the sex
police. Any idea that this law allows such policing will only
defeat a good and much-needed statute.
 &HT;    We should also call for an end to the humiliation of Monica
Lewinsky. This young woman broke no law, yet found herself
surrounded by FBI agents and denied access to her own lawyer. She
has been forced to reveal the most intimate details of her private
life _ under threat of her own imprisonment, and even the
imprisonment of her mother.
 &HT;    We owe it to her and ourselves to protest against the jokes,
humiliation and ridicule she has suffered. She has the right to
privacy, sexual expression and legal protection _ and if she does
not, neither do we.
 &HT;    We should also admit that we may be projecting our own
experience. For example, I have two women friends who were sexually
abused by their fathers. They have a hard time believing that
Monica could have been there voluntarily. I know another woman who
was done in by a faithless husband. Clinton's example hits a
bruise, and she reacts with pain and anger. I've been lucky enough
to have neither experience, and so can believe that Monica was
there voluntarily.
 &HT;    I don't even believe that power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.
When I was Monica's age, Eisenhower was president. I wouldn't have
gone to bed with Eisenhower, would you? I rest my case.
 &HT;    It's clear that many men and some women in the media hate
Clinton for reasons of the culture wars, even though they agree
with him on issues more than I do. It drives them crazy that
Clinton has won the most powerful position in the world without the
proper ``masculine'' behavior.
 &HT;    For example, his origins were lower-class (the same guys seem to
feel differently about the philandering of President Kennedy or
President Bush); he loved and remained close to his mother; he
married a wife who was at least his equal; he refused to go to war;
and he actually listens.
 &HT;    In other words, Clinton refused to play the usual male game _
and won anyway.
 &HT;    But none of these personal reasons can justify impeachment.
Clinton's behavior _ self-defeating and reckless as it was _ does
not constitute ``treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
 &HT;    The only thing that might be gained here is an understanding
that the religious right wing has won a disproportionate control of
Congress because so few Americans vote. If we get mad enough to
stop being the democracy with the lowest voter turnout in the
world, even this painful charade may have been worth it.

CHOOSING GIFTS THAT HELP OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>

 By ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's Christmas time, but gift-giving can mean
more than gems or high-tech gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative gift giving _ in which a donation is made to charity
in someone's honor _ is catching the imagination of comfortable
families who feel they, personally, have more than enough. Churches
and schools have opened ``alternative gift markets'' in recent
years. You can buy your gift of charity through a catalog, a
toll-free phone line, or from a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the perfect way to honor a member of your family or
friend and still contribute to a greater cause,'' said Helen
Jacobsen, who last year bought gifts of rain forest trees, shelter
for street children in Brazil and donations to Habitat for Humanity
for her sons, daughter and daughter-in-law, then wrapped the
information in boxes and bows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sat around the Christmas tree and cried because they were
so moved and so appreciative,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Menlo Park Presbyterian links up with larger organizations
such as the Southern California-based Alternative Gifts
International, which raises more than $1 million annually for
programs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The organization offers a 30-page catalog called ``My Shopping
List for the World'' that fits almost any pocketbook. Through it,
people can buy medicine for China ($40), supplies for eye surgery
($30), a milk cow for a village in Somalia ($330), or, for those on
a budget, $10 for a share of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animal banks in Laos with chickens and pigs and other kinds of
animals are always popular with the kids,'' said Jez McIntosh, the
church's assistant director of children's ministries. This year,
the congregation's fifth- and sixth-graders researched the various
projects and made posters to hang in the parish hall during the
``alternative gift fair'' held last month.
</P>
<P>
   In four hours, the gift fair raised $20,000, twice the amount
raised at last year's event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting more popular every year,'' McIntosh said. ``The
most common comment I've heard is that everybody has enough of
everything, especially in our community. It's nice to not have to
go out and shop and still be able to give something that will be
worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Though alternative gift fairs have grown in popularity mostly
over the past four or five years, the Alternative Gift
International catalog has been around since 1980 and has seen an
increase in donations every year, said Harriet Pritchard, the
organization's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans lead very privileged lives and a lot of people
really want to make a difference or do something significant,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another similar group is the Heifer Project, founded in 1954,
which raises about $1 million a year to promote self-sufficiency by
providing farm animals to poverty-stricken families around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Tom Peterson said interest has grown steadily. This
year, the project has a Web site (www.heifer.org) to help the
cyber-savvy get more connected. On it, you can buy a trio of
rabbits ($60), a crate of honeybees ($30), a flock of chicks ($20),
or a water buffalo ($250). For $5,000 you can buy The Ark, with all
of the above plus many more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people always look for a way to connect with what they
see as the deeper meaning of the holidays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of such alternative gifts is similar to that of a
two-for-one bargain, according to authors Jo Robinson and Jean
Coppock Staeheli in their 1982 book, ``Unplug the Christmas
Machine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you purchase your gifts from church bazaars, Third World
craft organizations, indigenous craftsmen, or nonprofit agencies,
you are giving a double gift _ one to the person who unwraps it on
Christmas morning and the other to the charitable organization
itself,'' the authors write.
</P>
<P>
   There is one caveat in charitable giving: Organizations that
monitor charities recommend doing your homework before giving to a
cause. Charities that are hesitant to provide financial information
_ such as how much of their income goes to administrative expenses
_ should be avoided. Also, it is helpful to find out where the
charity is based and talk to representatives about their mission
before giving money.
</P>
<P>
   One organization that monitors charities is the National
Charities Information Bureau, 212-929-6300, or www.give.org.

 &HT;    Redefining our terms
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a free country, my father used to say. Everyone's entitled
to their own opinion, he went on to elaborate, shunning nice
grammar.
</P>
<P>
   This encapsulates my father's political wisdom, except for the
stuff he would occasionally improvise. Most people of his time
agreed. Cliche-ridden as these ideas might have been, they were a
gesture of respect for the other guy with a different idea. The
recent House impeachment hearings show how much we have slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, this country has always argued with itself
spectacularly. We did, after all, have a Whiskey Rebellion and a
Civil War. We have always done poorly when we relied on scorn,
disrespect and recrimination. These days that's our specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we need to redefine some of our terms, beginning with
what we mean when we say liberal and conservative. Those terms used
to indicate what our attitudes were toward change. Liberals
promoted it. Conservatives were uneasy with it. That seemed to
work. Now they are special terms of malice. Let's go back.
</P>
<P>
   I guess that makes me a conservative.

AMID TRAGEDY, SCOTTISH TAKE THE HIGH ROAD 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOCKERBIE, Scotland _ Ten years ago (Dec. 21, 1988) the sky
rained metal and bodies, and this small town will never be the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Because 259 people fell to earth here when Pan Am Flight 103 was
blown out of the sky, this town will be forever linked with one of
the worst aviation disasters and one of the most ruthless acts of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   What is most striking when one comes here is how small and
nondescript it is. There are just a little more than 3,000 people
living in and around the town, which looks like so many others
around the England-Scotland border.
</P>
<P>
   What is also striking is how friendly people are. It is not
surprising that many of the Americans who lost loved ones on Flight
103 have become friends with the people of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, some American
families had asked the US State Department to return the clothing
of the dead. The bureaucrats said no. The people of Lockerbie paid
no heed to the bureaucrats. Without being asked, they retrieved the
clothing, washed it, pressed it, and sent it back so that grieving
Americans would have something to hold.
</P>
<P>
   The victims on Flight 103 included people from 21 countries, as
well as 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie killed by the falling
debris. The people of Lockerbie guard their memories fiercely and
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter took out a notebook in a pub during a recent
visit, an older gentleman leaned over and gently said in a soft
birr, ``Be a good lad, and put that away.'' To show his
appreciation, the man bought the reporter a pint of ale.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is another community in Scotland that is in mourning. If
it is possible, what happened to the tiny island community of Iona
last week was even more devastating than what happened to
Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
   There are only 86 people still living on Iona, which is a sacred
place to the Scots, the birthplace of Christianity in Scotland.
Last week, four men, ages 19 to 24, drowned when the small boat
they had used to travel to a Christmas party on the mainland
capsized on the way back. A fifth man swam 45 minutes to safety,
then ran more than a mile in his bare feet to raise the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   The young men who died were single, but they were expected to
father the next generation of islanders. They were the only men on
the island between the ages of 19 and 30.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Grant, whose 33-year-old son Gordon was the only one to
survive the disaster, said many islanders now believe the
community's demise is inevitable. ``These boys were the future for
this island and we have now lost that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the Lockerbie disaster, Scotland has had one of the most
emotional 10 years of its history. In 1996, 16 children and their
teacher were fatally shot by a madman who burst into a school in
Dunblane. Sandwiched between Lockerbie and Iona, Dunblane cuts much
deeper into Scotland's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   And yet despite all of this tragedy, or maybe because of it,
Scotland's 5 million people have never seemed stronger. Its people
overwhelmingly approved a referendum last year that will give them
their own parliament. Rather than dampen the desire for outright
independence, British Prime Minister Tony Blair's decision to give
the Scottish a greater degree of autonomy has breathed more life
into the secessionist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's opening of a national museum was greeted with
enormous pride. The BBC, however, recently turned down a request by
Scotland to have its own national newscast at 6 p.m. The Scottish
think the 6 o'clock news from London is too English-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Helena Kennedy, the Scottish lawyer who just became the first
woman to head Britain's biggest arts and cultural organization,
said it is a good time to be Scottish.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedies be damned. As Kennedy put it, ``The Scottish are on a
roll.''

RUSSIANS LOOK AT US SCENE WITH AMUSEMENT, ENVY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As the US Congress impeached President Bill Clinton for
lying under oath and obstruction of justice Saturday, Russians
reacted with a mixture of disbelief, envy, and humor.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, their president, Boris N. Yeltsin, is also being
investigated by Russian lawmakers for potentially impeachable
violations. But many Russians have trouble understanding what
Clinton did so wrong that he deserves to lose his job.
</P>
<P>
   To see why, it helps to compare the accusations against the two
presidents. While Clinton is charged with witness tampering and
lying under oath, Yeltsin faces charges of treason, genocide, and
illegal use of military force. But few Russians believe Yeltsin
will be forced from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   While both cases have caused controversy and ugly partisan
political battles, the impeachment procedure designed by the
founding fathers is fairly straightforward: A vote in Congress, a
vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's 1993 constitution, tailored to meet Yeltsin's
requirements after he crushed parliament with tanks, makes it
extremely complicated to remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   If the panel recommends impeachment, two-thirds of the Duma must
approve the motion for it to go to the Supreme Court, whose judges
have mostly been nominated under Yeltsin. Then the motion goes to
the Constitutional Court. If the judges approve the accusation,
two-thirds of the 189-seat upper house must vote in favor for
Yeltsin to lose his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear this impeachment is going nowhere,''
ultranationalist lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky said last week.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond procedural barriers, there is a deeper issue that
reflects Russians' longstanding, and well-justified, distrust of
their leaders. No one here really expects good government, and no
one expects their leaders to be good. That goes especially for the
aging, unpopular Yeltsin, whose health has been so bad in recent
years that many people have stopped feeling anger toward a man who,
they feel, has so often let them down. They are just waiting for
him to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's give the Americans our president and we'll take
theirs,'' went one joke that made the rounds recently. ``We'll
guarantee that Yeltsin won't be able to cheat on his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, some Muscovites asked picked up on that theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I found out Yeltsin had a mistress, I'd take that as a sign
he is indeed alive and well,'' said Andrei Kudrin, a Moscow TV
producer. ``If he lied about it under oath and tried to stop an
investigation, I'd take that as a sign that he was his usual
self.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment panel set up by the State Duma, the lower house
of the Russian parliament, is investigating Yeltsin on charges that
he committed treason by instigating the 1991 collapse of the Soviet
Union. The panel says he illegally used force when he ordered the
military assault on parliament in 1993 that claimed more than 150
lives. The panel says that Yeltsin instigated the war in Chechnya
in 1994 that claimed more than 100,000 lives. And last week, the
panel looked into whether Yeltsin committed genocide by his
economic policies that some lawmakers say led to the deaths of 4
million Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Chechnya, these charges are almost exclusively the
property of the Communists who dominate the Duma. Knowing that they
cannot force Yeltsin out of power, the Communists have chosen to
use the impeachment proceedings as a place to air their complaints
against the Russian leader, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment took an ugly turn when a senior Communist,
Viktor Ilyukhin, suggested that Russia's population would not have
declined by 4 million people over the seven years of Yeltsin's
presidency if he had employed few Jewish advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proceedings have turned into a discussion club for the
hatemongers,'' said Masha Gessen, chief correspondent of the
liberal magazine Itogi. ``Instead of serving the rule of law, this
is making a warped joke out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That leads to another problem. While US congressman Saturday
often debated the intent of the founding fathers, in Russia, there
is no consensus on who the founding fathers are. Should they
include Communist-era heroes who ran the country for most of the
20th century?
</P>
<P>
   The Duma recently voted to restore the statue of Felix
Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the secret police that became the KGB,
the archenemy of Russian democracy. Saturday, a school in the Urals
city of Chelyabinsk put up a monument to Josef Stalin, whose Great
Terror purges caused 20 million Soviet deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is so weak now, the issue is not how to oust him, but
the race to replace him. His presidency ends in the year 2000, but
candidates have begun campaigning, just in case Yeltsin cannot
complete his term.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, one of the potential front-runners, Mayor Yury Luzhkov
of Moscow, appealed to Russians to unite behind his new movement,
Fatherland. Speaking to congress of more than 1,000 supporters,
Luzhkov called for a stronger military and a stronger state role in
managing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the radical market reforms advocated by Yeltsin's
governments from 1992 until Russia's economic crash last August,
Luzhkov remarked: ``The experiment is over.''
</P>
<P>
   A delegate to Luzhkov's congress, Yury Kon, said it was right to
impeach Yeltsin, but impossible. He expressed respect for the US
system _ but not its decision Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has good laws, but I feel sorry for Clinton,'' Kon
said. ``He's not a bad president.''

MUSLIM SCHOOLS: A FEELING OF BELONGING

   NORTHBOROUGH, Mass. _ In most ways, it is a typical fifth grade
classroom, decorated with posters of constellations, the solar
system and the presidents of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But taped to another wall are items that distinguish this school
from almost all others in the state: posters of Muslim prayers and
verses from the Koran, Islam's sacred book.
</P>
<P>
   Housed inside a nondescript brown brick office building here,
the Al-Hamra Academy was founded four years ago as the first
Islamic elmentary school in Massachusetts. The 64 students at the
school pray twice a day to Allah, sing Islamic hymns and learn
Arabic so they can read holy texts.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the children were concentrating on Ramadan, the
holiest month of the Islamic calendar, which began Sunday and
celebrates the divine revelation of the opening chapters of the
Koran to the prophet Mohammad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this school because we can be Muslim without having to
feel like we're like out-of-place or something,'' said Asma
Lazzouni, 11, a sixth grader at Al-Hamra Academy. ``We are learning
how to grow up to be good Muslims and that's very important to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the school was founded by Muslim families from the
Worcester area because they worried about their children's ability
to carry on the Muslim faith. Growing up Muslim in America, many
Islamic faithful say, is not always easy.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of Muslims in Massachusetts and across the country
grows, families trying to pass on their religious heritage to their
children must contend with the forces of assimiliation and a
society with a high degree of ignorance and even suspicion about
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to fit into mainstream culture because mainstream
culture, for the most part, is still not knowledgeable about
Islam,'' said Imam Talal Eid, the spiritual leader of the Islamic
centers in Sharon and Quincy.
</P>
<P>
   Asma, who lives in Northborough, still has painful memories of
being ridiculed by her first grade public school classmates when
she told them she was Muslim. ``I'd tell them about the Koran and
they'd say that it was a fake book and that Islam wasn't a real
religion,'' recalls Asma, whose parents helped start Al-Hamra
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's challenging because, obviously, we don't live in a Muslim
culture,'' said Idrisa Pandit, who lives in Maynard and whose
5-year-old daughter is in kindergarten at a public elementary
school. ``If you lived in a Muslim culture, no matter how observant
or oriented you were toward Islam, there is still an ethos that is
pervasive, especially in the month of Ramadan. In America, we have
to create that environment.''
</P>
<P>
   One pragmatic response has been the creation of Islamic schools.
There are two in Massachusetts, which is home to between 40,000 to
50,000 Muslims, according to practicing Muslims. Besides Al-Hamra
Academy, the Islamic Center in Sharon started a K-8 school three
years ago. Both are approved by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Islam is not just going to the mosque on Friday for prayers,''
said Sadia Kahn, headmaster of Al-Hamra Academy. ``It's a way of
life. It's how you eat, it's how you work, it's how you dress. It's
everything. We felt we needed a place where the children would be
immersed in Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   The desire to instill religious values in a younger generation
of Muslims is underscored by the demand both Islamic elementary
schools have experienced.
</P>
<P>
   After starting with 100 students, the school in Sharon now has
130 pupils and the only reason the number is not higher is because
of limited space, Eid said.
</P>
<P>
   The Al-Hamra Academy plans to move to a new and bigger building
next year, adding an eighth grade and doubling its enrollment to
120. ``This school is a good way to make sure that we don't forget
the things that make us Muslims,'' said Amina Lazzouni, 7, Asma's
younger sister, who is in fourth grade at Al-Hamra Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching kids values that they don't feel or see in other kids
is very difficult,'' said Nadjette Lazzouni, Asma and Amina's
mother, who teaches at the school. It is hard, she added, to tell
Muslim children they can't do something they see their friends and
classmates doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine telling a child that they can't go trick-or-treating
or can't visit with Santa Claus,'' Lazzouni said. ``We adults know
that Muslims don't celebrate Halloween or Christmas, but children
don't. You don't like doing that to your child.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Muslim families, even those who send their children to
Islamic schools, say they do not want to isolate their children
from American society.
</P>
<P>
   But they do want to teach them that a culture whose youth are
entertained by television, movies and music seemingly saturated
with sex, violence and drugs, stands in stark opposition to Islam's
conservative mores.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason why Marwan Dajani, who owns two furniture
stores and lives in Mattapan, sends his two children to St. Mary of
Hills Elementary School in Milton. While Islam and Roman
Catholicism are certainly different, both share a strong moral
base. ``We try our best to create a healthy environment for them,''
Dajani said.
</P>
<P>
   The main challenge, many Muslims say, is to prepare their
children to flourish, academically, economically and socially, as
Americans, while still retaining a strong Islamic identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we decided to do was not to set our culture as
being against American culture,'' said Abdelsalam Hedaya, a
cofounder of InfoLibria, a computer firm in Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   So Hedaya and his wife put up a Christmas tree and, at
Halloween, allow their three children to go trick-or-treating. ``We
don't decorate with religious symbols, but we still celebrate the
seasons,'' he said. ``At the same time we are very consistent about
celebrating Ramadan. We hang up lights around the house.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hedaya's children attend a rigorous weekend Arabic school in
Quincy sponsored by the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington and
taught by Boston area Saudi scholars and graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed that if the kids felt that there was any
particular contradiction between the cultures that they might have
to choose one or the other and we don't think they need to,''
Hedaya said.
</P>
<P>
   While Islam may not yet be deeply woven into American society,
many Muslim families say they have been heartened by the tolerance
and respect shown their children by neighbors, classmates and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Because fasting from dawn to sunset is a central feature of
Ramadan, many schools give Muslim students greater leeway, allowing
them skip gym or allotting more time for assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Nadjette Lazzouni has no qualms about where her three children
will go to high school once they graduate from Al-Hamra Academy.
``I feel they are well-equipped to defend what they believe in,''
no matter where they are, she said. ``They are proud to talk about
their religion. That means the whole world to me.''

HOSPITALS RUNNING OUT OF KEY CLOT-BUSTING DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hospitals around the nation are rationing their dwindling
supplies of a widely used clot-busting drug after federal officials
suspended shipments because of concerns about the risks of
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, called urokinase or Abbokinase, is a mainstay for
treating blood clots in the legs that can threaten the loss of a
limb, for dissolving dangerous lung clots, and for clearing the
tubes used by patients with kidney failure and cancer for dialysis
and chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need this drug,'' said Dr. Anne Roberts of the
University of California at San Diego. ``There really aren't good
alternatives for many patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Boston hospitals say they have only a few days' supply of
urokinase, with no information from the drug's manufacturer, Abbott
Laboratories, about when it will resume shipments.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman Saturday said, ``We expect to have this
situation resolved shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an impending crisis,'' said Kenneth Lawrence, the
pharmacy manager at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ``This is
something that's starting to occur more frequently, drug shortages
that sometimes even the companies can't always explain.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with doctors Thursday, officials from the
US Food and Drug Administration were unwilling to estimate how long
the drug will be off the market, according to Tricia McClenny of
the Society for Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supplies are dwindling,'' McClenny said. ``Our members say
they have almost no supplies or only enough for one or two cases.''
</P>
<P>
   McClenny said physician members of her organization say that
some patients could die or lose a limb for lack of urokinase.
Although the FDA notes that there are alternative clot-busting
drugs, physicians have far more experience using urokinase for some
common situations, and doctors say it is much less likely to cause
dangerous bleeding or allergic reactions than similar drugs.
</P>
<P>
   At New England Medical Center lat week, a man with a clot in a
leg artery was sent to surgery rather than given urokinase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally we would try to use urokinase, but in this instance
the guy had to have an arterial bypass operation because we
couldn't afford to use up our available urokinase,'' said Dr. Neil
Halin of the medical center, who said the hospital has about a 1
1/2-day supply.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA ordered Abbott to suspend distribution of urokinase in
late November after inspections of the Chicago-based firm's
manufacturing plants turned up multiple problems, according to an
inspection report obtained from the federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   Urokinase, a drug introduced about two decades ago, is derived
from a natural clot-dissolving substance produced by the kidneys.
Its manufacture begins with human kidney cells derived from infants
who died shortly after birth.
</P>
<P>
   Although no lots of urokinase were found to be contaminated with
bacteria or viruses, the FDA report indicates that two lots of the
neonatal kidney cells were contaminated with the hepatitis B virus
or mycoplasma, a microorganism that is intermediate between
bacteria and viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Federal inspectors also faulted Abbott for failing to test 10
lots of urokinase for hepatitis C virus in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of hepatitis C is one of the driving forces behind
the FDA's action, according to urokinase authorities. ``There were
a number of concerns'' about Abbott's manufacturing process with
urokinase, said an agency spokeswoman, Lenore Gelb, ``but the
number one was the viral inactivation process.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Sasahara of Brigham and Women's Hospital, a former
Abbott researcher and one of the first doctors to use urokinase in
the 1970s, said that he knows of no instance in which the drug has
been contaminated by disease-causing organisms, due to a 10-hour
heat treatment. But he said the possibility of hepatitis C
contamination, which could lead to fatal liver disease, ``is what
the FDA is worried about.''

HOW FAR IS THAT STAR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am looking at a star that is 200 light years away. I know
light travels at 186,000 miles per second, which would put this
star 1,173,139,200,000,000 miles away. When I look at that star,
just how far am I really looking?
</P>
<P>
   JESSE
</P>
<P>
   A. Asking how far you can see, is like asking how far you can
catch. Think of your eyes as a catcher's mitt. The mitt waits for
the ball to come to it. Like that catcher's mitt, our eyes just sit
there and let the light shine in.
</P>
<P>
   The photons, or units of light energy we see, are like
baseballs. They do the traveling. The photons that left a star, or
the moon, or the newspaper you are reading, move across short or
long distances, over short or long periods of time. When those
photons hit your open eye, they trigger photoreceptor cells called
rods and cones on the retina.
</P>
<P>
   That turns into an electrical message sent to the back of your
brain, to a section of your brain called V1. That's the primary
visual cortex, the first part of the brain to receive incoming
visual messages. Not until the message from your eyes hits V1 do
you see.
</P>
<P>
   If the nerve cell pathways between the eyes and the visual
cortex is severed, the eyes may be receiving light, but we never
perceive it.
</P>
<P>
   How far away does something have to be before you can't see it?
You can see out to infinity, assuming you don't have any health
problems with your eyes, says Dr. Dimitri Azar, director of the
Cornea Service at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary.
</P>
<P>
   If the object is big enough and bright enough to send photons
out with enough power to reach your eye, you can see them, no
matter how far away the source is.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how long ago they left, or how far they traveled to
get to you, if those photons can hit your eye, the catcher's mitt
of your vision system, you can see the object from which they came.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. If I had a dollar bill for every atom in a one-dollar bill,
would I be richer than Bill Gates?
</P>
<P>
   S.V., Revere, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. This wonderful fantasy would indeed make you richer than
Dollar Bill Gates, who, according to Fortune Magazine has been the
richest person on Earth four years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Based strictly on his publicly registered holding of 500,777,800
shares of Microsoft, (according to the CNN FN network) Gates was
worth $64,068,259,787 last Monday. We'll call it $64.07 billion for
short. Since Microsoft stock went public in 1986, he has made $96
million a week.
</P>
<P>
   That makes him worth 50 percent more than all the gold in Fort
Knox. He could fund NASA for nearly five years. He could buy every
team in all four major professional sports leagues in America with
just one quarter of his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   But even Bill Gates wouldn't match your wealth, S.V. The Bureau
of Engraving and Printing says a dollar bill weighs .032 troy
ounces. We don't know precisely what a dollar bill is made of, but
it's mostly paper, which is largely cellulose.
</P>
<P>
   MIT physicist Walter Lewin says that based on the molecular
weight of cellulose there are approximately 80 billion trillion
atoms in a dollar bill. That works out to:
80,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
</P>
<P>
   Just for fun, we calculated how rich you'd be if you had a
dollar for every atom just in the black ink on the front of the
dollar bill, and the green ink on the back (that's why they call
them greenbacks).
</P>
<P>
   The .06 grams of black ink has 3.75 billion trillion atoms. The
.05 grams of green ink has 3.125 billion trillion atoms. Lewin
cautions that these are gross estimates based on some informed
estimates about the atomic structure and molecular weights of the
paper and ink of a dollar bill.
</P>
<P>
   But even if they are way off, a dollar for every atom in a
dollar bill would be enough to make even Bill Gates green with
envy.

`GOOD WILL TOWARD MEN'? NOT THIS HOLIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ The fifth-graders in the Washington public
schools brought home a work sheet the other afternoon. The answers
were: majority vote in the House, two-thirds vote in the Senate,
Andrew Johnson. You can guess what the questions were.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country schoolchildren are also having their holiday
concerts. You can hear the strains of ``Peace on earth, good will
toward men,'' even as the latest update on our bombing of Iraq
echoes in the background.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no peace. Precious little good will, either. This
is the most unsettling holiday season in years _ since, maybe,
1972, when on Christmas Day American airmen bombed the outskirts of
Hanoi, or maybe even 1941, when Americans were first coming to
grips with the notion that they were at war on two fronts, our
liberty and lifestyle in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   This holiday season we're at war with ourselves. No party
dispute about that; no gender gap, either. It's as plain as day.
And we just happen also to be at war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   So what are we to do to reclaim the holidays from politics?
Perhaps the answer is to turn away, just for this period, from
public conflict and take solace in private comforts: the strains of
familiar anthems and hymns, the reassuring presence of family, the
warm waves of enduring memories. There is a civic cost to such a
withdrawal, of course, for Thomas Jefferson reminded us that the
price of liberty is eternal vigilance. But the Founders will
forgive us, this once, if we don't let Monica S. Lewinsky and
Kenneth W. Starr nor Trent Lott and Bob Livingston intrude on our
thoughts until, say, the day after New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   Odd that things have turned out this way, at the end of a year
that began with so much promise: A roaring economy. American
soldiers and sailors and fliers far from harm's way. The budget
deficit gone. Voter rebellion vanished. Crime down. Optimism up.
The pollsters even showed that more and more Americans believed
that the nation was heading in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   These were the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   Were. Now we're racked with worry (over Iraq), rent with
bitterness (over impeachment), unsure of our way (about many
things.). The experts say that politics doesn't matter the way it
used to, that people aren't interested in Washington the way they
used to be, that foreign-policy challenges don't chill us the way
they used to. All three have been proven wrong in the last week. We
care a surprising amount.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we don't impeach a president every day. The last time
we did it was 1868, when we were hardly one country, though no
longer two. We were fresh out of the Civil War and the wounds, real
and psychological, were fresh. Only three years earlier, in one of
the most stirring speeches ever, Abraham Lincoln marked his second
Inaugural by pledging ``to finish the work we are in, to bind up
the nation's wounds.'' That passage, memorized by generations of
Americans, concluded with a pledge ``to do all which may achieve
and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a modern president, charged with the ancient but common
flaws of lust and lies, faces impeachment. No one doubts that he
behaved deplorably. But, in truth, there has been bad behavior all
around; the revelations on Thursday about the infidelities of House
Speaker Livingston _ a man eager for an impeachment vote _ reminded
us of that.
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't excuse any of it, of course, but only makes the
whole atmosphere worse. Partisan anger and frustration helped fuel
the drive for impeachment; even more partisan anger and frustration
grew out of that drive. And in any case, the anger and frustration
have contaminated the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, this is the season of suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   And so as war and impeachment crowd in on the celebrations _
Christmas week, Hanukkah, Ramadan, Kwanza are all affected, a
multidemoninational downer _ we're left with the thoughts of
Lincoln, and with the yearning for a just and lasting peace among
ourselves and with all nations.
</P>
<P>
   We are, moreover, left the way we started: searching for peace
within ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Happy holidays. Happy hunting.
</P>

DETERMINING SHARES' BASE COST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I need help. I bought 100 shares of stock at $22 each. The
shares split two for one, so I then had 200 shares. I then bought
another 100 shares at $38 each. The stock again split two for one,
leaving me then with 600 shares. When selling, either 100, 200,
400, or 600 shares, what is my cost base?
</P>
<P>
   J.R., Allentown, Pa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your total investment in the 600-share position was $6,000 _
plus the amount of the brokerage fees you paid for the two
purchases. Just as an example, let's assume the brokerage fee was
$30 each time. Thus, your base cost would be $6,060.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to sell your entire position, you would determine
your capital gain or loss by subtracting that $6,060 from the net
proceeds of the sale (again reflecting brokerage fees). If the
result is a negative number, you would have a capital loss. If it's
positive, it's a gain.
</P>
<P>
   But if you sell only part of your holdings, it can get a little
more complicated. You have two choices of how you handle the sale.
You can calculate your average cost per share, which would be
$10.10, and simply multiply the number of shares sold times $10.10
to get your base cost. Again, you would subtract that base cost
from your net proceeds to establish the capital gain or loss.
</P>
<P>
   But the tax rules also allow another method of calculating the
base cost, which is to specify the particular shares sold. Thus, if
you decided to sell 100 shares and if you wanted to minimize your
gain, you could specify that you are selling some of the shares you
purchased at $38. Adjusted for the second split, the cost base for
those shares would be $19 each, or $1,900 for 100 shares. You could
follow the same procedure if you wanted to sell 200 shares and
achieve the highest base cost _ reporting a base of $3,800 for
those 200 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose you want to go the other way _ reporting the lowest
possible base cost.
</P>
<P>
   (Perhaps you have a capital loss on some other transaction, and
want to build an offsetting capital gain.) You can then specify
that you are selling some of the shares acquired in your first
purchase. The initial 100 shares have now become 400 shares, and
their cost basis is $5.50 each. You may then sell as many of these
400 shares as you like, multiplying the number of shares sold by
$5.50 to get the cost base.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's one important technicality. The IRS dictates that
unless you specify otherwise, you must use the first method _
calculating your average cost per share for the entire position.
</P>
<P>
   To claim that you have sold specific shares you must specify in
writing to your broker that the shares you are selling were the
shares purchased at a particular date _ and/or the shares resulting
from the splitting of shares purchased on that date. Once you have
written out those instructions, maintain a copy for your tax
records.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 39 and my husband is 43. We have been putting $10,000 a
year into a 401(k) plan and $8,000 a year into a SEP-IRA, with the
two accounts now worth $140,000. All of the investments are in
stock funds. We plan to save at this rate until we retire in 15
years, but we will stop contributing to our retirement savings
plans for a six-year period beginning in six years, to pay for our
two daughters' college education. Like many investors, we are
concerned with the recent declines in our investments. Our goal is
to have $1 million saved in 15 years. Do you have any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   L.S., Portland, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, according to my calculations, you should come mighty
close.
</P>
<P>
   Following the plan you outlined above and presuming average
annual portfolio gains of 10 percent, your contributions of $1,500
a month for the next six years would take the pool to $393,269.
</P>
<P>
   During the next six years, with no additional contributions, it
would reach $697,700. And then, resuming the $1,500 monthly
contributions for the final three years, it would reach $989,620.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I run a long calculation such as that one, the answer
tends to make me nervous. It sounds so definite _ I could even have
made it $989,620.27.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, at bottom it's only a projection, and you should
probably view it as an approximation _ probably within 10 percent
plus or minus. So if you want to tilt the odds in your favor, you
could adjust the contribution levels each year.
</P>
<P>
   What I usually suggest is that you calculate how much that
$18,000 annual savings represents as a percentage of your income.
Then, presuming you achieve raises each year, maintain the savings
level as a percentage, thus raising the dollar level of your
savings program.
</P>
<P>
   The current market makes me nervous, too, but with 15 years to
go until your projected retirement date, you have plenty of time to
stay the course and ride out the market bumps.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio, which is too extensive to list here, is fairly
well diversified. The only addition I would make is to add a health
care fund to the SEP-IRA, making sure that the amount represented
there never exceeds 10 percent to 15 percent of the total
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a single divorced woman, 40 years old and without any
type of savings set up for myself. I make $27,000 a year, and I
plan to work until age 70, God willing. What can I do at this late
date to make some kind of retirement for myself? My work doesn't
offer any kind of benefits that way. I do not own anything and have
been barely scraping by most of the time, but things have settled
down. I do not understand all the different options that are out
there today, but I am willing to learn. I think I need to start an
IRA to save something for myself, but what exactly is an IRA? Where
would be the best place for me to start?
</P>
<P>
   M.J., Fullerton, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You're right that the starting point to build retirement
savings is an IRA. Those letters stand for Individual Retirement
Account. These are special savings vehicles that have been set up
by the government, providing tax incentives to people to save for
their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, you are allowed to put up to $2,000 a year into an
IRA _ providing you earn at least as much as your contribution
amounts to. When you put money into an IRA, you are allowed to
deduct the amount of your contribution from your taxable income,
thus reducing your current tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the government allows your money to build in an IRA on
a tax-deferred basis until it is withdrawn in retirement. Then,
when it is finally withdrawn, it's payback time for Uncle Sam _ the
withdrawals are treated as earned income, and are taxable at that
point.
</P>
<P>
   But most people who are retired find themselves in a lower tax
bracket than when they were working, so the ultimate tax bill is
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are a few rules involving withdrawals. If you
withdraw money from an IRA before age 59 1/2, you will face a 10
percent penalty for premature withdrawal (unless you fit into a
fairly narrowly defined list of exceptions), and also have to pay
taxes on the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   After age 59 1/2 you may make any withdrawals you like, but the
amounts withdrawn will be treated as taxable income. And finally,
after age 70 1/2 you must begin a sequence of annual withdrawals
from your IRA.
</P>
<P>
   For a person who is as many years away from retirement as you
are, a prodigious amount of money can be accumulated in an IRA
account.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you could make the maximum $2,000 annual
contribution and achieved average annual gains of 10 percent from
the investments you chose for the IRA, the account would grow to
$344,064 over 30 years. Even if you could manage only half that
amount _ $1,000 a year or $83.33 a month _ you could accumulate
$172,032, following the same assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing with a program of this sort is to adopt a
savings discipline and stick to it. Better, for example, to go over
your budget and decide you can only manage $83.33 a month than to
stretch for $166.66 _ and then find that you're skipping payments
on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up an IRA is easy. You can go to a bank and face no
risks at all, but the kind of accumulations I outlined above
require moving into the riskier world of stock investments.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to write or call one of the major mutual
fund companies such as Fidelity or Vanguard (both of which have 800
numbers) and ask both for literature describing IRAs in general and
material describing their funds that track the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 Index.
</P>
<P>
   However you proceed, you will probably have to begin with a
bank, because you'll have to reach the minimum investment level,
usually in the $500 to $1,000 range for IRA accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no difficulty in transferring an IRA from a bank to
a mutual fund company _ you simply tell the mutual fund company
what you want to do, fill out some forms, and they'll take it from
there.

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - We had the 35mm camera. We had the camcorder. There
would be another camera waiting for us there, of course, and a
computer diskette with photographic capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Edmund Hillary didn't lug along this much equipment to
document his big adventure.
</P>
<P>
   But all he did was climb Mount Everest. We were taking our
daughter to a mall to visit Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   She's only 6 months old and wouldn't know Saint Nick from
``Saint Elsewhere.'' But this is a storied American tradition, and
we intended to take part.
</P>
<P>
   If she smiled on Santa's lap, friends and relatives would have
great Christmas cards. If she shrieked in terror, we would have
something with which to embarrass her in front of future
boyfriends.
</P>
<P>
   So we dressed her in a Christmas-themed outfit, combed what few
wisps of hair she has (she currently sports a modified Charlie
Brown look) and made our way to the mall. It was decked out in an
orgy of ornaments, lights and whatnot, and in its middle stood
Santa's cottage, with the Jolly Old Elf himself holding court in a
kind of wicker love seat.
</P>
<P>
   And the line was short.
</P>
<P>
   There didn't seem to be an entrance, however, so we stepped over
a string of garland and waited. I looked around for a moment, when
what to my wondering eyes should appear but a teenage girl, the one
working the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're closed,'' she told us. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Unseasonable mood
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What??? How could this be?
</P>
<P>
   We have to cut it off somewhere, she explained. That's why you
couldn't find the entrance. It's closed.
</P>
<P>
   Ugh. This put me in the Christmas spirit about like a nail gun
to the head would have (though it affected my daughter not at all).
But we licked our wounds and came back another night.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the line was much longer, naturally, with about 15
families in front of us. It was going to take a while.
</P>
<P>
   The people behind us were veterans. They had packed their
daughter, Susan, a sandwich (excited in line, she cried on Santa's
lap). The family in front of us had four children, ranging in age
from 7 years to 18 months, which meant their level of excitement
ranged from mild to off the meter.
</P>
<P>
   Kids fueled the whole experience. Every time anyone in front
moved an inch, the whole line behind squeezed forward, hoping this
might knock a few seconds off the wait. But no one complained _
this Santa had a reputation as a pro with patience who read every
list and listened to every wish (he proved his mettle by not
erupting when a fat kid jumped up and down on his thigh). That's
great when you're on his lap, less so when you're waiting in line.
</P>
<P>
   After almost an hour, there were only a couple of families in
front of us. One, however, had an entire brood of kids. Who were
they, the Waltons? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Picture-perfect
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they moved on. Merry Christmas, John Boy. Now we had to
decide which photo package to buy. We thought for a minute before
opting for the inevitable Ton 'o Photos. A sucker for this kind of
thing, I also bought the computer diskette.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw you coming,'' the father in front of me said,
laughing. His family had been doing this for years; he bought a
single 5-by-7 photo for the family album. With experience comes
wisdom, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was our turn. Not old enough to fear strangers (a
problem for some kids), my daughter was perfectly happy on Santa's
lap. She smiled and giggled and looked like the Gerber baby on
holiday tour. Good plan, buying all those extra shots.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's hard to get into the holiday spirit when you're
still running the air-conditioner in your car. Balmy days and
``Sleigh Ride'' aren't always a good mix. But as we left the mall,
I realized I hadn't felt this Christmasy in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature didn't matter. Neither did the decorations.
Santa, jolly as he was, didn't either.
</P>
<P>
   But that funny little smile on my daughter's face did.
</P>
<P>
   I can hardly wait till next year. &QL;

THE REAL RACISM IN `NAPPY HAIR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Nappy Hair'' controversy in Brooklyn has faded from the
papers, understandably displaced by news of impeachment and Gulf
War fighting. Looking back, though, I wonder whether the episode
doesn't say something about America's troubles that is at least as
important as the president's lack of character, or highlight a
threat to our future that is as menacing as Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nappy Hair'' is the title of a children's book by Carolivia
Herron, a professor at Chico State University in California. Its
subject is the wild, kinky hair of a little black girl. Its message
is that black children, far from being embarrassed, should love
their hair and take pride in their African features. The text
adopts a ``black'' rhythm and syntax:
</P>
<P>
   (begin itals)Them some willful intentional naps you got all over
your head.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough.
</P>
<P>
   Your hair intended to be nappy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it did.(end itals)
</P>
<P>
   At Public School 75 in Brooklyn, a third-grade teacher used the
book for extracurricular reading with her mostly black and Hispanic
class. Ruth Sherman chose ``Nappy Hair'' in the belief that it
would strengthen her students' self-esteem. But a few black parents
objected to the book and descended on P.S. 75 in protest.
Apparently they were affronted by the word ``nappy,'' which in some
circles is a pejorative. Without reading the book, they jumped to
the conclusion that it was offensive to minorities _ and that the
teacher who assigned it must be a racist. The teacher, needless to
say, is white.
</P>
<P>
   ``An angry mob confronted Sherman at the school,'' the New York
Post reported, ``hurling racial slurs and demanding, `What the
(expletive) do you know about nappy hair?' There were shouts of
`You better watch it!' and `We're gonna get you!' '' Sherman was
pulled from her class and suspended from teaching for several days.
Eventually New York City school officials figured out that she was
the victim in the affair, and invited her back to P.S. 75. Fearing
for her safety _ and observing that no action had been taken
against the parents who threatened her _ Sherman asked to be
transferred. Now she is teaching second grade at P.S. 131 in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lessons of this sorry tale is the old warning that no
good deed goes unpunished. Sherman's reward for concerning herself
with the welfare of her students was to be branded a racist and
chased from her classroom. This must have been particularly
painful; Sherman used to volunteer as a reading tutor at P.S. 75
even before becoming a teacher. Among the students she tutored was
a daughter of one of the women who threatened her.
</P>
<P>
   It is bad enough to be falsely accused of racism; it is even
worse when your alleged offense was the opposite of racist. Sherman
is only the latest in a depressingly long line of people slandered
as bigots at the very hour when they were demonstrating that their
tolerance and respect knows no color.
</P>
<P>
   Editors of the student paper at the University of Rhode Island
know how Sherman feels. They were condemned as racists this month
for running a cartoon that offended minority activists on campus.
In fact, the cartoon was meant to mock those who oppose affirmative
action in higher education. But like the Brooklyn parents, the
activists in Providence were so eager to take offense that they
didn't bother to notice that they were attacking their own allies _
and becoming thugs in the process. ``Too many people have been
hurt,'' barked one student who wanted to cut off the paper's
funding. ``Are we going to hide behind this freedom-of-speech
crap?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the end of the day, the worst sinner in the ``Nappy
Hair'' business, it seems to me, is Ruth Sherman herself. Granted,
her motives were pure. And granted, the foul-mouthed parents who
threatened her are jerks. But what kind of teacher encourages her
students to dwell on their hair? What kind of teacher tries to
promote self-esteem with feelgood cheerleading for meaningless
racial characteristics? What kind of teacher imagines that what is
needed at P.S. 75 _ where 70 percent of the children read below
grade level _ is a patronizing affirmation that black is beautiful?
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy is that Sherman is no exception. Countless teachers
and principals, awash in PC theories of ``diversity'' and
``multiculturalism,'' spend the school year filling their students'
heads with racial boosterism and ethnic consciousness. What matters
most in life, the students learn, is not what they know or how they
behave _ it is which minority group they belong to. The kids of
P.S. 75 may never master reading and writing. But they will master
the technique of wearing their racial and ethnic identities like
suits of armor _ a defense against all criticism, a shield against
high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The two most dangerous trends in American society are the
failure of public schools to educate the young and the splintering
of our population into race-obsessed subgroups. Both trends are
accelerated by schools like P.S. 75, where reading takes a back
seat to the praising of nappy hair. If Sherman believed she was
helping her young students, she was deluding herself. What
third-graders need to hear is that true self-esteem comes only
through hard work and real achievement. Telling them to celebrate
their hair is tantamount to telling them they are too stupid to
strive for any higher accomplishment. Perhaps it's just as well
that Sherman was chased from her classroom.

PEOPLE'S VOICE   WAS IGNORED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   We interrupt this constitutional crisis to bring you a slice of
reality: The Great Train Store in Natick, Mass. is running low on
Lionel starter sets; Borders is doing a brisk enough business to
keep Tom Wolfe in white suits into the next century; Furbies are
out of stock everywhere, but there are still Cool Blue Barbies to
be had at Kay Bee Toy Stores.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States Congress breathlessly counts down the
days of the Clinton presidency, we are ticking off the shopping
days until Christmas. We are not apathetic; we are irrelevent. We
recognize that Congress is again off on a toot of its own. Who can
blame people for going to the mall given our lack of impact on the
vote Saturday in ``the people's House?''
</P>
<P>
   In telegrams and opinion polls, Americans for weeks have
appealed to our elected representatives to find a middle course, to
punish the president for his reckless misdeeds without subjecting
us to an impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing my constituents or anyone else could say to
me at this point,'' Congressman Bill McCollum, a Republican
Judiciary Committee member from Florida said as House debate on
impeachment resumed Saturday. ``We are not listening to the public
at this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   If not at this moment, then when, Mr. McCollum?
</P>
<P>
   McCollum and his majority party in the House insisted that one
man's record of deceit and manipulation has put the presidency
itself in peril. What is the risk, then, to representative
democracy when the well-modulated voice of the American people is
silenced by the vengeful cries of our elected representatives? What
is the danger of a political process engineered for retribution
rather than resolution?
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the surface comity _ the gentle lady from Impeachment
Now yielding without objection to the gentleman from Censure
Alternative _ the refusal to consider any but the ultimate sanction
against President Clinton was the culmination of a bitter
partisanship that has undermined progress on substantive issues
from health care to Social Security. The rancor did not begin with
William Jefferson Clinton, though certainly the personal enmity his
behavior engenders has exacerbated it.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been moving for a quarter century toward partisan
paralysis and away from what the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
once called ``the search for remedy.'' The idealism that once made
so many Americans view politics as an instrument of social progress
has been reduced to the sexual voyeurism that Saturday forced
Congressman Bob Livingston of Louisiana to surrender his seat and
his pending speakership of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no stability in the House since 1987 when Thomas
P. O'Neill Jr. returned home to Massachusetts after 10 years as
speaker. Livingston is only the latest victim of what O'Neill's
successor, Jim Wright of Texas, called the ``mindless cannibalism''
of a once deliberative body, now riven by vicious
self-righteousness. Republican Newt Gingrich of Georgia
self-immolated only a month ago, singed by the flames of his own
incindiary rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   For all the meanness and mistrust, for all the smallness and
suspicion, there were moments of quiet grace and stirring eloquence
on the floor of the House within the last 48 hours. Not every
Republican was participating in what Patrick Kennedy of Rhode
Island characterized as ``a political lynching.'' One could hardly
doubt the sincerity of J. C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, who could not
reconcile the president's lies with the ideals he is trying to
teach his children. Not every Democrat was simply doing his party's
bidding. One could hardly doubt the dismay of Charles Schumer of
New York, who could not reconcile the use of impeachment to punish
a sexual indiscretion, no matter how cunningly covered up.
</P>
<P>
   If we only had any sense that those of differing but good will
were actually listening to one another Saturday. Maybe then, we
retain some hope that, at some juncture, the people's House will
respond to us once more.
</P>
<P>
   It took a political Independent, Bernard Sanders of Vermont, to
speak for the hopeless among us who finally gave up and went
shopping. ``I have never fully appreciated before just how out of
touch this institution is with the American people,'' he said.

THREE CONGRESSMEN IN SEARCH OF AN IMPEACHMENT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in microcosm, you can see what went wrong in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Charles Bass and John Sununu of New Hampshire and
Democrat Jim McGovern of Massachusetts were not players in the
impeachment farce and are doubtless happy that was so. But they
were voters nonetheless, just as powerful in the end as Bob Barr,
Lindsey Graham, and Bill Delahunt.
</P>
<P>
   And as such, they were stuck with what proved an impossible task
_ explaining a decision that could not be justified with reference
to a body of ``facts,'' a common concept of what constitute
impeachable offenses, or even a clear definition of the offenses
with which President Clinton is charged.
</P>
<P>
   All three were bipartisanly partisan. McGovern voted ``no'' all
the way; Bass and Sununus voted ``yes'' on all the close votes,
though Bass did join 80 other Republicans in rejecting the fourth
article of impeachment alleging perjury in last month's game of 81
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, they reflected what all voting commentators on this
mess were forced to reflect: a mass of grand jury material that was
never investigated, its internal contradictions never resolved, its
witnesses never tested by the probing heat of cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Under such impossible conditions, the best roles Bass, Sununu,
and McGovern could play were as sightless people touching different
parts of an elephant and identifying their tiny corner of reality
with certainty.
</P>
<P>
   On the guilty side, Bass and Sununu deplored perjury without
identifying a single perjurious statement, exactly as in the
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On the House floor late Friday, Jim McGovern argued for a
summary judgment based on prosecutorial abuse, as did most of the
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee. He made no case against the
case itself, inferential and incomplete as it is.
</P>
<P>
   This unhappy situation is the result of what both the
Republicans and the Democrats did during an inquiry that was really
not an inquiry at all.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the fortunately expiring Independent Counsel Act, all
the Republicans did was receive Ken Starr's argumentative referral,
release it along with his grand jury material, and then reproduce
it with different words. No testing of the evidence or of the
witnesses ever occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The burden of proof should never be on a defendant, presidents
included, but the fact remains that the Democrats also chose to
pick at the evidence rather than put on their own inquiry. And
worse, the full committee never did what its Watergate counterpart
did with such care _ reach a consensus on what constitutes
impeachable conduct and on the standards for a yes vote on an
article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The result, almost by bipartisan conspiracy, was a bunch of
people (initially 37, eventually 435) picking and choosing their
favorite and least favorite pieces of raw material or dismissing
the entire case.
</P>
<P>
   Bass got but 60 seconds on the floor late Friday to claim that
Clinton ``knowingly'' lied under oath, following the Judiciary
Committee's tack of labeling unidentified testimony. Similarly, he
followed Republican form in asserting that Clinton ``attempted to
corruptly influence'' others' testimony, ignoring the assertions of
Monica Lewinsky and Betty Currie that he did not.
</P>
<P>
   In his material announcing his decision last week, Bass at least
departed from many of his GOP colleagues in not claiming he was
simply voting to ``send'' the case to the Senate, saying his vote
to impeach means he believes the president should not hold his
office any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Sununu, who announced his intention a bit earlier, to no one's
surprise, followed a similar path in his own statement. Where he
differed primarily was in flatly stating many of the ``facts''
actually in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sununu said Clinton conspired to ``obstruct justice
by encouraging witnesses to hide evidence'' _ despite the fact that
no grand jury witness testified to that effect. And he bought into
another element of that alleged offense by ignoring the testimony
of Betty Currie that the president did not try ``to intimidate her
into providing false testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   And both, to their shame, attempted to draw inferences from
their claim _ which is false _ that the president offered no
contradiction of the ``facts'' in Starr's referral.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, McGovern attacked partisanship, the subject matter
of the case, and the denial of a censure alternative. In effect, he
demanded summary judgment rather than acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the three congressmen were footnotes to the main
story. But they were also metaphors, with full voting rights, for
an inquiry that accomplished nothing beyond the amplification of
deep divisions.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't their fault. The case they had to consider could never
have been anything more than the vehicle for a shouting match. But
they voted, and that act will eventually be judged.
</P>

IN CLINTON'S FATE, A CONGRESSIONAL ASCENDANCY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bill Clinton began his march to the White House in the fall
of 1991, only two years had passed since the fall of the Berlin
Wall marked the end of the Communist empire and the transformation
of the American presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The president has always reigned supreme in wartime, as the
national leader and emblem of American values, and the Cold War
period had been no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, was vying to become the first postwar
president in almost five decades. Politically dextrous and
emotionally responsive, Clinton seemed as well suited to an era
dominated by domestic issues, and thus by shared power and
persuasion, as he was ill-suited to wartime.
</P>
<P>
   His liabilities _ avoidance of military service, marital
infidelity _ might have ruled him out during a time when the
president unblinkingly answered to ``Leader of the Free World.''
But that title, and the grandiose expectations that went with it,
died with the Communist empire.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was elected to a weaker office, amid lower expectations.
And last week, as the House denied him even the usual deference
accorded a commander in chief when soldiers are in the field, both
the president and his office seemed to grow even weaker by the
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Clinton stands impeached, some historians are wondering
about the extent to which the tides of history, and not simply the
accidental confluence of a sexual harassment suit, a lie about sex,
and an aggressive independent counsel, are drawing the presidency
inexorably into the arms of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an argument of luxury,'' said Michael Corgan,
presidential historian at Boston University, as he watched last
Friday's impeachment debate. ``We wouldn't be doing this if the US
were really imperiled. It's now safe for Congress to take power
back and make the president less of a leader. He can't use that
excuse anymore _ that he can't be disturbed because there are vital
issues at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Columbia University historian Eric Foner, ``National
crises tend to aggrandize the power of the president. In more
normal times, the balance tends to shift away from the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, of course, is not alone in having assumed the
presidency during a period of congressional ascendency. Similar
fates befell other postwar presidents _ including, most
dramatically, the man to whom he is now twinned in history, Andrew
Johnson, the only previous president to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson survived a trial in the Senate by one vote, but the
impeachment presaged a long era of weakened chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   While Foner noted that the Johnson crisis was spurred by sharp
policy differences over vital national issues _ differences all but
absent in the current clash _ others saw the 1868 impeachment as a
reaction to the unprecedented powers assumed by Abraham Lincoln
during the Civil War, a kind of pendulum swing back in the favor of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the House and the Senate had stayed home for much of
the Civil War, allowing Lincoln to rule largely unfettered as
commander in chief of America's armed forces, the major power
ascribed to the president under the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln's political acumen, combined with the prestige earned by
steering the Union to victory, seemed to promise an orderly
reconstruction. But Lincoln was assassinated just as the war was
ending, and Johnson, a Southerner who had remained loyal to the
Union, uneasily assumed his mantle.
</P>
<P>
   When the Republicans in Congress clashed with Johnson over the
standards for readmitting Southern states, the House and Senate
moved quickly to restrict the president's powers.
</P>
<P>
   They approved the ``Tenure of Office Act'' to prevent Johnson
from replacing any of Lincoln's Cabinet officers, thereby assuring
that the hawkish Edwin Stanton would remain as secretary of war.
When Johnson defied the act by firing Stanton, the House impeached
him by an overwhelming majority.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson remained in office for another year, his standoff with
Congress paralyzing the country.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency, many believe, didn't regain its luster for more
than 30 years, until Theodore Roosevelt ascended ``the bully
pulpit'' and, in the name of the people, declared war on the
economic excesses of the Gilded Age.
</P>
<P>
   The office assumed even greater power under Roosevelt's rival,
Woodrow Wilson. World War I made the United States a world power,
and Wilson became the preeminent figure of the postwar world.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress, following a familiar postwar scenario, rejected
Wilson's grand vision for a League of Nations in an epic grudge
match that rendered the president politically weakened even as he
was physically disabled by a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Warren G. Harding, Wilson's successor, promised a ``return to
normalcy'' that would last a dozen years, before the successive
crises of the Depression and World War II would restore the
dominance of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not in a war, it's hard to see what the power of
the presidency is,'' Foner said, citing the relatively powerless
presidencies of the late 19th century and the 1920s. ``The power of
the presidency is the ability to put yourself forward as spokesman
of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Harry Truman clashed with the ``do nothing''
80th Congress in a standoff somewhat reminiscent of Johnson's and
Wilson's struggles. But Truman's invoking of the Communist threat
broke the logjam, prompting Congress's approval of aid to Greece
and Turkey, and the ``Truman Doctrine'' ushered in the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Truman and his four immediate successors bestrode the world
stage: Lyndon Johnson's escalation of the Vietnam War, based only
on a loosely worded Senate resolution, was a high-water mark of
presidential authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Watergate scandal, immediately following the Vietnam War,
and Richard Nixon's resignation, changed the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the aftermath of the president more or less running
the Vietnam War out of his back pocket,'' said Corgan. ``I see
Watergate, and Nixon's resignation, as part of the same'' pattern
toward postwar congressional leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Clinton struggles to remain in office, a desire for more
congressional control is ``not the only argument out there, but
it's part of it,'' Corgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Hillary Clinton have long maintained that they are
transitional figures representing a younger generation, with a
world view informed by the clashes of the '60s: the antiwar
movement, the civil rights movement, and feminism.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's overtly political style _ the narrow
tailoring of issues to build coalitions, the cat-and-mouse
gamesmanship with Congress _ also marks a transition from the more
lordly approaches of Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   No longer the guardian of American freedom against a foreign
enemy, the president must, by necessity, lead by persuasion. The
history of the Clinton administration _ from the epic defeat over
health care, to the tussle over the Contract With America, to the
government shutdown of 1995 _ reflects the seesawing of power
between the president and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion surveys suggest Clinton commands the support of the
people in the impeachment crisis, but with the next election two
years away, it's hard to tell how much the polls will hold sway.
</P>
<P>
   As Foner, Corgan, and others point out, the sheer ``normalcy''
of the times, with no imminent threat abroad and no economic crisis
at home, leaves Clinton vulnerable. After all, how profoundly
disruptive can it be to replace one moderate Democrat with another?

THE STEREOTYPES DON'T SURVIVE IN THIS FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look at my name. Now, read about my family.
</P>
<P>
   My brother and his wife are crack addicts and high school
dropouts. My mother, when money was tight, worked as a prostitute.
She was held hostage once by her crazy ex-convict boyfriend, who
dunked her head in a toilet, at knifepoint.
</P>
<P>
   My cousin is in prison for stealing cars and checks from my aunt
and grandmother. Her two sons, both teenagers, are in jail for
murder. My grandmother lives in a trailer park. I am the only one
of my American cousins to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let me tell you why I support the idea of looking at
diversity _ and disadvantage _ in terms of economics, rather than
race or ethnicity: All of the above mentioned relatives are white.
</P>
<P>
   When I cover stories for the Globe that deal with disadvantaged
people, usually (but not always) people of color, my editors
applaud my ``understanding'' of the people I write about. Many
assume my Hispanic-ness has something to do with that. No one
assumes the truth: that I personally understand and identify with
the disadvantaged because of my white mother, and her poor,
uneducated family.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes comes from my father, who is Cuban, very middle class,
and a college professor. Rodriguez comes from my husband, a
fourth-generation Mexican-American who speaks about as much Spanish
as Rush Limbaugh. My in-laws drive a minivan, live in the suburbs,
shop QVC, and own their own home.
</P>
<P>
   My mother is what you would call white, with red hair and blue
eyes, Irish and English, from a family that is lovingly described
by her as ``white trash.'' My sister-in-law, the crack addict, is
also white. Her father once called my brother a ``spic'' and chased
him from their trailer home with a shotgun. But now my brother, who
goes by Ric rather than Ricardo, has proved that he is as big a
Lynard Skyynard fan as the next redneck in their family, and they
have accepted him.
</P>
<P>
   My brother's world is inhabited by poor white dropouts and
rejects, perpetually high kids who grew up on welfare, were beaten
by their parents _ a hopeless bunch forever in and out of prison,
who are in every way more deserving of affirmative action than am
I, with my Ivy League degree.
</P>
<P>
   The folks with bad grammar in my family tree are white. The ones
on welfare, white. The ones in trouble with the law, white.
</P>
<P>
   At 12, I was given the choice to live with my Hispanic single
father or my white single mother after their divorce.
</P>
<P>
   My father wrote books, had a PhD, attended my school functions.
He traveled, and played NPR on the radio as he cooked dinner for
us. He jogged. He bought flowers for the table.
</P>
<P>
   My mother wore tight cutoff shorts and T-shirts that said things
like ``Damn I'm Good.'' She flirted with my teenage brother's
friends, and bought them alcohol for their parties. She lived with
a mechanic from New Jersey, a white guy, who sold drugs and robbed
her of $4,000 before running out on her. She smoked pot and left
the remains of her joints in Harley Davidson ashtrays. She got
tattoos. She took a job with an escort service. Her convict
boyfriend shot my brother's car full of bullets in a
mushroom-induced rage, and promised he would kill me, too. He was a
member of a white supremacist organization.
</P>
<P>
   I chose to live with my father.
</P>
<P>
   My Hispanic father. My Cuban father. It was only later that I
learned that Cuban-Americans have median household incomes higher
than that of ``whites.'' That didn't surprise me. The only poor
people I'd known growing up were my mother's relatives, cousins who
lived in trailer parks and fed their babies Dr Pepper in their
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you about Josh. He was my cousin Brett's youngest
son. Brett is the one who is now in prison. I was 14 or so when
Josh was born, and I remember the deep gaze with which he observed
me one Thanksgiving. He must have been about 3 years old. Sucking
his soda out of that bottle, he was bruised, inside and out. He
still hadn't spoken his first word.
</P>
<P>
   His was a world of abuse and drugs and loud Led Zepplin and
speeding junky Camaros. He watched me, and I wanted to wrap him up
and run away with him. He did not smile. What kind of child didn't
smile? I spent hours that evening talking to him. Holding him. I
remember him eventually leaning into my embrace, trusting me, I
remember saying softly into his hair, ``Be strong, please, please
make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh is almost a man now, 16 years old. And he's in prison. He
robbed a gun store, and, the police say, killed a woman. He is
family. He is white. And I know, I know, I got chances in this life
that Josh never got. We come from the same hell. But I have a
Spanish name.
</P>
<P>
   Disadvantage is more than a skin color. More than a language.
More than an ethnicity. It is your mother selling her body. It is
your brother smoking crack until his diaphragm separates from his
lungs and he ends up in the emergency room, and they call you and
tell you he is dying, he and all his white drug addict friends.
</P>
<P>
   Disadvantage is the lack of opportunity, brought about by
poverty. And it is ludicrous to think that my husband and his
siblings, raised by a loving, stable and hard-working suburban
family, are more deserving of a boost up than my sister-in-law, my
cousin, or my mother.
</P>
<P>
   That is the truth.
</P>

PREPARATION CAN EASE THE STRESS OF HOLIDAY TRAVEL DELAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Filed in national news, ``a,'' and travel, ``t,''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACOB H. FRIES  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When a lightning storm at the Ronald
Reagan-Washington National Airport outside Washington forced the
plane back to the terminal, many passengers got confused, some got
upset, others got ready to run for the gate agent. Molly Brodie got
out her Rolodex and cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Before Brodie even stepped off the plane, she had booked another
flight to San Francisco and a hotel room for the night.
</P>
<P>
   With the prospect of holiday crowds, travel specialists are
urging passengers to expect delays and be ready with a ``Plan B.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the survival of the fittest,'' said Lauri Berger,
editor of Consumer Reports' Travel Letter, who recommends that
holiday travelers use ``guerrilla tactics,'' or face sleeping in an
airport. ``You learn to play the game, and it's the road warriors
that talk their way in and out of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The busiest travel days this holiday season are likely to be
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday as travelers try to reach the homes
of friends and relatives by Christmas Eve, airport officials said.
Terminals also are expected to be packed on Jan. 2, as passengers
return home after New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to crowded parking lots and congested traffic
outside the terminals, travelers can expect beefed-up security
because of the recent airborne attacks on Iraq by American and
British forces. Weather also could lead to delays.
</P>
<P>
   Brodie, who flies more than 100,000 miles a year as a senior
researcher for the Kaiser Family Foundation, said just having the
phone number for an airline or travel agent can reduce many delays
caused by crowds and poor weather. The payoff for her: While most
of the other 200 passengers on her storm-delayed flight were
waiting in line for help, she strolled off to dinner and a soft
bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't dare wait for someone to take care of you,'' she said.
``Expect beyond-belief delays and create options for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodie said holidays fliers should allow more time between
connecting flights to steer through crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said passengers should demand a seat assignment when
making reservations to avoid the dreaded middle or nonreclining
seat. As a ``road warrior'' herself, Berger said she tries to board
the plane first, regardless of where she is supposed to sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They generally don't check your boarding pass, and that way
you can get some place to put your carry-ons,'' she said. ``And the
worst thing that can happen is they'll send you to the end of the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   During holidays, airlines strictly limit passengers to two
carry-on bags. To avoid bulk, airport officials suggest that
passengers pack gifts in their checked luggage and wrap them once
they arrive at their destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Wilson, a spokesman for the San Francisco International
Airport, said X-ray machines at security checkpoints have trouble
detecting through foil wrap and tin containers. If X-ray monitors
can't see what is inside a package, passengers may be asked by a
security guard to unwrap it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent military action against Iraq, Wilson said
passengers would hardly notice stepped-up security, which includes
more bomb-sniffing dogs and tow trucks to remove unattended
vehicles. He said passengers would still be asked to present photo
identification and answer security questions, precautions put in
place after the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kabo, a consultant specializing in corporate travel,
said his best advice was to fly early in the day and enter through
the arrivals area.
</P>
<P>
   If crowds become too much, Kabo said, he likes to escape in a
book. Others, he said, take free shuttles to nearby hotels to avoid
airport noise and bustle.
</P>
<P>
   When all else fails, Brodie said, it helps to recognize that
other people are going through the same frustrations and that
airline workers probably aren't responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``And once you've done all that you can to fix any problems,
then the only thing you can do is remove yourself mentally away
from the chaos,'' she said.

CLINTON WILL LOSE IN SENATE TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What if he survives? That's the question Democratic senators ask
themselves as they contemplate President Clinton's impeachment by
the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome in the House is no longer in doubt. A president who
has been impeached is governing us.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings then move to the US Senate for trial. There will
be no deal on censure there, just as there was no deal on censure
in the House. Republican constituencies simply will not allow it.
Indeed, on this point of procedure, the voice of Republican
constituents has already prevailed. Thursday, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott said the Senate would not deviate from the
straight and narrow path prescribed by the Constitution. There will
be no easy way out.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of Republican senators will vote for
conviction, so the president's fate now rests in the hands of 45
Democrats. They must decide whether to condone or condemn his
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Morally, they know that if they vote against conviction, they
will have ceded the high ground to their Republican colleagues.
They will not be the ones upholding the Constitution. They will not
be the ones insisting that no man is above the law. Their
Republican colleagues will state that case and it will ring true,
as it always has.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Democratic senators who vote to condone will establish
what may in time become known as The Clinton Exemption. The Clinton
Exemption will aver that a president may lie under oath in a sexual
harassment suit, may lie under oath to the presiding federal judge
in that suit, may lie to his Cabinet and counselors, may lie to the
country he governs, may lie under oath to duly appointed officers
of the Department of Justice in a federal criminal investigation,
may lie to the House Judiciary Committee presiding over hearings on
his impeachment, and, should he so choose, may engage any number of
people in our employ to lie on his behalf, so long as he lacks the
courage to face embarrassment. It is a precedent that will be
etched in the acid of dishonor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, senators who vote to condone Clinton's conduct will
be voting to overlook serious and substantial charges of witness
tampering and obstruction of justice, both of which are ongoing
subjects of federal criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   That is a tall order for men like Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, a devout Roman Catholic and a dedicated public servant.
That is a tall order for Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, whose
character is attested to by a Congressional Medal of Honor. That is
a tall order for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whom history will
regard as perhaps the greatest senator of his time.
</P>
<P>
   Those that vote to condone will do their best to put things in
the best possible light. They will argue that Clinton's offenses do
not rise to the level of impeachment. They will minimize and
rationalize and justify Clintons conduct; splitting every legal
hair as they go. They will decry Republican tactics and the
zealotry of its right wing. They will recite the chapter and verse
of public opinions polls objecting to the president's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And as they do so they will dishonor the very liberal values
that have guided their party across a century of political life.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, if enough Democrats vote to condone, then they will
have Clinton hanging around their necks for the next two years. The
president himself will lack the moral authority to do anything, and
the corruption of political life will continue apace. Everything
will be transactional. Ethics will be a joke. Spin will reign
triumphant. And come the year 2000, they can all campaign together
under a banner that states: One Man is Above the Law.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, they will be left with their consciences and the
judgment of history. They work in office buildings named after men
like Everett Dirksen and Phil Hart, giants of political courage and
fortitude. In the halls and in committee hearing rooms, they sit
under portraits of men who changed the course of history. Almost to
a person, the 45 Democratic senators don't admire Bill Clinton.
They admire his political skills and facility, but with regard to
his character they can barely conceal their contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Why any Democratic senator would lift a finger to help him is a
mystery. It is said in Washington that the votes to convict Clinton
cannot be found in the Senate chamber. Do not believe it. Not one
Democratic senator believes the four articles of impeachment are
insubstantial. And most of them believe that every word of the
articles is true.

<P>
   When all else fails, Brodie said, it helps to recognize that
other people are going through the same frustrations and that
airline workers probably aren't responsible.

REPUBLICAN AGENDA LEGIBLE TO ALL BUT MOST DON'T WANT TO READ IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Republicans' rush to get President Clinton impeached
before the new Congress is sworn in next month strongly suggests
that their true intentions had nothing to do with their
constitutional responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they had everything to do with a right-wing agenda to
finally accomplish what they have been trying to do for the past
six years: humiliate, embarrass, and, if possible, destroy Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   GOP partisans would not allow even US air attacks against Iraq,
or the latest Republican scandal _ House Speaker-elect (and now
resigned) Bob Livingston's admission last week of marital
infidelities _ to slow the impeachment stampede.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to judgment is fueled, in part, by the Republicans'
knowledge that some of the current members voting for impeachment
won't be back next month, having lost their seats in last month's
elections. It's hard to say how the new members might vote.
</P>
<P>
   After all, some of those new members might wonder, as does most
of the nation's electorate, what Clinton's affair with former White
House intern Monica S. Lewinsky has to do with a constitutional
danger to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Livingston forced to acknowledge his own adulterous
affairs, the Republicans' moral standing has grown even more shaky.
His GOP supporters claim that at least Livingston didn't lie under
oath _ as they say Clinton did. But that begs the question of
whether lying about sex under oath is truly an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress believes it is, then it might also consider whether
a congressman who takes the oath of office, but fails to uphold the
trust of his electorate by committing adultery, is equally
culpable.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, with all due respect to the moral integrity embodied in
Congress, Livingston, and even Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde, could also be accused of breaking a public trust _ a lying
under oath, of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the legality of such a charge might be open to
challenge, it does help to underscore the hypocrisy of the GOP
right-wing in its pursuit of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Once Clinton acknowledged his affair with Lewinsky, the entire
issue should have ended with a reprimand or censure from Congress.
However, such an appropriate punishment was never the intent of a
right-wing Republican-dominated Congress frustrated over its
inability to nail Clinton after failing to defeat him in the last
two elections. The GOP has had Clinton in its sights because he
trumped their issues, and seized control of much of the Republican
agenda, including overhauling welfare.
</P>
<P>
   After the GOP could not get him on Whitewater, Travelgate,
Filegate, or charges of illegal campaign fund-raising, it saw an
opening _ with independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's questionable
charges _ to zero in on the president. Both Clinton's critics and
supporters know that he, as President Andrew Johnson 130 years ago,
will be remembered for the impeachment effort against him _ even if
the Senate acquits.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to win the support of wavering Republicans and the
public, the GOP argued that a House vote for articles of
impeachment was little more than a procedural vote, and that the
Senate will likely not convict Clinton anyway. That strategy
persuaded some members to swing over to the pro-impeachment side.
But for Republicans to treat a such a serious charge so frivously
betrays their true motives; they are using, not following, the
Constitution to pursue their own political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate hearings could paralyze Congress, if not the nation,
for several months. If the Congress of 1998 did almost no
legislating, the Congress of 1999 might end up doing even less.
</P>
<P>
   There are, at the moment, not enough votes in the Senate to
convict Clinton by the required two-thirds majority. But by having
the hearings proceed anyway, Republicans give themselves another
opportunity to vilify the president. They reason that if they can
get him to resign, they will have accomplished a second goal:
making Clinton the second president in history to resign from
office.
</P>
<P>
   When Hyde suggests that Clinton resign to save the country from
this difficult Senate trial, he is not saying it as a humanitarian,
but as a partisan who wants to even a so-called political score.
</P>
<P>
   However, when President Nixon was forced by his own party to
resign, the charges against him were so legitimately serious that
his closest supporters were convinced that he would have been, and
perhaps should have been, convicted in the Senate of far more
serious charges than perjury.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans hope that a Senate trial will be a lengthy
setack for the Democratic Party's agenda, it may instead result in
a serious setback for the nation and its people. A trial could
degenerate into a political civil war between the parties that
would ultimately destroy an already eroding link between government
and its people.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republican right wing will be blamed for creating a
very costly post-impeachment disaster, it will be the people who
will have to pay the price. And, for millions of Americans who see
through the Republicans' agenda, that price is already too high.

TUTORIAL FOR TEENS ON CONSUMER RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the face of the barrage of ads and marketing pitches aimed at
teenagers, Peggy Meagher of the Massachusetts attorney general's
office is on a campaign to keep young people from getting taken in
today's slick consumer world.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, she spoke to an economics class at Matignon High
School in Cambridge and threw them a pop quiz. It's a good thing
this wasn't a high-stakes statewide test, since the average student
got six out of 10 questions correct. But then, Meagher said typical
adults don't score much better than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The quiz covered a range of subjects, from landlord-tenant
obligations and gift certificates to credit reports and debt
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Several students said the quiz revealed new and practical
information they plan to use in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have imagined that a landlord owed me interest
on my security deposit,'' said Lisa Caponigro, 17, referring to a
landlord-tenant question.
</P>
<P>
   Meagher, who heads the attorney general's consumer complaints
section, has visited a half-dozen high schools in the past year to
do some early-intervention consumer education. She said many young
adults approach her office with complaints about credit cards,
student loans, credit reports, health club memberships, and
vacation trips.
</P>
<P>
   Alerting young people to marketing scams and informing them of
their consumer rights, she said, helps them avoid problems.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for three consumer topics that parents and educators
should be sure to review with teenagers, Meagher said, ``Credit
cards, credit cards, credit cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, banks these days have become quite aggressive at
peddling plastic, particularly on college campuses. Many banks give
away mugs, T-shirts, and chocolates to students to get them to
apply.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Massachusetts Public Interest Research
Group found that students who get credit cards from on-campus
marketers are more likely to carry large balances and get more
cards than those who get them through other means, such as their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   In her talk, Meagher also emphasized that students should take
credit reports and student loans seriously. She stressed that the
obligation to repay a student loan cannot be escaped for any
reason, not even bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Meagher said teens often don't have enough life experience to
detect shady operators. She has heard tales of college students
scammed by the promise of a cheap Florida spring break trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to be shocked that there are disreputable travel
agents out there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Carr, head of Matignon's business department, said he
plans to ask consumer advocates to speak to classes every year to
strip away any naivete the youngsters might have. ``I don't want
them to get burned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gift certificate charges?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Al Calk picked up a $30 gift certificate recently at the Emerald
Square Mall in North Attleborough, Mass. and ended up paying $31.20
once a 4 percent service charge was added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never seen that before,'' Calk said. ``I thought it was
ridiculous. Basically, you're paying money to get money.''
</P>
<P>
   Curt Fickeisen, general manager of the mall, said that without
the fee, the mall would have to discontinue the gift certificate
program.
</P>
<P>
   Fickeisen said mall gift certificates are issued as a courtesy
to customers and mall stores. He said the mall incurs a number of
costs, including paying a bank to handle the finances, credit card
fees, personnel, marketing, and packaging for the certificates.
</P>
<P>
   He said the certificates are like money orders, which can be
used in any store or even deposited in a bank. He said customers
concerned about the fee are told that they can obtain a gift
certificate from a specific store in the mall with no service
charge.
</P>

<P>
   Southwest: No shuttle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines recently announced plans to launch service in
and out of MacArthur Airport in Islip, N.Y., which is on Long
Island about 40 miles from La Guardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   We think Southwest is one of the most consumer-friendly
airlines. The Dallas-based carrier transformed T. F. Green Airport
in Warwick, R.I., and Manchester Airport in Manchester, N.H., into
hubs for many Massachusetts residents. In the process, Southwest
drove down fares substantially at the two airports and in some
cases at Logan Airport in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Early news reports about Islip, particularly in The Wall Street
Journal, made it sound as if Southwest was about to use the Long
Island airport as a staging area to take on the shuttle carriers
that buzz between Boston, New York, and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not happening. Out of Islip, Southwest is flying
nonstop to Baltimore/Washington, Chicago, Nashville, and Tampa.
Warwick and Manchester are not in the mix.
</P>

 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
 !!  1/2 ``Prince of Egypt'' DreamWorks' splashy animated biblical
epic tells the story of Moses and the Exodus from Egypt more
fleetly than Cecil B. De Mille did in 1956 with Charlton Heston.
The drawing is spectacular, the acknowledgment that Moses' people
were Jews more overt. But in the end, this noble effort is more
imposing than stirring, and leaves one wondering why DreamWorks
didn't insist on creating a new animation style that moves farther
away from Disney's. (PG)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !!! &LR;  ``La Separation'' Christian Vincent impressively details
the disintegration of a Parisian couple's relationship into a
minefield. Daniel Auteuil and Isabelle Huppert supply beautifully
gauged and nuanced performances, acting mostly with their eyes as
they slide into ever more corrosive territory. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !!! &LR;  ``You've Got Mail'' Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, and
writer-director Nora Ephron know just how to mix the comedy and
sentiment. This warm, clever confection plays more like their
``Sleepless in Seattle'' than like the update it is of ``The Shop
Around the Corner'' to the age of e-mail. Ryan and Hanks woo on the
Internet, unaware that he's behind the voracious chain out to
devour her book shop. A bit prefab, but the faults are overridden
by the charm and appeal of the leads. (PG)
</P>
<P>
   (FR)  &UR; !!! &LR;  ``Ten Benny'' Eric Bross's assured debut film
convinces us that there are streets in suburban New Jersey as mean
as any in Manhattan's Little Italy in this story of three buddies
who grow up, then grow apart. Adrien Brody's jumpy, appealing
performance, as a kid with a gambler father and a self-detructive
streak, got him a lead role in ``The Thin Red Line.'' (R)

THANK YOU FOR BEING THE CLOD OF OUR FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
hol-i-day (hol'i-da') n. A designated day during which one is
obliged to spend time with relatives one normally avoids.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is one definition of ``holiday.'' And it happens to be the
one that's in the lexicon of Mark Rosen, author of ``Thank You For
Being Such a Pain: Spiritual Guidance for Dealing with Difficult
People.''
</P>
<P>
   The book could hardly be more opportune, this being the time of
year when families reconvene, stress levels rise, and someone can
usually be relied on to offend someone else: The obnoxious uncle
who brags about how much money he makes, right after you've told
him you just got laid off. The cousin who gets into an argument
with his father, then walks out in a huff. The aunt who loudly
informs her niece that she's wearing too much makeup.
</P>
<P>
   In the presence of such difficult people, the average person
would probably be tempted to cringe, or slip away, or swear, or
yell and make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you dealt with these situations in a more charitable
way, a spiritual way? What if you viewed that oafish person not as
an antagonist but, as Rosen suggests, a teacher who is part of a
larger cosmic scheme, challenging us and giving us ``a divine kick
in the spiritual butt?'' A person, in short, whose characteristics
``exactly correspond to the places within us that need learning and
healing.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the perspective that Rosen invites his readers to
consider in his recently published book, which grew out of the
workshops he teaches to businesses and adult education classes.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult people are lurking everywhere, all the time, notes
Rosen, an industrial relations specialist who teaches management
courses at Bentley College and at Brandeis University's Hornstein
Program in Jewish Communal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult people are the customers who demand a refund when they
can't produce a bill. They are the managed-care representatives who
won't listen to logic. They're the coworkers who gossip, the bosses
who yell, the guy in the next car who honks because you stopped to
let a pedestrian cross. ``There's no escaping them,'' Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   But he contends that our encounters with difficult people are
not just chance occurrences but rather events orchestrated by ``an
intelligence totally beyond our comprehension'' to enhance our
personal and spiritual growth. An experience with a deceitful
person, for example, teaches us the merits of being cautious. An
encounter with someone cruel reminds us to treat others with
kindness. A selfish person shows us the value of generosity.
</P>
<P>
   For Rosen, a Newton, Mass. resident who is an observant Jew,
that elusive ``intelligence'' is God, but he acknowledges that one
needn't believe in a higher power, or even possess a spiritual
mind-set, to benefit from his guide, published by Harmony Books.
``I'm not on a campaign to get anyone to believe,'' he said in an
interview. I'm looking to help people make practical changes in
their behavior, so they don't hurt anyone, or hurt themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Difficult people are in our lives for a reason,'' Rosen
writes, and that reason isn't always the one we ascribe to them
(such as ``They're out to get us,'' or ``They're insensitive
fools''). ``Sometimes,'' writes Rosen, difficult people ``help us
learn about ourselves, work on difficult issues, and confront
painful truths.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this doesn't make the other guy's boorish behavior
any more palatable, so in his book _ which draws on Eastern,
Christian, and Jewish doctrines _ Rosen recommends a multifaceted
strategy to keep from being driven buggy by annoying people. He
urges readers, for example, to remember that there are lots of
explanations for why someone might be difficult _ they are ill,
perhaps, or preoccupied with a personal problem. He recommends
giving the difficult person the benefit of the doubt, a notion, he
points out, that derives from the Torah. (``You shall judge your
fellow man with righteousness,'' Leviticus 19:15.)
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean resigning yourself to the behavior, but it
does keep you from acting rashly by drawing premature conclusions,
Rosen said. ``It means that in your personal life, you practice the
same principle that applies in a court of law: Difficult people are
innocent until proven guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Mastering your own anger in aggravating situations is another of
Rosen's suggestions _ an idea inspired by the Dalai Lama, who
maintains that anger cannot be overcome by anger. If tempers flare
on both sides, ``no one gets anywhere,'' said Rosen. Best to
practice a more constructive ``intrapersonal'' method of blowing
off steam, like going for a walk, or getting in the car, driving to
the far corner of a parking lot, and screaming at the top of one's
lungs.
</P>
<P>
   If all this talk about God and the Dalai Lama and the Torah
seems an unlikely vocabulary for an industrial relations
specialist, Rosen, 45, agrees. He describes himself as a
``professor by day, and seeker by night'' _ a spiritual seeker,
that is. Even as he worked toward his doctorate in industrial
relations from the University of Wisconsin, he was reading sacred
texts in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, I probably should have gone to divinity
school,'' Rosen said. Instead, he nudged his career toward the
``people side of the business world,'' teaching human resource
management as well as workshops on dealing with difficult people in
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   But he said his students started telling him that the workshops
applied to more than just the workplace. ``They said this can apply
to my brother-in-law too.'' So he stretched the workshop to include
interpersonal conflicts and was approached independently by both a
literary agent and a publisher to write a book on the subject.
``Thank you For Being Such a Pain'' is now being translated into
Chinese and Japanese and is recommended by five national book
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen came by his interest in difficult people naturally. For
one thing, he says, he is the son of one. His father, a ``lovable''
man to whom he now feels very close, was a Polish Holocaust
survivor who ``carried around an enormous amount of emotional pain
which he never expressed,'' and inadvertently redirected it to his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen himself admits to having done ``some bonehead things''
when he was younger, particularly to his two younger siblings. ``I
wasn't the best older brother,'' he admits in the book. ``I would
be less than honest if I didn't also admit to being difficult
myself. Certainly not to everyone, and hopefully not all that
often, but enough so that I've managed to annoy some and hurt a
few.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Mark Rosen's tips for dealing with difficult people on the
holidays:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ If someone offends you at a holiday gathering, deal with the
situation as soon as possible in a direct and respectful way, so it
doesn't fester. ``Take Aunt Sadie aside and say, `That was an
unkind thing you just said,''' Rosen suggests. You'll get it off
your chest and save yourself a lot of anguish. But, he warns, don't
count on being able to change Aunt Sadie's personality.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monitor your own alcohol consumption level, and that of
others. The potential for causing problems is multiplied by
alcohol, and ``people who are normally mildly annoying can be
outrageously stupid when intoxicated.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Try gentle humor, especially when the conflict is over
something trivial, but avoid sarcasm, name-calling, and other
negative forms of humor.
</P>
<P>
   _ If all else fails, grin and bear it. You only see that uncle
once a year, ``and anyone can make nice for one evening.'' See the
situation as an exercise in self-restraint.
</P>

CHRISTMAS BRIGHTENS UP WEB, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Ho, ho, ho! Merry computing, everyone!
</P>
<P>
   Santa Claus just sent me an e-mail, and it says I should write
about stuff to help get people into the holiday spirit! If I don't,
Mr. Claus says he's going to replace my operating system with coal.
</P>
<P>
   So I best get cracking!
</P>
<P>
   - Want to treat the kids to something a bit different this
Christmas? Check out www.eaze.net/citius//santa.htm. It offers a
program for PCs called Tracking Santa. The shareware ($6.99 to
register) offers a world map that ``tracks'' Santa on Christmas
Eve, holiday songs, a version of the Christmas Story and features
you can customize for your family. It runs on Windows 3.1, 95, 98
or NT. My advice: If this interests you, download it now and test
it. You don't want to disappoint the kids on Christmas Eve!
</P>
<P>
   - There's still a few days left before Christmas. And, if you're
like most people, you'll have to work right up until Christmas Eve.
Not to worry. My advice: Goof off at work! The easiest way is to
download and play with ``Twinkle Bulbs.'' It's the shareware you
probably saw a co-worker using last year. It allows users to
decorate their desktops with Christmas lights. Find them at
softseek.mdonline.net/DesktopEnhancements/FunStuff/Review42 &QL; 
16index.html.
</P>
<P>
   - Want a laugh? You'll think this version of '`'Twas the Night
Before Christmas'' is funny if you know anything about computer
programmers. Find it at www.citilink.com/
jgarrick/vbasic/humor/nightbeforechristmas.html.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Away in a manger, ya da da da dum, dee dum . . .'' I can
never remember the words to all those holiday songs. Can you? If
not, check out www.primenet.com/kringle/. You'll find the words and
some decent .wav files that will have you singing in no time!
</P>
<P>
   - Well, the geese and maids-a-milking still cost the same as
last year. But just about everything else in the traditional song,
``The Twelve Days of Christmas,'' cost more in 1998. Check out an
official accounting at www.pncbank.com/12days/.
</P>
<P>
   - Oh yes. I know you want to hear them. Yes, yes. You deny it.
Go ahead. But you'll sneak back to your desk to listen to them
again later, won't you? I'm talking, of course, about ``Jingle
Cats'' and ``Jingle Dogs'' and, yes, this year's special, ``Jingle
Pigs.'' And they're not just singing, they're in QuickTime movies!
Find them at www.forthnet.gr/astronet/business/jingles/index.htm.
</P>
<P>
   - Looking for images of Santa or Rudolph? Check out a new image
search site called Arriba Vista at www.arribavista.com. It works
pretty well, offering up a quick list of images available on the
Internet. The folks behind the site were billing it as
``pornography free.' But I managed to pull up some off-color images
with a single search. (No, I won't tell you how!) The Arriba Vista
folks said they'll stop claiming the site is porn-free, but
maintain that they've taken many steps, including blocking specific
Web sites and search terms, to keep pornographic images from
showing up during searches. They deserve some credit for their
effort. So, give it a try, but be forewarned that Arriba Vista
isn't perfect. (I'm not sure any site is!)
</P>
<P>
   - If you have the urge to cook this holiday season, and you'd
like to try something besides that pork stuffing dish your mother
always made, check out Christmas Recipe.com at
www.christmasrecipe.com. The site offers a wide variety of recipes
and cooking tips. There's also a glossary so you can look up
confusing ingredients. Additionally, the site allows users to
search its recipe database for just the right dish. You can search
using any keyword or ingredient. Yum!
</P>
<P>
   - The final days before Christmas can be hectic. Gifts to buy.
Rooms to clean. Relatives arriving. And, of course, the kids are
out of school! Want to keep them busy? Check out the Crafts for
Christmas page at www.imagitek.com/xmas/crafts. The site offers
basic instructions for many holiday crafts, including snowflakes
you can hang on the tree, paper angels, tin can toys and lots more.
</P>
<P>
   - When Uncle Harry starts boring everybody with his know-it-all
attitude, ask him if he knows how cold it is at the North Pole.
Then, stand up and say, ```You know, Harry, we can find out real
quick if you're right!'' Then, check out The Weather Channel's
North Pole page at www.weather.com/northpole/. If Harry is wrong,
maybe he'll stay quiet for a couple days. Then again, he might be
right!
</P>
<P>
   - Want to send Santa some e-mail? It's getting late, but you can
still give it a shot. One site to check is Santa's Official Web
Site at northpole4kids.netnation.com/1998/america/west/server.htm.
You can send e-mail not only to Santa, but to Rudolph, the elves
and others. While you're there, you can check out the Christmas
tunes, stories, contests and lots more! While you're at it, try
www.santaclausonline.com/, which offers many of the same features.
</P>
<P>
   - Every year, the U.S. Postal Service receives thousands of
letters from kids across America to Santa Claus. The USPS has
created a special Web site that honors this tradition, and allows
visitors to read some of the very best letters to Santa. Find it at
www.usps.gov/letters/volume2/santa-main.html. (You best keep a dry
hanky handy.)
</P>
<P>
   - Uh-oh. You just opened the mailbox and found a Christmas card
from somebody who wasn't on your list! Don't panic! If they have an
e-mail address, you can send them an electronic holiday greeting
card free. There are many Web sites that offer this service. One
you can try is www.123greetings.com/christmas/. Have fun!
</P>
<P>
   - Ever heard of the term ```Webring?'' It's a way Web sites of
similar topics can group themselves together. It's kind of like an
advertising co-op. Similar sites link to each other. Tap into the
right Webring, and you might find hundreds of sites offering what
you need. You can tap into Santa's Christmas Webring at &QL; 
members.aol.com/Lisa1929/santa.html. Links toward the bottom of the
page allow visitors to visit random sites in the Webring or view an
entire list of all the sites that belong. Sure, it's not that much
different from using a Web directory, such as Yahoo! But give it a
shot!
</P>
<P>
   - OK, so the guy across the street put up enough Christmas
lights to attract attention from astronauts in the space shuttle.
Well, be glad you don't live across the street from Nat George. He
spends weeks each year putting up his Centralia, Wash., display.
And if that ain't enough, he has a Web site to show it all to those
who can't drive by! Check it out at
www2.localaccess.com/NGeorge/lights/.
</P>
<P>
   - Hey, guess what. They celebrate Christmas all over the world!
Yep. I figured you'd like to know that. Anyways, there's a great
Web site at christmas.com/worldview/ that will show you h ow the
celebrations are conducted. The site features a clickable world map
and information ranging from music to recipes.
</P>
<P>
   - OK, here's one last site: If the kids keep asking, ``Mom, how
much longer is it until Santa comes?'' Don't scream. Sit them down
in front of the computer and call up Nick's Countdown 'Til
Christmas!! page. It's at
home.weborbiter.com/users/user2/countdwn.htm. The page displays the
exact number of days, hours, minutes and seconds left until the Big
Day.
</P>
<P>
   That's about it. Hope it makes you happy, and keeps Santa off my
case! &QL;

   BOSTON _ It's the biggest joke between roommates Lynn Quealy and
Nicole Dever. When Quealy wants to know the latest hot makeup
trends, she doesn't flip through Cosmopolitan or Elle. Her best
source is, of all things, a man _ Edward Fee, a Chanel makeup
artist at Filene's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really excited to get a makeover by a man. I've always
had it done by a woman in the past,'' says Quealy, 23, who visits
Fee regularly. ``It's exciting to get a man's perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, thought Dever, 23. Lipstick and mascara tips from a guy?
``I don't even go to a male hairdresser,'' she says. Then Dever had
a makeover too. ``He has ways of putting on eyeshadow that I would
never have thought of,'' she says now. ``And if he thinks it looks
good, then other men might too.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about role reversal. Today, more than ever before, there
are male makeup artists everywhere giving hands-on advice to women
about their looks. It's an interesting development for an industry
created, in many ways, by female entrepreneurs like Helena
Rubinstein, Estee Lauder, Mary Kay Ash, and Florence Nightengale
Graham (founder of Elizabeth Arden).
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that long ago that selling makeup was one of the few
good jobs available to women. ``The industry was in many ways built
by women because they were discriminated against in most other
industries,'' says Kathy Peiss, a University of Massachusetts at
Amherst history professor and author of the book ``Hope in a Jar:
The Making of America's Beauty Culture.''
</P>
<P>
   So why are men getting into the act? ``It's big business,'' says
Dave Dodge, manager of the cosmetics department at Neiman Marcus in
Boston, which employs seven male makeup artists (out of 60). ``More
and more, we live in an environment focused on youthful looks. We
(makeup artists) play a huge role.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there have always been men in the industry. David
Hall McConnell founded Avon Cosmetics in 1886. Max Factor founded
his firm in 1909. And Charles Revson created Revlon in 1932. But
clearly, these were businessmen who worked mostly behind the
scenes, not on sales floors with actual women customers. Indeed,
says Peiss, ``Women really made cosmetics acceptable and popular
among women. They had some understanding of how to turn products
that were seen as disreputable into something that women should use
on their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, it's much more common for stores to employ male
artists locally or host the visits of national makeup artists, who
travel around the country meeting with customers. Says Dodge, ``We
can book a man (for shopper makeovers). He's usually good-looking,
tall, and aggressive . . . and in society, there is a line of
flirtation.''
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. Just ask Sarah Cardozo Duncan. After chatting for 20
minutes recently with Keith Cavaleri, a Bobbi Brown makeup artist
at Neiman Marcus, she decided to return later for a whole new look.
Why? Not only does Cavaleri know his colors, says Duncan, but ``he
has fabulous eyebrows.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might argue that men have an advantage over women behind
the counter because frequently the women artists are just too
heavily made-up for the real world. Says Dever, ``Sometimes I see a
lady at the counter and I say, `Eew, she's going to make me look
like her.' I'd much rather go to a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Julio Sandino, a New York-based artist who was in Boston
recently making over women at Saks Fifth Avenue, says ``Women like
having their makeup done by a man because men see them in a
different way.'' Sandino works for Francois Nars, another male
makeup artist who launched his own cosmetics line in 1994 and who's
known for doing the makeup for Madonna's album covers and videos.
Says Sandino, ``(Women) want a man's opinion of what they'd like to
see in a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, being in the business, a lot of men wear makeup too.
Cavaleri wears concealer and bronzing powder (which gives a
suntanned look), he says, because that helps to sell it. Also, he
says, ``It gives me a finished look. It makes me feel better about
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Men say they're choosing the field because they love fashion and
they enjoy helping people. ``We're a self-esteem counter,'' says
Johnnie Evers, who sells cosmetics for 29 lines at Neiman Marcus.
``We make people feel good about themselves. We're not judgmental .
. . . At the end of the day, I can go home and feel good because I
made someone else feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Evers started 12 years ago, selling Estee Lauder at Jordan
Marsh, after earning a college degree in marketing and interior
design. As a child, he says, he learned about makeup application
and skin care from his aunt, who owned a cosmetics studio.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Fee started in makeup to supplement his income as a
struggling actor. After several years of work, he says, ``I thought
this wasn't too bad a career.'' Working for Revlon's Borghese
division as a national makeup artist, Fee flew all over the country
meeting with customers. ``It's the only time I've been in Phoenix,
Seattle, and San Francisco. It was a wonderful experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Fee has settled in Hingham with his wife and daughter. He
travels from upstate New York to Connecticut to Massachusetts doing
faces for Chanel. ``My reason for being here is my obsession with
fashion. I love to see people put together well, with matching
shoes and pocketbooks, hair and nails, gloves, whatever . . . I
think of it as art.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about societal reaction to his career choice? ``There's
an eyebrow that goes up,'' Fee says. ``I'm not ashamed. I love what
I do. I know a lot of men who go to 9-to-5 jobs and sit behind
desks and are miserable . . . I think sometimes the assumption is
that if a man knows how to do this he must be gay . . . Male,
female, gay, straight, (your success) always comes down to your
taste and how you connect with people.''
</P>
<P>
   And Fee says he connects very well. He says, ``I hear
everything. I hear about affairs. Oh my God, it's like being a
psychiatrist in a way. You're really in their space. Everyone has
something that you can enhance. Maybe that endears you a little
bit. It's a very personal thing when you're talking about a
person's colors.''

 UNDATED: ... for me.''

<P>
   It wasn't a peace that came easily. Penn and Wright met in 1987,
got together in 1990, had two children, broke up. In 1993, Penn's
house in Malibu (where he grew up) was destroyed by a fire. In
1994, while he was living in a trailer, listening to rock 'n' roll
and playing with guns, he asked her to marry him. In 1996, she said
yes, if he'd lose the trailer. He did, they did, and to this day he
says his toughness is overplayed, hers underplayed, citing the time
last year when she simply refused to allow a carjacker to drive off
with their two children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he performed the role of Eddie in a stage production of
``Hurlyburly'' in Westwood, got to know playwright David Rabe. ``I
realized it was the text that got me,'' he says. ``After I got to
know David Rabe and listened to him talk about the way he was
displeased with the New York production, it made the play sound
more interesting and rich, not as cerebral. Then, once having done
the play and worked so hard on it, it was hard to let it go to
somebody else as a movie. You know, good writers tend to be
provocative writers. I think there's not very good optimistic
writing out there. Most of the so-called optimists are really
cynics in hiding. They write love stories, but only about the first
five days of a relationship. Nobody can believe that people can
have an enduring love, so they don't write about that. I think
they're alienated, so they write about the alienated. I don't think
it works the other way. I don't think it's a pursuit of the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, good writing protects you from having to do anything
more than is real and honest in the piece you do. The guy I play
wants to be loved. He wants to feel like he's human by virtue of
having somebody love him. I felt like David Rabe more or less
created like a slide and the actor had to be willing to go down it.
So I'm probably forcing myself to analyze things that I didn't
necessarily ever analyze in the process of picking the text up
again and leaving myself open and remembering what I was going
after in the play and letting that process continue. The best thing
to do is to not analyze it too much and go by your gut.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn makes no secret of the fact that he felt burned by the
scant impact of the two films he directed. ``As a director, you're
so happy you made the film that I was completely unaware for two
years of anything to do with what the response was. It seemed to
come out and go away pretty quickly. I thought that `The Crossing
Guard' was treated just terribly and it was the best performance
that Jack Nicholson had given in several years. It's hard to be
objective about it. I feel that if a film is just a little
different, and not just my films, we ought to embrace those things.
It's a matter of valuing some attempt that isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it strange talking about myself. I always feel much
more revealed by other people. You know, when I sit and watch
somebody really articulate those things I'm stumbling toward.
That's when you're most understood _ when you understand them in
somebody else. Suddenly somebody will say something, have certain
ideas. Somebody says something, and you say, `That's right! That's
who I am!' Or, `That's who I want to be!' If anything, I think it's
about avoiding things that suck your blood. There's a level of
bloodletting that is probably not wrong, but when people don't
embrace the effort you make, that kind of takes the steam out of
you. I've found that I would prefer to direct if I was gonna let
blood. I'd rather do it in a way that seems worth the effort. I'd
be less whiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn's dissatisfaction with acting has been well documented,
starting when he announced in 1991 that he was giving it up
altogether. Soon afterward, he returned to it. Far from being
ridiculed, his heartfelt attitude has made him the new De Niro
among the generation following his. So highly is Penn respected for
his seriousness of purpose and his sense of vocation that Mike
Medavoy, who produced ``The Thin Red Line,'' told Premiere
magazine: ``Sean Penn was really a very important part of getting
the actors interested in the movie. He had apparently run into
Terry (director Malick) and said, in effect, `Anytime you're ready
to make a movie, just call me and I'll do it for a dollar.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The result was that Penn spent last summer in Australia, which
doubled for Guadalcanal. But then Penn says that for him many
acting assignments are Guadalcanal. ``I'm very clear what a
terrific and lucky profession this is, especially to be able to do
it on a certain level and be paid and all that stuff. I didn't lose
interest in it. I lost enjoyment of it. The process is very taxing
to me. It's like stopping the arc of your life to hold it in a
certain position. It's almost like when a parent holds a kid's
development back. You're doing that to yourself as a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I heard recently that the biggest fear that many
actors have is being found out to be a fraud. The characters in
`Hurlyburly' are in a similar dynamic, afraid of being found out _
or of not being alive in the first place. Do I have this fraud
feeling? No. As an actor, I've always banked on the fact that most
of my peers were so bad. Not so much that I was particularly good.
No, I've never felt like a fraud. I always felt I had something to
contribute. I never was very hyperbolic about myself, but I always
was real clear about the playing field I was on.''

IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE ... IN THE ERA OF DOWNSIZING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ George Bailey keeps staring at the pink slip,
then begins thinking about Mary and their four children. Bailey
Brothers Building &AMP; Loan had survived the run on the banks and that
foul-up with Potter, but not the hostile takeover by Oui, Cheatham
and Howe. He shakes his head and mutters to himself, ``I wish I'd
never been hired.''
</P>
<P>
   When he looks up, he sees his guardian angel, Clarence. ``Long
time, no see,'' George says. ``Don't worry. I'm not going to kill
myself this time. I'm just depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we don't handle suicides anymore,'' Clarence tells him.
``Now we're involved exclusively with layoffs. Our shareholders
wanted us to be in a growth industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel so stupid,'' George says. ``I should have taken
that job with Ebenezer Scrooge. He never laid anybody off just
before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Feeling stupid is the worst thing you can do. You're a fine
man and a great worker _ Lord knows you're dedicated. Besides,
remember what Uncle Billy told you when Potter tried to close you
down: `I can get another job. I'm only 55.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but Uncle Billy never heard of the Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about all you've got going for you, George. You're great
with numbers, you know how to help people. You even ran paper
drives during the war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But _''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, you're deaf in one ear. You could go into
telemarketing.''
</P>
<P>
   George remains unconvinced. So Clarence shows him how different
life in Bedford Falls would have been if George Bailey didn't work
there.
</P>
<P>
   Without having his brother around to help, Harry Bailey couldn't
afford to go to college, and he missed out on his chance of being a
war hero. Potter took over the Building &AMP; Loan, and Harry was stuck
in the town's other dying industry: He wrote for the local
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   George sees how Bedford Falls has turned into Pottersville,
filled with struggling renters instead of struggling homeowners.
``Each man's life touches so many other lives,'' Clarence says.
``You see, George, you really had a wonderful job.''
</P>
<P>
   The pharmacist, Mr. Gower, wound up going to prison, of course,
because he accidentally sent that poison to the child with
diphtheria. ``George Bailey wasn't around to help him,'' Clarence
says. ``He ended up having to hire that Kevorkian kid.''
</P>
<P>
   George puts his head in his hands for what seems like an hour,
then looks up at Clarence. ``You win,'' George says. ``Say, you
don't happen to have a winning lottery ticket in your pocket, do
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, all right. I want to work again. I want to work
again. Satisfied?''
</P>
<P>
   Clarence fades away like a hologram. Guardian angels have better
special effects than they did in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   George walks home through the snow, not having a clue about what
he'll tell Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary did it, George,'' Uncle Billy tells him as he walks in
the door. ``She told everybody what happened, and they all want to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary greets her husband with a kiss. As they huddle with their
children near the Christmas tree, people from Bedford Falls start
dropping by, some bringing money and food to help the Baileys get
by. Mr. Gower offers to let George take over the pharmacy, and Sam
sends a fax from London promising George a job in his high-tech
restaurant: Fish 'n' Microchips.
</P>
<P>
   But war hero Harry has the best offer of all. Using his
connections, he lined up a chance for George to finally take his
family around the world, inspecting purchases at all the military
bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be the best job you ever had, George. You know the
federal government's not going to go out of business anytime
soon,'' Harry tells him, ``unless those rumors about cloning Ken
Starr are true.''
</P>
<P>
   As the group begins singing Christmas carols, George notices a
copy of ``What Color Is Your Parachute?'' among the presents. The
book includes a note from Clarence: ``Remember no man is a failure
who has friends.''
</P>
<P>
   As George sets the book aside, one of the bells on the Christmas
tree begins to jingle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Daddy,'' his daughter tells him. ``Teacher says every
time a bell rings, somebody gets laid off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right. That's right,'' George says, then looks to the
heavens and smiles. ``Attaboy, Clarence.''

LANGE, SHUE TERRIFIC IN `COUSIN BETTE'

<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Cousin Bette'' _ Jessica Lange and Elisabeth
Shue team up to humiliate men. Actually, an aging Lange engages
Shue to destroy the men who jilted her. The only problem is that no
man in his right mind would reject the gorgeous Lange. The two
actresses, script, and direction are terrific.

<P>
   ``The Secret of Nimh 2'' _ The success of animated films on
video has led to many sequels, none more deserving than ``The
Secret of Nimh.'' While the technical qualities might not measure
up to Disney, the story involving animal lab research is
provocative and dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rat Pack'' _ Whenever casting agents are looking for
actors to portray famous people, the first thing they go for is the
look. It's nearly always a mistake. In this case, Ray Liotta looks
nothing like Sinatra but he does try to capture the inner man.
Aided by Don Cheadle's Sammy Davis, Jr. and Bobby Slayton's Joey
Bishop, this film portrays the Vegas playboys better than ``Oceans
11,'' which starred the actual characters.

GWYNETH PALTROW IS FREE TO PLAY SHAKESPEARE'S MUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like the fiercely independent young woman she
portrays in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Gwyneth Paltrow has always
chafed against the peculiar prison of public perception.
</P>
<P>
   Barely out of high school, she quickly found work as an actress,
but her ability was overshadowed by her bloodlines. The daughter of
acclaimed actress Blythe Danner and producer-director Bruce
Paltrow, she was considered another example of how having the right
name can open all the right doors. By the time she began to win
more substantial roles in ``Seven'' and ``The Pallbearer,'' she was
mainly known as the girlfriend of actor Brad Pitt. Suddenly, the
world was far more interested in her romances than in her roles,
and every mention of her name was rife with speculation on her life
with the Sexiest Man Alive.
</P>
<P>
   When her relationship with Pitt went up in flames, more people
were concerned with what went wrong than the fact that Paltrow was
developing into a smart, young actress in such films as ``Emma''
and ``Sliding Doors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard when you take your work very seriously, and you want
the focus to be on your work,'' said Paltrow recently. ``I think
it's taken me a lot longer than it would have taken anybody else to
achieve respect, because first there was my mother, and people
thought I was getting roles because of my parents. Then they said,
`Oh, she gets parts because of her boyfriend.' You start to think,
`Well, there must be a reason this is happening this way, and I'll
just ride through it, and keep doing my work.' At the end of the
day, hopefully that will speak for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be about to happen with ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which
opens Christmas Day, and also stars Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush,
Judi Dench, Colin Firth, and Tom Wilkinson. In this fanciful story
written by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, and set in the 1590s,
Paltrow plays Lady Viola, who is reluctantly set to marry the
stuffy Earl of Lord Wessex (Firth). She wants to be an actor, but
given the mores of the day, women are barred from the stage. She
disguises herself as a man and auditions for the still-developing
work by a young playwright, Will Shakespeare (Fiennes).
</P>
<P>
   Poor Will is having a vexing time with his new play, one he
calls ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.'' But everything
begins to change when Will meets Viola, and the two fall in love.
She becomes his muse, inspiring Shakespeare to write his great love
story, ``Romeo and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't the traditional objectified muse; she brought out
the best in him, and was his partner. Who she was and what she
represented to him brought out a whole creativity,'' said Paltrow,
during a day's worth of interviews in a midtown hotel, not far from
her New York apartment (and before she was nominated for a Golden
Globe for her performance). ``It was a really interesting character
for me because she was so strong, and so proactive in dressing as a
boy to audition, and all of that. Even though the story is about
him, she's an important element in the story. It's not your basic
love-interest part.''
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow, 25, has certainly played her share of love-interest
parts, and judging by her looks alone, it's fairly easy to
understand why. Paltrow is pretty, even more so in person than on
the magazine covers she so often adorns. Her looks are so
Hollywood-friendly they border on cliche; even in jeans, with her
straw-blond hair in a ponytail, she manages to be both unassuming
and elegant.
</P>
<P>
   But Paltrow also possesses a crackling vitality and
determination, qualities which convinced ``Shakespeare in Love''
director John Madden that Paltrow was his Viola. He auditioned
about 40 to 50 actresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met her for another movie about five or six years ago, and
she was just a complete knockout,'' he said. ``When this project
came around, she was just the natural choice for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The only person who needed convincing, it seems, was Paltrow.
When the script first arrived in her agent's office, Paltrow wanted
nothing to do with it _ or, at that time, any other film. She had
been working steadily, was ``really burned out,'' and didn't want
to commit immediately to another film. After a few months, a
producer at Miramax, the studio behind the film, persuaded her to
read the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, `You're crazy. You gotta do this,' '' Paltrow
recalled. ``So I read it, and I thought it was incredibly
well-written, and I'd never read anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the part was unlike anything Paltrow had read, she was
certainly familiar with the character's British accent. Two of her
recent roles _ ``Emma'' and ``Sliding Doors'' _ also required the
Los Angeles-born actress to affect the Queen's English. To master
Shakespeare's rhythmic iambic pentameter, she and her fellow actors
were coached by a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. And
while Paltrow lacks formal Shakespearean training, it seemed to
come easily since she was raised with the words of the Bard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it comes from my mother who was always rehearsing
Shakespeare or a classical piece, and just being exposed to it
opens up a part of your brain that wouldn't necessarily be opened
up if you weren't constantly exposed to it,'' she said. ``She was
always taking me to Shakespeare in the Park or an experimental
theater production of `Hamlet' in some East Village church.''
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow's ear for Shakespeare, as well as her flawless British
accent, impressed costar Fiennes, who was born in England and spent
several seasons with the RSC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her ability to hit the accent is extraordinary,'' Fiennes
said. ``I haven't done much film, so it was remarkable to watch
someone just nail it, someone who understands the discipline of
Shakespeare, and has the poise and brilliance to get it right, and
doesn't need 15 takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, films like ``Shakespeare in Love,'' don't always have
the luxury of budget-busting, repeated takes. It is an independent
film, unlike Paltrow's other entry this year, ``A Perfect Murder.''
That was the big-budget summer thriller that aped Alfred Hitchcock,
and costarred Michael Douglas. Throughout her career, Paltrow has
moved between mainstream movies like ``Seven,'' with Pitt and
Morgan Freeman, and independent fare such as ``Sliding Doors'' and
``Emma.'' Working on big-budget movies is more like a job, albeit a
``great job,'' Paltrow said, whereas smaller films allow her to
flex her artistic muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing a movie like `A Perfect Murder' was strange because it's
not really the kind of movie I do, but I wanted to experience the
slick, big-budget Hollywood machine kind of movie,'' she said. ``I
felt like a blue-collar worker _ I got up in the morning, had my
coffee, went to work, did my job, and came home. It's fun, but it's
not difficult, and it's not really engaging work.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you do a movie like `Shakespeare in Love,' you feel
like an artist,'' Paltrow said. ``It doesn't go as smoothly, it's
all quirky and backwards, but it's artful. You feel like you're
learning and discovering things, and you feel like you know why you
do this job.''
</P>
<P>
   For as long as Paltrow can remember, she wanted to be an
actress. What she never wanted to be, or expected to be, was a
gossip magnet. Yet for most of her career, which began in 1991 with
a small role in ``Shout,'' with John Travolta, the tabloids have
had their way with her. When she was with Pitt, their pretty blond
heads seemed permanently affixed to every gossip rag and TV show
dedicated to celebrity dish. Paltrow, who was then barely 21,
talked about her relationship with Pitt, only to soon realize such
honesty was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my last relationship, I was young, and didn't realize that
every time I divulged something, as innocuous as it was to me, I
was opening more doors for people,'' she said. ``Then I was like,
`Why are people so interested in this?' The little things give
people a personal hold or some kind of personal association where
they think they know you.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was going through it, I didn't think about it. I just
tried to live my life. But it was hard. At the time, I think it was
my own hubris or ego that made me think, `Oh, it doesn't matter,'
and I didn't realize the world perceived me as something other than
a working actress. Obviously, I see that now much more clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow is much more guarded about her current relationship with
Ben Affleck, who has a small role in ``Shakespeare in Love.''
During interviews she never mentioned his name, and bristled at a
reporter who implied she might have used her clout to get him in
the film.
</P>
<P>
   This is a different Paltrow, one rubbed raw by years of
intrusions into her personal life. She is no longer the smiling
ingenue who once talked in depth on ``Oprah'' about her life with
Pitt. Paltrow now believes she owes the public a good performance,
and nothing more. She will no more discuss her private life than
read the rumors that have her waltzing down the aisle with a
different man every other week. One tabloid even had her having an
affair with Matt Damon _ Affleck's best friend, and her costar in
the upcoming thriller ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Paltrow, the actress-turned-tabloid-fodder who has
reclaimed herself as an actress, feels that whatever the gossip
mill churns out is ``none of my business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't engage in it, I don't read it, I don't listen to it,''
she said. ``Whatever anybody says about me when they don't know me,
it's not my business what they say. It's my business what my family
says, my friends say. The people that I love and who love me,
that's what I care about.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while it was difficult because you enter into this world
where all of a sudden people are writing all these things and
speculating, and you're sort of feeling, `Who am I, and how did all
of this happen?' Paltrow added. ``It's difficult and wearing, but
you have to do your best and not take it personally. You have to
say, `It's not about me, these people don't know me, they don't
have my best interest at heart.' I'm not going to empower them by
allowing them to hurt my feelings.''

SEAN PENN AT PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For Sean Penn, every role is a blast furnace. He never skated
through a film in his life. For that matter, he never skated
through life. At 38, married to Robin Wright and a doting father of
two children, Penn has mellowed. A bit. But for Penn, the easy way,
the artistic or personal shortcut, does not exist, because, simply,
the guy cares. Holed up for a few hours in a Boston hotel room, to
which he rushed after a day of shooting Woody Allen's new film, a
flu-ridden Penn says, between sips of tea, that his succession of
angst-filled roles has never been a conscious career choice.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Penn never could be is indifferent. This intensity
has kept him at the forefront of post-Brando, post-De Niro actors.
But he also says his choices say more about him than any words put
between quotation marks. He wouldn't want to accuse himself of
purity, he said a few years ago on the eve of the opening of his
second directorial effort, ``The Crossing Guard.'' But consider
that film and his directorial debut, ``The Indian Runner.'' Both
are rough, honest, grueling films (Penn wrote both) about men
grappling with what they must do to live with honor.
</P>
<P>
   In film after film, Penn has plumbed the pain of bad guys. Think
of his convicted rapist on death row in ``Dead Man Walking,'' his
army sergeant turned loose cannon in Vietnam in ``Casualties of
War,'' his coked-up lawyer in ``Carlito's Way,'' his criminal son
of a criminal father in ``At Close Range,'' his Irish-American
tough guy in ``State of Grace,'' his drug dealer turned traitor in
``The Falcon and the Snowman.'' Now add to that gallery his World
War II grunt under fire in Guadalcanal in Terrence Malick's
imminent ``The Thin Red Line.'' Not to mention _ in ``Hurlyburly,''
opening Friday _ his confused Hollywood casting agent, Eddie,
roller-coastering his way through a storm of sexual and other
confusion alongside buddies played by Kevin Spacey and Chazz
Palminteri.
</P>
<P>
   It's his kind of film, Penn says, because it takes pains to
shine a light on unruly stuff that usually is ignored by what
passes for adult entertainment. ``I like the idea that a movie is
going to last longer than when you walk out of the theater and will
impact an audience,'' Penn says. ``I'm much more interested in a
tiny bit of enduring emotional truth than a lot of
wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am stuff.'' After Eddie and his friends put
themselves and the women around them through several kinds of hell,
Penn says, there's only the tiniest window of hope remaining at the
end. But, Penn being Penn, he won't offer the easy consolation of
glib optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if his eyes open clear enough to see what's in
front of him. I don't know if he's that close to a relationship
with a woman because I don't think he's that close to a
relationship with himself. There's very little self-respect in the
lives that he and these people lead. Without that, I don't know if
the word `relationship' is even appropriate. There's a great, great
violence to any circumstance when someone allows himself to be
convinced that he can't change. To one who has lost his self-belief
and awareness, who has lost his belief in his ability to grow and
change, the cumulative effect of thinking and feeling like you're
stuck somewhere is feeling like you're dead. That's where the
creepiness starts to happen to these characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn has changed. He prizes his family, prizes time. All he
wants to do now, he says, is write and direct the films he wants to
make. After he wraps the Woody Allen project, he may concentrate on
another prison movie. At 38, it would be pathetic if he were the
same person he was at 28, he says. This is his veiled way of saying
that he has outgrown the bad-boy coverage that fell on him like
acid rain in the wake of a few punches thrown while drunk, a
drunk-driving charge, and a few dust-ups with paparazzi during his
tempestuous first marriage, to Madonna. ``People misperceive me to
a degree that I'll never be able to fix, never be able to
control,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, some of the things I was despised for I take complete
credit for. There were times I did things in an effort to be
helpful to someone else and got caught in the middle of that
situation and took heat. There were other times when, though
arrogance, you take pride in getting away with things like abusing
alcohol. At a certain point you realize it's not giving you much
back, then it gets tiring. Then suddenly it comes back one more
night and it makes you feel alive one more time. It's really about
where your energy is coming from. If the energy comes from anger or
from mental health, it's all going to feed the same beast. I had
allowed myself to sometimes be fierce in my arrogance, probably
still do sometimes. But a lot of the things I got in trouble for,
all it took was one pretty princess getting killed in a tunnel and
everybody's feeling about it was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``But am I worried that civility in my life is going to diminish
things? I'm not worried about that. My wife is in this film
(playing a role of a woman who is even more of a loose cannon than
the men). It was nice to have her there, to do the scenes together
and, you know, to go home. I have a sense of home now. My son likes
everything outdoors. He's an outdoors guy. My daughter is more of
an indoors person. So what do you do? I dunno. I read to her. I
take them both to the beach, the museum, camping out. They like to
just play a lot. Most of the time, I sit around and I cuddle them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being married, having kids, I think you have a lot more
accountability. It affects the way you look at life, your
resonsibilities, even the way you look at material. I've tried to
pick up the pieces of a movement toward total antisocial
surrendering of belief in the human race to believing in it,
despite itself. Then there are all these practical things, like
where are you at what time of year and how often do you get on an
airplane? My wife and I have to be very cooperative with each other
about when one's going to work. I mean, so much of being a parent
is just about being there. I think from the outside, it's always
going to appear a bit of a mess, but it's feeling more and more
peaceful a mess for me.''

TONI TENNILLE PLAYS VICTOR AS VICTORIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the chic black pants and jacket she wears for an
interview at the Ritz, the long-legged 5-foot-11 Toni Tennille is
dazzling, definitely more ``Victoria'' than ``Victor.'' And, that,
it turns out, is just the way she plays their roles.
</P>
<P>
   Tennille is best known for a 1975 pop hit written by Neil Sadaka
and recorded by her and husband Daryl Dragon. He's the son of a
coloratura concert soprano and Carmen Dragon, an Academy
Award-winning composer/conductor. The Captain &AMP; Tennille was how
the act was billed, and the song was ``Love Will Keep Us
Together.'' It and other hits propelled them from being the house
band at the Smoke House in Encino, Calif., to nine slots in
Billboard's Top 40 between and 1975 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Now 55 (``I don't say it, but I find it keeps popping up in
articles so I might as well''), Tennille is touring in the role
that Julie Andrews originated in ``Victor/Victoria,'' the movie and
subsequent stage musical set in a bohemian Left Bank nightclub in
Paris in the 1930s. The latest production of the play will be at
the Colonial Theatre Dec. 29 through Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Julie Andrews, Tennille succeeds Liza Minnelli and
Raquel Welch in the role of Victoria, a glamorous but unemployed
and indigent actress who finds herself constrained to bend her
gender for some cafe society hi-jinks.
</P>
<P>
   Tennille won the coveted role after apparently losing it.
Spurred by Cheri Ingram, her manager, who supplied her with a
bootlegged tape of a performance of the show for a Japanese TV
special, Tennille made her own tape of seven scenes and five songs,
edited it down to 11 minutes and sent it to Blake Edwards and
producer Tony Adams. Edwards, who is married to Andrews, is the
filmmaker who directed the movie version (it preceded the musical,
which opened on Broadway in 1995, by 13 years). Two days after the
tape was mailed, the signing of Raquel Welch for the role was
announced. ``I thought that was the end of it,'' says Tennille. The
next thing she knew, she was being asked if she might be interested
in doing the national tour.
</P>
<P>
   Tennille, like her husband, has show-business genes. Her father
sang with Bob Crosby (Bing's brother) and the big band Bobcats. Her
mother played classical piano and sang classical and jazz music.
She and Dragon have won gold, silver, and platinum albums and
singles and starred on their own network TV series and specials.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon, who was a keyboardist for the Beach Boys (who gave him
his stage name), hired her as a keyboardist for a Beach Boys tour,
making her, she says, the only female who qualified as a ``Beach
Boy.'' She had to be escorted onstage for performances because
security guards always tried to stop her, thinking she was a
groupie. She sang backup vocals in a tenor range, which turned out
to be good training for her approach to the Victoria role. She also
sang as a backup tenor on an untitled album that became Pink
Floyd's ``The Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite swimming through the show business milieu, Tennille and
her husband have remained married since 1975. Asked how they've
done it, she says ``first, you have to choose the right person.''
Then, she says, ``you have to survive the first year,'' which is
``the hardest. He comes from a large family that never talked.
They'd close doors. After we got married, if we disagreed, he'd go
in and shut the door. I'm one of three sisters. They're
overwhelming, like me. When he'd shut the door, I'd say `Let's
talk.' We refined the ability to talk things out at the time.''
They have no children. ``If we did, I'd want to be with them all
the time,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Tennille says her strategy in playing Victoria involves several
approaches. Key is what she refers to as the drag queen's motto:
``Why do when you can overdo?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, Victoria hasn't spent her life learning how to be
gay,'' she says. She plays the role as if it was similar to ``the
idea of putting your wife in a tux so she can go out and be a guy.
She's very uncomfortable, especially in her first appearance as a
guy; then she becomes more comfortable with it. Always, though,
underneath it all, she's Victoria. She behaves like a woman. It's
only when she's in public that she behaves masculine, manly. It's
what they call a `pants role.' I played the pants role of Prince
Orlofsky in Nevada Opera's production of `Die Fledermaus.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tennille, born in Euphala, Ala., says she plays Victoria
``Southern'' and that ``it's the most fun when Victor is not
performed as a woman but as a drag queen. ``There's a big
difference. When he does `Le Jazz Hot' he's over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that she's a contralto. ``Blake didn't want me copying
Julie. He told Raquel and Liza the same thing. I'm singing in the
contralto or male tenor range. I sing in a male tenor voice. But
don't let the voice fool you.''

THEY SWEAR THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not about sex.
</P>
<P>
   We know it's not about sex because they keep telling us: It's
not about sex! It's about lying under oath. Sex has nothing to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not about sex. Even though sex keeps coming up. Because
they keep bringing it up. Mostly to say: It's not about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see if we have this straight.
</P>
<P>
   It's all right to cheat on your spouse as long as you don't lie
about it under oath. You can lie to her, or to him, as the case may
be, but you can't lie under oath. And, as we've seen in the case of
Speaker-elect Robert Livingston, if you publicly admit having
multiple extra-marital affairs and tell the entire nation that
you're very, very sorry, you may get a standing ovation from your
colleagues. Hurrah! Thank you for sharing! Group hug!
</P>
<P>
   But if you cheat on your wife and lie about it under oath in
court, as opposed to lying about it under oath to your wife
(``Honey, I swear to God I never laid a finger on her!'') you may
find yourself impeached, disgraced, forced to forfeit the chance
that your likeness will ever appear on Mount Rushmore. Plus you may
bring down the government. Because lying under oath is serious
business, far more serious than sex.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not about sex. How many times do we have to hear it
before it sinks in? And yet somehow sex keeps coming up. How can
this be? If it's not about sex?
</P>
<P>
   It's about lying under oath. You can lie like a dog when you're
not under oath. Say, like Representative Henry Hyde, you indulged
in a youthful indescretion. You were in your 40s when you began it,
so it was really more of a midlife crisis. But you were just a kid,
or you felt like a kid anyway, and it was a meaningless affair of
no more than five or six years. Now you're sorry. And you're
forgiven because you told the truth, you owned up to it 20-odd
years after the fact, when you were forced to. You may have sinned,
but you never lied under oath, except that oath you took to love
and honor and cherish and keep thee only under her, and who takes
that seriously?
</P>
<P>
   Everybody lies about sex. ``Without lying there'd be no sex,''
Jerry Seinfeld said of the Clinton mess.
</P>
<P>
   You'll notice he didn't say ``Without lying under oath there'd
be no sex.'' Because it's not about sex. It's about lying under
oath.
</P>
<P>
   Even Republicans lie about sex, as we have seen, and may
continue to see, if Larry Flynt, this decade's answer to Woodward
and Bernstein, presses on with his campaign to expose congressional
philanderers. Flynt is a man for these times, truly.
</P>
<P>
   It's not about sex. But who'll be outed next? Who's the leading
candidate in the office pool? How long before the congressional
ranks are decimated? This is more fun than Jerry Springer, watching
our duly elected representatives wallow in the muck. It's a little
like Jerry Springer, actually. Except that it's not about sex. Even
though it seems to be about sex.
</P>
<P>
   How low can we go? When we hear Representative Richard Gephardt
deplore the politics of smear do we think, ``How refreshingly
high-minded,'' or, ``What's he trying to cover up?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters. Because it's not about sex. It's about
lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine named Bill Clinton and Ken Starr as its Men of the
Year. Forget it. Flynt and Linda Tripp are the Co-persons of The
Year. Because they know what it's about. They don't mince words and
dance around the subject. It's about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Except that it's not.

DRAGONFLY 
NASA and the Crisis Aboard Mir 
By Bryan Burrough. HarperCollins. 528 pp. Illustrated. $26.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a subject of such cosmic importance (sorry), there is
precious little Grade-A journalism about space exploration. The New
Yorker's Henry Cooper wrote a brilliant pair of articles about the
near-mutiny on board Skylab. Tom Wolfe hit the mark in ``The Right
Stuff,'' and ``Apollo 13,'' written by commander Jim Lovell and
Jeffery Kluger, is superb. Add one more work to that list:
``Dragonfly,'' Bryan Burrough's account of the troubled US-Russian
collaboration on board the Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   I'm embarrassed by how much I enjoyed this book. Many years ago,
when a talented magazine writer wrote a 600-page book about Sears,
Roebuck &AMP; Co., one of his friends remarked, uncharitably: ``He
thought he was writing a book about America, but he ended up
writing a book about Sears.'' With ``Dragonfly,'' it is just the
opposite. Burrough writes brilliantly about the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Russian space program,
but his story transcends the details of the subject at hand. Just
as Robert Massie's biography ``Peter the Great'' is the best book
about contemporary Russia, ``Dragonfly'' is the best account of the
interplay of American and Russian cultures to appear in years.
</P>
<P>
   The American public first tuned in to the shuttle-Mir missions
in early 1997, when a raging fire and a subsequent in-space
collision nearly claimed the lives of American astronauts Jerry
Linenger, Michael Foale, and their Russian counterparts. But
reading Burrough, you see that the shuttle-Mir program was a
disaster, from its wobbly liftoff to its hellacious, terrifying
finale.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of sending NASA astronauts to the rickety, 12-year-old
Mir was thrown together by a White House aide one  &UR; week &LR;  before
President Bush's June 1992 summit with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin. Bush was already trailing an insurgent Bill Clinton in the
polls, and needed a centerpiece ``event'' _ any event _ to make the
summit newsworthy. The proposed cooperation served many
constituencies: The White House got its spacey photo-op. NASA,
unsuccessfuly trying to flog its International Space Station, got a
reason to live. And the Russians _ canny traders! _ got $400
million. The program likewise advanced the American policy goal of
keeping Russian missile scientists employed, and out of the
clutches of Saddam Hussein &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Even though NASA boss Daniel Goldin hungered for the deal, the
Mir program was a stepchild inside his bureaucracy. At the Johnson
Space Center in Houston, contempt for the Russian space effort ran
deep and wide. While no one questioned the aptitude and bravery of
the Russian cosmonauts, which proved to be considerable, frontline
NASA personnel suspected the Russians were throwing outmoded,
jury-rigged technology up into space. And they turned out to be
right.
</P>
<P>
   The culture clash between the Russians and Americans erupted
almost immediately after NASA's traditionally pampered astronauts
landed in Star City, the Russian training facility outside of
Moscow. The Soviet Union had collapsed just a year before, and the
appurtenances of modern civilization were in short supply. To
supplant the unreliable phone system, the astronauts had one
portable Inmarsat phone, normally reserved for ships at sea, to
communicate with their families. When NASA finally installed its
own phones in Star City, it made the astronauts pay for their
personal calls.
</P>
<P>
   Space exploration a la Russe proved to be quite an eye-opener.
Linenger, the fourth American to fly on Mir, must have been
surprised to hear his commander, Vasily Tsibliyev, discussing
prospects for the mission with a famous Russian psychic _ from
outer space! It fell to Linenger, a doctor, to read some blood
``data'' transmitted from Star City that falsely revealed the
astronauts to be mortally ill. And it was Linenger who once flew
into a basketball-sized glob of ethylene glycol coolant hovering in
the middle of the space station. (Mir leaked coolant constantly,
and had standing puddles of condensed water in several nooks and
crannies. One Russian space boss estimated that the cosmonauts
spent 75 percent of their waking hours repairing the station.)
</P>
<P>
   Likewise Linenger was surprised to find a broken hatch secured
with a do-it-yourself C-clamp, and it was his misfortune to witness
the raging Mir fire, an event his Russian colleagues tried to cover
up. Linenger criticized the safety conditions on board Mir, and was
ostracized by Russians and Americans alike, who desperately wanted
the show to go on.
</P>
<P>
   This book was written in a hurry _ some of the interviews were
conducted earlier this year _ but it doesn't read that way.
Burrough investigates and celebrates the diverse personalities of
the astronauts, many of whom revel in the anonymity of their
androgynous space garb. Bonnie Dunbar is difficult; Norman Thagard
is crotchety; Shannon Lucid goes along, gets along, and is one of
the few Americans who actually enjoys the Mir. Burrough, co-author
with John Helyar of the clunky bestseller ``Barbarians at the
Gate,'' writes like a dream, and has the sweet eye for detail. Can
there really be a NASA staffer named Stella Luna? Would he dare
make that up?
</P>
<P>
   Does the book have any shortcomings? I had a problem with the
last few pages. Burrough ends the book with a roseate,
hands-across-the-ocean paean to the virtues of US-Russian
cooperation. But his hard work of reporting and writing belies this
brief, Pollyannish conclusion. We are back in the joint-venture
business with the Russian space program, assembling NASA's latest,
dubious raison d'etre, the $60 billion International Space Station.
That makes Burrough's book especially topical as American lives are
once again risked in an overpriced and poorly conceived joint space
program. This book _ the best of its kind in the past five years _
deserves a larger audience than it has received so far.

ROCK-CRIT'S DEAN WEIGHS IN WITH `GROWN UP ALL WRONG'

GROWN UP ALL WRONG 
75 Great Rock and Pop Artists from Vaudeville to Techno 
By Robert Christgau 
Harvard University Press, 495 pp., $29.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the Hall of Fame. The proof that rock 'n' roll has come
of age is that serious criticism has arisen around it, schools of
thought and discussion that weigh its popular appeal against its
artistic merit, its influences, and its international range. ``It's
got a beat, and you can dance to it,'' the famous Dick Clark line,
may still represent the primary criterion in some forums, but in
many others, rock as art has become the rule of the day. Therefore,
if anyone is looking for ``Grown Up All Wrong,'' Robert Christgau's
compendium of critical essays, to be a fun, light read _ a pop
single of a book _ that reader should turn the page.
</P>
<P>
   Hailed by many as the dean of American rock criticism,
Christgau, senior music critic of The Village Voice, is arguably
the person most responsible for making such criticism a serious
discipline. And after 27 years at that paper, the operative word is
``arguably,'' because for all his brilliance, Christgau has always
approached the music with as much brain as heart, as much outrage
as fandom, and as much downright orneriness as love. Unlike Greil
Marcus, a writer who has long been more poet than critic, Christgau
lays out clear tracks for his cerebral, history-laden trains of
thought; unlike the late Lester Bangs and his gonzo descendants, he
makes it seem that the gray matter between the ears counts for as
much as the ears themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It is as a cultural critic, therefore, rather than as a ``rock
writer,'' that Christgau tackles popular music. Although ``Grown Up
All Wrong'' is a series of essays (culled from throughout his
career) ostensibly about artists from George Gershwin through
KRS-One, it is also about our times. Eschewing the standard line
that rock was born from a union of blues and country music,
Christgau looks to more mainstream traditions of popular music, and
reflects on Nat King Cole and blackface vaudevillian Emmett Miller
to find the reasons for our contemporary tastes. Poking behind the
myths (that Janis Joplin's recordings never matched her live shows,
or even the long-discounted line that the Rolling Stones were
working class), he seeks to decipher why we love this music _ or
why we ought to. Discussing contemporary acts, he sets out to
explain context as much as sound. And while that can get a tad too
philosophical (when he chews over the concept of a young band
learning to invent itself in his essay on Sleater-Kinney), he also
lovingly depicts scenes to which fans of any sound can relate.
Writing about that band and its fans as they adjust to an
illness-plagued, too-early set, he depicts how ``young women ride
the surge'' of the music, and readers ride along.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the author often takes a godlike stance,
proclaiming that an artist is brilliant, or that a fellow critic is
not. (He dismisses Peter Guralnick's well-received Elvis biography,
``Last Train to Memphis,'' by saying, ``The main things missing . .
. are ideas and dirt.'') He also likes to put himself into the
artist's head, writing, ``Pete Townshend didn't really think
`Tommy' was an opera, he was just having his little joke,'' and
declaring that the intentionally ambiguous artist Prince's ``
`Purple Rain' is about what to do with . . . maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   But as these fairly straightforward sentences indicate, he has a
clear (if sometimes vicious) prose style. Technical terms (such as
timbre) are not defined, but in context are easily understandable.
Therefore, when he pushes the reader past established boundaries
(he is, after all, the founder of the Voice's cross-genre ``Pazz
and Jop Poll''), he takes us with him. Of course, riding along with
the crotchety old dean may not be everyone's idea of fun. But for
them, as Christgau himself says, ``When all else fails, there is
always jazz.''

`GOOD WILL TOWARD MEN'? NOT THIS HOLIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ The fifth-graders in the Washington public
schools brought home a work sheet the other afternoon. The answers
were: majority vote in the House, two-thirds vote in the Senate,
Andrew Johnson. You can guess what the questions were.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country schoolchildren are also having their holiday
concerts. You can hear the strains of ``Peace on earth, good will
toward men,'' even as the latest update on our bombing of Iraq
echoes in the background.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no peace. Precious little good will, either. This
is the most unsettling holiday season in years _ since, maybe,
1972, when on Christmas Day American airmen bombed the outskirts of
Hanoi, or maybe even 1941, when Americans were first coming to
grips with the notion that they were at war on two fronts, our
liberty and lifestyle in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   This holiday season we're at war with ourselves. No party
dispute about that; no gender gap, either. It's as plain as day.
And we just happen also to be at war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   So what are we to do to reclaim the holidays from politics?
Perhaps the answer is to turn away, just for this period, from
public conflict and take solace in private comforts: the strains of
familiar anthems and hymns, the reassuring presence of family, the
warm waves of enduring memories. There is a civic cost to such a
withdrawal, of course, for Thomas Jefferson reminded us that the
price of liberty is eternal vigilance. But the Founders will
forgive us, this once, if we don't let Monica S. Lewinsky and
Kenneth W. Starr nor Trent Lott and Bob Livingston intrude on our
thoughts until, say, the day after New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   Odd that things have turned out this way, at the end of a year
that began with so much promise: A roaring economy. American
soldiers and sailors and fliers far from harm's way. The budget
deficit gone. Voter rebellion vanished. Crime down. Optimism up.
The pollsters even showed that more and more Americans believed
that the nation was heading in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   These were the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   Were. Now we're racked with worry (over Iraq), rent with
bitterness (over impeachment), unsure of our way (about many
things.). The experts say that politics doesn't matter the way it
used to, that people aren't interested in Washington the way they
used to be, that foreign-policy challenges don't chill us the way
they used to. All three have been proven wrong in the last week. We
care a surprising amount.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we don't impeach a president every day. The last time
we did it was 1868, when we were hardly one country, though no
longer two. We were fresh out of the Civil War and the wounds, real
and psychological, were fresh. Only three years earlier, in one of
the most stirring speeches ever, Abraham Lincoln marked his second
Inaugural by pledging ``to finish the work we are in, to bind up
the nation's wounds.'' That passage, memorized by generations of
Americans, concluded with a pledge ``to do all which may achieve
and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a modern president, charged with the ancient but common
flaws of lust and lies, faces impeachment. No one doubts that he
behaved deplorably. But, in truth, there has been bad behavior all
around; the revelations on Thursday about the infidelities of House
Speaker Livingston _ a man eager for an impeachment vote _ reminded
us of that.
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't excuse any of it, of course, but only makes the
whole atmosphere worse. Partisan anger and frustration helped fuel
the drive for impeachment; even more partisan anger and frustration
grew out of that drive. And in any case, the anger and frustration
have contaminated the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, this is the season of suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   And so as war and impeachment crowd in on the celebrations _
Christmas week, Hanukkah, Ramadan, Kwanza are all affected, a
multidemoninational downer _ we're left with the thoughts of
Lincoln, and with the yearning for a just and lasting peace among
ourselves and with all nations.
</P>
<P>
   We are, moreover, left the way we started: searching for peace
within ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Happy holidays. Happy hunting.

TUTORIAL FOR TEENS ON CONSUMER RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the face of the barrage of ads and marketing pitches aimed at
teenagers, Peggy Meagher of the Massachusetts attorney general's
office is on a campaign to keep young people from getting taken in
today's slick consumer world.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, she spoke to an economics class at Matignon High
School in Cambridge and threw them a pop quiz. It's a good thing
this wasn't a high-stakes statewide test, since the average student
got six out of 10 questions correct. But then, Meagher said typical
adults don't score much better than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The quiz covered a range of subjects, from landlord-tenant
obligations and gift certificates to credit reports and debt
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Several students said the quiz revealed new and practical
information they plan to use in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have imagined that a landlord owed me interest
on my security deposit,'' said Lisa Caponigro, 17, referring to a
landlord-tenant question.
</P>
<P>
   Meagher, who heads the attorney general's consumer complaints
section, has visited a half-dozen high schools in the past year to
do some early-intervention consumer education. She said many young
adults approach her office with complaints about credit cards,
student loans, credit reports, health club memberships, and
vacation trips.
</P>
<P>
   Alerting young people to marketing scams and informing them of
their consumer rights, she said, helps them avoid problems.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for three consumer topics that parents and educators
should be sure to review with teenagers, Meagher said, ``Credit
cards, credit cards, credit cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, banks these days have become quite aggressive at
peddling plastic, particularly on college campuses. Many banks give
away mugs, T-shirts, and chocolates to students to get them to
apply.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Massachusetts Public Interest Research
Group found that students who get credit cards from on-campus
marketers are more likely to carry large balances and get more
cards than those who get them through other means, such as their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   In her talk, Meagher also emphasized that students should take
credit reports and student loans seriously. She stressed that the
obligation to repay a student loan cannot be escaped for any
reason, not even bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Meagher said teens often don't have enough life experience to
detect shady operators. She has heard tales of college students
scammed by the promise of a cheap Florida spring break trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to be shocked that there are disreputable travel
agents out there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Carr, head of Matignon's business department, said he
plans to ask consumer advocates to speak to classes every year to
strip away any naivete the youngsters might have. ``I don't want
them to get burned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gift certificate charges?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Al Calk picked up a $30 gift certificate recently at the Emerald
Square Mall in North Attleborough, Mass. and ended up paying $31.20
once a 4 percent service charge was added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never seen that before,'' Calk said. ``I thought it was
ridiculous. Basically, you're paying money to get money.''
</P>
<P>
   Curt Fickeisen, general manager of the mall, said that without
the fee, the mall would have to discontinue the gift certificate
program.
</P>
<P>
   Fickeisen said mall gift certificates are issued as a courtesy
to customers and mall stores. He said the mall incurs a number of
costs, including paying a bank to handle the finances, credit card
fees, personnel, marketing, and packaging for the certificates.
</P>
<P>
   He said the certificates are like money orders, which can be
used in any store or even deposited in a bank. He said customers
concerned about the fee are told that they can obtain a gift
certificate from a specific store in the mall with no service
charge.

   Southwest: No shuttle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines recently announced plans to launch service in
and out of MacArthur Airport in Islip, N.Y., which is on Long
Island about 40 miles from La Guardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   We think Southwest is one of the most consumer-friendly
airlines. The Dallas-based carrier transformed T. F. Green Airport
in Warwick, R.I., and Manchester Airport in Manchester, N.H., into
hubs for many Massachusetts residents. In the process, Southwest
drove down fares substantially at the two airports and in some
cases at Logan Airport in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Early news reports about Islip, particularly in The Wall Street
Journal, made it sound as if Southwest was about to use the Long
Island airport as a staging area to take on the shuttle carriers
that buzz between Boston, New York, and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not happening. Out of Islip, Southwest is flying
nonstop to Baltimore/Washington, Chicago, Nashville, and Tampa.
Warwick and Manchester are not in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   To get into New York City from Islip requires a short cab ride
to the nearest Long Island Rail Road stop and a 1 1/2-hour train
ride from there to Penn Station.
</P>
<P>
   A Southwest spokeswoman acknowledges the early reports were
misleading. She said Southwest for now will be servicing the travel
needs of Long Island's 3 million residents. ``MacArthur Airport is
the convenient airport for Long Islanders,'' she said.

OCCASIONAL CHAIRS, PERFECT ITEM FOR HOLIDAY SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Chairs have been around since the ancient
Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   But according to books on traditional decorating, the ottoman
was an auxiliary seat in American furnishings dating only to the
early 1840s, prior to the Victorian period, and so was the
occasional chair.
</P>
<P>
   A simple parlor, dining room or bedroom chair was customarily
used for this as-needed type of seating. The occasional chair
remains a favorite standby, especially for holiday dinners, parties
and family gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Also called a transitional chair, it has often featured turned
wood parts and a rush or caned seat, although occasional chairs
with upholstered seats were commonly found in living rooms. It is
often a one-of-a-kind chair, ornate, with carvings, swags,
medallions, painted designs, oval- or shield-shaped backs, with or
without arms.
</P>
<P>
   However, an occasional chair also can be one that came from a
parlor set of four or six. Side chairs commonly fit the bill
because they can fit easily anywhere in the home, put aside until
needed. According to ``The Field Guide to American Victorian
Furniture,'' by Thomas H. Ormsbee, an Astor, Vanderbilt or similar
mansion would be provided with a quantity of these gilded wooden
side chairs to be held in reserve for formal dinners or musical
soirees. Another popular shape for an occasional chair was the
corner chair, where the diagonally placed seat forms a right angle
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Occasional chairs can be easily found in many yard, tag and
garage sales, as well as auctions and antiques shops. An occasional
chair can be found from as little as $3 to $3,000 or more.

   OCTUPLETS _ HOUSTON _ All eight babies born to a Houston couple
were in critical condition Monday, and doctors were giving them an
85 percent chance of survival. The mother underwent surgery Monday
to stop bleeding that was a side effect of drugs given to forestall
labor. She was expected to bbe released from the hospital by
Christmas. Meanwhile, the hospital, St. Luke's Episcopal, has been
deluged with reporters and phone calls. It's updating a web site to
provide updates. But little was known about the Chuwur family,
which requested that he hospital not give out any personal
information. (Harmon, Austin American-Statesman).

   BUSH-PRESIDENT _ In public _ in the kinds of things political
advisers politically advise _ and in private _ in the kinds of
things your mother tells you to do _ uncandidate George W. Bush is
doing the kinds of things a presidential candidate does. Texans saw
it recently when he named longtime and trusted family friend Chase
Untermeyer as chairman of the State Board of Education and when
State Insurance Commissioner Elton Bomer moved over to the
governor's staff. And one man in Davenport, Iowa saw it recently
when the governor of Texas thought it was important to offer
long-distance congratulations on the birth of a child. Bush insists
he is still undecided on whether to run, but the Iowa dad said Bush
sounds like a candidate. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman).

   FAULDER-DEATH-ROW _ U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks convened a

whether authorities violated an international treaty by not
allowing him help from his home country. (Ward, Austin

Travel experts anticipate that a record 45.2 million people will

RECONCILIATION? WHO GETS NICE FIRST? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the past President Clinton and House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt have not always been singing from the same
political page, but in the House impeachment struggle the
Democratic leader emerged as the president's most eloquent
congressional defender.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's worst hour was Gephardt's finest.
</P>
<P>
   As did first lady Hillary Clinton and many other Democrats,
Gephardt appealed for reconciliation across partisan barriers and
an end to ``the politics of slash and burn.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said it better than anyone else, with passion, force and
spontaneity rarely seen on the House floor. The fact that the
Republicans did not listen did not take away from the historic
importance and potential impact of what the Missouri Democrat said.
If a narrowly divided Congress cannot recapture a sense of civility
and accommodation, it cannot adequately function at all.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, whom Gephardt may soon run against for
the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination, pointedly commended
Gephardt later at the White House. Gore called Gephardt's emotional
remarks ``the finest speech'' he had heard in Congress since they
both arrived in the House two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt tore up his prepared speech after Speaker-elect Bob
Livingston's stunning resignation in order to reach rhetorically
across the aisle and ask Livingston to reconsider his decision. He
called Livingston a ``good and honorable man,'' the kind of
cross-party praise for a political foe seldom heard in the House
these days.
</P>
<P>
   When Gephardt finished, he was rewarded with an unusual,
prolonged standing ovation from Democratic members. At that moment,
Gephardt proved he has the stuff to be speaker if the Democrats
recapture the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican members, unmoved and sullen, sat on their hands
in a sad demonstration of their unwillingness to give a partisan
inch even when a suffering colleague is praised.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's gesture was an empty one that came too late, as he
knew it would. But it was a symbolic way to begin retreating from
what he calls the partisan ``abyss'' created by the intolerance and
vicious self-righteousness that dominates the House and threatens
to consume our political system and our country.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston himself had contributed to Washington's downward
partisan spiral by refusing to allow the House to consider a
bipartisan censure resolution as an alternative to impeachment. It
confirmed the Republican House majority's real goal, which was not
to punish the president but to drive him from office. (The GOP
congressional leaders invented some legalistic poppycock, but their
refusal of a censure vote had more to do with the fact that it
might get GOP votes and pass than any credible constitutional
basis.)
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt could have crowed about the political demise of the
second GOP speaker in two months, ironically brought down just like
Clinton by illicit sex. It means the Democrats can't be tabbed the
sole party of immorality after all.
</P>
<P>
   When Livingston confessed to having had affairs, Republicans
tried unsuccessfully to pull the old double standard. They said it
didn't compare with Clinton's behavior because Livingston had never
been asked about sex and therefore never lied except during his
marriage vow. They said Livingston's acts were private, whereas
Clinton's involved public lying under oath. The difference came
down to which man had been asked about sex and which one hadn't. It
didn't fly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gephardt could have warned ominously that the
Republicans would pay a price at the ballot box for unilaterally
doing in Clinton, extending the cycle of political retaliation into
eternity. The recent game of mutual revenge now stands at one GOP
and one Democratic president, one Democratic and one GOP speaker,
one GOP speaker-elect, several Cabinet officers and Cabinet
nominees of both parties and a GOP Supreme Court nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, the New York Democratic senator-elect,
observed sadly that ``what began 25 years ago with Watergate ...
has grown beyond our control so that now we are routinely using
criminal accusations and scandal to win the political battles and
ideological differences we cannot settle at the ballot box. It has
been used with reckless abandon by both parties. ... My fear is
that when a Republican wins the White House, Democrats will demand
payback.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt instinctively chose the high road, expressing
sympathy and understanding for Livingston and pleading for new
tolerance on both sides. ``No one,'' he said, ``can pass the
puritanical test of purity that some are demanding our elected
leaders take. ... The founding fathers created a system of
government of men, not of angels.''
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the polls, the country agrees with Gephardt that the
personal rancor and perpetual distrust in Washington have gone too
far. Clinton's job approval ratings have soared to remarkable highs
in the low 70s. A series of national polls all say roughly the same
thing: A two-thirds majority of those surveyed don't want him to be
forced out of office or to resign.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, slightly fewer than one third of the voters
surveyed have a favorable view of the Republican party. Two thirds
disapprove of the House decision to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no easy way to get from today's mean-spirited
climate to Gephardt's ``new politics of respect and fairness and
decency.'' One side has to start, and the other side to respond.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to the majority party members to begin that process.
They control the votes and the institutional congressional
structure. By ignoring the Gephardt opening, House Republicans have
shown they are in no mood to do so, even though it is in their
long-term interest.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment focus moves now to the Senate for trial, where
it is hoped members may have the class and common sense lacking in
the House. But will the House learn anything from a gentler, kinder
Senate? Not likely.

POPULAR FUTURIST IMMERSES HIMSELF IN HIS WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RHINEBECK, N.Y. _ There are no crystal balls to be found at the
Trends Research Institute, but don't be surprised if Gerald Celente
puts one on display.
</P>
<P>
   The fortuneteller's accouterment would be but another whimsical
decoration at Celente's office, a knickknack that would be right at
home alongside globe ornaments and yin-yang symbols hanging from
wooden beams. Or next to the two white coffee mugs signed by Oprah,
souvenirs from his appearances on the television talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Celente, founder and director of the institute, is paid to
predict the future, or at least make forecasts about what is likely
to happen in the months and years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``Trends 2000: How to Prepare and Profit from the
Changes of the 21st Century'' (Warner Books, 1997) has an
impressive following.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Fortune 500 companies, from Coca-Cola to Lockheed
Martin to Lehman Brothers, subscribe to Celente's pricey ($185 a
year) eight-page quarterly newsletter The Trends Journal, the
copyrighted ``voice of the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these businesses so respect Celente's vision that they
hire him as a guest speaker, for which he charges a $25,000 fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take on things is different than everybody else's,''
explained Celente, a wiry 52-year-old dressed casually in black
wale corduroys and a charcoal pullover sweater, reading glasses
hanging on a cord around his neck. ``I decode the system. I know
how it works, how it fulfills itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have up to 20 people contributing to the newsletter but I'm
the final arbiter of whether or not something's a trend. I eat,
sleep and drink this stuff. Sure, intuition plays a role, but you
only get that from experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Celente's resume lists more than 20 on-target forecasts. Among
them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Casual dress trends ('86).
</P>
<P>
   _ The rise of deep discount and warehouse shopping ('88).
</P>
<P>
   _ Alternative/complementary medicine/new age trends ('88).
</P>
<P>
   _ Downsizing and outsourcing ('90).
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100 television and radio interviews scheduled for
January, the futurist is sure to be a widely quoted authority
during the final 12 months before 2000 and the new millennium. But
he has been forecasting the future for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   A Bronx native, Celente was a lobbyist and government affairs
director for a Chicago-based trade association when then-President
Jimmy Carter announced in 1978 that the Shah of Iran was firmly in
control of his nation, a notion that contradicted everything
Celente knew about the oil-rich country.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I started to think about the implications of this, the
probability of a successful revolution and the price of oil and
gold going up,'' Celente said. ``And I started playing the
commodities market.''
</P>
<P>
   His hunch mushroomed into a small fortune for Celente, and a new
career was born. Celente quit his job and moved here to a ranch
house with dark wooden beams and smooth oak floors tucked into the
gently rolling landscape east of the Hudson River. He wanted
tranquility and easy access to Manhattan, and this met the
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sign on the mailbox or on the 40 acres enveloping
the house that tells visitors they have come to the Trends Research
Institute, despite its think-tank name. Celente no longer lives
here; after an unpleasant divorce several years ago that ended his
23-year marriage, a subject Celente prefers not to discuss, he
moved up the road to the hamlet of Tivoli. He makes the 8-mile
drive to the office daily.
</P>
<P>
   The institute has a small staff. Two assistants and two
librarians file and cross-reference every article Celente finds
interesting or noteworthy from the Internet as well as that day's
USA Today, New York Times and Wall Street Journal, publications he
reads devoutly. He also subscribes to less-well-known periodicals
(Covert Action Quarterly, Human Events, Skeptical Enquirer, etc.)
that offer particular points of view with which he likes to be
familiar. Celente has more than 300 files updated daily, covering
subjects from the Asian financial crisis to astrology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in the implications of current events,'' he
explained. ``We compile and analyze.''
</P>
<P>
   He also listens to his gut. If something strikes the right chord
with Celente, like the irreverent Comedy Central TV program ``South
Park'' did a year ago, he touts it as an ``on-trend'' in the
newsletter. Four months later, ``South Park'' was a Newsweek cover
story.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to tabulate Celente's batting average. He
estimates he's made ``several hundred'' predictions during the past
20 years, many of them broad enough that they're hard to disprove.
For example, he predicts in his book ``Trends 2000'' such obvious
developments as ``financial planning experts will find a booming
business helping boomers prepare for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims he has accurately predicted numerous political and
economic events, from the October '87 stock market crash (forecast
in January of that year) to the emergence of a new political party
in the '90s (forecast in '88), as well as numerous cultural trends
such as the rise in popularity of gourmet coffees and
microbreweries.
</P>
<P>
   The only ``miss'' he acknowledges is the 1992 presidential
election. He picked George Bush to beat Bill Clinton, apparently
ignoring his own sage prediction regarding the rise of Ross Perot's
Reform Party. Said Celente: ``I had no way of knowing Perot would
drop out, then re-enter the race and make a fool of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Celente has admirers at USA Today, which publishes his annual
top 10 trend forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bob Dubill, executive editor at USA Today: ``My
recollection is that his batting average is quite high. As far as
misses, pollsters have missed too. In fact, they seem to miss more
often than they hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gerry's a tracker in the finest sense of the word. He devours
news. He's the kind of person who if he was interested in reporting
would come up with terrific stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Celente outlined his four-step formula for tracking a trend,
which starts with his reading news stories. He tracks clusters of
stories, looks for a trend, then analyzes the trend and makes a
forecast. The final step is designing strategies for making the
most of the trend.
</P>
<P>
   It is in this way that Celente runs counter to so-called new age
expectations. He is an unabashed capitalist, eager to cash in on
developments much as he did when he foresaw the overthrow of the
shah.
</P>
<P>
   He said he preferred to invest in companies and sectors that he
believes are going to experience long-term growth as well as
short-term hits. The merger of Chrysler Corp. and Germany's
Daimler-Benz auto maker inspired Celente to invest heavily in that
newly created company.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, he is looking for a new business in which to put his
money. He is dumbfounded that as we begin 1999 there are no
health-food fast-food eateries offering a free-range
organic-chicken sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell is the big mystery?'' Celente mused. ``People
will pay two or three dollars more for quality. That's one thing
that's been demonstrated time and again during the last decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Celente recalls his appearance before the National Coffee
Association in 1990. At the organization's annual convention in
Miami he predicted that gourmet coffee would be the next wave. At
that time there were just 13 Starbucks Coffee Co. outlets, all
located in the Seattle area. Today, Starbucks has more than 1,700
stores in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people there thought I was a nut,'' Celente
remembered, his eyes twinkling. ``I overheard people at lunch later
that day asking each other who I was, and then one couple came up
to me to shake my hand. They had decided to start a gourmet coffee
shop in Chicago, and they hoped I was right.''

Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Dec. 22:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BALLOON (Undated) _ The balloon team led by Richard Branson
is facing an emergency after China abruptly revoked air-space
permission, blocking the only viable route on their quest to be the
first to float around the world. By Malcolm W. Browne.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DEEPSEA-AQUARIUM (Monterey, Calif.) _ Miles beneath the
turbulent waters of California's Monterey Bay, research biologists
equipped with a giant robot submersible, advanced sensory equipment
and stomachs almost of steel are collecting some of the rarest sea
creatures known to man. If the biologists of the Monterey Bay
Aquarium manage to keep these bizarre animals alive after bringing
them back from the abyss, as they say they can, the researchers
plan a public exhibit of more than 40 species early next year _ the
largest such display of living deep-sea life ever. By Calvin Sims.

   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GIJOE-PHYSIQUE (Undated) _ Barbie has a male companion in
the land of the outlandish physique, and his name ain't Ken.
Instead, we must look to that old trooper, G.I. Joe, to see a match
for Barbie's cartoon anatomy, and to find a doll that may be as
insidious a role model for boys as Barbie is for girls. Some
researchers worry that Joe and other action-hero figures may
contribute to the use of muscle-building drugs among young
athletes, even as doctors and sports officials struggle to
emphasize that such drugs are not only risky, illegal and
unsporting, but in many cases actually worthless to performance. By
Natalie Angier. (1485 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TIME-REVERSAL (Undated) _ Since a landmark experiment in
1964 by Dr. James Cronin and Dr. Val Fitch, physicists have known
that time reversal is not so neat in the microscopic world of
particles. They found indirect but convincing evidence that
sometimes a particle going backward in time fails to land on the
metaphorical diving board; in other words, time, they found, could
not be perfectly symmetrical. Experimenters have now achieved
direct confirmation of this unsettling inference. By Malcolm W.
Browne. (1820 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CANCER-TREATMENT (Undated) _ A novel form of cancer
treatment has neared the end of its preliminary trials with
promising results at the same time as new research has cast doubt
on its original rationale. The doubts, not yet resolved, may mean
that the treatment is less innocuous to normal cells than thought.
But it is also possible that the treatment may be applicable to a
much wider range of cancers than previously believed. The agent of
treatment is a genetically altered adenovirus, one of the viruses
that cause the common cold. By Nicholas Wade. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BIRDS-MONOGAMY (Undated) _ In study after study, the idea
that females are naturally devoted to their one and only mates,
even as the males wander, has fallen to growing evidence that many
of the world's females are anything but monogamous. In spite of
these findings, many biologists held out hope that some females
might be faithful, particularly to exemplary, hard-working fathers,
as in the bird species known as the wattled jacana. But research
reported today in the Proceedings of the Royal Society shatters
that dream. Although the diminutive male jacanas do everything to
care for the eggs and young of their raucous, beefy females _ these
males are cuckolded. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SCHALLER-BIODIVERSITY (Undated) _ George Schaller, director
of science for the Wildlife Conservation Society, the group that
runs the Bronx Zoo, has studied animals in the wild for more than
45 years, from the birds of Colville River, Alaska, to the mountain
gorillas of Zaire and the giant pandas of China. He discussed
biodiversity and his current field work _ trying to gauge the
impact of an epidemic of bacterial hoof disease on the vast herds
of gazelles on the Central Asian steppe _ in a telephone interview
from a campsite near Choybalsan in eastern Mongolia. By John
O'Neil. (1190 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions: Does the appendix have
any use in the human body? (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Short science items: Items on pollution of
the South Platte River, South American dinosaur extinction and the
care and feeding of ocean bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Health and Fitness &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-MINORITIES (Undated) _ Harlem AIDS Forum examines the
way minorities are finding alternative disease treatments. By David
France. (1230 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Veterinarians who have treated
countless holiday casualties caution pet owners to pay as much
attention to their animals' safety as they would to a child's.
Holiday food, decorations and plants pose particular problems. By
Jane E. Brody. (1280 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TEETH-WHITENERS (Undated) _ A variety of new procedures and
products have become available for whitening darkened or discolored
teeth. But dental experts warn that some of them can not only
damage the teeth they are whitening but also can present general
health risks. By Holcolm B. Noble. (600 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CAUSE-OF-DEATH (Undated) _ The Doctor's World column: New
evidence of flawed death certificate information comes from
researchers at the federally financed Framingham Heart Study in
Massachusetts. The study, begun in 1948 and involving some 10,000
people, suggests that doctors overstate coronary artery disease as
a cause of death on death certificates, particularly among the
elderly. Few doctors are trained in listing cause of death, but
steps are being taken to teach them, including step-by-step
electronic certificate-filing programs. By Lawrence K. Altman.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-CHILD (Undated) _ Exercising with a young child in a
jogging stroller, bike seat or backpack has its advantages and
appeal, but safety experts offer a long list of cautions. By John
O'Neil. (600 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Short items on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute has created a new
Web site to help physicians, researchers and asthma patients. (280
words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Many toys are unsafe. About 121,000 kids ages 14 and under
were treated in hospital emergency rooms for toy-related injuries
in 1995, the most current year of complete statistics. Nearly, 60
percent of those injured were age 4 or younger. (450 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Night owls, British researchers have found, are just as likely
as early-rising larks to be healthy, wealthy and wise. (375 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Scientists already have suggested that eating chocolate may
make you happy. Now they say men who indulge in chocolates may live
longer. A study of 7,841 Harvard male graduates found that
chocolate and candy eaters _ regardless of how voracious their
appetite for goodies _ live almost a year longer than those who
abstain. The researchers from Harvard University's School of Public
Health, whose study was published in a recent issue of the British
Medical Journal, said they could not explain this phenomenon. (300
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATER-PARKS (Undated) _ Indoor water parks, with spraying
fountains, may transmit infectious agents. A Colorado water park
was shut down twice because of mysterious lung disease among
lifeguards. By John O'Neil. (560 words)

   --Young brass-instrument musicians who feel weakness in their
facial muscles may owe it to more than overexertion. In those who
have a heart defect called a patent foramen ovale, the pressure of
playing may up their already-increased risk for stroke, according
to researchers at the University of Munster in Germany.

   -- Allowing patients to return to work less than two weeks after
a certain type of spinal-disc surgery is just as safe as the
standard months-long recovery, new research suggests.

   SCI-BALLOON (Undated) _ The balloon team led by Richard Branson
is facing an emergency after China abruptly revoked air-space
permission, blocking the only viable route on their quest to be the
first to float around the world. By Malcolm W. Browne.

   SCI-DEEPSEA-AQUARIUM (Monterey, Calif.) _ Miles beneath the
turbulent waters of California's Monterey Bay, research biologists
equipped with a giant robot submersible, advanced sensory equipment
and stomachs almost of steel are collecting some of the rarest sea
creatures known to man. If the biologists of the Monterey Bay
Aquarium manage to keep these bizarre animals alive after bringing
them back from the abyss, as they say they can, the researchers
plan a public exhibit of more than 40 species early next year _ the
largest such display of living deep-sea life ever. By Calvin Sims.

   SCI-GIJOE-PHYSIQUE (Undated) _ Barbie has a male companion in
the land of the outlandish physique, and his name ain't Ken.
Instead, we must look to that old trooper, G.I. Joe, to see a match
for Barbie's cartoon anatomy, and to find a doll that may be as
insidious a role model for boys as Barbie is for girls. Some
researchers worry that Joe and other action-hero figures may
contribute to the use of muscle-building drugs among young
athletes, even as doctors and sports officials struggle to
emphasize that such drugs are not only risky, illegal and
unsporting, but in many cases actually worthless to performance. By
Natalie Angier. (1485 words)

   SCI-TIME-REVERSAL (Undated) _ Since a landmark experiment in
1964 by Dr. James Cronin and Dr. Val Fitch, physicists have known
that time reversal is not so neat in the microscopic world of
particles. They found indirect but convincing evidence that
sometimes a particle going backward in time fails to land on the
metaphorical diving board; in other words, time, they found, could
not be perfectly symmetrical. Experimenters have now achieved
direct confirmation of this unsettling inference. By Malcolm W.
Browne. (1820 words)

   SCI-CANCER-TREATMENT (Undated) _ A novel form of cancer
treatment has neared the end of its preliminary trials with
promising results at the same time as new research has cast doubt
on its original rationale. The doubts, not yet resolved, may mean
that the treatment is less innocuous to normal cells than thought.
But it is also possible that the treatment may be applicable to a
much wider range of cancers than previously believed. The agent of
treatment is a genetically altered adenovirus, one of the viruses
that cause the common cold. By Nicholas Wade. (1350 words)

   SCI-BIRDS-MONOGAMY (Undated) _ In study after study, the idea
that females are naturally devoted to their one and only mates,
even as the males wander, has fallen to growing evidence that many
of the world's females are anything but monogamous. In spite of
these findings, many biologists held out hope that some females
might be faithful, particularly to exemplary, hard-working fathers,
as in the bird species known as the wattled jacana. But research
reported today in the Proceedings of the Royal Society shatters
that dream. Although the diminutive male jacanas do everything to
care for the eggs and young of their raucous, beefy females _ these
males are cuckolded. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (1400 words)

   SCI-SCHALLER-BIODIVERSITY (Undated) _ George Schaller, director
of science for the Wildlife Conservation Society, the group that
runs the Bronx Zoo, has studied animals in the wild for more than
45 years, from the birds of Colville River, Alaska, to the mountain
gorillas of Zaire and the giant pandas of China. He discussed
biodiversity and his current field work _ trying to gauge the
impact of an epidemic of bacterial hoof disease on the vast herds
of gazelles on the Central Asian steppe _ in a telephone interview

   SCI-TEETH-WHITENERS (Undated) _ A variety of new procedures and
products have become available for whitening darkened or discolored
teeth. But dental experts warn that some of them can not only
damage the teeth they are whitening but also can present general
health risks. By Holcolm B. Noble. (600 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CAUSE-OF-DEATH (Undated) _ The Doctor's World column: New
evidence of flawed death certificate information comes from
researchers at the federally financed Framingham Heart Study in
Massachusetts. The study, begun in 1948 and involving some 10,000
people, suggests that doctors overstate coronary artery disease as
a cause of death on death certificates, particularly among the
elderly. Few doctors are trained in listing cause of death, but
steps are being taken to teach them, including step-by-step
electronic certificate-filing programs. By Lawrence K. Altman.

   _ Scientists already have suggested that eating chocolate may
make you happy. Now they say men who indulge in chocolates may live
longer. A study of 7,841 Harvard male graduates found that
chocolate and candy eaters _ regardless of how voracious their
appetite for goodies _ live almost a year longer than those who
abstain. The researchers from Harvard University's School of Public
Health, whose study was published in a recent issue of the British
Medical Journal, said they could not explain this phenomenon. (300

the season is ultimately canceled, is it possible the players would

answer, for now, seems to be that it is possible, but not very
realistic, particularly because the TV networks are not showing

GRINCH TAKES FLIGHT, AS DO BUTTERFLIES &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   I've always been a sucker for Christmas. I've loved buying
gifts, squeezing the biggest tree possible into a corner of our
family room, getting teary-eyed when carols are played.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the decorations went up in the stores before the
Halloween costumes were packed away. What about Thanksgiving? Are
we going to just nudge it right off the calendar? I found myself
growing grumpy. I like a buildup to the big day.
</P>
<P>
   I'm on vacation while you're reading this. Visiting the family.
But before I left the office, a letter from a gardener arrived _ a
gift that took the commercialism right out of Christmas. Perhaps it
will boost your spirits, too:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Kathy: Four years ago I purchased two milkweed plants that
I planted in my garden. The two plants have now multiplied into
five plants. The Monarch butterflies visit the plants and lay their
eggs. Each season as the caterpillars emerge, I bring three or four
inside and place them in a large plastic jar with holes in the lid.
I place a few sticks in the jar and feed the caterpillars fresh
milkweed leaves each day and clean their poop out several times a
day.
</P>
<P>
   I watch them eat and grow. Eat and grow. I watch them spin their
silk pads and hook their little bodies to them and hang in the
letter ``J.'' I watch them split their skins and each shape into a
beautiful green-and-gold-speckled chrysalis. I check on them until
the chrysalides turn dark, and I watch as beautiful butterflies
emerge. I watch the butterflies stretch and dry themselves. I then
place the jar in a quiet place and wait until the next morning to
release the butterflies back into my garden.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I watch this cycle of life occur, I feel like a child
at a birthday party. I share this experience with those I know who
love nature and might wish to share it with their children and
loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I would share this with you. Perhaps your readers
might enjoy this gift of nature in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Have a wonderful holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   A: Thank you. You chased the Grinch away.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you provide me with a list of native flowers or
perennial flowers or shrubs that I might plant to attract
hummingbirds, birds and butterflies? If you could give me the color
and approximate height of these, I could arrange them in a
stair-step fashion.
</P>
<P>
   A: There are many nectar-bearing flowers that will feed
butterflies and hummingbirds. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ageratum (blue, 18 inches; perennial native)
</P>
<P>
   _ Asters (lavender, blue, 12-18 inches; perennial, some native)
</P>
<P>
   _ Black-eyed Susans (yellow-gold, 2-3 feet; perennial)
</P>
<P>
   _ Butterfly bush (Buddleia, white, purple, red, pink; to 6 feet;
perennial shrub)
</P>
<P>
   _ Butterfly weed or milkweed (Ascle- pias, orange-yellow or
red-yellow; 3 feet or more; perennial shrub)
</P>
<P>
   _ Lantana (yellow, white, lavender, orange; 1-3 feet; perennial,
some native)
</P>
<P>
   _ Pentas (red, pink, blue; 2-4 feet; tender perennial)
</P>
<P>
   _ Summer phlox (magenta, rose, pink, white; 3-4 feet; perennial)
</P>
<P>
   _ Purple coneflowers (pinkish-purple; 2-3 feet; native
perennial)
</P>
<P>
   _ Salvias (various blues, purples, red, pink, white; to 4 feet;
perennial, some native)
</P>
<P>
   _ Verbena (`Apple Blossom,' `Blue Princess' and `Purple
Homestead' some of the best perennials; 1-foot range)
</P>
<P>
   _ Shrubs and trees that draw birds include:
</P>
<P>
   _ American beautyberry (fall-winter purple berries; to 6 feet)
</P>
<P>
   _ Parsley hawthorn (white flowers, red fall fruit; to 24 feet,
native)

   The latest example of that is in the credit card business.
</P>
<P>
   Smart consumers found a way to keep their credit card interest
rates way down: Sign up for a credit card with a low promotional
rate. When that short-lived teaser rate is about to expire, these
``rate-surfers'' transfer the balance to another bargain card.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rate-surfing has been raised to an art form among some
people,'' said Jim Shanahan, a credit card consultant at Business
Dynamics Consulting in Wilmington, Del., consultants to the
financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the credit card industry is out to teach rate-surfers a
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Issuers are beginning to charge consumers a fee to transfer
balances to their new low-rate card.
</P>
<P>
   First USA, one of the largest credit card issuers and one of the
most aggressive marketers, has started charging a fee of 2 to 3
percent on balances transferred to some of its cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like paying points on a loan,'' said George McCane, First
USA spokesman. ``It's the cost of accessing credit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the charges relate to ``handling costs and certain risk
factors,'' on which he declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   But industry observers say lenders figure if you have to endure
the pain of paying balance-transfer fees, you'll think twice before
ditching your new credit card, when the teaser rate runs out, for
one that charges an even lower interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly can have that effect,'' McCane said. ``We view
our balance-transfer fees as part of a strategy to engender
loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit card issuers are moving toward these fees because they're
losing money when people jump from card to card, industry analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 million card holders transfer card balances several
times each year, and it costs card issuers about $100 in marketing
and mailing to attract each new card customer, ndustry experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of banks have lost money on this stuff,'' Shanahan said.
``You can't make money on 4.9 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Providian Financial in San Francisco will offer to beat your
original issuer's rate for a certain period, say, three months, but
then will raise the rates to between 12.99 and 21.99 percent,
depending on what rate a card holder is getting from his or her
current card issuer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are typically in the market for consumers who are actively
using credit,'' said Laurie Cole, Providian spokeswoman. ``We are
hoping to get people who are interested in a long-term
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies your power as a consumer _ especially if you carry
a balance _ to get around these moves by issuers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a consumer who generally carries a balance on your
credit card, then you are a prime target for the credit card
industry and you're in a prime negotiating position as well,'' said
Gerri Detweiler, co-author of ``The Ultimate Credit Handbook.''
``It's very hard for issuers to find consumers who carry balances
and who are willing to transfer those balances to a new card.''
</P>
<P>
   If a card issuer wants to charge you a balance-transfer fee,
insist that the fee be waived. These aggressive promotions exist
because there are so many other companies out there hungry for
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very likely that if you qualify for that card, then
you'll qualify for another one,'' Detweiler said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if your credit record is good, contact your bank about its
credit card program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these banks, if they can't compete with these issuers
in terms of marketing dollars, can give a decent rate to
creditworthy people,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   There's another way you can get around the balance-transfer
fees.
</P>
<P>
   When you get your next card statement, pay off the balance by
using one of those ``convenience checks'' issued by the card with
the lower rate, said David Gagie, marketing director at Auriemma
Consulting Group in Westbury, N.Y., consultants to the credit card
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who ends up paying that (balance-transfer fee) is not
really being smart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One crucial piece of advice about balance transfers: Always
transfer the balance with a firm plan to pay off the debt. A
balance transfer isn't a license to keep charging up your debt. The
whole purpose of transferring a balance is to keep interest from
piling on so high that you don't make headway in paying off the
bill.

GREETINGS, OBSERVATIONS AT DOORSTEP OF 1999 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ To help wind down this year and prepare to
welcome 1999, here are some seasonal greetings with, I hope,
relevant observations attached:
</P>
<P>
   H _ Healthy. It would be great if the economy, our governmental
leaders and all of us taxpayers remain healthy in 1999. If we
remain as robust as our political skepticism, most of us will be in
great shape.
</P>
<P>
   A _ Absence. No disrespect intended, but state government will
survive the absence of Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, Attorney General Dan
Morales, Comptroller John Sharp and Land Commissioner Garry Mauro.
Although sometimes controversial, the four veteran Democrats made
strong contributions to Texas, some of which will be felt for years
to come. People of all political persuasions can be grateful for
their service. But life goes on, and so will Texas. Sharp and
possibly Morales may even get another shot at public office
someday.
</P>
<P>
   P _ President. Will Gov. George W. Bush run for president? If
you are tired of such speculation, better hide in a cave because it
will get worse until the governor finally clears the air within the
next few months. Although there doesn't seem to be much suspense
over the likelihood of his running, we won't know the answer to an
even more important question for a while longer yet. Will he win a
race that will be tougher than most of us can even imagine?
</P>
<P>
   P _ Perry. Lt. Gov.-elect Rick Perry is no Bob Bullock. But as
the Senate's next presiding officer, he will find himself the focus
of a lot more media attention than he was used to as agriculture
commissioner. Perry's new job will be a tough test of his
leadership capabilities, and, whether he likes it or not, many
people will evaluate him by Bullock's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Y _ Year (old). The departing 1998 was a landmark year for Texas
Republicans, who captured all the statewide offices for the first
time since Reconstruction. They deserved their celebration.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H _ Hispanics. Although still voting heavily Democratic, this
fast-growing group of Texans is hardly monolithic, as the recent
election strongly demonstrated. Gov. Bush made large inroads into
the Hispanic vote, and former Secretary of State Tony Garza became
the third Hispanic elected to statewide office in Texas _ the first
as a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   O _ Oversight. Besides the $17.3 billion in tobacco payments
that are supposed to flow to Texas over the next 25 years, the
biggest legacy of the anti-tobacco lawsuit may be more oversight by
the governor and/or legislative leaders over the attorney general's
office. Some lawmakers will sponsor bills to curtail the attorney
general's independence in signing contingency contracts with
outside lawyers, which sparked huge fees _ and major controversy _
in the tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   L _ Luck. All of Texas' officeholders will welcome a large dose
of this commodity in the new year. Perhaps the largest share,
however, should be reserved for state Sen. Bill Ratliff and state
Rep. Rob Junell, who have taken on the worthy _ but extremely
difficult _ task of writing a new state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   I _ Integrity. Government decision-makers should never leave
home without it. Unfortunately, 1998 showed us once again that many
officials _ even some high-ranking ones _ may not even be sure what
the word means.
</P>
<P>
   D _ Deregulation. The deregulation of electric utilities may be
the single biggest issue before the Legislature next year. Efforts
to forge a compromise will continue. It is a complex issue with
potentially enormous stakes for utilities, their consumers _ and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   A _ Appearances. These often are as important as reality in
government and politics. But Rick Perry _ or people close to him _
recently showed more zeal for raising political money than concern
for ethical sensitivities. Setting $50,000 quotas for some
lobbyists who supported Perry's Democratic opponent, John Sharp,
was out of line. The quotas may not have been Perry's idea, but he
is ultimately responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Y _ Year (new). The time for celebrating is almost over. The
Republican victors who were beside themselves with glee on election
night now face the serious task of governing. Everyone will have a
stake in their success or failure.
</P>
<P>
   S _ Schools. They will be a high priority for the governor and
the Legislature in the new year. One of the big fights again will
be over a proposal _ strongly supported by Bush and Perry _ to
allow students from low-performing public schools to use vouchers
paid by state tax dollars to attend private schools. But, once
again, the real test will be in the Democrat-dominated House, which
has defeated similar proposals in recent years.

`NYAH, NYAH _ GOTCHA!' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 27)  
 (Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.)  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This space has been hijacked this week by the Gotcha! Gang, a
growing legion of readers who take preternatural delight in
exposing the grammatical errors of the resident columnist. Their
motto: ``No Haven for the Maven.'' (Excuse me;  &UR; its &LR;  motto.)
</P>
<P>
   From N. Lewis of Croydon, N.H.: ``You write, `A column in this
space titled ``The Asian Connection'' had just appeared, followed
the next day by a front-page article about John Huang's
fund-raising in The Wall Street Journal.'
</P>
<P>
   ``John Huang was doubtless a very active fellow, but I doubt he
was engaged in `fund-raising in The Wall Street Journal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Max Culpa for Mayor. Huang was surely not chasing the editor
Robert Bartley down that newspaper's corridors seeking
contributions to the Clinton campaign. A prepositional phrase like
 &UR; in The Wall Street Journal &LR;  is a modifier and should cozy up
intimately to the noun it modifies, lest another, closer noun be
mistaken for the term being modified.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the noun phrase being modified was  &UR; a front-page
article &LR; , but I put so many words in between that it is possible to
think that  &UR; fund-raising &LR;  was the modified term. The philologist
Richard Lederer had a good example of this abuse of
prepositional-phrase position: ``Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg
Address while traveling from Washington to Gettysburg on the back
of an envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   From Ed Cashin of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.: ``You say, `He
offers the other two branches of government the choice,' but you
mean `the  &UR; two other &LR;  branches.' Otherwise, we would have four
branches of government.''
</P>
<P>
   You know, he's got a point. I never thought of that before.
 &UR; Other &LR;  is called a ``postdeterminer'' because it usually comes
after words that are determiners, like numerals or other
quantifiers that make a noun phrase specific. Thus, when I wrote
 &UR; the other two branches &LR; , it could be thought to stand against
 &UR; these two branches &LR;  _ totaling, as my eagle-eyed critic observes,
four branches. But if I had written  &UR; the two other branches &LR; , there
could be no doubt that only three branches exist.
</P>
<P>
   Some would call this pedantry, but I stand corrected, and in
turn correct David Schippers, majority counsel of the House
Judiciary Committee, for his castigation of the president's disdain
for ``the integrity of the other two coequal branches.'' Cashin is
hereby appointed recording secretary of the Nit-pickers' League, a
highly sophisticated subgroup of the Gotcha! Gang whose membership
is in constant turmoil about writing its name Nitpicker's League.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, in reviewing Bryan Garner's Dictionary of Modern
American Usage, I misquoted him by writing that ``that historic
differentiation'' between  &UR; enormity &LR;  (``outrageousness'') and
 &UR; enormousness &LR;  (``hugeness'') should be upheld. Garner correctly
wrote  &UR; historical &LR; . Robert Burchfield's New Fowler's Modern English
Usage quotes a forgetful maven on that: ``Any past event is
 &UR; historical &LR; , but only the most memorable ones are  &UR; historic &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Now to the alleged mistake that drew the most mail. In a line
about the pronunciation of  &UR; status &LR; , I wrote, ``That is usually
pronounced STAT-us, as in  &UR; statistics &LR; , by the highfalutin, and
STATE-us by the hoi polloi.''
</P>
<P>
   From Jim Tart of Dallas: ``My daughter Katie tells me that her
eighth-grade teacher would have smacked her in the head with her
grammar book had she said ` &UR; the &LR;  hoi polloi.' Katie says  &UR; hoi
polloi &LR;  means `the masses,' and therefore should never be proceeded
by  &UR; the &LR; . Live by the sword and die by the sword.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Mr. Tart. (And when Katie comes by with her spelling
book opened to  &UR; precede &LR; , watch your head.) Curiously, this seeming
redundancy in regard to a foreign phrase apparently infuriates
Greek scholars. ``Wrong!'' shouts Stephen Esrati of Shaker Heights,
Ohio. `` &UR; Hoi &LR;  means `the.''' No doubt about that. Wrote Ronald
Serafine of Butler, Pa.: ``One does not say ` &UR; the &LR;  hoi polloi' for
the same reason that one does not say ` &UR; with &LR;  au jus.' How plead
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Innocent with an explanation, Your Honor. Take that French
phrase first: When you order roast beef  &UR; au jus &LR; , pronounced
oh-ZHOO, you are using the French for ``in its juice'' (literally,
``with juice''). Your waitress is in error if she treats that
phrase as a noun and asks, ``You want the  &UR; au jus &LR;  on the side?''
Correct her, and you will soon have a  &UR; chemise au jus &LR; . In the same
way, if you correct an inviter who writes, ``Please R.S.V.P.,'' you
won't get asked again to  &UR; Repondez s'il vous plait &LR;  (literally,
``Respond, if you please'').
</P>
<P>
   Those are two-language redundancies not yet given absolution by
all-forgiving usage. When we speak of ``the  &UR; hoi polloi &LR; ,''
however, we are firmly grounded in an error that common usage over
centuries has erased. Certainly,  &UR; the hoi polloi &LR;  translates
formally and redundantly as ``the the masses,'' causing speakers of
Greek and members of the Squad Squad to look at you with disdain.
But the English idiom is  &UR; the hoi polloi &LR; . Sometime next century,
we will write that as  &UR; hoipolloi &LR;  to reflect its Anglicization.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Burchfield, in the third edition of Fowler's, calls the
hidebound resistance to  &UR; the &LR;  in front of the Greek phrase ``an
attempt to force Greek grammar on the receiving language.'' He
writes: ``Dryden and Byron wrote `the oi polloi' and who is to
quarrel with them? And who is prepared to `correct' W.S. Gilbert's
lines from ``Iolanthe,'' 'Twould fill with joy, And madness
stark/the oi polloi (a Greek remark)'?''
</P>
<P>
   Though willing to go along with the usage roundheels on
permitting that redundancy, I hang tough on semantics: The meaning
of  &UR; the hoi polloi &LR;  should remain ``the masses,'' or in
less-Marxist-sounding terms, ``ordinary folk.''
</P>
<P>
   When the writer Pete Hamill told the interviewer Charlie Rose,
``Sinatra threw a party for Agnew in Palm Springs with all  &UR; the hoi
polloi &LR;  in attendance,'' Francis Dyer of New York objected, noting
that the phrase had not taken on a new meaning of ``important
people, upper classes or `swells.'''
</P>
<P>
   That upside-down usage occurs often. The confusion comes from
the similarity of the noun  &UR; hoi polloi &LR;  and the adjective
 &UR; hoity-toity &LR; , a rhyming compound from the English dialect term
 &UR; hoit &LR; , ``to play the fool,'' which has come to mean ``foolishly
snooty.'' (What a pleasure it is to get back to correcting other
people's mistakes.)

 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Lewis Carroll's mirror world of ``Through the Looking
Glass,'' it seems perfectly logical that the White Queen, who lives
backward, first bandages her finger, then begins to bleed, then
screams, and finally pricks her finger.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, if not in real life, the physics governing many
natural phenomena permit time to run either forward, like a swimmer
jumping from a diving board, or backward, like a reversed movie in
which the swimmer leaps from the water and lands on the board.
</P>
<P>
   But since a landmark experiment in 1964 by Dr. James W. Cronin
and Dr. Val L. Fitch, both at Princeton University at the time,
physicists have known that time reversal is not so neat in the
microscopic world of particles. They found indirect but convincing
evidence that sometimes a particle going backward in time fails to
land on the metaphorical diving board; in other words, time, they
found, could not be perfectly symmetrical.
</P>
<P>
   Experimenters have now achieved direct confirmation of this
unsettling inference.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, physicists at two big particle
accelerators, one in Switzerland and the other in Illinois, proved
that when certain particles go backward in time, their behavior is
somewhat different from what it is when they go forward.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds baffling to non-scientists, they are not alone; a
member of the Nobel committee who sat on the panel that awarded
Cronin and Fitch the 1980 prize in physics remarked, ``It would
take a new Einstein to say what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   But one important implication stands out: Time's slippery nature
may explain why there was anything left after the Big Bang to build
the universe as we know it. Theorists have concluded that there was
a slight imbalance in the amounts of matter and antimatter created
at the birth of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   The matter and antimatter believed to have been created by the
Big Bang presumably annihilated each other quickly, leaving only a
slight excess of matter _ just enough to create today's matter
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Time, which had a role in this, is probably the deepest of all
enigmas in physics.
</P>
<P>
   At the everyday level, physicists believe that the ``arrow'' of
time points always in the direction of increasing disorder (or
``entropy''). Natural processes run down, order yields to disorder,
information disappears, and people grow old, die and decay. These
processes mark the forward passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   But a particle is not like a human being, and when physicists
speak of a particle going backward in time, they do not mean that
the particle is a tiny time machine capable of exploring the past.
</P>
<P>
   A leading particle theorist, Dr. Chris Quigg of the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., explained: ``It's
not that antiparticles in my laboratory are actually moving
backward in time. What's really meant by that is that if I think of
a particle moving from one place to another forward in time, the
physical process is the same as it would be if we imagine running
the film backward and also changing the particle into an
antiparticle.''
</P>
<P>
   Three fundamental transformations of particles are involved in
all this: the reversal of electrical charge (C), which changes
particles into antiparticles and vice versa; parity reversal (P),
the mirror reversal of every dimension in a particle (turning it
inside out, so to speak), and time reversal (T).
</P>
<P>
   Physicists feel comfortable when things can be explained by
balance sheets that show everything accounted for. They once
believed that the symmetry of parity _ the original form versus its
inside-out version _ was inviolate, meaning that physics in a
mirror world would be identical to our own.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics honored Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee
and Dr. Chen N. Ning Yang for discovering that the assumed symmetry
of parity in particles did not exist; that when short-lived
particles called K mesons (or kaons) decay, their transformations
violate parity symmetry.
</P>
<P>
   Many theorists expected that this asymmetry would be balanced
out by another of the transformations, that of charge. Fitch and
Cronin proved, however, that charge symmetry was also violated.
That meant that to keep things in balance, the symmetry of time had
to be violated to make up for the symmetry violations of charge and
parity.
</P>
<P>
   In this way the total package of charge, parity and time, or CPT
as physicists call this combination of interlocking components,
would be ``conserved,'' preserving the ideal of a universe that
fits neatly together.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe that charge, parity and time taken together
must balance out,'' Quigg said, ``then if charge and parity are a
little funny, and you divide them into the charge-parity-time
package, then time must be a little funny, to compensate. That was
predicted by theory. But the two new experiments by Fermilab and
Cern, the European accelerator group, show directly that
time-reversed symmetry is violated in just the direction and amount
predicted by theory. Now the CPT ledger book is in balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Cern and Fermilab experiments measured decay processes
of rare particles called neutral kaons and neutral antikaons, which
consist of two quarks. (Protons and neutrons, the particles that
make up the nuclei of ordinary atoms, contain three quarks.)
</P>
<P>
   In the Cern experiment, detectors measured the oscillations of
kaons into antikaons, and vice versa, as these fleeting particles
sped away from their point of origin. If time were perfectly
symmetrical, the rates at which kaons and antikaons are transformed
into each other should be precisely equal.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment showed, however, that the rate at which antikaons
(which are a form of antimatter) turn into kaons (which are normal
matter) is higher than the time-reversed process in which kaons
become antikaons.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some similar asymmetry could help to explain the presumed excess
of matter over antimatter when the universe was created.
</P>
<P>
   But what, if anything, does a particle moving backward in time
have to do with conventional time at larger scales?
</P>
<P>
   Mathematical equations governing the laws of motion,
electromagnetism and many other phenomena present no difficulty
with time reversal. Nor is time reversal inconsistent with particle
physics, which is governed by ordinary quantum mechanics, which for
all its celebrated weirdness operates within a mathematical
framework of classical three-dimensional space and time. Quantum
mechanics requires no special direction of time, either forward or
backward.
</P>
<P>
   But cosmic relationships are governed by the laws of general
relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity, and these have yet to be
brought into consonance with quantum mechanics _ the rules for the
behavior of atoms and subatomic particles. In each of these
domains, time has a somewhat different meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Relativity decrees that time is not an absolute quantity. Among
the surprising effects of relativity are that a moving clock runs
slower than a clock at rest, and that time on a mountain top runs
faster than time at sea level, because gravity is stronger at sea
level and gravity slows time down.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, some scientists have suggested, it might be possible
to travel in time using black holes, worm holes, cosmic strings or
other distortions of spacetime, but one of the problems with time
machines is the ``grandmother paradox''; if someone could go back
to the past and kill his own grandmother, a paradoxical violation
of the principle of causality would result.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of this happening is one of the main objections
to the idea of time travel, although some physicists have devised
ingenious schemes for getting around the paradox.
</P>
<P>
   But does a particle going backward in time pose the same kind of
paradox?
</P>
<P>
   Physicists think not.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the physics of ordinary experience prevents time
reversal and violations of causality, Fitch said in an interview
that ``things in the everyday world are statistical in nature, and
disorder always increases, fixing the direction of the arrow of
time. But time asymmetry for particles applies to just a handful of
individual particles, not to statistical aggregates.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J. Richard Gott III, a cosmologist at Princeton University,
envisions a possible universe that would be the opposite of ours in
every sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine living in a universe like ours, except that
charge, parity and time are all reversed,'' Gott said in an
interview. ``Instead of expanding from the Big Bang, such a
universe would be contracting toward a big crunch, with everything
growing hotter.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper in the journal Physical Review D, Gott and his
colleague, Li-Xin Li, suggested that the laws of physics ``may
allow the universe to be its own mother.''
</P>
<P>
   In an antimatter, time-reversed universe, Gott said, people
would remember what we call the future (but not what we think of as
the past), and for them, the backward flow of time would seem as
natural as does our sense of forward-flowing time.
</P>
<P>
   But to come to terms with such things physicists need to deal
with quanta _ the discrete packets of energy that define the
microscopic world: electrons, photons, quarks and so forth. Even
empty space is believed to be quantized _ subdivided into
infinitesimal cells.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, despite the best efforts of Albert Einstein and many
other theorists, no one has been able to dissect gravity or time
into their component quantum packets, if such exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still children as far as quantum gravity is concerned,''
said Dr. Daniel E. Holz, a relativity theorist at the Max Planck
Institute, Potsdam, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how to quantize time,'' Holz said. ``You can't
make heads or tails of it. When you try to quantize gravity, time
is what sinks you. When we understand what to do with time in
quantum gravity we'll have it done. Or turn it around: When we get
quantum gravity, the big revelation will be, aha! So that's the way
time works!''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John A. Wheeler of Princeton University, the cosmologist and
astrophysicist who coined the term ``black hole'' to describe
ultradense objects from which light cannot escape, believes that
despite the puzzles and paradoxes posed by time, a fundamental
simplicity underlies it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that there's something strange about time,''
Wheeler said in an interview. ``The thing that's strange is what's
going on inside time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will first understand how simple the universe is when we
recognize how strange it is.''

HURRICAN WIPES TOURISTS FROM ISLAND, BUT TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY

   ROATAN, Honduras _ The sea still shimmers electric turquoise,
and the reef fish dazzle with the colors of the rainbow, but the
winds of Hurricane Mitch seem to have blown the tourists clean from
this Caribbean island just off Honduras' northern coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to restaurants, they're dead. Cabin accommodations,
dead. Everything is dead,'' says Foster Diaz Bush, 42, owner of one
of the most popular restaurants and bars in the West End, a
tranquil jumble of small hotels, eateries and shops facing one of
Roatan Island's better reefs. ``Things were just starting to get
going when the hurricane hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Set like jewels in the second longest barrier reef in the world,
Roatan and the other Bay Islands of Honduras have long been a
favorite destination for scuba divers and adventurers. In recent
years, a real estate boom fueled by time-share condominiums and
vacation homes for well-heeled Americans had begun to transform the
islands.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the horror tales of Mitch's wrath in Honduras _ more
than 5,600 people dead, tens of thousands of others still missing
or homeless, billions of dollars in damage and the spectre of
epidemic _ the tourism business on Roatan and the country's other
Caribbean islands has, perhaps understandably, plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel and restaurant operators on Roatan, by far Honduras' most
popular Caribbean destination, report that business is off more
than 80 percent and that cancellations of reservations for
Christmas and well into the New Year are piling up.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials, hotel operators and visitors to the country
say the stampede from Honduras' tourist meccas is an overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the country was affected in one way or another, but it
wasn't destroyed,'' Kenia Lima de Zapata, the marketing director at
the Honduras Tourism Ministry, says of Mitch. ``Sure, there is a
lot of damage. Anyone with eyes in their head can see it. But it's
not like everybody is dead, like everything looks dirty, like
everything is smelly.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mitch battered wide swaths of Honduras, including several
villages on Roatan and almost all of neighboring Guanaja Island,
most of the diving resorts, Maya ruins and beaches that have
attracted tourists in the past were largely unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   The major exception is Guanaja, a small island just 20 miles
east of Roatan, which suffered heavy damage when Mitch stalled over
it for three days. Most of the island's small resort hotels were
either damaged or destroyed, and much of its jungle and pine
forests was leveled.
</P>
<P>
   The storm hit hardest in areas where few tourists ever ventured.
The high death toll in Tegucigalpa, Honduras' high-country capital,
took place mostly in poor shanty towns and residential
neighborhoods far from the tourist trail. The situation was the
same in rural central and southern Honduras, where many of the
remaining deaths occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be honest, Honduras has got some serious problems,''
says Julio Galindo, the owner of Anthony's Key, Roatan's oldest
resort, and still one of its largest, which suffered damage during
Mitch. ``But we don't have the problems here. Right now we need to
show people we are still here. We weren't wiped out.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 15 of the resort's cabins were destroyed when a surging
sea swept over the small island offshore. ``The wind didn't do
much,'' Galindo says as he walks through his resort, supervising
the repairs. ``It was the water.''
</P>
<P>
   But Galindo, who was insured for the damage his resort suffered,
has taken the storm as an opportunity to make long-needed
improvements. The destroyed cabins are being replaced, others are
being renovated. New power and water lines are being laid
throughout the resort.
</P>
<P>
   Galindo plans to reopen Feb. 1, and while as a business owner he
mourns the loss of the Christmas tourist rush, he believes the
long-term benefits will outweigh the short-term losses. He's
offering steep discounts, including 2-for-1 packages, to lure
customers back.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are ready to go,'' Galindo says of his resort's
employees. ``We're getting back to normal. We were lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the reef may have suffered damage _ some divers on
Roatan earlier this month said there were fewer fish in the reefs
than in past years, and marine biologists say a severe storm could
cause some coral heads to be broken off or otherwise damaged _ the
hurricane may have some good effects.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually warm temperatures in the sea surrounding the Bay
Islands may have contributed to the recent ``bleaching'' of coral
in the reef, which is part of the second largest such system in the
world, after Australia's Great Barrier Reef.
</P>
<P>
   Bleaching occurs when corals stressed by temperatures either
higher or lower than normal expel the algae that gives a reef its
brilliant hues. The coral turns white and dull, explains Thomas
Iliffe, a marine biologist at Texas A&AMP;M University in Galveston who
has done research on Guanaja and Roatan.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mitch, water temperatures around Roatan have dropped by 4
degrees, raising hopes that the reef will recover in the cooler
water, says Galindo, who runs a marine science institute at
Anthony's Key and whose wife, Cheryl, heads a group focused on the
reef's ecology.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras's income from tourism, at about $145 million this year,
pales in comparison to that of nearby Costa Rica, which boomed as
an eco-tourism and beach destination throughout the 1990s. Costa
Rica now earns about $900 million a year from tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But a new room tax by Honduras on hotels had created a $1
million pool of money that the Tourism Ministry was starting to use
to market the country in magazines targeted at scuba divers,
adventurers and travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials had just begun to promote Honduras
aggressively as the next big destination in eco-tourism and
Caribbean holidays, says Kenia Lima de Zapata, the marketing
director with the Honduras Tourism Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its beaches and coral reefs, Lima says, Honduras
boasts the Maya ruins at Copan, on the border with Guatemala, as
well as nine ethnic groups and more than than 100 protected natural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   San Pedro Sula, the country's industrial city that serves as the
gateway to both the Caribbean islands and Copan, suffered heavy
flooding during Mitch, but the waters have mostly receded and the
ruins were not damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Landslides on some roads leading to Copan, about 2 1/2 hours'
drive west of San Pedro Sula, forced travelers to take short
detours, Lima de Zapata says, but the ruins themselves were not
damaged by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to attract tourists now, Lima de Zapata and other
promoters clash with media reports quoting government and aid
officials claiming widespread death, destruction and disease across
the country in the wake of Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Apocalyptic reports of Mitch's legacy, which have sometimes
seemed wildly inflated, have attracted hundreds of millions of
dollars in international aid to Honduras and the rest of Central
America. They have also helped to drive away tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect people who have heard about cholera, who have
heard about malaria, to want to go on vacation here,'' says
Galindo, the resort owner.
</P>
<P>
   With most sources of Honduras' foreign income badly damaged by
Mitch, Lima de Zapata says, tourism holds out the best hope for the
country to keep earning dollars while industries such as bananas,
coffee and shrimp-farming recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourism is going to have to play a major role in the growth of
our economy,'' Lima de Zapata says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we were harmed. Yes, we need the aid,'' she says. ``But
we don't believe we should stand begging for the rest of our lives,
so we're trying to look at things positively.''

RETURN TO SENDER: YOU'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE ALREADY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As ``You've Got Mail'' unfolds, and the arrogant prince of the
city Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) gets his comeuppance _ from, of all
people, the wincingly decent Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) _ you wonder
if writer-director Nora Ephron is apologizing for the brittle, cool
cruelty that she exhibited as a magazine essayist.
</P>
<P>
   As an Esquire magazine columnist 20 years ago, Ephron's laissez
faire hostility set a standard that other writers are still trying
to match _ each piece seemed chilled to exactly 34 degrees. (I
liked her stuff, but I never wanted to meet anyone like her.)
</P>
<P>
   The bright colors and small-town friendliness that she evokes in
``You've Got Mail,'' a remake of the sublime ``The Shop Around the
Corner,'' are literally the polar opposite of her print stuff. This
is a picture-postcard Manhattan with a big lipstick kiss on its
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Touchingly, Ephron is out to show a generosity of spirit as a
filmmaker that couldn't possibly have interested her as a writer.
She'd probably have made fun of Kathleen, the owner of the
children's bookstore The Shop Around the Corner, who's so
button-eyed cute that she does everything but show up to work
wearing a Pokemon knapsack.
</P>
<P>
   A touchstone on the Upper West Side _ her mom started the shop _
Kathleen's store is threatened by the imminent appearance of Fox
Books, a books superstore that seeks to be all things to all
people. Or rather, sell all things to people.
</P>
<P>
   Joe is the only relatively sane member of the Fox family. His
dad (Dabney Coleman) and grandfather (John Randolph) have married
women younger than Joe and had kids with them. Which means that Joe
ends up baby-sitting his grade-school-age aunt and her brother, a
touch of low-key eccentricity that gives this movie a little
freshness. Otherwise, ``You've Got Mail'' makes you feel like
you're in a pet shop; it's the only other place you're likely to
hear grown people purr ``Awww''' so often.
</P>
<P>
   Ephron does better with the media types. Greg Kinnear is
Kathleen's boyfriend, a professional Luddite and New York Observer
columnist who's more in love with his own writing than he could be
with any human being. Otherwise, she falls back on the device
that's made her, as David Letterman would say, such a big deal in
show business.
</P>
<P>
   This is another romantic comedy in which the leads spend a great
deal of time communicating while not in the same room, so they end
up talking to their friends about each other a lot, just like in
``When Harry Met Sally,'' which Ephron wrote, and ``Sleepless in
Seattle,'' which she co-wrote and directed. (In ``Mail,'' those
friends include the able actors Steve Zahn, Jean Stapleton, and
stand-up comic Dave Chappelle.)
</P>
<P>
   Here, Joe and Kathleen fall in love over the Internet and via
America Online, a product placement that will do more for AOL's
stock price than will its merger with Netscape. It makes ``Mail''
feel like a first of a sort, some kinda crypto-sequel/remake
companion piece to ``Sleepless.'' You've already seen it before you
walk into the theater; it's the equivalent of swallowing pre-chewed
Milk Duds _ mushy and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks and Ryan join for their third team-up, the first being the
wildly uneven _ and mostly bad _ ``Joe Versus the Volcano.'' Ryan's
work in ``Volcano'' _ she played three roles _ was two parts a
marvel of comic intensity. She played a pale, cowed office worker
and an eccentric, exasperated heiress who rattles off every single
thought that comes to mind, and made them both distinct people.
</P>
<P>
   It was an undertaking that deserved credit for its ambition, not
to mention that she chose to display her timing and determination
in a movie that was barely worth sitting through. (She was even
better as the spurned monomaniac in the inferior ``Addicted to
Love,'' and shows backbone and style in a minor part in the
upcoming ``Hurlyburly.'')
</P>
<P>
   In ``Mail,'' Ryan is only determinedly cute. She plays a '90s
mainstream comedy cliche that strips her of all complication.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks, playing one of those true '90s movies freaks of nature _
an essentially good-guy mega-capitalist _ comes through with
pinpoint shadings. He gives Joe a bone-deep self-possession that
can register a little faster than the eye can see; his
one-upmanship slips right past his oblivious book editor girlfriend
_ Parker Posey, who always seems to have drunk one mochaccino too
many.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks has expressed some anxiety about being compared with Jimmy
Stewart, an anxiety he's apparently confronting by taking on a role
in which Stewart gave one of his best, most natural performances.
Hanks deepens his relaxed, all-American slyness here. He goes
drier, and his minimalism results in the best scene _ perhaps the
only good one _ in ``Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kathleen almost causes a riot by getting into the Cash
Only line of Zabar's with no cash, Joe sails in and rescues her
with his princely charm. Hanks, with the tiniest, swiftest
inflections, uses a winning aplomb that's so totally New York, you
almost forgive the rest of the picture, especially the last
half-hour, which is like being trapped in the Express Line behind
someone who's paying in rolls of pennies. (The aftermath, when
Kathleen tries to imitate his I Can't Believe It's Not Butter
polish, is funny, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Hanks shows he's ready for much more complex parts than he's so
far taken. He and Ryan show a spark here that makes you want to see
them in a much better, and riskier, film. With a scene like this,
Ephron even shows she's capable of directing it.

   ROATAN, Honduras _ The sea still shimmers electric turquoise,
and the reef fish dazzle with the colors of the rainbow, but the
winds of Hurricane Mitch seem to have blown the tourists clean from
this Caribbean island just off Honduras' northern coast.

EVEN SANTA HAS HIS LIMITS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By Harry Shattuck 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When last we checked in with Santa, Rudolph and the gang, they
were struggling to come to grips with holiday capacity controls on
their frequent-flyer mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new dilemma:
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean that I can't take the children's Christmas
presents aboard the airplane?'' Santa is asking the agent at the
North Pole Airport ticket counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, but we've got stricter carry-on restrictions this year,
Santa,'' the agent responds. ``Two bags maximum. One on crowded
flights. And that includes computers, cameras and briefcases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't have any of that stuff. All I've got is Furbys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shopping bags count against the limit, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So how many Furbys can I carry aboard?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many do you have?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a few hundred. They're even hard for me to find. Mrs.
Claus and I shopped all year to get just enough for the really good
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have to fit together within a 9-by-14-inch sizing bin
at the gate; otherwise, the flight attendant won't let the Furbys
board. Flights are really packed these days, Santa. We're jamming
in those seat rows. And finding room for all the carry-on bags is
delaying everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa scratches his beard in bewilderment. ``But airplanes are
empty on Christmas Eve. We're just about the only folks flying. And
we've got important deliveries all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell the truth, Santa, it's not just crowding and delays
we're worried about. Thousands of passengers get hurt each year
when bags fall from the overhead bins and plunk them on the
noggin'. We can't afford the doctor bills and lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Furbys are innocent and soft and cuddly. Even a baby would
love for one to fall in her lap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Be honest now, Santa. I'll bet you've got some video games and
CDs and dolls in your gift satchels, too. If those fell on your
head, they'd sting. And, Santa, what are we going to do about that
big garment bag you're carrying? It will never fit in the sizing
bin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do without the garment bag. That's where I stash my
spare suits in case I get all sooty climbing down chimneys. Ever
looked at my Santa suit? It's bulky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a suggestion, Santa; you may want to redesign your suit
to fit into a tote bag. The luggage makers have all but ceased
production on carry-on garment bags because they don't meet our new
rules. We're going to see lots of adjustments in luggage-making
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Rudolph has watched the exchange in pained silence.
He feels partly responsible; ever since he and the other reindeer
retired from sleigh duty, Santa has had nothing but hassles while
making deliveries by less reliable air transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a bright red light of inspiration illuminates on Rudolph's'
nose. ``We'll check with other airlines, Santa,'' he consoles.
``Someone will make room for the Furbys. We can't let the kids
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' the agent says, ``We're all in this carry-on
crackdown together. American, Southwest, Delta, United, US Airways,
TWA, Northwest. Sizes and rules vary, but not by much. Only
Continental is taking a different approach; they're building larger
overhead storage bins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it; we'll fly Continental!'' Santa and Rudolph say in
unison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't do, Santa,'' Agent Scrooge shakes his head. ``You've not
only got nonrefundable tickets, you've bought them over the
Internet through our e-mail program. You've got to use them tonight
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa bows his head in resignation. ``OK, we have no choice.
We'll ship the Furbys in the luggage compartment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, Santa, we may have a problem there, too. We've got these
questions we're required to ask you; understand, it's nothing
personal, but there are some crazy people out there. Did you do all
the packing yourself? Has anyone else had access to your luggage?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no. And yes. The elves always help me pack. I've got
elves everywhere. Moms. Dads. Uncles. Aunts. Grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'll have to inspect all your luggage. And we'll have to
unwrap the presents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there nothing I can do?'' Santa makes one last plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one exception to the carry-on rule, Santa. We permit
additional articles if they are for medical necessity: canes,
crutches, walkers, breathing devices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Furbys are a medical necessity,'' Santa argues. ``A lot of
really nice kids are going to be sick if they don't find them under
the tree tomorrow morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell you what, Santa _ it is Christmas. I've got kids, too.
We'll give the Furbys a medical exemption. They can board.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the agent checks his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, Santa, don't tell anyone. And don't you and Rudolph and
the Furbys expect a meal. We can't afford to serve steak on these
flights anymore. All you'll get are milk and cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time tonight, Santa smiles. Rudolph's nose glows.
Milk and cookies! ``Maybe there is hope for these airlines after
all,'' Santa says.
</P>
<P>
   Happy holidays.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Think back to your most enjoyable vacation in a foreign land.
Now consider what made the trip so special. Was it the exotic food?
The sightseeing? The accommodations? The shopping?
</P>
<P>
   Or was it the exciting new culture you experienced through
meeting and greeting the locals?
</P>
<P>
   If you responded affirmatively to the last question, then you've
been lucky enough to understand one of the most extraordinary
aspects of travel: the chance to learn about the lives and customs
of foreign people from the people themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One travel company that offers just that kind of opportunity is
Servas, a global organization with members in more than 130
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Servas is organized to promote world peace by connecting
travelers and foreign hosts to share their ideas, interests and
lives. It's for those who want to get beyond the Eiffel Tower and
the Louvre, and see a country through the eyes of its people,''
says Joyce Elson Moore, a mature traveler from Inverness, Fla., who
travels extensively through Servas' programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a 60-plus woman traveling alone on my first trip to Europe,
I landed in Paris and caught the TGV (france's high-speed train) to
Arras,'' Moore recalls. Moore was a bit overwhelmed, even though
she knew she would be meeting her first Servas host very shortly.
``I was armed with only a few French phrases and the determination
to see France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed at a hotel my first two nights, then visited my first
Servas hosts who lived five minutes from the Arras train station.
They shared their home with me for two days, guiding me through the
bustling Saturday market in Arras, taking me to the poignant Vimy
Ridge and introducing me to coffee from a bowl, `the French way.'
We shared wine and meals, politics and problems. It was a notable
beginning for my two-week trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore wanted to share with readers of this column some anecdotes
from her most recent Servas adventure. She writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Another Servas host allowed me to be a part of her busy family
life. Two dogs, a younger sister, a boyfriend and her mother made
up the family unit. Her younger sister asked me to come to her
English class at school, but unfortunately time would not permit
it. I walked to the train station with her mother and rode into
Paris. She spoke no English and I spoke very little French, but we
communicated like two old friends during the ride. Before she left
the train _ a few stops before me _ she kissed me in that endearing
French show of friendship: on both cheeks. Her daughter, my host,
wants to come to the United States, and I hope she does. She will
always be welcome at my home.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Moore's hosts was a lovely lady who, as a young Jewish
girl living in occupied France, had worn the obligatory yellow star
to elementary school. Moore was fascinated and saddened by the
woman's candid stories about living in France during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``She also asked me to see her perform in a Renaissance concert
in a nearby cathedral. Because she was part of the group, I was
invited into the choir room where later, to my surprise, the men
and women undressed down to their underwear to change from street
clothes into their Renaissance costumes. They were completely
unaware of my astonishment. After the concert, I was delighted to
be included in an midnight escapade with these 30 French singers to
a Chinese restaurant for a post-concert celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Servas members can be travelers, hosts or both. A Servas member
can request host lists for up to five countries. These lists are
updated annually and include names and addresses, family status,
professions, interests and days of prior notice required.
</P>
<P>
   Although some hosts require no advance warning, it is helpful to
the host and traveler to write ahead if possible.
</P>
<P>
   You pay your own expenses through Servas. No money can exchange
hands between hosts and travelers for lodging or anything else.
There is only an exchange of ideas and mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want an air-conditioned shuttle to your modern
Americanized hotel, and a porter to carry your bags, Servas may not
be for you,'' Moore warns. ``Servas travelers frequently have to
manage their own luggage and sleep in accommodations very different
than those to which they are accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you are interested in understanding communities on a
deeper level, meeting interesting people and learning about their
culture and traditions, join Servas.''
</P>
<P>

Suite 407, New York, N.Y. 10038. You can also call (212) 267-0252;

<P>
   The Big Apple can demolish a budget faster than the city can
level an old building in Times Square. With hotel occupancy running
more than 84 percent much of the year, New York City room rates now
average $200 a night. That's before paying restaurant prices that
can give plenty of indigestion, and buying $80 tickets to a
Broadway hit like ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to come in January. Sure, it can be cold. But
the Christmas hordes are gone, the city is catching its collective
breath and the cultural and entertainment life for which New York
is justly celebrated is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Museums are uncrowded, Broadway tickets are available and it's
possible to find a hotel room that won't break the bank.
</P>
<P>
   January also heralds Tax-Free Week, from Jan. 17 to 24, when
purchases of clothes, shoes and belts less than $500 are exempt
from New York City's brutal 8 1/4 percent sales tax. (That makes
January sales all the more tempting.)
</P>
<P>
   For hotels, start with hotel brokers like Quikbook (381 Park
Avenue South, New York, N.Y. 10016; 800-789-9887; www.quikbook.com)
and Express Reservations (3825 Iris Ave., Boulder, Colo. 80301;
800-356-1123; www.express-res.com). Both companies offer a select
range of popular hotels at discounts of 20 percent to 60 percent
off the published price.
</P>
<P>
   But it still pays to call hotels directly to compare prices. The
following rates are per night, based on double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Penny-pinchers should start by looking at the Malibu Hotel (2688
Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10025; 800-647-2227), at West 103rd St.
and Broadway on Manhattan's Upper West Side. It may not be the most
centrally located property in the city, but at $69 per night for a
double it's surely one of the best bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-priced hotels, such as the Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel (687
Lexington Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022; 212-355-0100 or
800-367-7701), are offering an executive guest room for $189 per
night and a one-bedroom suite for $219 during January, which the
hotel claims is a savings of more than $100 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Inter-Continental New York (111 East 48th St., New
York, N.Y. 10017; 800-327-0200) has a ``Half-Off New York''
package. Room rates begin at $189 per night or $289 for suites for
guests who book a weekend stay.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, every hotel purchase _ from food and beverage to
parking, phone calls and in-room movies _ are available at 50
percent off. The hotel is throwing in 500 frequent-flier miles per
stay with one of their partners.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who don't want to participate in the program, room
rates begin at $169 per night.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan East Suite Hotels (800-ME-SUITE), the city's largest
all-suite hotel group, has January rates that start at $184 for a
studio suite and $204 for a one-bedroom suite. Among the hotels
participating are the Shelburne Murray Hill (303 Lexington Ave.,
New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-689-5200).
</P>
<P>
   New York's newest boutique hotel, The Avalon (16 East 32 St.,
New York, N.Y. 10016; 888-HI-AVALON) opened in April in a former
office building after a $20 million renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The human-size body pillows that adorn each bed have become the
hotel's signature. In January, chef Larry Forgione, a founding
father of the new American cuisine, will open the Larry Forgione's
Coach House restaurant in the hotel. The hotel's ``Suite Winter''
special starts at $169 per night, including continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   January offers discounts even for those who can afford the best.
Take the Peninsula New York (700 Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y. 10019;
800-262-9467), which has just reopened after extensive remodeling.
The 23-story luxury hotel in Midtown has a ``Weekend No Frills''
rate of $370 per night. That's hardly a steal, but it's a far cry
from the normal rate of $535 per night for such luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Le Parker Meridiens (118 W. 57 St., New York, N.Y. 10019;
212-245-5000) ``Holiday Recovery Package'' offers the ultimate New
York indulgence, a guaranteed room with a panoramic view of Central
Park. It comes with breakfast at Norma's, the hotel's acclaimed new
restaurant that serves breakfast day and night, as well as a
massage for two. The price is $365 per room, per night. Extra
nights are $255 per room and include breakfast but not a massage.
</P>
<P>
   As for entertainment in January, jazz is synonymous with New
York and January marks ``Blue Note Takes N.Y.,'' a month-long
celebration of the 60th anniversary of the celebrated Blue Note
jazz label.
</P>
<P>
   Artists such as Max Roach, Lena Horne, Billy Higgins and Ron
Carter are scheduled to appear at such clubs as The Jazz Standard
(116 East 27th St., New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-576-2232), New York's
newest jazz haunt.
</P>
<P>
   Food is usually the least compelling reason to visit a jazz
club, but this club's restaurant, 27 Standard, has been singled out
by the city's food critics for it inventive cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   As for Broadway, Off-Broadway and Lincoln Center performances,
the TKTS (212-768-1818) booth in Times Square offers half-price
tickets to the same-day performances of many shows _ but accepts
cash only.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately, the Broadway Ticket Center, 212-302-4111, in the
new Times Square Visitors Center on Broadway at W. 47th Street
sells same-day and advance performance full-price tickets to
Broadway shows.

<P>
   Here are suggestions on ways to stretch a budget for your next
vacation:
</P>
<P>
   _ 1. Free brochures. Tourism offices in all 50 states, most
foreign countries and major cities worldwide publish brochures
crammed with information that can help you save money during a
visit. This literature usually costs nothing and can be requested
in advance of a trip.
</P>
<P>
   Some brochures include coupons that provide discounts or free
admissions; San Antonio's seasonal S.A.V.E. program, for instance,
offers significant savings at hotels, restaurants and varied
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Most tourism bureaus have toll-free numbers; access
www.mbnet.mb.ca/lucas/travel/tourism-offices.html on the Internet
for a list of government tourism offices, convention and visitors
bureaus and other agencies. Access www.wwb.com to learn how to
request more than 10,000 brochures at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   _ 2. Online promotions. Travelers of all ages are learning to
use the Internet for two main reasons: (1) the vast information
available online and (2) bargains available from no other source.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites sponsored by several airlines inform about e-mail
services that tout exclusive weekend getaway packages with
discounted air and lodging; Houston-based Continental
(www.flycontinental.com) designates last-minute cut-rate trips
every weekend from Bush Intercontinental Airport; last weekend you
could have traveled round-trip from Houston to San Diego for $169,
Kansas City for $139 or New Orleans for $79. Southwest also offers
periodic Internet specials; access www.iflyswa.com.
</P>
<P>
   For the most comprehensive listings of discounted airline fares,
access these sites: www.bestfares.com and www.webflyer.com.
</P>
<P>
   Several online booking services offer packages or links to
airline, hotel and destination specials; some will send e-mail
alerts about bargains on specific routes. Among the largest sites:
www.travelocity.com; www.expedia.com; www.thetrip.com;
www.travelweb.com; www.itn.com; www.biztravel.com; and
www.previewtravel.com.
</P>
<P>
   You can even name your price for a specified airline trip or
hotel stay via www.priceline.com. But study the guidelines
carefully and make certain you don't submit a bid for a higher
amount than you would pay via more traditional means.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of other travel-related Web sites _
sponsored by tourism bureaus, hotels, museums, theme parks, you
name it _ and you never know when you may come upon a bargain; we
were planning a stop at a New Braunfels cafe recently and
discovered an Internet-only coupon valid for 50 percent off an
entree.
</P>
<P>
   _ 3. Book early. It's not a cardinal rule anymore, but planning
and purchasing in advance remains the safest way to get low prices
on airlines, cruises and lodging.
</P>
<P>
   Because of better inventory control, airlines now occasionally
release unsold seats at low prices as the departure date nears. But
that's the exception; as frequent travelers know, most flights now
depart at or near capacity _ and those who pay the least usually
satisfy 14-day or seven-day advance-purchase requirements (earlier
for international travel). Airlines also offer periodic sales that
require almost immediate purchases even if travel is permitted
weeks or months into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines, too, offer significant discounts for
``early-bird'' bookings _ up to six months in advance. And if you
covet that $49 supersaver weekend rate at a chain hotel, don't dare
wait until the day before departure.
</P>
<P>
   _ 4. Off-season travel. Whatever your destination, recognize _
and if you're on a tight budget, avoid _ its busiest season.
Airline tickets, car rentals, train tickets and lodging likely will
be priced accordingly. Europe is a bargain in winter; the best
Caribbean deals occur in summer. Expect to pay double the regular
rates in New Orleans during Mardi Gras, but visit in August and
you'll find significant discounts. Low or shoulder season at some
destinations may not provide the ideal weather conditions, but
you'll avoid the crowds and pay substantially less.
</P>
<P>
   5 . Frequent-traveler programs. Many people consider these a
waste of time if they don't travel often. But more frequent-flyer
miles are earned on the ground than in the air. With careful
planning and the right credit card, you can accumulate miles while
buying groceries, dining out, making telephone calls, even paying
the home mortgage. And those miles can lead to a free trip. An
excellent source to learn ways to earn more miles is
www.webflyer.com. Randy Petersen, who operates this site, also
publishes ``The Official Frequent Flyer Guidebook''; its sixth
edition is due in January and costs $14.99. Call 800-209-2870 for
information.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every airline and hotel chain offers a credit card whose
benefits include mileage-earning opportunities. Even better are the
American Express Membership Rewards (call 800-297-3276) and Diners
Club Rewards (800-234-6377) programs, because they allow you to
accumulate points and transfer them to any number of
frequent-traveler programs.
</P>
<P>
   Look for partnerships among airlines and hotels. Say you're a
Continental OnePass member, but the Houston-based airline doesn't
fly to your destination; you can earn OnePass miles on more than a
dozen other carriers. Continental frequent flyers also earn credit
by utilizing any of 15 hotel chains and six rental-car firms.
</P>
<P>
   Don't automatically toss all those frequent-traveler
newsletters. True, much of what's written is propaganda, but
members-only discounts are often included.
</P>
<P>
   _ 6. Utilize a travel agent. The Internet is a wonderful tool
for information. But a local travel agent is still the
bargain-hunter's best friend in coordinating a vacation to fit
individual objectives and budgets. Keep in mind that a good travel
agent has access to the Internet, too, and knows how to use it for
your benefit. Unlike many Web sites, whose main purpose is to
promote and sell a specific service, the travel agent's main
responsibility is you. The value of comparison-shopping on your
behalf can't be overstated.
</P>
<P>
   Most travel agents now charge a small fee for their services.
But compare to the time and money you'd spend putting a trip
together. Just make certain the travel agent understands what you
want from a vacation and how much you can spend. If one agent
doesn't appreciate your budgetary requirements, find another who
does.
</P>
<P>
   _ 7. Advertised specials. Vegas for less! Maximum cruise value!
Guaranteed lowest price! Newspaper travel sections and magazines
are filled with advertisements touting the newest ``bargain of a
lifetime.'' It's always important to read the fine print and to
learn some background about the company making an offer, but a
savvy and cautious traveler can find a real deal. By evaluating a
variety of promotions and comparing prices, you can get a good idea
of which destinations or cruises are offering the best values. Ask
firm questions to find out exactly what you are getting for your
investment. And remember: If it sounds too good to be true, it
usually is.
</P>
<P>
   _ 8. Out-of-town publications. Target your reading just as
hotels, car-rental agencies and popular attractions target their
advertisements. Example: If you are planning a trip to New York,
consider buying a newspaper published in Boston or Washington, D.C.
Why? Because the best advertised discounts often are aimed at
travelers in neighboring cities.
</P>
<P>
   It's often worthwhile, too, to buy a newspaper published at your
destination and check it for planning and money-saving ideas. Some
bookstores, newsstands and public libraries in the Houston area
carry newspapers from other large cities.
</P>
<P>
   _ 9. Air-fare sales. Several times each year _ usually before
slow travel periods _ airlines advertise fare sales that cover
multiple destinations. And it's all but guaranteed that if one
airline reveals a sale, rival carriers will match the prices on
competing routes. Read details carefully when these announcements
appear: Often you are given only a short time _ maybe 10 days _ to
purchase tickets, but those tickets may be valid for months;
especially inviting are late-winter ``sales'' to Europe that allow
travel into early spring, when the weather may be ideal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ 10. Maintain flexibility. This is important in any aspect of
planning a trip, but especially in securing the lowest air fares.
The traveler who calls an airline reservations number and asks,
``What's the best price on Flight 299 from Houston to Chicago at
noon?'' will get only a fraction of the information necessary to
find the best deal. The same airline may offer a lower fare on
Flight 399 at 3 p.m. or Flight 499 at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing is no longer standard; airlines are constantly studying
the probable load factors of each departure and adjusting fares
several times daily in an effort to fill the maximum number of
seats. Be persistent in asking about all flights on your preferred
travel date; better yet, ask a travel agent to use a ``bargain
finder'' tool that surveys flights to your destination by each
carrier. If you don't like the answer, check again the next day;
you'll probably find a different set of fares.
</P>
<P>
   Be flexible, too, in your choice of airports. If the fare from
Houston to Washington, D.C., is too steep for your budget, ask
about connections to Baltimore. Consider Oakland instead of San
Francisco, Fort Lauderdale instead of Miami. Or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   _ 11. Consolidators and couriers. These companies are
essentially wholesalers that distribute discounted tickets airlines
can't sell for full value. They are best used for international
flights. Make certain any consolidator you use is reputable and pay
via credit card; most travel agents will book your trip through a
consolidator but only if you ask. A good source for information is
``Consolidators: Air Travel's Bargain Basement'' (The Intrepid
Traveler, $7.95) by Kelly Monaghan.
</P>
<P>
   Many readers call to inquire about courier travel (flying at
little or no cost while accompanying a package or document). The
era of free courier tickets is all but over, and few if any
departures are from Houston. Travelers desiring information can
check out ``The Courier Air Travel Handbook'' (Perpetual Press,
$9.95) by Mark I. Field. Other sources: Worldwide Courier
Association (800-780-4359; www.wallstech.com); International
Association of Air Travel Couriers (561-582-8320; www.courier.org)
and Air Courier Association (800-282-1202; www.courier.to)
</P>
<P>
   _ 12.  &UR; Seniors discounts. &LR;  Most airlines offer travelers 62 and
older a 10 percent discount on any published fare. Houston-based
Continental, Delta, United and American also sponsor clubs through
which seniors pay an established fee, then get higher discounts
and/or the opportunity to purchase sharply reduced tickets for
travel within specific zones.
</P>
<P>
   Major carriers also sell coupon books that can provide discounts
for senior citizens, depending on the route traveled; books of four
one-way coupons cost from $540 to $600. Some airlines allow seniors
to take along a companion of any age. Continental sells four-coupon
books for $579, eight-coupon books for $1,079. These cover the
lower 48 states, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean; trips to Hawaii
and Alaska require two coupons each direction. Make certain before
using a coupon that a lower published fare isn't available.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)
qualify for discounts at many hotels and attractions. Despite the
name, retirement isn't a criteria: Chances are you will (or did)
receive overtures from AARP around age 50; or call 800-424-3410.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the destination, seniors should ask about discounts;
restaurants, museums, parks and other attractions frequently offer
bargain prices. A good source is ``The Mature Traveler's Book of
Deals'' (GEM Publishing, $7.95; write to P.O. Box 50400, Reno, Nev.
89513-0400.
</P>
<P>
   Others who fit specific categories can reap benefits, too. Most
airlines offer discounts to active military personnel, especially
valuable for short-notice leave. Bereavement fares are available to
individuals making unexpected trips because of a death in the
family (but airlines can be strict in requiring documentation).
Consult individual carriers about their programs and rules.
</P>
<P>
   _ 13. Student and teacher travel. Several airlines offer fare
discounts and/or fixed-price coupons available to full-time
students. Ages vary. Youth passes purchased prior to a trip can
provide significant discounts on European train travel; call
800-438-7245. For a small fee, the nonprofit International Student
Travel Confederation offers student and teacher identity cards
valid for discounts worldwide; its Web site (www.istc.org) includes
destination-by-destination details and addresses of offices. The
nonprofit Council on Standards for International Educational Travel
(www. csiet.org) can provide information on 64 youth travel and
exchange organizations. Numerous other organizations specialize in
student and/or teacher travel, including teacher education programs
abroad; check with campus advisers or browse the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ 14. Auto clubs. Sometimes it's worth spending money to save in
the long run. Depending on the scope of an individual's travel,
membership in AAA or another auto club can prove beneficial even if
your car never breaks down on the road. AAA members pay no extra
charge for travelers checks (including those issued in some foreign
currencies); get free maps, tour brochures (identifying lodgings
and attractions) and trip planning advice; and receive discounts at
many hotels (though you need to ask when making reservations).
</P>
<P>
   _ 15. Free point-to-point maps. Save money on gasoline _ and
avoid headaches _ by knowing the quickest way to reach your driving
destination. Several online services specialize in mapping almost
any route you choose within the United States _ even if the trip is
from your home in Sugar Land to see Grandma in The Woodlands. Among
the best: www.maps.com and www.mapquest.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ 16. Group tours. These aren't suited to every traveler, but
package tours offer the security of knowing that all (or most)
major costs of your vacation are included in one basic price.
Independent travelers can be amazed how quickly ``incidental''
charges _ meals, tips, entrance fees, subway tickets, etc. _ mount
into hundreds of dollars and destroy a budget. Even with group
tours, find out in advance what the package includes. A $700 tour
without lunches and dinners hardly represents a savings over an
$800 tour that includes all meals. Also take time to check on the
reputation of the tour firm; most (but not all) tour operators
belong to either the National Tour Association (800-682-8886) or
U.S. Tour Operators Association (212-599-6599).
</P>
<P>
   _ 17. Tour group leaders. If you can assemble a group of 12 or
more (sometimes less) fellow travelers, you may qualify for a free
trip. A travel agent may help with arrangements once you guarantee
a certain number of participants. Or contact tour companies. One
caution: The role of group leader doesn't come without
responsibilities; don't get involved unless you enjoy working with
others and have the knack (and patience) to deal with problems that
arise.
</P>
<P>
   _ 18. Volunteering and teaching. Several organizations sponsor
programs through which individuals get to see the world at little
or no cost in exchange for volunteering their services part-time.
Among the best are Global Volunteers (800-487-1074) and Habitat for
Humanity (800-422-4828); a good source for learning about these and
other programs is ``You Can Travel Free'' (Pelican, $15.95) by
Robert Wm. Kirk. That book also takes a comprehensive look at
teaching abroad. Also recommended is ``Volunteer Vacations''
(Chicago Review Press; $13.95) by Bill McMilian.
</P>
<P>
   _ 19. ``Tourism offices.'' Upon arrival at a destination, the
first stop for a traveler on a budget should be a local tourist
office. Representatives there know about any low-cost hotel
availability and about discounts on tours and attractions. Most
?Vmstribute free brochures.
</P>
<P>
   _ 20. Hotel packages. Modern-day hotels and resorts offer more
than a room; they tout fitness centers, golf courses (or course
privileges), tennis courts, spas, children's centers, activities
programs and other perks. If you aren't careful, you'll pay more
for the

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 
(Undated): rental dollar.
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ 38. Avoid daily rental rates. A customer is quoted a $50 daily
car rental rate and a $200 weekly rate. He only needs the
automobile five days, not seven. Which does he choose? It's a
no-brainer. But you don't always know all the options unless you
ask. Rental car firms have myriad rates; inquire about discounts
for AAA, AARP and frequent-flyer program members and active
military personnel. Ask about special promotions. Persistence can
lead to a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   _ 39. Beware extra charges. Car rental clerks can dazzle you _
even scare you _ with suggestions about various insurance coverages
and fuel options. ``You pay only $10 extra for full security,'' the
employee will say, not bothering to add that the $10 is per day,
not for the full rental. It's essential to have sufficient
insurance, but your policy at home or work _ or the credit card you
use for payment _ may cover you fully. Know what you need, and
don't spend a penny more. And listen carefully when those fuel
plans are explained; you don't want to pay in advance for a full
tank if you plan to drive only 75 miles.
</P>
<P>
   _ 40. Avoid cruise brochure prices. These are akin to sticker
prices placed on new automobiles. Or to hotel rack rates. Nobody
should pay them. Any travel agent can offer a much better deal. Or
check newspaper advertisements in this and other travel sections
for bargains.
</P>
<P>
   _ 41. Repeater discounts. Cruise lines keep a careful record of
past passengers, and most invite you to join a repeaters club at no
charge; some enroll you automatically. As a repeater, you get
mailings about discounted sailings; some lines offer an automatic
savings.
</P>
<P>
   _ 42. Repositioning cruises. Many ships spend part of the year
in one part of the world (Europe perhaps) and another elsewhere
(the Caribbean). Voyages that connect these home areas usually have
a minimum number of port calls and quite a few sea days; these
repositioning cruises appeal greatly to veteran seafarers but not
to the mainstream, thus are usually offered for bargain prices.
This is a chance to sail on a top-quality ship at a price way below
normal. A travel agent can provide details.
</P>
<P>
   _ 43. Competitive itineraries. Fifteen years ago, cruises to
Alaska were priced beyond the means of most travelers; now, many
sailings cost little more than a Caribbean cruise. Why? Because
instead of three or four ships sailing in Alaskan waters, more than
30 call the area home in summer. Each tries to lure passengers by
offering the lowest price. Many veteran cruisers look for
one-of-a-kind itineraries, but they'll likely pay more. The best
bargains occur when ships vie for your business.
</P>
<P>
   _ 44. Last-minute specials. Yes, we advocate booking early, and
cruise lines offer advance-purchase savings on almost every
itinerary. But when specific sailings don't sell out as the
departure date nears, the line would rather sell a cabin at a
heavily discounted price _ even lower than the ``early bird rate''
_ than leave it empty. This benefits a flexible traveler who can
leave home in a hurry. Most travel agents know or can find out
about these bargains. Some companies specialize in last-minute
cruises. Among them: Houston-based Vacations to Go; call
713-974-2121.
</P>
<P>
   _ 45. Shore excursions. Prior to a cruise or as soon as you
board, a cruise line will give you a handsome brochure detailing
dozens of shore excursions. Most are efficiently operated and
convenient. Also expensive. These are best suited to single
travelers and couples; three or more passengers should consider
combining assets to hire an English-speaking guide to customize
sightseeing. Taxis and tour guides meet ships at almost every port
and are accustomed to negotiating prices _ per vehicle, not per
person. And you have more of a say in where you go and when you
stop.
</P>
<P>
   _ 46. Get documents early. The National Passport Agency can send
you a passport on short notice, but only for an extra fee. Be aware
when yours expires, and renew early. Don't tarry with visas and
other documents either, or you'll likely pay more for expedited
service.
</P>
<P>
   _ 47. Pack necessities. Making a packing checklist may seem
fundamental, but it's amazing how many frequent travelers forget
film, sunscreen or medications. At a resort destination or in a
foreign country, you'll pay a hefty price for items you buy at
Kmart or Target in your hometown.
</P>
<P>
   _ 48. Get VAT Refunds. Travelers to Europe, Canada and many
other international destinations pay a Value Added Tax on certain
purchases, sometimes including lodging and car rentals. This VAT
can represent up to 25 percent of your bill, but it's refundable _
but only if you take the time to complete the required paperwork.
In most instances, it's worth the effort; ask in stores or at your
hotel for the proper forms.
</P>
<P>
   _ 49. Consumer publications. We've cited several sources for
cost-saving information in this report. Bookstores and libraries
stock other helpful publications. These are books and periodicals
we find especially valuable:

(UNDATED): greens fees. _ 21. Free breakfasts. Budget motels and all-suite properties have
lured so many travelers by including free breakfasts with their
standard rate that many traditional full-service hotels now offer
this incentive; sometimes you have to ask. Breakfasts at some
European hotels (usually included in the rate) are so filling that
it's easy to skip lunch _ yet another savings.
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ 22. Know occupancy trends. You can save on lodging just by
understanding the establishment's priority. Hotels geared toward
business travelers offer discounts on weekends. At resorts and
bed-and-breakfasts, which cater more to vacationers, the best rates
are Sundays through Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   _ 23. Negotiate at hotels. When you call a hotel reservations
number and ask for a room rate, the employee almost always will
quote the highest published rate. Don't accept it; inquire about
discounts. Rarely are specials volunteered. Some cost-conscious
travelers forego reservations, arrive in early evening and bargain
with desk clerks; desk personnel often are given considerable
leeway in ``adjusting'' set rates, especially if it appears rooms
may go empty that night.
</P>
<P>
   _ 24. Promotional specials. Hotels in Europe and at other
international destinations occasionally try to lure Americans with
special promotions, especially during low-tourism seasons. Example:
For the fourth consecutive year, Thistle Hotels in Great Britain is
offering a ``pound for dollars'' promotion through April 11;
whatever the standard rate in British pounds, you pay that figure
in U.S. dollars, in effect a 40 percent savings. Because of the
Asian financial crisis, hotels in that part of the world are
offering huge discounts. A travel agent can inform about these and
other bargains.
</P>
<P>
   _ 25. Half-price programs. For a set fee averaging about $50,
clubs or directories promote ``half-price'' rates (or thereabouts)
at thousands of lodgings, including high-quality chain hotels. (One
caution: Half-price is usually off the highest published rate; if
that rate is $150 and an advertised special is $69 ... well, you
figure the math.) That said, these programs can lead to significant
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the largest companies: Entertainment Publications
(800-445-4137), Encore (800-444-9800), Privilege Card International
(800-236-9732), International Travel Card (800-987-6216), America
at 50 Percent Discount (800-248-2783) and Quest (800-638-9819).
</P>
<P>
   Also offering discounts in large cities is Hotel Reservations
Network, a no-fee consolidator; call 800-964-6835 or access
www.hoteldiscount.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ 26. Home exchanges. Many travelers can't imagine leaving their
home in the care of strangers, but for extended trips home
exchanges can result in substantial savings. And since you'll be
living in the home vacated by those temporarily inhabiting your
property, ample incentive exists for everyone to exercise care.
Some travelers work out exchanges on their own, through
advertisements or direct communications; most pay an annual fee
($40 to $80) to receive a directory of prospective home-swappers.
Among companies recommended by Houston Chronicle Budget Travel
columnist Arthur Frommer: Homelink (800-638-3841; www.swapnow.com);
Intervac U.S. (800-756-4663); Teacher Swap (516-244-2845); Trading
Homes International (800-877-8723; www.trading-homes.com); and
International Home Exchange Network (www.ihen.com). One book to
consider is ``Home Exchange Vacationing'' (Rutledge Hill, $14.95)
by Bill and Mary Barbour.
</P>
<P>
   _ 27. Villa rentals. Planning a reunion with former college
buddies in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico? A three-generation family
gathering in Italy? Why pay $150 per night for several rooms when
you can rent an entire house _ often with housekeepers and a chef _
for considerably less. Villas are available primarily in popular
tourist destinations other than large cities; ask tourism bureaus
for listings and photographs. A travel agent can provide guidance,
too.
</P>
<P>
   _ 28. Condominiums. So you relish the prospect of a one-week
vacation on the beach in Maui? The full-service resort charges $200
per night; the condominium next door charges $700 per week and
includes a kitchen. ``But I don't want to cook on vacation,'' you
say. Don't. Just pay the cheaper rate at the condo and dine at the
hotel. Two- and three-bedroom condominiums are especially practical
for families on a budget. The highest savings are at resort areas
where hotels charge a high tariff. Consult a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   _ 29. Hostels and dormitories. Hostels were originally designed
for youths who embrace low-cost dormitory-style living quarters and
shared bathrooms as a means to save on lodging. Now travelers of
all ages are welcomed and hostels are located worldwide; good
sources for finding them are Hostelling International (call
202-783-6161; access www.hiayh.org on the Internet); the Internet
Guide to Hostelling (www.hostels.com); and ``Hostels USA: The Only
Comprehensive, Unofficial, Opinionated Guide'' (Globe Pequot,
$14.95) by Evan Halper and Paul Karr.
</P>
<P>
   _ 30. Discount dining programs. Numerous programs feature
directories of restaurants where savings are available. Most
frequent-flyer programs now feature dining programs. The Houston
Chronicle Gusto Card, free to all subscribers, focuses primarily on
the Houston area but also provides discounts at some restaurants
elsewhere in Texas. Large programs operated nationwide include
Entertainment Publications (800-445-4137), Transmedia
(800-422-5090), Dinner On Us (800-346-3241) and Dining la Card
(800-253-5379).
</P>
<P>
   _ 31. Fixed-price meals. These are especially practical at
European restaurants. They are usually posted in windows or
attached to standard menus and offer three or four courses at
substantial savings.
</P>
<P>
   _ 32. Picnic lunches. These appeal not only to cost-conscious
travelers but to romantics everywhere. Visit a grocery, bakery
and/or (especially in Europe) a meat market, then find an idyllic
setting. Some hotels will prepare picnic baskets, but you run the
risk of spending more on them than you would at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   _ 33. Rail, air and bus passes. European travelers reap
considerable savings by purchasing passes from Rail Europe prior to
a trip. Dozens of options are available covering specified days and
countries; some can be combined with car rentals. Complete vacation
packages also are available. Call 800-438-7245; access
www.raileurope.com on the Internet. The Europe Flight Pass provides
$90 one-way fares for intra-European flights operated by 13
airlines to 62 cities in 20 countries; call 888-387-2479 or access
www.europeflightpass.com. Amtrak offers special zone fares and
vacation packages; call 800-523-8720 or 800-321-8684 or access
www.amtrak.com. Greyhound offers several variations of its
Ameripass for multiple use on buses and sells other discount
packages; call 800-231-2222 or access www.greyhound.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ 34. Public transportation. When vacationing in large cities,
ask about multiuse or multiday passes before buying single-ride
subway or bus tickets. If you plan extensive intra-city travel,
these passes can save money; evaluate options and read the fine
print. Ask if passes are valid for all forms of public
transportation; in London, for instance, the same pass covers buses
and underground trains. Even without passes, public transportation
is usually a cheaper alternative than taxis or car rentals.
</P>
<P>
   _ 35. Multiple-attraction passes. Usually available through
tourist offices, these passes are ideal for travelers who plan
extensive sightseeing. A museum pass in Paris is valid at more than
70 museums and monuments. City cards sold in Copenhagen and
Stockholm include free admission to many attractions and use of
public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   _ 36. Hop-on, hop-off tours. Popular in London, Paris and other
world capitals, these tours allow you to pay one price, then board
and re-board buses or trolleys at designated stops (usually near
major landmarks) as often as you wish during a day. Plan your
itinerary carefully, and you get maximum value for your investment.
</P>
<P>
   _ 37. Off-airport car rentals. Yes, those rental counters
adjacent to baggage claim carousels are convenient, but companies
pay top dollar to rent the space, and guess where that expense is
passed along? To the consumer. Smaller companies situated down the
road usually can offer lower rates. And free shuttles make access
easy. One caution: Make sure exactly what you are getting for your
rental dollar.

HOW THE BARD BOUNCED BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; When ``Shakespeare in Love'' opens, all is not
well in Will's world.
</P>
<P>
   The Bard, suffering from a paralyzing bout of writer's block and
pressured by financiers and theater owners, just can't seem to work
up much enthusiasm for his latest play, ``Romeo and Ethel, the
Pirate's Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The witty, fast-paced ``Shakespeare in Love,'' nominated for six
Golden Globes last week, portrays the young Shakespeare (Joseph
Fiennes) as a largely unknown playwright without inspiration or
material who falls for a woman who draws him into a dramatic _ and
very funny _ tale of star-crossed love.
</P>
<P>
   Much like a play by the Bard, the film, which goes into wide
release Christmas Day, is a story of mistaken identities, mixed
messages and ill-gotten desires in which Will finds his voice
through a love affair with Lady Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow),
a woman who is Shakespeare's mental match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viola is very sensory, very passionate, very open, and it's
not until the second half of the film that she becomes really aware
of herself and how life can be solemn and serious,'' Paltrow said.
``At the beginning, everything is enchanted for her _ her life is a
fairy tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the real William Shakespeare's life and how he
created his plays are mostly a mystery. The fictional plot of
``Shakespeare in Love'' falls between the few solid facts we know
about the Bard. Mostly the film, which was co-written by Tom
Stoppard, seeks to answer how Shakespeare made the artistic leap
between his early, flawed plays and his romantic masterwork,
``Romeo and Juliet,'' first performed in 1594.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can argue that `Romeo and Juliet' is the first time
Shakespeare really becomes Shakespeare,'' said Marc Norman, the
film's co-writer who devised the plot almost 10 years ago after one
of his sons called with the idea of the Bard as a struggling
playwright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until then, he'd written a bunch of plays that were good
but not much better than anybody else's work,'' Norman said. ``But
with `Romeo and Juliet,' that's when he becomes Shakespeare and
leaves the rest behind. And I began to wonder why that happened,
what could've caused that.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush as theatrical
producer Philip Henslowe; Paltrow's real-life beau, Ben Affleck, as
Ned Alleyn, the actor playing Mercutio in the film's version of
``Romeo and Juliet''; Rupert Everett as playwright Christopher
Marlowe, Shakespeare's rival; plus such top British character
actors as Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth I; Imelda Staunton as
Viola's nurse; and Colin Firth as the Earl of Wessex, Viola's gruff
fiance.
</P>
<P>
   The film's Golden Globe nominations, viewed as a barometer for
the Academy Award nods in February, include top musical or comedy
film, Paltrow for best actress, Dench and Rush for supporting
actors, John Madden for director and Norman and Stoppard for
screenwriters of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually a no-no to make a film that's about language, but
I felt this story had such tremendous cinematic possibilities,
which was an amazing challenge,'' said British director Madden,
whose ``Mrs. Brown'' explored the relationships between Queen
Victoria and her employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainly, I didn't want to get out of Shakespeare's world once I
was in it. There's something so intoxicating about this story,
which is partly about the intoxication of theater but also the
transformation that art can bring about. People are always
surprised how contemporary Shakespeare can feel, but if you spend
any time with his work, the psychological observations and feelings
and emotions are astoundingly contemporary.''
</P>
<P>
   The film has a long history. After Norman wrote his first script
in the early '90s, Stoppard came aboard for rewrites, and the movie
went into pre-production. The project, initially owned by
Universal, then fell into sudden limbo with a large price tag
attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were interested in making it, but it cost so
much to buy because of the money Universal had already incurred,''
Norman explained. ``If there's a hero to this story, it's (Miramax
Films co-chairman) Harvey Weinstein. He stepped up, said he wanted
the project and wrote a check.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of production, Universal opted to partner with
Miramax to co-produce the film, which has received raves from
nearly every critic in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow, already one of Hollywood's leading ladies for her star
turn in ``Emma,'' was Weinstein's first choice to play Viola. The
selection of an actor to play Will proved more challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The search for Will was quite a long one, and the thing we
looked for was you had to instantly believe that this guy wrote the
plays,'' said Stoppard, whose screenplays include ``Empire of the
Sun'' and ``Brazil,'' while his internationally acclaimed drama
``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'' unfolds between two minor
characters in Shakespeare's ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered whether, after `Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,' it
might be a bad idea for me to return to this theme,'' Stoppard
said. ``Once I got to work, I was carried away by the ideas and
possibilities of the story. I started with Marc's screenplay and
added characters and dialogue. We worked sequentially. Basically,
he built the vessel, and I filled it.''
</P>
<P>
   British-born Fiennes, the brother of Ralph, had appeared in just
three feature films, including ``Stealing Beauty'' and, most
recently, as Dudley in ``Elizabeth,'' also with Rush. But he has an
impressive career in theater, including seasons at the Royal
Shakespeare Company and on London's West End.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain extent I had to put aside my own reverence about
the writer of such great works of English literature and just get
on with it,'' Fiennes, 28, said. ``I had to adopt the attitude that
as soon as I put on those tights, I am Will Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the love affair with Viola that gives Will the impetus and
material to finish his play, which ends up as `Romeo and Juliet,'
the play-within-the-film that gives ``Shakespeare in Love'' much of
its poetry. At several points, Stoppard has Shakespeare uttering
lines from his plays as dialogue in his daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Rush and others believe that ``Shakespeare in Love,'' like Baz
Luhrmann's ``William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,'' could provide
a door-opener for people who might not be terribly familiar with
the Bard and his world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baz found a way to make a movie version of very complex poetic
text that was very richly true to Shakespeare,'' said Rush, whose
Henslowe runs the Rose Theatre and is one of the new film's many
memorable comic characters. ``This one, in its mock-Tudor way,
could be a great invitation for people. When I read the script it
seemed to scream `be in this,' `do this movie.' It was like being
invited to the party of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-writer Norman said he considered Luhrmann's film, hoping the
two movies with ``Shakespeare'' in their titles could co-exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to kind of knock Shakespeare off his pedestal and
kick him around in the dirt for a while and have some fun with him
and then restore him to his pedestal maybe with a better idea of
why he belongs there,'' Norman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted this to be an elitist film, an `in' film or an
art film. I didn't want it to be anything but a completely popular
film.''

NEW AUTOPSY SHOWS REPORTER WAS STRANGLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A second autopsy on the body of an American
journalist confirmed earlier forensic findings that the reporter
had strangled, a spokesman for President Ernesto Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Philip True, the Mexico City correspondent for the
San Antonio Express-News, was found last week in a mountainous area
of western Mexico three weeks after he had set out on a solo hike
to report on a regional Indian tribe.
</P>
<P>
   True's remains were cremated Sunday in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the attorney general's office and a forensic
pathologist contracted by the FBI traveled early Sunday to the
remote Sierra Madre Occidental where True's body was found on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the order of the federal government, a second autopsy was
conducted Saturday, just hours before a memorial service in the
garden of his Mexico City home where he lived with his wife Marta.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo said the complete autopsy
report would not be available for several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took tissue samples to conduct ... studies. These take
several days to do cultures,'' Madrazo said. ``And we'll be able to
study these together with criminal analysis from the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The body was returned to the family Saturday night and taken to
a funeral home where it was cremated.
</P>
<P>
   The first autopsy, conducted in the state of Jalisco on Thursday
by Dr. Mario Rivas Souza, found True had been strangled with either
a cord or neckerchief. Rivas concluded that True's death was a
homicide.
</P>
<P>
   True's body was found in a shallow grave in a ravine deep in the
Chapalagana Canyon on the border of the states of Jalisco and
Nayarit.
</P>
<P>
   An experienced solo hiker, True, 50, set out on Nov. 28 for a
100-mile trek through a remote region of the Sierra Madre where as
many as 20,000 Huichol Indians live in scattered villages and
ranches.
</P>
<P>
   His intention was study and photograph the Huichol culture for
the the Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   When he didn't return on Dec. 10, family, friends and colleagues
began a frantic search. Three days later, Mexican soldiers joined
the search.
</P>
<P>
   His body was found by a Huichol Indian who had been hunting in
the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   But when the hunter returned with soldiers in helicopters,
True's body had been buried.
</P>
<P>
   Services for True were held Saturday in the back-yard garden of
his home. The ceremony was attended by more than 60 people,
including foreign correspondents and government officials who knew
True, the Express-News correspondent in Mexico City for more than
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the Jack Kerouac of the Mexico City press corps,'' said
Tim Padgett of Time magazine, referring to True's penchant for
roaming the back-country roads of Mexico in pursuit of
unconventional stories.

   MONTEREY, Calif. _ Miles beneath the turbulent waters of
California's Monterey Bay, research biologists, equipped with a
giant robot submersible, advanced sensory equipment and stomachs
almost of steel, are collecting some of the rarest sea creatures
known to man.
</P>
<P>
   If the biologists of the Monterey Bay Aquarium manage to keep
these bizarre animals alive after bringing them back from the
abyss, as they say they can, the researchers plan a public exhibit
of more than 40 species early next year _ the largest such display
of living deep-sea life ever.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these unusual creatures have never been seen in an
aquarium. Indeed, just a decade ago they had hardly been seen by
anyone, because they inhabit the walls and floors of dark,
underwater canyons more than 3,000 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   While remotely operated robots have been used to retrieve
deep-sea animals for several years now, few species brought back
from the ocean floor survived for long outside their natural
habitat.
</P>
<P>
   But after more than a decade of research, trial and error, and
advances in husbandry and life-support systems, the biologists of
the Monterey Bay Aquarium say they are confident that they can
maintain a variety of deep-sea life long enough for public exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Among the strange creatures the scientists plan to display in
the aquarium's new deep sea exhibit, scheduled to open in March,
are mushroom corals, predatory tunicates, sea whips, spider crabs,
filetail cat sharks, ratfish, feather stars, and ellpouts. Many
biologists have never seen many of these species alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have seen television shows and discovery shows
about sea life but those programs deal mainly with what's in the
first 150 feet of ocean,'' said Gil Van Dykhuizen, a research
biologist for the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have captured creatures from thousands of feet deep _
creatures so unusual looking that they appear alien,'' Van
Dykhuizen said, ``and we have learned to keep them alive. Most
people will never see anything like this in their lifetime.''

   Beneath the picturesque Monterey Bay is an underwater canyon
more than two miles deep with steep rocky precipices. The
underwater canyon, which rivals Arizona's famous tourist
attraction, is rich in strange and elusive marine life.
</P>
<P>
   The deep-sea exhibit, which will contain 7,000 square feet of
displays, will focus on three of the habitats found in the Monterey
Bay's canyon: the midwater, vertical canyon wall, and sea-floor
habitats. The aquarium has spent more than $5 million over the last
decade to assemble the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   But gathering and sustaining these delicate, deep-sea species is
no easy task and continues to pose considerable technological and
logistical challenges. The success of the Monterey Bay Aquarium's
deep sea exhibit will depend on many factors beyond the biologists'
control. There is plenty of room for things to go wrong, and they
often do.
</P>
<P>
   The currents and weather conditions of the Monterey Bay are
unpredictable and sometimes violent, making it difficult for the
scientists to go collecting. The highly sophisticated machinery
used to gather these creatures from the deep sometimes
malfunctions, causing delays. And sometimes by accident, the
biologists fatally wound the animals while removing them from
hard-to-reach places in the underwater canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many deep-sea creatures perish outside the extreme
conditions of the deep where there is tremendous water pressure,
icy temperatures, limited food, low oxygen, and no sunlight.
Changes in pressure, oxygen content and water temperature causes
the immediate demise of some species.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are attempting has never been done before, so I guess
you can say we are in uncharted waters,'' said Edward Seidel, an
aquarium research biologist. ``But we've learned so much in recent
years that we believe that we can pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was graphically illustrated last month when aquarium
biologists went searching for predatory tunicates _ a star of the
planned exhibit. Extremely rough seas forced them to abandon the
expedition after three stomach-churning hours.
</P>
<P>
   That day the aquarium research boat Point Lobos left dock at
Moss Landing at 4:30 a.m., headed for a location off the bay where
the corals and tunicates are known to thrive. But the winds were so
high and the water so choppy that the research crew dared not place
the submersible robot in the water for fear of losing it. At least
one experienced biologist on board was seasick.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are days when the sea just doesn't want to cooperate,
and all you can do is try again tomorrow,'' said Susan Lisin, an
aquarium research biologist.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, the biologists were up bright and early,
departing dock at 5:30 a.m. with their fingers crossed. But this
time they headed for an unexplored area closer to shore, where the
crew lowered the robot, a giant remote-controlled submersible, into
relatively calm waters. The robot, which was adapted from an
oil-industry model used on offshore platforms and pipelines, is
equipped with sonars, video cameras, flood lights, sensors,
sampling tools, and collecting devices.
</P>
<P>
   On color television screens in the control room aboard the Point
Lobos, the scientists monitored the descent of the robot to the
bottom of the canyon. At first, only a constant rain of dead
plankton and animal wastes, known as ``marine snow,'' is visible on
the screens.
</P>
<P>
   But after diving for 30 minutes, the submersible reached the
ocean floor, a vast expanse of muddy ridges and cliffs, garnished
with colorful sea animals and plants and illuminated by the craft's
lights, which project out 10 to 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The search was under way. In the control room, the submersible
robot is operated by four research staff members, sitting at
workstations with television screens. A main pilot navigates the
submersible, while a second pilot maneuvers the robot's arms to
collect specimens.
</P>
<P>
   One biologist operates the cameras and identifies specimens, and
another biologist oversees a video program that records the entire
underwater excursion, noting the depth and location where sea
animals are encountered.
</P>
<P>
   While the mood in the dimly lighted control room is jovial _ the
blues guitar of Stevie Ray Vaughn flows from speakers overhead, and
there is constant joking _ the work is serious _ and after the
first hour or so often tedious.
</P>
<P>
   The submersible covers an area about the size of a football
field, meticulously searching for the predatory tunicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh where, oh where has my tunicate gone?'' the crew sang in
unison. After nearly an hour of searching, there were no tunicates
in sight. But there were several mushroom soft coral, deep-sea
cucumbers, and sea stars, which were collected and will displayed
in the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful mushroom corals also are expected to be big hits
of the exhibit. Related to anemones and jellyfish, mushroom corals
dwell at the ocean bottom where they extend feathery polyps to
feed, trapping small animals and particles from currents. When the
polyps are retracted, the polyp looks like the dimpled head of a
pink mushroom.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering these tender creatures is difficult because they are
often located on steep canyon walls that are hard to reach and
because even the slightest abrasions can kill them. Maneuvering the
robot arms can be especially tricky because the pilot has only a
two-dimensional view but is operating in a three-dimensional
environment.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two hours of combing the ocean bottom, the
researchers hit pay dirt. Perched on a canyon wall and resembling a
rubbery blob was a predatory tunicate. Tunicates are commonly known
as sea squirts because they pump water through their bodies to
filter out food particles.
</P>
<P>
   Deep-sea predatory tunicates are of particular interest because
they capture prey by closing their oral hood, trapping tiny animals
inside like a Venus fly trap.
</P>
<P>
   To gather the predatory tunicate, the pilot uses the robot's
clamshell arm, breaking the substrate with the animal attached, off
the canyon wall. The biologists have found that tunicates that are
torn from their substrate or that have their outer layer torn or
scraped, have little chance for survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't hurt a bit,'' said Stuart Stratton, the robot
pilot, as he grabbed the tunicate from the canyon wall.
</P>
<P>
   The tunicates and other deep-sea animals are stored in an
insulated drawer in the underside of the robot submersible. Such
isolation is necessary to protect the sea creatures, which are
collected in very cold water, from being contaminated by surface
water, which may be up to 10 degrees Centigrade warmer, the
biologists said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, the biologists had collected four
predatory tunicates, five mushroom corals, three deep-sea
cucumbers, one pom pom anemone, and one basket star. But collecting
these animals was only half the battle. The creatures must be
sustained in a hostile environment above water.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the biologists could keep the predatory tunicates
alive in aquarium tanks for no more than six to eight months. But
after providing the tunicates with a low-oxygen environment similar
to that in which they normally live, the biologists can now keep
these animals alive for more than two years in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   At depths of 1,650 feet to 2,800 feet, oxygen concentrations in
the Monterey Bay are as low as one-hundredth the amount found in
the surface waters. There is so little oxygen that most surface
fishes would suffocate.
</P>
<P>
   But animals like the predatory tunicate survive in these low
oxygen zones by maintaining a low metabolic rate and extracting
oxygen efficiently. The biologists have designed special
low-temperature, low-oxygen tanks to house the tunicates.
</P>
<P>
   The biologists said they have collected about 70 percent of the
animals needed for the exhibit and that they plan to make at least
five more trips to the deep sea before the opening in March.

DRUGS, SPORTS, BODY IMAGE AND G.I. JOE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Calif.)   (af)  
 By NATALIE ANGIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Which classic American doll has been a staple of childhood from
the boomer babies onward, has won iconic, if politically freighted,
status in our culture, and possesses a waist so small and
hemispheric projections so pronounced that no real adult could
approach them without the help of potentially dangerous body
enhancement therapies?
</P>
<P>
   Barbie? Well, yes. But Barbie has a male companion in the land
of the outlandish physique, and his name is not Ken. Instead, we
must look to a recent model of that old trooper, G.I. Joe, to see a
match for Barbie's cartoon anatomy, and to find a doll that may be
as insidious a role model for boys as Ms. Triple-D top, Size-2
bottom is for girls.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers worry that Joe and other action-hero figures
may, in minor fashion, help fan the use of muscle-building drugs
among young athletes, even as doctors and sports officials struggle
to emphasize that such drugs are not only risky, illegal and
unsporting, but in many cases worthless in enhancing performance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harrison G. Pope Jr., a psychiatrist at McLean Hospital in
Belmont, Mass., has studied how the morphology of G.I. Joe has
evolved since the doll was introduced in 1964. Just as Barbie has
become gradually thinner and bustier, Pope said, so each new
vintage of G.I. Joe has been more muscular and sharply defined, or
``cut,'' than the model before.
</P>
<P>
   The most extraordinary G.I. Joe on the market, ``G.I. Joe
Extreme,'' wears a red bandanna and an expression of rage. His
biceps bulge so much that they are larger around than his waist,
and, if ratcheted up to human size, they would be larger than even
the arms of the grotesquely muscular Olympias of today, said Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro Industries, maker of the G.I. Joe dolls, disagrees with
Pope's contention that the body type of the standard Joe doll has
changed much over the years. The company adds that it has stopped
manufacturing the ``Extreme'' model, although a recent shopping
expedition showed that the doll was still available in toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   G.I. Joe is the only action figure that has been around long
enough for Pope to be able to make comparisons between old and new
models. But he said that a survey of other popular action figures,
including the Power Rangers, Batman and Cyberforce Stryker showed
the same excessive muscularity.
</P>
<P>
   Pope said the dolls might be planting in boys' minds a template
for a he-man's body that cannot be attained without engaging in
obsessive behaviors to build muscle and strip off fat, and then
augmenting those efforts through the consumption of drugs like
human growth hormone and anabolic steroids, which are synthetic
versions of the male hormone, testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   His study of the evolution of action dolls will be published
early next year in The International Journal of Eating Disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to 1960, and the introduction of anabolic steroids, even
the most dedicated bodybuilders couldn't get larger than a certain
maximum size,'' Pope said. ``Steroids made it possible for men to
look as big as supermen, and now we see that standard reflected in
our toys for the very young.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the ubiquitous images of muscularity, as well as the
mounting demands on young athletes to sprint faster, vault higher,
lift heavier and otherwise impress cadres of easily disgruntled
sports fans, experts say it is not surprising that the use of
muscle-enhancing drugs has reached pandemic proportions, even among
barely pubescent boys.
</P>
<P>
   Some 18 percent of high school athletes in the United States are
thought to use anabolic steroids, about twice the figure of 10
years ago, according to some estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Although performance-enhancing drugs are generally banned by
athletic organizations, it is considered laughably easy to cheat
and escape detection in drug screens. In addition, health food
stores now offer a variety of ``nutritional supplements'' reputed
to have anabolic properties.
</P>
<P>
   The supplements include creatine, DHEA, beta agonists and
androstenedione, a precursor of testosterone recently made famous
by the baseball slugger Mark McGwire, who admitted with pride that
he ate it. Such supplements are not strictly regulated, like drugs,
their side effects are uncharted and their effectiveness is
unproved.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long emphasized the dangers of muscle-building
drugs. The use of anabolic steroids lowers the levels of protective
high-density lipoproteins, suppresses sperm production and raises
the risk of heart attacks, strokes and liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   The chronic use of human growth hormone in ultra-high doses has
its own hazards, among them an increased risk of arthritic-type
disorders, diabetes and some cancers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet experts acknowledge that it is not enough to harangue
athletes about the risks to their health. Surveys have shown that
competitive athletes _ who are, after all, quite young and still
unconvinced of their mortality _ say they would gladly trade years
of their life for the chance at winning a gold medal or breaking a
world record.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Schwarzenegger has pointed out that top-tier athletes are
not in it for the sake of ``fitness,'' and that they often go to
grueling, distinctly unhealthy extremes in their training regimens;
he has said that, when he was a competitive bodybuilder, he often
worked out so intensively that he vomited afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The great Alberto Salazar twice was given last rites at the end
of a marathon after pushing himself so hard in the race that he
nearly died at the finish line. What is the difference between
overtraining and overcompeting yourself to death, and killing
yourself slowly with steroids?
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be so hypocritical,'' said George Annas, chairman of
the health law department in the Boston University School of Public
Health. ``We say, it's OK to spend 18 hours a day training, and we
put our kids through all kinds of inhumane regimens that can border
on child abuse, but take one drug and that's the end of it. We're
really crazy about drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   According to many researchers, the paradoxical element in the
seemingly unstoppable epidemic of doping, or using performance
enhancing drugs, is that most of the drugs do not work nearly as
well as billed.
</P>
<P>
   Human growth hormone may increase muscle mass, but bigger does
not necessarily mean stronger, said Shalender Bhasin, a professor
of medicine and chief of the division of endocrinology metabolism
and molecular medicine at Charles Drew University in Los Angeles.
``Patients with acromegaly, who naturally overproduce growth
hormone, often have muscle hypertrophy,'' he said. ``But their
muscles are weak.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the effectiveness of anabolic steroids and other types of
testosterone supplements, scientists for years debated whether the
drugs truly increased muscle mass and strength, or merely bloated
muscle cells with water and encouraged athletes to train harder
through a placebo effect.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Bhasin and his colleagues showed in a
comprehensive report in The New England Journal of Medicine that
super-high doses of testosterone given to healthy young men could
increase muscle size and muscle strength, as measured by the
ability to do exercises like bench-pressing and leg-squatting.
</P>
<P>
   But the results were far from spectacular, and high-intensity,
drug-free workouts proved nearly as good at building muscle
strength as did exercise and testosterone combined. For reasons
that remain unclear, said Bhasin, a pound of muscle gained through
exercise is stronger than a pound of muscle gained through the
grace of testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   He also emphasized that neither his study, nor any other that he
knew of, had shown testosterone-like drugs capable of improving
muscle performance _ that is, the capacity of a muscle to do the
sports maneuver an athlete wants it to do.
</P>
<P>
   The extra muscle bulk that comes from steroid use may drag an
athlete down without compensating for the added weight through
better performance. For any event that requires moving against
friction or gravity, Bhasin said, including sprinting,
pole-vaulting or swimming, and for endurance activities like
marathon running, taking testosterone may be counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Some athletes know as much, and sneer at their doping friends.
Whether performance drugs will ever be eliminated from sports,
though, nobody can say. ``I'm afraid I'm very cynical,'' Pope said.
``From my research, I've seen that the use of steroids and other
drugs has infiltrated deeper into sports than the vast majority of
the public realizes. It's like asking, how can we turn back from
nuclear weapons? The technology is there. The genie is out of the
bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   It might help to begin by tinkering at Santa's workshop. Mattel
has talked about releasing a more realistic Barbie doll with a
thicker waist and smaller bust. How about a G.I. ``Love Handles''
Joe? &QL;

PERSONAL HEALTH: WHEN HOLIDAY TREASURES POSE DANGERS TO HOUSE
PETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cappy is a lovable but naughty 32-pound cocker spaniel with an
insatiable appetite. So it should not have surprised his owners
when, two days before Christmas, he raided the wrapped gifts under
the tree and ate an entire 12-ounce box of chocolate-covered coffee
beans.
</P>
<P>
   His owners returned from a holiday party to find him racing
about the house, his heart pounding rapidly. An emergency visit to
an all-night veterinary clinic revealed that in his haste to devour
the treats before he was discovered, he had swallowed the beans
whole, avoiding more serious consequences like seizures from the
stimulants in the dark chocolate and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Cappy was lucky. Many a pet dog and cat has suffered far more
disastrous health problems from holiday-related hazards, and more
than a few have died, casting an unshakable pall over the whole
season for those who loved them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Saidla, director of continuing education at Cornell
University's College of Veterinary Medicine, said he spent his
saddest Christmas trying in vain to save a young dog hit by a car
when it dashed across the street after children who were going to
inspect a neighbor's new bike. The dog had been a gift to the
children after their father was killed in a plane crash on
Christmas Day two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians who have treated countless holiday casualties
caution pet owners to pay as much attention to their animals'
safety as they would to a child's. In many ways, a pet dog or cat
is like a perpetual toddler _ insatiably curious, unlikely to heed
the word ``no'' and willing to put anything and everything into its
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Given the tumult that generally characterizes the holidays,
Saidla said: ``Christmas is a terrible time to get a new pet.
There's too much going on, too many distractions and not enough
time to pay close attention to a new animal in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Holiday Hazards
</P>
<P>
   Even for a pet that is a well-established member of the
household, there are many new dangers in the house at holiday time
that can attract an animal and cause serious, costly illness. Dr.
Ann Hohenhaus, who heads the department of medicine at the Animal
Medical Center in New York, listed three major categories of
holiday hazards for pets: foods, plants, and seasonal decorations
and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   FOODS ``There's tempting food everywhere at Christmas,'' Dr.
Hohenhaus said, ``and dogs will check out anything they can get to:
turkey bones, the string used in cooking a turkey or rolled roast,
the onions and greasy juice in the pan, corn cobs and even peach
pits.''
</P>
<P>
   The bones can cause an upset stomach, constipation and painful
defecation. The cobs, pits and string can get stuck in the small
intestine, causing severe vomiting and requiring emergency surgery
to remove them. Too many onions can result in ruptured red blood
cells. And too much fat can cause pancreatitis, an inflammation of
the pancreas that can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Family members and guests should be discouraged from giving pets
scraps from the table, especially foods that contain a lot of fat.
And foods, whether served or wrapped as gifts, should never be left
unattended where a dog can get at them.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol can also be a problem for the family dog that finishes
the beer and egg nog left around by holiday guests. ``Pets get
drunk and have hangovers, just like we do,'' Dr. Hohenhaus said.
</P>
<P>
   SEASONAL ITEMS Almost every kind of trinket, even the cords from
strings of lights, can put a pet at risk. ``Cats and dogs,'' Dr.
Hohenhaus said, ``especially young ones, will bite into dangling
electrical cords because they think they're interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting shock from the low-power Christmas lights is
unlikely to severely harm or kill a pet but can inflict a nasty
burn on the lips and tongue, and in some cases it can cause fluid
to collect in the animal's lungs, which can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Stringy tinsel or ``icicles'' which, when eaten, can lodge in
the animal's gut, is a common problem. It can cut through the
intestine and require major surgery to remove it. Tinsel that
resembles bottle brushes is much safer. Cats also like to chew on
ribbon used to wrap packages, so it is best to pick up ribbon as
soon as packages are opened.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Schaer, a professor at the University of Florida
College of Veterinary Medicine, said an animal that suddenly loses
its appetite and vomits repeatedly should be seen by a veterinarian
as soon as possible. A delay in diagnosis and treatment of an
intestinal obstruction can result in a ruptured bowel, which can be
fatal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saidla said that cats and dogs have knocked over fully decorated
Christmas trees and eaten the balls and tinsel right off them. He
recommends that trees be placed in a wide enough base that is
tightly screwed to the trunk. For further security, screw an eye
hook in the ceiling and attach the tree to it with a strong cord or
wire.
</P>
<P>
   Any gift or toy with little parts that a pet can swallow can
also cause an intestinal blockage. Dr. Hohenhaus said she once had
to remove a whole set of ``Toy Story'' figurines from the intestine
of a Labrador. Pennies (zinc, not copper) and Monopoly pieces made
of zinc, when swallowed by a pet, can cause severe anemia and
necessitate a transfusion and surgery to remove them.
</P>
<P>
   Decorative candles should not be placed on low surfaces where a
cat might jump up and get its tail singed or knock over the candle
and start a fire.
</P>
<P>
   PLANTS Poinsettias _ at least, the kind sold at holiday times _
are not nearly as toxic as many people think (their sap can
irritate the stomach and eyes), but the berries of Jerusalem cherry
can cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain,
vomiting and diarrhea. Other popular Christmas foliage, including
holly leaves and berries, mistletoe berries, boxwood and Japanese
yew, are also toxic to animals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other Common Risks
</P>
<P>
   Holidays notwithstanding, winter presents its own set of
problems for pets. Schaer urges that, outside the house, pets
should always be kept on a leash and away from roads to avoid
encounters with drunken drivers. Also, it is hard to see pets on
roadways during the many hours of dim light and darkness in winter.
In very cold weather, outdoor pets need a shelter, extra food and a
source of liquid water.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet-tasting antifreeze left in the yard or garage can be
deadly to pets, said Dr. Larry Thompson, toxicologist at the
Cornell veterinary college. Though it is more expensive than the
more commonly used highly toxic antifreeze made from ethylene
glycol, antifreeze containing propylene glycol is much safer for
dogs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the mouse problem. When rodents seek indoor warmth
and comfort in winter, homeowners are likely to put out
rodenticides, which can kill pets. These toxins are best placed out
of a pet's reach and used in limited amounts. It takes only a
teaspoonful to kill a mouse, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   If you suspect your pet has been poisoned or harmed by holiday
trimmings, call your vet without delay. There is also a pet hot
line run by the National Animal Poison Control Center at the
University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine. Calls to
(900) 680-0000 cost $20 for the first five minutes. Calls to (800)
548-2423 can be charged to a credit card at $30 per case.

CUCKOLDS CARD FOR CHICKS THAT AREN'T THEIRS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ga., Nev., Ill.)   (af)  
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cuckoldry is the fate of males the animal kingdom over. In study
after study of species after species, the idea that females are
naturally devoted to their one and only mates, even as the males
wander, has fallen to growing evidence that many of the world's
supposedly monogamous females are guilty of their share of
indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in spite of these findings, many biologists, especially male
biologists, held out hope that some males might be immune to this
kind of treatment by their mates _ particularly the exemplary,
hard-working fathers, as in the bird species known as the wattled
jacana (pronounced JAC-uh-nuh).
</P>
<P>
   But research reported Tuesday in the Proceedings of the Royal
Society shatters that dream. Although the diminutive male jacanas
do everything to care for the eggs and young of their raucous,
beefy females, these males are cuckolded. Under some circumstances,
the researchers found, males had a 74 percent chance of spending
three months raising another male's chick, a mistake in the
evolutionary race to perpetuate one's own genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about as bad as it can be for these guys,'' said Dr.
Peter Wrege, of Cornell University, who wrote the paper with fellow
behavioral ecologists Dr. Stephen Emlen, Jacob Gould Schurman
Professor at Cornell, and Dr. Mike Webster of the State University
of New York at Buffalo. ``A male stuck with doing all the parental
care should have a very high certainty of paternity, but in fact,
that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patricia Adair Gowaty, behavioral ecologist at the
University of Georgia at Athens, who described herself as having
made a cottage industry of writing about mating behavior from the
female perspective, called the jacanas ``absolutely fascinating,''
</P>
<P>
   ``The females are really in the catbird seat,'' Dr. Gowaty said.
``They seem to be getting whatever they want.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who were also affiliated with the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Institute when they did the work, studied the
jacanas on the Chagres River in Panama. These strikingly patterned
birds peck out a living in the plants that grow in and near the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Known as one of the most extreme examples of sex-role reversal,
the large, bullying jacana females spend their days jousting with
one another at the borders of their territories while harems of
meek males cower on their nests of eggs or chaperon chicks from
feeding site to feeding site.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say they expected to see little or no cuckoldry
because research suggests that males would evolve to work this hard
raising young only if they were certain they were raising their own
offspring. But DNA tests showed that jacana males often raise
another male's chicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a breakthrough,'' said Dr. Lewis W. Oring, a behavioral
ecologist at the University of Nevada at Reno. ``This kind of
demonstration requires years of very careful work, marking all the
individuals, getting tissue samples and doing the DNA analyses.''
</P>
<P>
   In other species, males appear to keep track of such things as
the amount of time the female is out of sight or strange males
lurking around the territory to assess the likelihood that the
female is mating with another male. And when males sense trouble,
they sometimes do not work quite so hard to feed the young, letting
their cheating female pick up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Females, meanwhile, appear to go to great lengths to keep any
transgressions secret, sneaking copulations when their mate is not
around and even soliciting copulations from other males in their
mate's presence only to make a grand show of rejecting them.
</P>
<P>
   But, researchers say, for jacana males it should be easy to
surmise whether they are cuckolds. Researchers found that the males
that receive their clutch of four eggs from a female while other
males in the harem are also unfettered by caring for chicks and are
ready to mate, a potentially easy thing to assess, are at great
risk of being cuckolded.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   A male was even more likely to be a cuckold if his female mated
with another male around the time that her main mate's eggs were
developing or she was laying them, a frequent, easily observed
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a paradox,'' said Wrege. With little on the river to
block a male's view of the territories, and with matings being
exuberant events, with females and males calling out and bright
yellow wing tips flapping, Wrege said, ``He should be able to
assess the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But female jacanas appear immune to retribution. Despite all the
evidence jacana males have, they do not do what researchers predict
_ break eggs, abandon clutches, fly off to find a new mate. They do
not mutiny, researchers say, because they cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Even if one or more eggs in his nest may be another male's, if a
jacana destroys his nest or young, he loses any chance of raising
his own offspring. ``It's a Catch-22,'' said Dr. Stephen
Pruett-Jones, behavioral ecologist at the University of Chicago,
who described the new work as ``a great study.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the male apparently cannot distinguish his chicks from
another male's, ``He can't do anything except care for all the
young'' if he wants to raise any offspring, Dr. Pruett-Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, the likelihood of finding a faithful mate is
slim. As Oring said: ``What does he gain by deserting her? He's
just going to get the same situation later. He's a slave, a sex
slave.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, while every male researcher interviewed focused on
the costs of being a cuckolded harem-mate, Dr. Gowaty suggested
that jacana males could be receiving many evolutionary benefits _
that harems might actually be good for males.
</P>
<P>
   In other mating systems, she explained, many and sometimes most
males never get the chance to mate. Among jacanas, hard-working
males are fought over in vicious battles between females and many
males get the chance to sire young.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefits for males might be that they get some
reproductive success in comparison to a situation where they might
not get any,'' Dr. Gowaty said.
</P>
<P>
   But whether good or bad for males, the current state of affairs
seems to be nothing less than invigorating for females. Presented
with the opportunity to step out, female jacanas have really run
with it, chalking up the most copulations per hour of any of the
world's 9,000 species of birds, often going from one mating to
another in a matter of minutes in noisy succession, researchers
say.
</P>
<P>
   What females receive from these matings, other than what their
triumphant squawking might suggest is the obvious, remains a
mystery. Emlen and colleagues are looking into several
possibilities, including the hypothesis that females may be trying
to mate often with the most genetically desirable males, forcing
males of lower genetic quality to raise eggs sired by the best of
the harem.
</P>
<P>
   For many male researchers (themselves all mammals, a group in
which males typically take little care of their young), the plight
of the jacana male seems at once implausible and pathetic, leading
to the question: how did they get into such a mess?
</P>
<P>
   Emlen and his colleagues suggest that jacana males most likely
evolved to be the sole caretakers of eggs and chicks under
conditions in which they had a high certainty that they were the
father of all the chicks in their nest. But once the males had
become the sole caretakers, they were trapped. They had lost the
leverage of withholding parental care because the females would
provide none, no matter what the males did.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some researchers have begun gathering data that
suggest that, rather than being a sex-role reversal, the
stay-at-the-nest male jacana represents the ancestral state of bird
families, before evolution changed things.
</P>
<P>
   If so, then perhaps those devoted-father jacanas are not the
grievous evolutionary anomaly they are depicted to be but something
much closer to nature's ancient, original state of things _ at
least for birds.

TIME TO SCRAP TIES THAT BIND

 TIE-CHRISTMAS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dutch men have found reason to rejoice this season: The demise
of the necktie may be nigh. In a fit of new-found fashion freedom,
Prince Claus of the Netherlands recently ripped the cravat from his
throat during an African fashion show in Amsterdam, calling the tie
``a snake around my neck.''
</P>
<P>
   On television that evening, a news anchorman and sportscaster
followed suit, and the country has coined the phenomenon
``Claustrophilia'' to honor the brave prince.
</P>
<P>
   Will the tie fade from fashion? Probably knot. But in the spirit
of Claustrophilia, here are 10 pretty good reasons not to buy the
man in your life a tie for Christmas:
</P>
<P>
   1. Can you say ``booooring''?
</P>
<P>
   2. When was the last time you saw him wearing the other tie you
bought him?
</P>
<P>
   3. Why buy now when there's a patent pending on the tie-free
necktie? Simply clip on the knot and go!
</P>
<P>
   4. If ``Claustrophilia'' goes trans-Atlantic, ties might soon be
as passe as that Tickle Me Elmo you bought last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   5. Was Mark McGwire wearing one when he hit his 70th home run?
</P>
<P>
   6. As far as gifts go, Pokemons are so much more interesting. On
second thought ...
</P>
<P>
   7. How would you like it if the man in your life gave you
pantyhose?
</P>
<P>
   8. Way too easy to pick an ugly one.
</P>
<P>
   9. Increases possibility of choking on turkey bone during Xmas
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   10. Monica gave one to Bill.

RETURN TO SENDER: YOU'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE ALREADY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As ``You've Got Mail'' unfolds, and the arrogant prince of the
city Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) gets his comeuppance _ from, of all
people, the wincingly decent Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) _ you wonder
if writer-director Nora Ephron is apologizing for the brittle, cool
cruelty that she exhibited as a magazine essayist.
</P>
<P>
   As an Esquire magazine columnist 20 years ago, Ephron's laissez
faire hostility set a standard that other writers are still trying
to match _ each piece seemed chilled to exactly 34 degrees. (I
liked her stuff, but I never wanted to meet anyone like her.)
</P>
<P>
   The bright colors and small-town friendliness that she evokes in
``You've Got Mail,'' a remake of the sublime ``The Shop Around the
Corner,'' are literally the polar opposite of her print stuff. This
is a picture-postcard Manhattan with a big lipstick kiss on its
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Touchingly, Ephron is out to show a generosity of spirit as a
filmmaker that couldn't possibly have interested her as a writer.
She'd probably have made fun of Kathleen, the owner of the
children's bookstore The Shop Around the Corner, who's so
button-eyed cute that she does everything but show up to work
wearing a Pokemon knapsack.
</P>
<P>
   A touchstone on the Upper West Side _ her mom started the shop _
Kathleen's store is threatened by the imminent appearance of Fox
Books, a books superstore that seeks to be all things to all
people. Or rather, sell all things to people.
</P>
<P>
   Joe is the only relatively sane member of the Fox family. His
dad (Dabney Coleman) and grandfather (John Randolph) have married
women younger than Joe and had kids with them. Which means that Joe
ends up baby-sitting his grade-school-age aunt and her brother, a
touch of low-key eccentricity that gives this movie a little
freshness. Otherwise, ``You've Got Mail'' makes you feel like
you're in a pet shop; it's the only other place you're likely to
hear grown people purr ``Awww''' so often.
</P>
<P>
   Ephron does better with the media types. Greg Kinnear is
Kathleen's boyfriend, a professional Luddite and New York Observer
columnist who's more in love with his own writing than he could be
with any human being. Otherwise, she falls back on the device
that's made her, as David Letterman would say, such a big deal in
show business.
</P>
<P>
   This is another romantic comedy in which the leads spend a great
deal of time communicating while not in the same room, so they end
up talking to their friends about each other a lot, just like in
``When Harry Met Sally,'' which Ephron wrote, and ``Sleepless in
Seattle,'' which she co-wrote and directed. (In ``Mail,'' those
friends include the able actors Steve Zahn, Jean Stapleton, and
stand-up comic Dave Chappelle.)
</P>
<P>
   Here, Joe and Kathleen fall in love over the Internet and via
America Online, a product placement that will do more for AOL's
stock price than will its merger with Netscape. It makes ``Mail''
feel like a first of a sort, some kinda crypto-sequel/remake
companion piece to ``Sleepless.'' You've already seen it before you
walk into the theater; it's the equivalent of swallowing pre-chewed
Milk Duds _ mushy and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks and Ryan join for their third team-up, the first being the
wildly uneven _ and mostly bad _ ``Joe Versus the Volcano.'' Ryan's
work in ``Volcano'' _ she played three roles _ was two parts a
marvel of comic intensity. She played a pale, cowed office worker
and an eccentric, exasperated heiress who rattles off every single
thought that comes to mind, and made them both distinct people.
</P>
<P>
   It was an undertaking that deserved credit for its ambition, not
to mention that she chose to display her timing and determination
in a movie that was barely worth sitting through. (She was even
better as the spurned monomaniac in the inferior ``Addicted to
Love,'' and shows backbone and style in a minor part in the
upcoming ``Hurlyburly.'')
</P>
<P>
   In ``Mail,'' Ryan is only determinedly cute. She plays a '90s
mainstream comedy cliche that strips her of all complication.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks, playing one of those true '90s movies freaks of nature _
an essentially good-guy mega-capitalist _ comes through with
pinpoint shadings. He gives Joe a bone-deep self-possession that
can register a little faster than the eye can see; his
one-upmanship slips right past his oblivious book editor girlfriend
_ Parker Posey, who always seems to have drunk one mochaccino too
many.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks has expressed some anxiety about being compared with Jimmy
Stewart, an anxiety he's apparently confronting by taking on a role
in which Stewart gave one of his best, most natural performances.
Hanks deepens his relaxed, all-American slyness here. He goes
drier, and his minimalism results in the best scene _ perhaps the
only good one _ in ``Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kathleen almost causes a riot by getting into the Cash
Only line of Zabar's with no cash, Joe sails in and rescues her
with his princely charm. Hanks, with the tiniest, swiftest
inflections, uses a winning aplomb that's so totally New York, you
almost forgive the rest of the picture, especially the last
half-hour, which is like being trapped in the Express Line behind
someone who's paying in rolls of pennies. (The aftermath, when
Kathleen tries to imitate his I Can't Believe It's Not Butter
polish, is funny, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Hanks shows he's ready for much more complex parts than he's so
far taken. He and Ryan show a spark here that makes you want to see
them in a much better, and riskier, film. With a scene like this,
Ephron even shows she's capable of directing it.

 '' 
 &HT;    _ ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' by Dr. Seuss By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's always about money, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   American families spend an average of $800 to $1,200 a year on
Christmas. Well, this year, no more.
</P>
<P>
   No more Tickle Me Elmo. No more ``Martha Stewart Living.'' No
more lavish gifts, office parties, ``secret Santas,'' expensive
dinners or credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity movement, the backlash against '80s greed, has
finally gotten around to taking on the Christmas monster. But
wouldn't you know that how to do it has become its own cottage
industry.
</P>
<P>
   There are a dozen books on the subject. There are groups that
sponsor church seminars, groups that collect data, groups that push
for a revolt. There are even Web pages devoted to getting out of
exchanging gifts. (Try a ``Gift of Time'' certificate.)
</P>
<P>
   No wonder it's come to this. According to a poll by the
nonprofit group The Center for a New American Dream, most Americans
admit there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the people surveyed, 70 percent said they would welcome
less emphasis on gifts and spending.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most respondents said they spend one of every three hours
during the holidays on a stressful activity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Respondents said it takes them an average of six months to pay
off holiday bills.
</P>
<P>
   Heard enough?
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth resident Jeanie Crane decided 10 years ago she didn't
want to buy anything she could live without. She cut back at
Christmas, though her family was never nuts about celebrating
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Crane, a small-business owner and consultant who is 57, bought
calendars for her son and daughter-in-law this year, and instead of
overspending as some grandparents do, she wrote and illustrated a
storybook for her grandson.
</P>
<P>
   She prefers to spend her energy on gifts of time. As a gift for
older people, she suggests visits or running errands. She
encourages older family members to write or record family history
as a gift to the younger generation. Crane buys at thrift shops,
where gifts can be recycled.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the simplifying-Christmas movement is based in the
Earth-friendly causes that promote recycling and equate consumerism
to trashing the planet. But some people are driven by a desire to
focus on the Christian roots of the season. And others are like the
Boston mother who told author Elaine St. James, ``Last year I woke
up the day after Christmas, and I was so tired I just wanted to
cry.''
</P>
<P>
   St. James, author of ``Simplify Your Life,'' has written
``Simplify Your Christmas: 100 Ways to Reduce the Stress and
Recapture the Joy of the Holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tips are extreme, others are obvious. St. James suggests
sending no Christmas cards, cleaning up a vacant lot, posting a
list of chores for your holiday guests, bowing out of the office
gift exchange, and throwing out women's magazines starting in
September. The reason: They encourage unrealistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   St. James argues that shopping by catalog or shopping through
the year doesn't count. ``Simplifying the holidays is not the same
thing as organizing them,'' she writes. ``When you organize, you're
just reshuffling the same heavy load. When you simplify, you
actually eliminate a large chunk of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Where to start?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unplug the Christmas Machine: A Complete Guide to Putting Love
&AMP; Joy Back into the Season'' helps family members discover which
activities stress them out. There are exercises for men, ``The
Christmas Stagehands,'' exercises for women, ``The Christmas
Magicians,'' even exercises for kids.
</P>
<P>
   If the thought of going to a bookstore causes you anxiety, skip
it. That's the message from Adbusters, an environmental group that
started ``Buy Nothing Day,'' which has become an international
boycott on the biggest shopping day of the year, the day after
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas has long been the last fort built strong enough to
ward off the simplicity movement. Crane explains that there's a
``magical'' sort of rationalization that people bring to holiday
overdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have brainwashed ourselves into thinking it takes
money to make something special,'' she said. ``I do understand how
people can get wrapped up in it and how it can be fun. But do you
own the things or do the things own you?''

<P>
   Some tips are extreme, others are obvious. St. James suggests
sending no Christmas cards, cleaning up a vacant lot, posting a
list of chores for your holiday guests, bowing out of the office
gift exchange, and throwing out women's magazines starting in
September. The reason: They encourage unrealistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   St. James argues that shopping by catalog or shopping through
the year doesn't count. ``Simplifying the holidays is not the same
thing as organizing them,'' she writes. ``When you organize, you're
just reshuffling the same heavy load. When you simplify, you
actually eliminate a large chunk of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Where to start?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unplug the Christmas Machine: A Complete Guide to Putting Love
&AMP; Joy Back into the Season'' helps family members discover which
activities stress them out. There are exercises for men, ``The
Christmas Stagehands,'' exercises for women, ``The Christmas
Magicians,'' even exercises for kids.
</P>
<P>
   If the thought of going to a bookstore causes you anxiety, skip
it. That's the message from Adbusters, an environmental group that
started ``Buy Nothing Day,'' which has become an international
boycott on the biggest shopping day of the year, the day after
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas has long been the last fort built strong enough to
ward off the simplicity movement. Crane explains that there's a
``magical'' sort of rationalization that people bring to holiday
overdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have brainwashed ourselves into thinking it takes
money to make something special,'' she said. ``I do understand how
people can get wrapped up in it and how it can be fun. But do you
own the things or do the things own you?''

`PRINCE' MAKES MIRACLES ROYALLY ENTERTAINING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using animation to tell the story of Moses renouncing worldly
goods and taking his place with his people, the Hebrews _ as in
``Prince of Egypt'' _ is potentially a good and a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   What's troublesome is that, in animation, the miraculous happens
as a matter of course. That is, unless you think animals walking on
their hind legs, speaking with a Brooklyn accent and wearing gloves
is normal.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the parting of the Red Sea sounds like the kind of
spectacle that screams for animation, the cartoon context robs a
miracle of some of its power. (And, yes, there is the fact that the
Red Sea parting from ``The Ten Commandments'' is a special effect
against which others are still judged.)
</P>
<P>
   But a brilliantly conceived sequence from ``Prince'' _ the
slaughter of Hebrew baby boys, illustrated with hieroglyphs _ shows
how animation can triumph over apparent limitations.
</P>
<P>
   It was less than a month ago that ``A Bug's Life'' raised the
stakes for an animated feature film. ``Prince'' seeks to elevate
that standard even higher by offering the first epic animated story
for an adult audience in more than 60 years. (One of the first was
the long-forgotten, lushly rendered 1939 adaptation of Jonathan
Swift's ``Gulliver's Travels.'')
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious ``Prince'' features two songs in the opening five
minutes _ as the infant Moses is launched to safety by his mother
and adopted by the Egyptian royal family _ to reassure audiences
and not immediately subvert the genre. None of the animals bursts
into song, and Moses' staff doesn't whisper comic-relief asides
into his ear. ``Prince'' is played as straight as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for a version of Moses more faithful to the King
James Version of the Bible _ parts of which are so beautiful they
can make you weep _ may be a bit put off to find a teen-age Moses
who seems more like a suburban kid, sporting a goatee like the guy
at Starbucks who doesn't even pretend to be interested when he's
taking your order. ``High-spirited'' and ``irrepressible,''
adjectives not found in the Old Testament, would best describe this
energetic kid, voiced by Val Kilmer. To make Moses more obviously
sympathetic, he's a plainspoken American with convivial
inflections. He's lovable.
</P>
<P>
   His family _ brother Rameses (Ralph Fiennes), father Pharaoh
(Patrick Stewart) and mother Queen (Helen Mirren) _ are all voiced
by Brits. So even their corniest sentiments are trilled loftily,
spoken with a hint of condescension.
</P>
<P>
   What you may find yourself craving in a story like this, which
doesn't fall short in the big moments, is the idiosyncrasy of an
actor's eyes. It's the one thing that can have as much impact in
drama as the delivery of a line. It's also one of the things that
animators haven't quite mastered. But we do get an unusual
assemblage of actors with distinctive voices. They include Michelle
Pfeiffer as the spunky woman Moses marries, Sandra Bullock as his
sister Miriam, as well as the warm-honey growl of Danny Glover and
the hiccuping, stop-and-stutter Jeff Goldblum.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks honcho and ``Prince'' executive producer Jeffrey
Katzenberg has married ambition to a crowd-pleaser mentality. He
reached out to so many religious leaders and advisers while making
``Prince'' that the movie often seems like it's running for office.
</P>
<P>
   Which, again, is good and bad _ ``Prince'' lacks the show-biz
peculiarity that infests movies such as ``Commandments.'' (Billy
Crystal's impersonation of Yul Brynner's misplaced zest is one of
the best pieces of film criticism I've ever heard.) It moves
quickly, too, as if afraid to bore the audience. It doesn't want to
offend anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Right down to the songs, which are filled with the bland uplift
of an Amy Grant collection. (She's on one of the three soundtrack
CDs, along with DC Talk, and a Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey
duet in which they wrestle ``If You Believe'' to a standstill. The
collection of performers crooning ``Prince'' songs is, at least, an
answer to a VH1 prayer.)
</P>
<P>
   As an animation feature, ``Prince'' is handsomely rendered and
is realized with a performer's need to entertain, the kind of thing
some might say contradicts the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   On its own terms, it's an achievement _ the deft sand and sky
tones have majesty. With the big moments _ the plagues that sweep
through Egypt _ the animators run with the opportunity to strut
their stuff and display a graphic vitality not normally seen in
cartoons. Delineating the power of the Old Testament must've been a
dream come true for them.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The final fact of life is that when you die, a doctor is
required to fill out your death certificate, specifying the cause
of death.
</P>
<P>
   Assigning a cause is more than an exercise in morbid curiosity.
The certificate has important legal and social purposes. For
families of the deceased, the certificates can affect health and
finances. For policy-makers, the documents provide information to
track national trends in diseases and form a basis for setting
spending priorities. For researchers, the information is crucial to
scientific studies.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of death certificates has grown in recent years
as the autopsy rate has plummeted to about 10 percent from about 50
percent in the 1960s. In the absence of autopsy findings, the death
certificate becomes the official declaration of why a person died.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, death-certificate information is often flawed, and
that misinformation can affect policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors don't realize that millions of dollars are actually
allocated on the basis of that little statement that they put on
the death certificate,'' Dr. Harry Rosenberg, a senior statistician
at the National Center for Health Statistics, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   New evidence of flawed death-certificate information comes from
researchers at the federally financed Framingham Heart Study in
Massachusetts. The study, begun in 1948 and involving some 10,000
people, suggests that doctors overstate coronary artery disease as
a cause of death on death certificates, particularly among the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, coronary artery disease is the default diagnosis for
the death certificate when doctors are not sure of the cause of
death.
</P>
<P>
   The situation, however, is complicated: Many cases are so
medically complex that assigning a single cause of death,
particularly in older people with multiple ailments, can be
virtually impossible, but doctors still must cite one primary cause
and can add secondary causes. In such cases, doctors may differ
about the main cause.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the importance of the death certificate, the message
about the frequent flaws is unpopular in medical circles because it
implicitly criticizes medical education and practice.
</P>
<P>
   Studies in the United States and elsewhere have documented
varying degrees of inaccuracies in death-certificate information,
with some showing an error rate of 30 percent to 40 percent.
Critics say that improving the accuracy will permit more reliable
detection of trends in deaths from various diseases. Rare
conditions, child abuse and suicides are among the conditions that
are believed to be underreported.
</P>
<P>
   When autopsies are performed, amendments to the death
certificate are allowed. But many times the information is not
forwarded, or if it is, it may not lead to a change in the
certificates, thus creating discrepancies between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been required to sign death certificates in all
states since at least 1933. Yet formal instruction on how to assign
a cause of death is spotty. Instead, the learning generally comes
informally during residency training when doctors may ask
colleagues, ``How do I fill this thing out?'' Answering the
question are other doctors, nurses, medical-records workers, and
occasionally even funeral directors.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dec. 15 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine, the
Framingham authors add to earlier pleas that have urged improved
training for doctors in how to complete death certificates. The
National Center for Health Statistics has distributed instructional
laminated plastic cards and audio and videocassettes to hospitals
through state health departments. Yet examinations for doctors
rarely include questions about death-certificate procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The death certificate is intended to provide the best possible
explanation of why a person died.
</P>
<P>
   In signing a certificate, a doctor is supposed to list a
specific cause of death. Breast cancer, pneumonia and diabetes are
examples.
</P>
<P>
   The designation of ``natural causes,'' which some doctors have
used, is neither specific nor meaningful. The cause also differs
from such things as cardiac arrest or respiratory failure. They are
mechanisms of death, not causes, since everyone's heart and lungs
eventually stop at death from whatever the underlying ailment is.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific imperative to provide accurate information is
growing daily. As more is learned about the hereditary nature of
many diseases, survivors and unborn generations may someday want to
look up a relative's cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that are more immediate and practical issues. Death
certificates can help settle estates and affect insurance claims.
If an autopsy showed that someone died of a heart attack that led
to a car accident, the beneficiaries might not be eligible to
collect on double-indemnity clauses.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, misinformation on death certificates has led to
malpractice suits. For example, in a recently reported case, a
heart attack was listed as the cause of death of a 48-year-old male
heavy smoker. His widow sued his doctors, alleging that they had
failed to diagnose and treat the heart attack. But an autopsy
showed no evidence of a heart attack and found that death probably
resulted from inflammation of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Family pressures, even hospital billing practices, can influence
what is listed as a cause of death. In trying to comfort survivors
of a suicide victim, some doctors put down another cause of death,
justifying the comments in medical journals that some certificates
``are pure fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   In part to encourage doctors to provide more accurate death
certificates, they are not available to the public in New York and
some other states, but they are public documents in many other
areas.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Because heart disease is the most common cause of death in the
United States, Dr. Daniel Levy's team at the Framingham Heart Study
undertook a study to determine the accuracy of death certificates
for heart disease. The Framingham study has become arguably the
most influential heart-disease research project, helping to shape
the understanding and treatment of heart disease throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Levy's team compared the cause of death listed by a patient's
doctor on the death certificate with the one determined by a panel
of three experts. The panel routinely reviews each death in the
Framingham study after examining the patient's medical records and
information from interviews with the next of kin. The panel does
not use the death certificate in making its determination.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Framingham authors agreed that expert panels are
not infallible. Also, the treating physician may have information
that is not in medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Levy's report involved 2,683 participants in the Framingham
Heart Study who died between 1948 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The death certificate cited coronary disease as the cause of
death for 942, or 35 percent, of the deceased, compared with 758,
or 28.3 percent, for the expert panelists. Further statistical
analysis showed that certificates attributed 24.3 percent more
deaths to coronary artery disease in all age groups. The expert
panel agreed with only 635, or 67 percent, of the coronary causes
of death listed on the death certificate.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the tendency to assign more deaths to coronary
heart disease increased with age. In those 85 and older, death
certificates listed coronary heart disease twice as often as the
panel did.
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham researchers cautioned against extrapolating
findings from one community to a wider area. Yet even if the
inaccuracies in the Framingham study were confirmed on a national
scale, heart disease would not drop to second place behind cancer,
Levy said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The findings also have important implications for research
determining risk factors for various diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make it difficult, if not impossible,'' Levy said,
``to identify risk factors for a disease when the level of
misclassification on death certificates is similar to what we
observed for coronary disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg, the National Center for Health Statistics official,
said use of the Internet would eventually make death-certificate
information more reliable and retrieval of data speedier.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can now consult the Web site
(www.cdc.gov/nchswww/about/dvs/mortdata.htm) for help in completing
a death certificate. Also, an electronic filing system is being
tested in three states _ Iowa, New Hampshire and New York. Doctors
who connect with the New York health department's Web site will see
an image of the death certificate. ``Prompts, edits and tutorials
will guide the user,'' Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our best hope,'' he added, ``but we're not there yet.''

   FBC-COACHES _ ATLANTA _ Many teams around the South are
preparing for bowl games with new coaches or depleted coaching
staffs. Former Georgia assistant Chris Scelfo is the new coach at
Tulane, and he must prepare for the liberty Bowl without much of a
staff to work with. Many of the former assistants under former
coach Tommy Bowden have joined their boss at Clemson. Florida will
face Syracuse in the Orange Bowl without its offensive and
defensive coordinator. Tennessee will meet Florida State in the
Fiesta Bowl without its offensive coordinator. David Cutcliffe, who
left Tennessee to become the coach at Ole Miss, won't have much of
a staff as many of the former assistants followed Tommy Tuberville
to Auburn. (Barnhart, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

CHRISTMAS LIGHTS DON'T SHINE  

</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You will probably not be all that surprised to learn that the
Grimes family's outdoor Christmas lights are, once again, the joke
of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   All over my subdivision there are homes lit up like department
stores. Yards and yards of icicle lights drip from the eaves. Trees
and shrubs glow with enough wattage to satisfy the power needs of
small city. Racer lights. Animatronic reindeer. Snowmen so bright
they hurt the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's my house. It's easy to spot. It's the one that
looks like it was decorated in five minutes by someone with a
vision disorder and then a strong wind came up and blew most of the
lights away.
</P>
<P>
   Understated is the word I like to use to describe the overall
effect. Pathetic is the word my wife prefers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you need to understand that my wife is the kind of
person who begins looking forward to Christmas in early July. She
is not bothered in the slightest by stores that begin putting up
their Christmas decorations right after Halloween. If it were up to
her, the decorations would stay up all year.
</P>
<P>
   My wife is very unhappy this year because we have only three
Christmas trees in our house, down from four in previous years. The
12-year-old, giving no thought to how he was breaking his mother's
heart, said he did not want a tree in his room this year. Maybe he
grew tired of having to crawl through his window to get into and
out of his room, or maybe he finds it easier to sleep without the
holiday equivalent of 10 searchlights scorching his retinas. I
don't know.
</P>
<P>
   But even without the fourth tree, the interior of our house is
plenty festive. I won't go into details other than to say that when
it comes to holiday decorating, my wife makes Martha Stewart look
like a slacker.
</P>
<P>
   And, even more annoying for a decorating-impaired person like
myself, she's fast. She can festoon three trees, hang the garlands
and make five or six wreaths from reeds she gathered down by the
pond in less time than it takes me to untangle one string of
lights.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, her lights are never tangled because when she takes
them down, she coils them neatly in their original packaging,
labeling each box carefully so that next year she knows which
lights go in the living room, which go in the dining room, which go
on the dog, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Do I find this the least bit irritating? Does Bill Clinton find
Ken Starr the least bit irritating?
</P>
<P>
   You would think, with my wife's innate decorating skills, that
she would volunteer to decorate the outside of the house, too,
allowing me to take on the supporting role (i.e. drinking beer and
watching college basketball on TV) with which I am so much more
comfortable and better suited.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, either due to a perverse nature or the legitimate
fear that I would disappear into the TV room like a groundhog and
not reappear until the last bowl game was over, she makes me do the
outside decorating.
</P>
<P>
   She does this knowing full well that appointing me to hang
Christmas lights is like hiring Mike Tyson to do plastic surgery on
your ear. The results tend to be a little ... uneven.
</P>
<P>
   But that's OK. As with all great artists who are ahead of their
time, I feel confidant that the day will come when my style of
decorating, which basically consists of hurling tangled wads of
lights at the bushes and gutters and hoping some stick, will become
the standard rather than the exception.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, if you happen to drive by our house, I
recommend that you ignore the outdoor lights (it won't be hard;
there aren't that many) and focus instead on the expertly decorated
trees glowing in the windows.
</P>
<P>
   The dog looks pretty cool, too.
</P>

CAUTION URGED IN WHITENING TEETH AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A variety of new procedures and products are becoming available
for whitening teeth, many of them sold over the counter in
pharmacies or by mail order for use in the home. But a controversy
swirls around their safety and effectiveness, particularly the
over-the-counter home products.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers insist that the products are both safe and
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Whitening solutions with high concentrations of hydrogen
peroxide _ 30 percent to 35 percent _ have been available in
dentists' offices for years for teeth stained by food, coffee, tea,
tobacco or other substances. Initially, they required meticulous
preparation, and this, coupled with their unpredictability, limited
their popularity.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s new products were introduced that were easier
to apply, and the process began to be used more often.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the Food and Drug Administration classified the
whiteners as drugs, affecting bodily structures or tissues and
requiring FDA approval. The manufacturers then argued that the
products were cosmetics, and the FDA allowed them on the market
pending another review. The agency says questions are still being
raised, including recent reports of increasing levels of peroxide
being added to home products, and the matter remains under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The generally accepted method of whitening is done in the
dentist's office with prepared bleach-and-gel solutions perhaps one
to three times a year after a normal teeth cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   The dentist places a rubber dam or a gel on the gums to protect
them, and then swabs the teeth, keeping the bleaching agent in
place for 10 to 20 minutes. The number of treatments depends on the
severity of the staining. Another office procedure, approved two
years ago but not yet subjected to long-term study, adds laser
light to the bleaching to speed the process and lessen exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Clifford Whall Jr., director of product evaluation at the
American Dental Association, said the in-office bleaches have a
long record of safety, though it is too soon for long-term
conclusions on laser or at-home procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Whall and others say that, as with many medical procedures that
are beneficial if correctly followed and harmful if not, teeth
whitening can kill gum tissue or damage the teeth if done
improperly. And animal studies suggest that high concentrations of
hydrogen peroxide can cause irreversible cell damage and may
enhance carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   Home bleaching devices, prescribed by a dentist or bought over
the counter, use lower levels of peroxide but must be applied more
often, generally several hours a night for up to six weeks. The
bleaching agent _ acceptable mixtures contain 10 percent carbamide
peroxide, the equivalent of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide _ is poured
into small, thin trays that are molded tightly around the teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jinder Khurana, a periodontist and an official of the New
York Dental Association, said ``people can be tempted to overuse
them and this can eventually cause damage to both the exterior
enamel and the inner nerve or the mouth itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``all-in-one'' solution now advertised as a combination
whitener and ordinary toothpaste, contains still less peroxide, but
is recommended for twice a day, presumably for life. The effect of
lifetime exposure to low-level hydrogen peroxide is unknown, the
experts say.

BATTLING HOOF ROT AND OTHER ILLS IN MONGOLIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Schaller, the director of science for the Wildlife
Conservation Society, the group that runs the Bronx Zoo, has
studied animals in the wild for more than 45 years, from the birds
of Colville River, Alaska, to the mountain gorillas of Zaire and
the giant pandas of China.
</P>
<P>
   He discussed biodiversity and his current field work _ trying to
gauge the impact of an epidemic of bacterial hoof disease on the
vast herds of gazelles on the Central Asian steppe _ in a telephone
interview from a campsite near Choybalsan in eastern Mongolia. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)And what brought you to Mongolia?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The Mongolian gazelle is one of the great wildlife spectacles
left in Asia. You can see a herd of 50,000 gazelle. I've been
working off and on for 10 years with the Mongolian government to
try to get a management plan going for these gazelles so they can
be sustainably harvested rather than just poached and unsustainably
hunted, because there's still one to two million of them. So it's
one of the great wildlife populations in the world, and nobody's
ever heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What's happening with them right now?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They've had this disease, a hoof rot. There were heavy rains
last summer and many thousands have died, but Billy Karish from the
Wildlife Conservation Society came with me. He's a veterinarian,
and we are looking at what effect this has had on the gazelle,
because this is an unusual event. But I come periodically to check
on population composition and other information. And we're thinking
of doing a larger project here.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What sort of impact do humans have on an elusive and
out-of-the-way population like the gazelles?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The wonderful thing is the eastern steppes of Mongolia are
the last really big undamaged grassland ecosystem left in the
world, other than some areas in Tibet. And the gazelle is the major
wild hoofed animal. People are very few, so it's a wonderful
opportunity for Mongolia to manage the whole landscape on a
sustainable basis both for the wildlife and for the people.
</P>
<P>
   But development is coming. There's oil exploration, there's talk
of building a railroad and an oil pipeline and all these things.
And by planning ahead now for conservation, you can have both the
development and the gazelles and the beautiful grassland ecosystem,
and that's what we're working toward.
</P>
<P>
   It's a natural habitat, one of the last. It's like the American
prairies used to be. And in America we're fighting for these last
little, tiny few acres here and there. Here you've got 100,000
square miles of wonderful grassland. Now is the time to plan for
the future, not after it's been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)A lot of the public discussion about problems of
biodiversity centers on tropical environments. You hear much less
about cold places. Is a lot being overlooked because of the focus
on the rain forest?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, some of the more open woodlands, subtropical
woodlands, are far more in danger of being destroyed as ecosystems
than the rain forest. But all systems basically are under threat
from development. And this is one of the basic issues today.
</P>
<P>
   You've got words like sustainable development, and that's being
equated with conservation. Well, you use the word development,
that's only to please consumers. It's not to protect biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   And you can't manage things on a long-term basis, sustainably or
otherwise, unless you have the basic information about the
situation. And that's what is usually lacking in most conservation
efforts. You need information, knowledge about the natural system.
You can't just pop in and out for two or three years. You have to
have a real commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Are there lessons for the work of the Wildlife
Conservation Society in the United States from your work in places
like Mongolia?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Certainly one lesson has been learned overseas, which is only
relatively recently applied in the states, is that you have to deal
with local communities, that you can't have long-term conservation
without approval and cooperation of the local people. All too often
in the states, this has not been the case. And that's why you have
a lot of backlash. Whereas if people feel that they are
contributing, that their livelihood is not truly being negatively
affected, in other words, education and communication, it has a
major impact.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one of our North American programs is in
Adirondacks Park, which has a lot of private in-holdings and so
forth. And there's a real effort to bring the community together to
discuss options of managing the region. And to keep the area
beautiful and also, to some extent, wild without having too much of
a negative impact on the people.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)In your travels, what do you see as the most hopeful
development as far as the environment and species preservation?(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. There is obviously in the last couple of decades a much
greater awareness, which is a hopeful sign. Most governments are
aware, most governments are actually proud of the natural areas
they have. All too often these days in conservation you hear terms
like use it or lose it. Well, most of the world, yes right now,
seems to operate full blast on using up resources, using up wealth,
creating temporary wealth, raising cash. But there are ethical,
moral considerations, there's national pride in natural areas and
natural heritage, which exists and which many governments have. And
this is something one needs to build on.
</P>
<P>
   An organization like the Conservation Society has a narrow focus
because we are small and our impact is greatest if we focus on a
small issue.
</P>
<P>
   The science part is fun. The conservation part, which means
politics, economics and everything, is not fun because you're
dealing with basic social issues that cannot easily be resolved.
What we can do and have done is to convince governments that this
area is worth protecting and we find ways to manage the area and
one feels one has gained a little ground in that respect.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Could you say a little about what you did today and
any lessons you took from the work?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. We've been looking at the gazelle herds to see what the
survival of young was like after the disease outbreak. And the
survival of young this year has been poor. They'll make up for it
another year. Today we worked in the laboratory to check several
gazelles that had been sick, how would they make it through the
winter, what condition were they in.
</P>
<P>
   And it's bitter weather, it's below zero here. Snow on the
ground, the steppes are dead yellow, covered with snow. A cold wind
is blowing.
</P>
<P>
   But it's one of the most beautiful sights in the world when you
see big gazelle herds running across the grasslands. So this is a
limited goal, but one feels one is doing something useful for a
country in which one works.

HEALTH HAZARDS FOR WORKERS AT INDOOR WATER PARKS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indoor water parks, with their fountains, spouts and water
slides, have grown increasingly popular. But a study that tracked
two outbreaks of what researchers dubbed ``lifeguard lung'' shows
that the spraying water that makes such parks fun can pose health
complications as well.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have long suspected that saunas, hot tubs and
indoor fountains can be highly effective vehicles for transmitting
infections.
</P>
<P>
   Microbes in the water are far more likely to make their way into
human lungs when they waft through the air in what are technically
referred to as aerosolized water droplets.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a Colorado water park that was closed twice in
two years by outbreaks of lung disease among lifeguards,
researchers reporting earlier this month in the American Journal of
Public Health found that chronic exposure to contaminated droplets
was responsible for a kind of inflammatory lung illness,
granulomatous pneumotitis, that can cause permanent scarring.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the city of Westminster, north of Denver, opened one of
the country's first ``natatoriums,'' with three pools, two
waterfalls, a water slide, fountain and two hot tubs.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, a number of lifeguards at the
facility developed respiratory symptoms, leading several to quit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, four guards were diagnosed with granulomatous
pneumotitis and the pool was shut.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent survey found that at least 27 percent of pool
employees had been infected, reporting symptoms that included
coughs, chest tightness and congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cecile Rose of the National Jewish Medical and Research
Center in Denver, who led the team that studied the outbreak, said
two points were particularly worrisome: ``Young, healthy lifeguards
were sick,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And tracking work records indicated a direct link between time
spent at the pool and likelihood of infection.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers hired by the city said that increasing the flow of
fresh air would dilute contamination sufficiently, said Bill
Walenczack, the current director of parks, recreation and
libraries, and the pool's ventilation system was overhauled at a
cost of $600,000. It reopened in May 1990. Within three months,
however, a second outbreak of lung disease among lifeguards was
reported, and this time it hit 65 percent _ and the pool was closed
again.
</P>
<P>
   After testing water droplets in the air, the researchers found
high levels of bacterial cell residues called endotoxins _ 25 times
higher within the water park than in outdoor air, and far higher
than at two pools without water spray equipment that were tested.
</P>
<P>
   Levels were highest from samples taken in the ``crow's nest''
chair where lifeguards reported the most chest discomfort. ``They
were sitting up there for hours and hours, being exposed to water
droplets small enough to get deep inside the lung,'' Rose said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The pool eventually upgraded parts of its system _ at a cost of
$1.2 million _ and since then there have been no new cases or
complaints, said Walenczak.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is the first time that pools have been identified
as a source of inflammatory lung infections, Rose warns that the
growth of water spray features should put pool workers on their
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Less clear is the risk of more occasional exposure. ``We don't
really know what the risk is to users _ probably much lower, if
there is any,'' said Rose.

POLLUTION RUNS THROUGH IT  
 DEATH FROM ABOVE  
 FIGHTING FOR A BITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A river is like a highway, flowing through the landscape.
Unfortunately, according to a new study, it is also like a car,
polluting the air as it rolls along.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from the United States Geological Survey, in a study
of the South Platte River in Nebraska and Colorado, determined that
the river gives off large amounts of nitrous oxide, a gas that acts
as a catalyst in the destruction of ozone in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Like many rivers, the South Platte is rich in nitrates and
ammonium, from agricultural runoff and the discharges from sewage
treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   Microbes turn these nitrogen sources into nitrous oxide. The
researchers, whose work was published in the Internet edition of
Environmental Science and Technology, found that the river in many
places was supersaturated in nitrous oxide, with the result that
much of it entered the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists estimated that the amount of the gas emitted
along a 450-mile stretch of the river each year was equivalent to
that produced by all the worst sewage treatment plants in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   And although they said more studies were needed, they added that
if the South Platte is typical, as seems likely, rivers are a major
source of man-made nitrous oxide pollution. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dinosaurs became extinct, so the common theory holds, when a
large asteroid or comet struck the Earth near the Yucatan 65
million years ago, drastically altering weather patterns worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Now, scientists led by a geologist from Brown University have
discovered evidence in South America of a lesser, and far more
recent, impact that they suspect caused local extinctions.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists studied glass fragments in sedimentary deposits
on coastal cliffs in southeastern Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The fragments, known as escorias, were first described in 1865,
but their origin had never been satisfactorily explained.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the journal Science, the scientists theorize that the
escorias were formed by the impact of an asteroid or comet, the
intense heat of the event fusing the sediment into glass. By dating
the fragments, which are found over a distance of 20 miles, the
researchers determined that the impact occurred 3.3 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just above the level of the glass is another level of sediment
that is notable for the absence of about three dozen species of
animals that are present in older deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists theorize that the impact caused enough of a
climate change in the region to wipe out those animals. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Life is a rat race _ even for bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Consider feeding, for example, or more specifically, how
bacteria in seawater get nutrients. One might think that the ocean
is a homogeneous soup, with nutrients equally available to all. In
this view, bacteria would not have to compete for food.
</P>
<P>
   But a study by scientists in Denmark and Australia shows that
this is not the case. Food often becomes available at a distinct
source, as when a protozoan excretes organic matter. The nutrients
then quickly spread out into a tiny, spherical ``patch.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, reporting in the journal Science, found that
this sets off a microscopic feeding frenzy, with bacteria
clustering around the patch for a few minutes and then dispersing.
</P>
<P>
   So feeding, rather than being a passive activity, becomes a
competitive one. And the study showed that, for patches over a
certain size, bacteria that can move toward nutrients or other
chemicals (known as chemotactic bacteria) have a distinct advantage
over those that cannot.

   _ Christine Lavin, ``Planet X'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week, a group of astronomers will turn their attention from
weighty issues such as the fate of the universe and the search for
new worlds to a question most people thought had been answered a
long time ago:
</P>
<P>
   What the heck is Pluto?
</P>
<P>
   Those who ring their buzzers and answer simply ``the ninth
planet'' are in agreement with history, tradition, and most
astronomy textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   But, it turns out, there is a heated debate going on among
astronomers right now as to whether, in addition to its traditional
status as a major planet, Pluto should be given a kind of ``dual
citizenship'' as an asteroid, or minor planet _ the diminutive
members of the sun's family.
</P>
<P>
   The issue will come to a head with the conclusion of a formal
vote by a division of the International Astronomical Union.
</P>
<P>
   Two coincidental facts have given rise to this brewing tempest
in terminology. First, just as the numbers on the calendar are
rapidly approaching the magical and much-anticipated rollover to
triple zeros, a sequential numbering system for the known asteroids
is about to reach the momentous number 10,000. The count, updated
monthly, stands at 9,826 and is growing by more than 100 a month,
and some astronomers would like to save that special number for a
truly special case _ Pluto. Second, a new family of objects in the
solar system has been discovered over the last six years _ a family
to which Pluto bears a striking resemblance.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of saving number 10,000 for Pluto, while still
retaining its major-planet name, originated with Brian Marsden, a
Cambridge, Mass. astronomer who heads the International
Astronomical Union's Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams,
where astronomical discoveries are first reported, and its Minor
Planet Center, which maintains a rapidly-growing catalog of such
objects.
</P>
<P>
   When the first member of the new family _ known as the Kuiper
Belt _ was discovered in 1992, Marsden promptly asked the
provocative question of whether Pluto should, instead, be thought
of as the first of this class, rather than just the last of the
nine major planets. Soon, he began to think about the
rapidly-approaching number 10,000, and the idea clicked. Why not
Pluto?
</P>
<P>
   This apparently arcane discussion among astronomers about how to
organize their catalogs _ who knew asteroids even had numbers? _
seems to have touched a nerve in some quarters. A newspaper article
on the subject two years ago even inspired singer/songwriter
Christine Lavin to compose a lengthy and detailed ballad on the
subject. (Among other things, the song claims the distinction of
being the first to include an internet address, complete with
``http colon slash slash,'' in its lyrics.) She performed it at
Harvard's Sanders Theater earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL; 
``. . .others say that Pluto is an asteroid
</P>
<P>
   in the sun's gravitational pull
</P>
<P>
   but if you ask Clyde Tombaugh
</P>
<P>
   he'll tell you `That's all bull'.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among those who've gotten riled up by all this talk of celestial
demotion is astronomer David Levy, discoverer of 31 comets and
author of several astronomy books including a biography of Clyde
Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto in 1930 and died last year at the
age of 90.
</P>
<P>
   Levy feels strongly that defending Pluto's planethood is a
matter of protecting Tombaugh's honor and his legacy. He also
admits to being somewhat bewildered by the whole debate. ``I think
that doing such a thing would be a dreadful disservice to
history,'' Levy said last week. ``Pluto, by any definition I know,
is a major planet. . . Why is our time being wasted on a question
like this?''
</P>
<P>
   Marsden, meanwhile, is feeling a bit stung by all the rancor his
simple suggestion seems to have stirred up, and is getting
increasingly defensive about it. It started out as just a way to
find special significance for a special number, and to recognize a
new class of objects that, in terms of the evolution and behavior
of the solar system, do have a lot in common. Marsden also points
out that the Kuiper Belt _ a family of large icy objects extending
out beyond the orbit of Neptune _ may include other
still-undiscovered objects that could be as big as Pluto itself, or
even bigger. What will we call them?
</P>
<P>
   (No problem, says Levy; call them planets, too.)
</P>
<P>
   This has been a tough year for Marsden. He was criticized by
some astronomers for his announcement last March that an asteroid
called XF 11 might, just possibly, strike Earth in 2028. Within 24
hours other astronomers found earlier pictures of it that proved
there would be no collision, and some commentators _ and colleagues
_ were harsh about his ``premature'' announcement. Marsden
maintains that, until those earlier observations came to light, a
collision early next century was possible, and that without the
announcement those earlier pictures might not have been found.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, however, he is not eager to start another fight.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion of ``dual citizenship'' for Pluto makes sense, he
maintains. For one thing, observers searching for distant
solar-system objects sometimes get confused by Pluto. Minor planets
are catalogued in a way that allows observers to determine quickly
whether what they're seeing matches a known object or might be a
something not seen before.
</P>
<P>
   The nine major planets, however, are not in that catalog, so
astronomers sometimes report sightings of Pluto to the Bureau,
thinking they have found something new. Including Pluto in the
catalog would help to avoid confusion, he says.
</P>
<P>
   To confuse things further, now there are two proposals under
consideration. Richard Binzel, an astronomer at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, has proposed starting a numbering scheme
just for the Kuiper Belt objects, of which 85 (counting Pluto) have
now been found. He is not opposed to starting the list with Pluto
as K-1. The rest could be numbered K-2 and so on in their order of
discovery. The suggestion seems to be gathering steam.
</P>
<P>
   Binzel is not intending this as a demotion, either. ``When we
study the planets, we study their surfaces, their atmospheres,
their satellites,'' he said in an interview last week. ``Pluto has
all these attributes. It has been known as the ninth planet for
nearly three generations, so Pluto's planetary status is well
established. It's certainly not a minor planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why give it a separate designation? ``I think we need a new
numbering system for the Kuiper Belt,'' Binzel said, because ``I
think they are so different from the minor planets that they should
be in their own catalog. They are different in origin, different in
makeup, they may be different in evolutionary history. Creating a
new catalog emphasizes our understanding of the structure of the
solar system.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``. . .and now 20 astronomy textbooks
</P>
<P>
   refer to Pluto as less than a planet
</P>
<P>
   I guess if Pluto showed up at a planet convention
</P>
<P>
   the bouncer at the door might have to ban it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many astronomers have made such distinctions in their
college classes for years, and some astronomy textbooks now refer
to Pluto as less than a major planet. Even some elementary and
high-school texts now raise the question.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a 1990 text called Understanding the Universe says
this: ``Astronomers question whether it deserves the title
`planet'. . . Pluto should perhaps be called a `minor planet' or
`planetesimal.' ''
</P>
<P>
   William Hartmann, an astronomer at the University of Arizona and
author of a college-level astronomy text, said, ``It's entirely a
semantic issue at this point. But I believe words are important,
because they shade our understanding of the arrangement of the
universe. If Pluto were discovered today, we would surely have just
given it a number like one of the Kuiper Belt objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says Binzel. ``I would point out that Pluto is 10
times the size of any other Kuiper Belt object. If Pluto were
discovered today, there would be a roar over whether to call it a
planet. It's not cut and dried.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one likely outcome of the debate is that in the process
of deciding what to do about Pluto and the Kuiper Belt, astronomers
may for the first time establish a formal definition of just what a
planet is. The leading candidate was somewhat arbitrarily
constructed, to ensure that we still end up with the traditional
nine:
</P>
<P>
   A planet is any object orbiting the sun whose diameter is
greater than 1,000 kilometers. Pluto, at 1,440 kilometers, is
comfortably in. Ceres, the largest asteroid at 600 kilometers, is
out. The status quo prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after months of discussion, three options are being voted
on by a dozen members of the International Astronomical Union's
division on Planetary System Sciences. The votes, being tabulated
by e-mail and due in before Christmas, will determine whether to
leave things as they are, give Pluto the number 10,000, or start a
new list.
</P>
<P>
   Michael A'hearn, an astronomer at the University of Maryland and
president of that division, says he is aiming at a consensus,
rather than deciding by a simple majority, so it's possible that
there will be further discussion and some modification of one of
these options. But one way or another, Pluto's fate is likely to be
sealed within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At which point Lavin, who confesses she got a D in the only
astronomy course she ever took, might have to add new lines to her
song.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Ph.D.'s all disagree
</P>
<P>
   we don't know yet who's wrong or who's right
</P>
<P>
   but wherever you are, whatever you are,
</P>
<P>
   Pluto, we know you're out there tonight.''

   The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute has created a new
Web site to help physicians, researchers and asthma patients. The
Asthma Management Model System was started this month and is
designed to keep researchers, health-care professionals and the
public abreast of developments in asthma management.
</P>
<P>
   The system _ at www.nhlbi.nih.gov _ consists of Web-site links
for research, education and communications.
</P>
<P>
   The research link brings users to an interactive search engine
that ties them to scientific databases like Medline and Crisp. The
education link provides access to an electronic library,
patient-education programs and medical-education programs for
physicians. The communications link connects to the Web master,
provides access to asthma chat rooms and online forums, and invites
users to register for updates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AMMS provides quick access to information to keep
clinicians on the cutting edge of asthma management,'' said Dr.
Claude Lenfant, the institute director.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 15
million Americans have asthma, and 5 million to 6 million of those
are children. The National Institutes of Health reported that
asthma was the third-leading cause of hospitalization of children
under 15 and that asthma-related deaths among children 5 to 14 more
than doubled from 1979 to 1995.

   Choosing Nonhazardous Toys
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute holiday shoppers, take note: Many toys are not safe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the last year for which statistics are available,
Americans bought 2.6 billion toys and games. And according to
National Safe Kids, an organization for the prevention of childhood
injury, about 121,000 children ages 14 and under were treated in
emergency rooms for toy-related injuries. Nearly 60 percent were 4
or younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leading cause of toy-related deaths is choking,'' said
Mary Beth Ogle, coordinator of Tulsa Area Safe Kids at St. Francis
Hospital in Tulsa, Okla. ``Food items, small parts of toys, wheels
and buttons on clothes are all potential choking hazards.''
</P>
<P>
   Children under 3 are at the greatest risk of choking, because
they tend to put objects in their mouths. And boys of all ages
account for nearly two-thirds of toy-related injuries, including
strangulation, burns, poisoning, drowning and falls from riding
toys such as tricycles.
</P>
<P>
   National Safe Kids recommends these guidelines for selecting
age-appropriate toys:
</P>
<P>
   INFANTS Babies do not move much in their first months. But once
they learn to reach, roll over and sit up, they are at an increased
risk for choking. Recommended toys include activity quilts, stuffed
animals without button noses and eyes, bath toys, soft dolls, cloth
books and squeaky toys.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 1 TO 3 Toddlers are curious and intrepid, and they like to
climb, jump, throw and play rough-and-tumble games. Good toys
include books, blocks, fit-together toys, balls, pounding toys and
shape toys.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3 TO 5 Preschool children tend to think with their feet and
spend hours running around. Recommended indoor toys include
nontoxic art supplies, books, videos, musical instruments and large
blocks. Good outdoor toys are baseball tees, tricycles, slides and
swings.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 5 TO 9 These children are creative and more physically
active than younger children. Recommended toys include craft
materials, jump ropes, puppets, books and sports equipment.
Children 8 and older can begin to use electrical and
battery-operated toys.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 9 TO 14 These children can enjoy team sports and games that
demand increased dexterity, such as pick-up sticks and marbles.
Good toys include computers, microscopes, board games and sports
equipment.

   Sleeping Late Is No Disadvantage
</P>
<P>
   A new study has found that Benjamin Franklin might have had it
all wrong when he advised being early to bed and early to rise.
Night owls, British researchers have found, are just as likely as
early-rising larks to be healthy, wealthy and wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found no evidence that following Franklin's advice about
going to bed and getting up early was associated with any health,
socioeconomic or cognitive advantage,'' Dr. Catharine Gale and Dr.
Christopher Martyn reported in the current issue of The British
Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 1,229 men and women over 65, the researchers, from
the Environmental Epidemiological Unit at Southampton General
Hospital, found that owls were wealthier than larks. At least they
showed the largest mean income, the greatest access to a car and
the most indoor toilets.
</P>
<P>
   In the group surveyed, 356 were identified by their classical
circadian rhythms as larks, in bed before 11 p.m. and up before 8
a.m., and 318 as owls, turning in after 11 p.m. and getting up
after 8 a.m. The other subjects fell between. The numbers of men
and women were about equal in each group, but the owls tended to be
younger than either the larks or the others in the study.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that early risers somehow got more out of the day
``grew out of the need to make the best use of daylight,'' Dr. Gale
said, adding that many people have to alter their lark-owl
inclinations because of job demands.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gale, a definite lark, and Martyn, an owl, worked around
their different body clocks in compiling the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to compromise in writing the paper,'' Dr. Gale said.
``I feel at my most creative in the early morning, so I wrote the
results section then. My colleague feels at his peak in the late
afternoon and evening, so everything we wrote together was usually
put together between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.''

HARLEM FORUM CASTS DOUBT ON HIV AS CAUSE OF AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(rl) 
 By DAVID FRANCE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the very first hours of the AIDS crisis _ especially the
confusing interval between 1981, when the first cases were
reported, and 1982, when the mysterious blight was given a name _
there have been wild conspiracy theories.
</P>
<P>
   One theory fingered the CIA for a failed biological war against
Cuba that inadvertently backfired (scuba-diving operatives were
said to have fumbled a lethal vial and broken it against a rock in
Haiti). Another theory held that this was no new virus at all, but
African swine fever, a deadly danger being hushed up by the pork
industry. Still another theory was that the virus had been
engineered by government scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, much of this early suspicion fell away. Or so it
seemed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, conspiracy peddlers still abound, especially among
blacks. ``There's a whole host of African-American people who
believe that HIV is not the cause of AIDS,'' said Mario Cooper,
founder of Leading for Life, an initiative to draft black and
Hispanic leaders into the AIDS battle. Leading for Life is a
project of the Harvard AIDS Institute.
</P>
<P>
   That fact was vividly demonstrated on Saturday at the Harlem
AIDS Forum sponsored by the Rev. Al Sharpton and his National
Action Network. Throughout the afternoon, to thunderous applause
and heartfelt approbation, speakers presented a score of assaults
on AIDS orthodoxy. Of the dozen or so speakers, only one subscribed
to the theory that HIV was what was making people sick _ and he
argued that it was being transmitted intentionally to blacks
through World Health Organization vaccine programs, part of what he
described as a genocidal project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to allow people to hear the disparate
perspectives, and do their own follow-up research,'' said Curtis
Cost, who organized the event, attended by more than 150 people
drawn mostly from Harlem. ``These are things that the public needs
to hear, and you can't hear them on television and read them in the
papers.''
</P>
<P>
   While health care experts are frustrated by such entrenched
fears, they acknowledge that African Americans have a unique reason
for distrusting health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   The notorious Tuskegee experiment, in which poor blacks were
denied treatment for syphilis and then monitored by federal
researchers, was the most egregious example, but many older
American blacks can recall segregated doctors' offices and
hospitals, or have experienced substandard medical treatment they
attribute to discrimination in the years since.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of African Americans conducted last year by the
Institute of Minority Health Research at Emory University's Rollins
School of Public Health, 74 percent of blacks believed they were
very likely or somewhat likely to be used by doctors as guinea pigs
without their consent. In the survey, 18 percent said they believed
HIV was an engineered microbe, and nearly 1 in 10 said AIDS was
part of a plot to kill blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a gut reaction,'' said Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint, a
professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School who writes
widely on African Americans and the health care system. ``When
people don't know science, and most people don't, it's not hard to
convince them that something unsavory may be going on. And this
becomes a conspiracy to get black people. That's how much they
believe that doctors in the system want to kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic has been especially cruel to blacks. Although
they make up only 13 percent of the nation's population, blacks
accounted for 57 percent of all new infections last year, according
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The annual AIDS
case rate among African-American women is 16 times that of white
women, while one out of 50 of the nation's black men is believed to
be infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been good news. In the past two years, infections
that occur as complications of HIV have sharply fallen, thanks to
powerful new AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, fewer blacks than whites with HIV are taking these
drugs, which are expensive and require complicated schedules. Since
1995, AIDS death rates for whites have dropped by almost 70
percent. By contrast, black death rates have fallen 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, director of AIDS programs at Harlem Hospital,
said blacks with HIV were more likely to demand evidence that a
drug worked before taking it. ``Building trust takes time,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said AIDS was just now coming to the top of the
community's political agenda, and said the Harlem AIDS Forum was
part of a productive ``catharsis.'' Dennis DeLeon, director of the
Latino Task Force on AIDS, agreed _ though he and Cooper both
steered clear of the forum. ``I think it's a community trying to
come to grips with the fact that this is an African-American
epidemic,'' DeLeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Poussaint was less forgiving. ``This is destructive, very
destructive,'' he said. ``If it gets people to stop getting tested,
and engaging in safe sex, it's just very sad. Because this is a
crisis situation in our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the theories advanced throughout the afternoon, the only
common thread was that AIDS was a hoax. Keidi Obi Awadu, a speaker
on public health issues who also goes by the name ``The Conscious
Rasta,'' advanced a fantastical scenario in which everything about
AIDS was in question. It is not caused by HIV, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is no epidemic at all, only a series of unrelated
health concerns that must be treated individually, he said. And the
condoms that are supposed to safeguard instead cause illness, he
said. ``Guess what,'' he told the rapt crowd, ``latex causes
allergies. Latex causes antibodies. The more condoms you're exposed
to, the more likely you are to test HIV positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers suggested that blacks in Harlem and Africa were
being used as guinea pigs in some mysterious experimentation, or
that the ultimate goal was depopulation of Africa in order to get
to the deposits of precious metals there.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC took most of the heat, having been renamed by one
speaker ``the Centers for Control by Diseases.'' Cost held the
federal agency partly responsible for perpetrating what he called a
great myth: that viruses exist at all. ``Nobody can see them except
for a handful of scientists with their microscopes, so we have to
take their word for it,'' Cost said.
</P>
<P>
   When Cost asked for a showing of hands from people who thought
HIV caused AIDS, not one hand rose. Then he asked people to raise
their hands if they believed AIDS was transmitted through sex.
Nobody did.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the thrust of the six-hour gathering seemed to be an
emotional plea to anyone with HIV to stop taking their medication.
Lynn Gannett, who identified herself as a data processor on an
early research trial of the AIDS drug AZT, spoke in a quavering
voice as she beseeched the audience. ``Please,'' she said, ``if you
are on these pills or if your baby is taking them, stop. I beg you.
The drugs can kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those at the forum, Bill McDougald, 49, a chauffeur,
sought to make sense of it all. ``The Harlem community collectively
feels that the information coming in is suspect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, summing it up, said: ``I don't agree with everything
they may say, but I think people should hear it. There are in my
community a disproportionate amount of victims.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The coldest air mass of the season will invade the Northeast on
Tuesday, punctuated by strong winds. Powerful gusts of wind will
accompany an Arctic front as it forges rapidly east from western
New York and western Pennsylvania. Gusts to 50 mph are possible,
particularly in valleys such as the Mohawk Valley of New York and
the Winnoski Valley of Vermont, which have open exposure to west
and northwesterly winds. Strong winds are also likely atop
mountains, with gusts well over 100 mph occurring at the summit of
Mt. Washington in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the sharp Arctic front, morning temperatures will be in
the 40's and 50's along the rainy Northeast seaboard. But, by
Wednesday morning, readings will have plummeted into the single
digits, teens or low 20's from Portland, Maine, to New York City,
where the first 32-degree temperature of the season will be
observed in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, snow showers and snow squalls will rage downwind of
Lake Erie and Lake Ontario as Arctic air is rapidly moistened in
transit over unseasonably tepid waters. Heavy snow is possible on
high ground across northwest Pennsylvania and southwest New York,
where moistened Arctic air is forced to rapidly ascend the sloping
terrain. Lake-effect snows will taper and gradually end as a ridge
of high pressure builds into the region later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An incursion of cold air will also take place in the Gulf Coast
states. Monday's high temperatures were in the 70's in northern
Louisiana. Tuesday, readings will struggle to exceed 32 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Minneapolis Mileposts
</P>
<P>
   Two wintry mileposts were just passed in Minneapolis. Two inches
of snow fell on Sunday, marking the season's first snowfall of one
inch or more in the Twin Cities area. Sunday's ``plowable'' snow
ranks as the city's seventh latest date on record for the first
snowfall of an inch or more. In quick fashion Monday morning, the
temperature in Minneapolis fell to minus 1 degree Fahrenheit,
marking the first sub-zero degree reading since January 20, 1998.
The 334-day streak without temperatures below zero degrees
Fahrenheit ranks as the city's third longest on record.

TIPS FOR EXERCISING WITH CHILDREN IN TOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ky.)   (af)  
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exercising with a small child in a jogging stroller, bike seat
or backpack seems like a great experience for both parent and
child. But safety experts are split over the idea, and offer a
longer list of cautions than you might have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bryant Stamford, a professor of exercise physiology at the
University of Louisville, Ky., who reviewed the subject in last
month's issue of the journal The Physician and Sports Medicine,
found expert opinion to be ``pretty polarized.''
</P>
<P>
   No solid statistics are available to guide the debate, he said,
``but it's the kind of thing where if an accident happens once,
it's probably going to catch a lot of attention.'' On the other
hand, he said, experts should remember that responsible parents
``deserve some credit'' for common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he warned that there are risks, especially in areas
where winter terrain makes the going rough. ``As a rule, the
younger the child, the greater the risk,'' he said. ``A crash could
be disastrous for a newborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Below, Stamford offers suggestions for runners, bikers and
hikers who want to take a small child along for the ride: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Running
</P>
<P>
   ``Pushing a stroller while you're jogging to me seems pretty
safe,'' Stamford said in a telephone interview. But when buying a
jogging stroller, he recommended choosing a model that is sturdy,
stable and will not tip on turns. ``Don't trade safety for
savings,'' he said. ``Expect to pay over $200.'' He also suggested
choosing a model with a deep seat and a seat belt, and wearing a
safety wrist strap to prevent the stroller from getting away from
you.
</P>
<P>
   When running with your child, never run in traffic or ``close
quarters of any kind,'' and avoid rough surfaces. Try to anticipate
hazards like car doors opening and never leave the stroller
unattended.
</P>
<P>
   If your child is an infant, try to keep his or her head from
bouncing. Large, slightly deflated tires can decrease jostling. A
child's bicycle helmet offers added protection.
</P>
<P>
   Stamford also recommended making sure the child is neither under
nor overdressed. ``Remember, what's comfortable for the exercising
adult is likely not for a seated child,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Biking
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that happen with bicycles bother me more,''
Stamford said. In the article, he noted that: ``Bicycles are, by
nature, unstable and adding a seat decreases stability even more.''
Quite a few experts reject the idea of child bicycle seats
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Others caution against carrying children heavier than 40 pounds
_ because of stability concerns _ or under a year old, because
their necks are weak and might be strained by bumps or the side to
side whipping motion of a bike laboring uphill.
</P>
<P>
   When buying a bike seat, make sure that it has spoke guards,
safety belt and adequate padding, and that it fits securely to the
bicycle frame. When riding, avoid clothing or blankets that could
get caught in the spokes or other moving parts. Do not ride at
night or in traffic, and you and your child should always wear
helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycle trailers seem safer, though they are far from ideal.
Communication with the parent is limited and the ride can be rough.
``Another factor is that trailers cost much more than seats,''
Stamford said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hiking
</P>
<P>
   Hiking with a child in a backpack ``may be the safer option,''
Stamford said, but backpacks ``are not risk free.'' Backpacks come
in various sizes, and large packs are generally more comfortable
for the child and offer greater support.
</P>
<P>
   When hiking, ``take smaller steps, avoid rough, hard-to-see or
slick terrain and don't walk too fast, especially when going
downhill.'' And never wear a baby backpack when fly-fishing, lawn
moving or skiing.
</P>
<P>
   In all these activities, Stamford concluded, the key is
vigilance. ``The average person tends to think that since I'm a
safe person, I can do this safely,'' he said. ``But some factors
will always be out of control. You can do it a thousand times
safely, but it only takes one little mishap to be pretty
catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   The best safety equipment, he said, is ``real serious thought.''

SCIENCE Q&AMP;A: THE APPENDIX 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(Eds: Please note that the word AT in parentheses has been used in
the endnote instead of the symbol, which is non-transmittable to
many newspaper systems.) (mk) 
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Does the appendix have any use in the human body?
</P>
<P>
   A. The vermiform (Latin for worm-shaped) appendix, a dead-end
branch of the intestines, plays at least a minimal role in the
immune system and is also sometimes regarded as a potential spare
part for replacing things like a diseased urinary bladder.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the adenoids, tonsils and spleen, the appendix is
classified as part of the mucosal immune system, a secondary set of
immune organs along the mucus-lined membranes of the body. This
system is also called the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue, or
MALT.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the gut, the appendix contains nodules called
Peyer's patches where certain types of immune cells mature and
``learn'' whether or not to react to foreign substances by calling
in cellular troops to attack the invaders. This function of the
appendix is most pronounced in the first few decades of life and
declines thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   However, the appendix is not a specialized immune organ and is
not essential to health. Dr. Carol Shoshkes Reiss, an immunologist
at New York University, explains that it is a vestigial part of the
gut that was important in animals whose diets were composed of more
fiber than humans consume.
</P>
<P>
   It is not normally full of immune cells called lymphocytes, she
said, ``except when it becomes infected, and since it is a pouch,
this occurs with some frequency.'' Then lymphocytes and
macrophages, which clean up microbial invaders, infiltrate in order
to deal with the infection.

THE BOY WHO HATES DECEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - He's an 8-year-old American boy who plays baseball and
basketball, watches ``The Simpsons'' on TV, roams the neighborhood
on his bicycle and hates December.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, his teacher in second grade asked her class to
write an essay about the holiday season. In big tilted letters
printed on blue-lined paper, his began, ``I hate December because I
don't celebrate Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   It continued, ``Why I don't celebrate Christmas is because I'm a
Muslim. And Muslims don't celebrate Christmas. Instead they
celebrate Eid.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true what he wrote. But these are only the religious
technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   For Osman Chaudhry, a child born in the United States of America
in the decade before the new millennium, there are larger, more
complicated, more pressing concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas is about toys,'' he wrote. ``Eid is about prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Osman's mother, Mumtaz, mailed me his essay. ``I am writing this
letter to draw attention to the stress that all the non-Christian
children have to go through during the Christmas season,'' she said
in a note.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when I spoke to her, she added, ``When you are new to a
country, you want to become a part of that country and still to
maintain your heritage. This is understandable to an adult but very
difficult for a little boy.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Kids don't understand &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Osman's parents emigrated from Pakistan in 1985. They have three
older boys for whom Christmas wasn't a difficult adjustment,
perhaps because they're closer to one another in age and formed
their own small support group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Osman is mostly with his friends from school,'' Mrs. Chaudhry
says. ``He sees all the commercials on television. And sees what
goes on in the stores. It is everywhere, the toys and gifts and
emphasis on what people are buying.''
</P>
<P>
   She wrote a letter to Osman's teacher, hoping she might explain
Osman's religious background to the other children. And she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher understands,'' Osman tells me. ``But the kids
still don't.''
</P>
<P>
   For Muslims, the holiest month of their year, Ramadan, begins in
December. From dawn to dusk, believers drink no water and eat no
food. This year, for the first time, Osman will join his family in
the fast.
</P>
<P>
   The end of Ramadan is Eid ul-Fitr. Gifts are exchanged then.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these are most often small things,'' Mrs. Chaudhry says.
``We do not wish to have the gifts outweigh the religious parts.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Protecting a tradition &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's trying to protect a tradition, to preserve an identity. To
keep the American lifestyle from rolling over her immigrant family
like a tidal wave, washing away the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want all our boys to know our traditions,'' she says. ``I
want them to know they are a part of something that is important
and goes back a long time. I feel if I do not do this then the
things we believe in will die out. But who can blame a child for
wanting what other children have? What his friends have?''
</P>
<P>
   To make it a little easier on their boy, the Chaudhrys will give
Osman his Eid presents early this year. Even sacred traditions, it
seems, must be altered in small ways to keep from being lost _ at
least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   `'Christmas is about toys,'' Osman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And it's true.
</P>
<P>
   What he can't imagine _ not because he's a Muslim but because
he's an American boy _ is that it wasn't always true. &QL;

GALLERIES OF NEIMAN MARCUS A HAVEN FOR BIG SPENDER

<P>
   PHOENIX - Got a million dollars burning a hole in your pocket
and looking for a place to plunk it down for something nifty for
Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   The Galleries of Neiman Marcus might have what you're looking
for.
</P>
<P>
   The upscale retailer is testing the prototype home and gift
store in three locations nationally, including Biltmore Fashion
Park in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix store opened Saturday, offering an array of fine
jewelry, china, crystal and collectibles for shoppers who want to
spend seven figures, or just a few dollars. The new store carries
some knockout price tags but doesn't want to be just a haven for
big spenders.
</P>
<P>
   But it certainly has the capacity to max out a credit card.
Among its most expensive items: seven colored diamonds selling for
$1.4 million, and an emerald and diamond necklace, earrings,
bracelet and ring priced at $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the low end: A $10 candle in a coconut shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really all things to all people here,'' said Steve
Magner, vice president of Galleries of Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus is known as a high-end retailer that sells
expensive apparel in large stores, many of them in the
100,000-square-foot range. But the company is looking to take
advantage of the popularity of its hard good sales and also move
into new markets.
</P>
<P>
   At 12,000 square feet, the Biltmore store is much smaller than
Neiman's location at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Neiman picked
Phoenix for a Galleries so it could judge the impact of its sales
on a mainline store.
</P>
<P>
   Three Galleries stores are planned initially. One has opened in
the Cleveland area and the third is scheduled to open in Seattle
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do what we want them to do we will build 15 to 25,''
Magner said. ``This may be the venue that Neiman Marcus may use to
brand itself internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The store was designed by architect Richard Gluckman, who has
several museums to his credit, including the Georgia O'Keeffe
Museum in Santa Fe. Magner said it's intended to stand apart from
the mainline store, with a contemporary look that includes a
sandstone floor and sandstone walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merchandise is jumping out at you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Galleries isn't likely to intimidate the Biltmore's
well-heeled shoppers. The mall already has a reputation for
exclusive retailers that the Galleries will bolster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will add a level of merchandise and
sophistication we certainly have at the mall, but they will be the
centerpiece of all that,'' said Gary Doyle, the mall's general
manager. &QL;

MORE AMERICANS SHED WRAPPINGS OF MATERIALISTIC HOLIDAY

 &HT;    And he puzzled three hours, 
 &HT;    till his puzzler was sore. 
 &HT;    Then the grinch thought of something he hadn't before! 
 &HT;    `Maybe Christmas,' he thought, 
 &HT;    `doesn't come from a store. 
 &HT;    `Maybe Christmas perhaps 
 &HT;    means a little bit more!' 
 &HT;    _ ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' by Dr. Seuss 
 &HT;    _ 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's always about money, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   American families spend an average of $800 to $1,200 a year on
Christmas. Well, this year, no more.
</P>
<P>
   No more Tickle Me Elmo. No more ``Martha Stewart Living.'' No
more lavish gifts, office parties, ``secret Santas,'' expensive
dinners or credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity movement, the backlash against '80s greed, has
finally gotten around to taking on the Christmas monster. But
wouldn't you know that how to do it has become its own cottage
industry.
</P>
<P>
   There are a dozen books on the subject. There are groups that
sponsor church seminars, groups that collect data, groups that push
for a revolt. There are even Web pages devoted to getting out of
exchanging gifts. (Try a ``Gift of Time'' certificate.)
</P>
<P>
   No wonder it's come to this. According to a poll by the
nonprofit group The Center for a New American Dream, most Americans
admit there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the people surveyed, 70 percent said they would welcome
less emphasis on gifts and spending.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most respondents said they spend one of every three hours
during the holidays on a stressful activity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Respondents said it takes them an average of six months to pay
off holiday bills.
</P>
<P>
   Heard enough?
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth resident Jeanie Crane decided 10 years ago she didn't
want to buy anything she could live without. She cut back at
Christmas, though her family was never nuts about celebrating
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Crane, a small-business owner and consultant who is 57, bought
calendars for her son and daughter-in-law this year, and instead of
overspending as some grandparents do, she wrote and illustrated a
storybook for her grandson.
</P>
<P>
   She prefers to spend her energy on gifts of time. As a gift for
older people, she suggests visits or running errands. She
encourages older family members to write or record family history
as a gift to the younger generation. Crane buys at thrift shops,
where gifts can be recycled.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the simplifying-Christmas movement is based in the
Earth-friendly causes that promote recycling and equate consumerism
to trashing the planet. But some people are driven by a desire to
focus on the Christian roots of the season. And others are like the
Boston mother who told author Elaine St. James, ``Last year I woke
up the day after Christmas, and I was so tired I just wanted to
cry.''
</P>
<P>
   St. James, author of ``Simplify Your Life,'' has written
``Simplify Your Christmas: 100 Ways to Reduce the Stress and
Recapture the Joy of the Holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tips are extreme, others are obvious. St. James suggests
sending no Christmas cards, cleaning up a vacant lot, posting a
list of chores for your holiday guests, bowing out of the office
gift exchange, and throwing out women's magazines starting in
September. The reason: They encourage unrealistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   St. James argues that shopping by catalog or shopping through
the year doesn't count. ``Simplifying the holidays is not the same
thing as organizing them,'' she writes. ``When you organize, you're
just reshuffling the same heavy load. When you simplify, you
actually eliminate a large chunk of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Where to start?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unplug the Christmas Machine: A Complete Guide to Putting Love
&AMP; Joy Back into the Season'' helps family members discover which
activities stress them out. There are exercises for men, ``The
Christmas Stagehands,'' exercises for women, ``The Christmas
Magicians,'' even exercises for kids.
</P>
<P>
   If the thought of going to a bookstore causes you anxiety, skip
it. That's the message from Adbusters, an environmental group that
started ``Buy Nothing Day,'' which has become an international
boycott on the biggest shopping day of the year, the day after
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas has long been the last fort built strong enough to
ward off the simplicity movement. Crane explains that there's a
``magical'' sort of rationalization that people bring to holiday
overdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have brainwashed ourselves into thinking it takes
money to make something special,'' she said. ``I do understand how
people can get wrapped up in it and how it can be fun. But do you
own the things or do the things own you?''

 &HT;    Cremins hopes for redemption against UNC
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Kentucky humiliated Georgia Tech in front of 23,614 in the
Georgia Dome on Saturday, Yellow Jacket coach Bobby Cremins
couldn't explain Tech's embarrassing performance. ``What can I
say?'' Cremins asked after watching his team lose 80-39.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning the veteran coach subscribed to the theory that
pictures were better than words. ``I showed them the first 20
minutes of the game,'' he said. ``No more needed to be said.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets get a chance at redemption tonight when they play
No. 7 North Carolina at Alexander Memorial Coliseum. The Tar Heels
have started 12-1 in what was supposed to be a rebuilding year.
Still, Tech's biggest challenge might be overcoming its Saturday
performance, more than anything it'll see from North Carolina in
the conference opener for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all embarrassed, all of us,'' Cremins said. ``We know
we can play a lot better. Our shot selection was poor, and when we
did get good shots, they just wouldn't go down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kentucky made us look bad and stupid, and we're neither of
those,'' he said. ``Offensively we were out of sync. We didn't play
together as a team. It was like five people out there playing, but
not together.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, despite its record, isn't as good as last year's
edition. Coach Bill Guthridge has said on several occasions that
his Tar Heels are over-rated. Gone are All-America selections
Antawn Jamison and Vince Carter, along with guard Shammond
Williams. Ed Cota injured his thumb against Louisville and didn't
play Saturday against Dartmouth. Another starter, freshman Jason
Capel, missed the game because of an illness in his family.
</P>
<P>
   Both are expected to play against the Jackets, along with
freshman guard Ronald Curry, who is through with his football
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year North Carolina was one of the most exciting teams
I've seen in our league,'' Cremins said. ``Bill Guthridge did a
wonderful job in winning the national coach of the year award. He
had my vote. If you lose two like they did (in Jamison and Carter),
it's hard for them to be as good. But Ed Cota has always been one
of the best point guards in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins refused to get too down on his team. ``Saturday against
Kentucky was a great setting with 23,000 in the stands, and we
didn't live up to the setting. We were playing well, but our last
game was a very poor showing. Our overall record is 7-2, and I'm
very pleased with that. We split with Georgia and Kentucky, and
that wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blowouts occur,'' he said. ''They're not very pretty, but they
happen to everybody. Remember when Nebraska beat Florida in
football a few years ago? I've seen it happen to a lot of good
programs like Duke and North Carolina. But against Kentucky, we
played brainless.''

 &HT;    Major matchups dot this week's schedule
 &HT;    By Leo Willingham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's only December, but tonight's Duke-Kentucky
matchup could have the intensity of an NCAA tournament game.
</P>
<P>
   The second-ranked Blue Devils (10-1) and third-ranked Wildcats
(10-1) will meet in the regular season for the first time since the
1988-89 season in tonight's second game of the Jimmy V Classic in
East Rutherford, N.J. The teams have met in two of the most
thrilling games in NCAA tournament history, Duke winning 104-103 in
overtime on Christian Laettner's buzzer-beater in the 1992 East
Regional final and Kentucky rallying from a 17-point deficit to win
86-84 in the South Regional final last season.
</P>
<P>
   Duke and Kentucky have been college basketball's premier teams
of the 1990s, and the winner could stake its claim as the top team
of the decade. Duke has won two NCAA titles and has four Final Four
appearances during the '90s, while Kentucky has advanced to the
title game the last three years, winning in 1996 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   However, both coaches are playing down the significance of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this game was for a national championship or a regional
title, then it'd fit into whatever equation you're using to
determine the top team of the 90s,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski
said. Kentucky's Tubby Smith said,'' Any one game is not going to
determine the history of Kentucky basketball.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Ron Jirsa's 39th birthday was Monday. In his
second season as Georgia coach, he hasn't had much else to
celebrate lately, with his Bulldogs losing two overtime games in a
row. Georgia, which fell to 7-3 with Saturday's loss to Fresno
State, is a team desperately needing some sort of spark heading
into tonight's home game against East Carolina. The Dogs might find
some new life in freshman guards Terrence Edwards and Shawn Fields,
who will make their debuts against the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll both play,'' Jirsa said. ``We'll see how much, but
they'll both play.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, the younger brother of former Georgia tailback Robert
Edwards, now with the New England Patriots of the NFL, and Fields
officially joined the Bulldogs before the 86-82 loss to Fresno
State. They practiced for the first time on Sunday, followed by two
sessions on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has labored through its first 10 games with only three
guards _ seniors G.G. Smith and Ray Harrison and freshman D.A.
Layne _ after Adrian Jones suffered a season-ending foot injury in
the preseason. Smith has averaged 34.9 minutes per game, and
Harrison has averaged 32.8 in the eight games he has finished. He
played just six minutes against West Virginia and didn't play
against Furman with a shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina arrives in Athens with plenty of confidence after
stunning South Carolina 56-34 Saturday in Columbia. In that game,
the Pirates took an early 8-0 lead but then went more than nine
minutes without a field goal. But the Gamecocks managed only 13
first-half points en route to their lowest-ever scoring total in
Frank McGuire Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the lowest field-goal total, field-goal percentage,
first-half scoring and total points for South Carolina under
sixth-year coach Eddie Fogler. The Pirates used a 20-2 second-half
run sparked by three consecutive 3-pointers by freshman guard
Brandon Hawkins, to put away the Gamecocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``(East Carolina) plays good defense, and they play a lot of
people,'' Jirsa said. ``They play good defense, both man to man and
in the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia struggled at East Carolina a year ago, needing forward
Badi Oliver's free throw with no time left for a 55-54 victory.
After Harrison tied the game with 35 seconds left, the Pirates'
Raphael Edwards missed a jumper. Georgia took over on an
alternate-possession jump ball. Oliver caught a full-court pass
from Larry Brown with 1.8 seconds left and was fouled by Edwards as
he turned to shoot.

 &HT;    Falcons miss is Arizona's gain
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he held his breath early in the second round of the '97
draft, Arizona Cardinals vice president for player personnel Bob
Ferguson wondered if he would ever see a scene like the one that
transpired in Sun Devil Stadium on Sunday. Ferguson and Cardinals
coach Vince Tobin desperately wanted quarterback Jake ``The Snake''
Plummer, the local hero from Arizona State, in the second round.
With only the journeyman Kent Graham to develop at quarterback, the
Cardinals needed a savior, and preferably a box-office draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for sure Dan (Reeves) would take him in Atlanta
because the feeling was he wanted a young guy behind Chris Chandler
at the time,'' Ferguson recalled. ``But then the Falcons passed
twice on Plummer (taking defensive lineman Nathan Davis and
tailback Byron Hanspard) in the round, . . . and he was just
sitting there for us. Sometimes you've got to be more lucky than
good. Sometimes things just work out.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons had selected Plummer _ and, apparently, there was
no sentiment for him in the war room _ he'd still be sitting behind
Chandler. In Arizona, he got the chance to play, and Monday he
earned a four-year contract extension worth about $6 million per
year. The new contract came just a day after he authored a
brilliant last-minute rally to get the Cards to the brink of their
first postseason berth since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (contract) already was agreed to before Sunday's game,''
said Plummer, whose cool demeanor is often likened to that of Joe
Montana, ``but bringing us back like that, . . . I hope it showed
management here and the fans what they can expect.''
</P>
<P>
   No new Leaf
</P>
<P>
   San Diego veterans have answered the question why Chargers
lame-duck coach June Jones hasn't gone back to Ryan Leaf for a few
late-season starts. According to several players, the first-rounder
has been missing meetings and frequently falling asleep in the
sessions he's attended since being benched in favor or Craig
Whelihan.
</P>
<P>
   On the line
</P>
<P>
   If you still need convincing that the New York Jets' Bill
Parcells is the most brilliant coach of this era or that assistant
head coach Bill Belichick has one of the NFL's best defensive
minds, look no further than the makeshift front four the team used
to capture the AFC East. Left end Rick Lyle flopped in an earlier
stint with the Cleveland Browns and had just three sacks entering
the season. Right end Anthony Pleasant was a solid player early in
his career, but injuries marred his last two seasons, and he had a
half-sack for Atlanta in '97. Right tackle Ernie Logan personifies
the term journeyman, having played for four teams in seven seasons.
The left tackle is former Georgia star Jason Ferguson, who fell all
the way to the seventh round of the '97 draft after testing
positive for marijuana at that year's combine workouts. Exclusive
of incentives and bonuses, the four earn an aggregate $1.136
million in base salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Toe jam
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas training staff has informed coach Chan Gailey that
Deion Sanders is only a longshot to be able to play in the team's
first playoff game. Sanders continues to rehabilitate a sprained
big toe and still can't drive off his left foot. The feeling now is
that there is ligament damage. Sanders attempted to practice last
Wednesday and lasted only one play.
</P>
<P>
   Without a Hitch
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota defensive coordinator Foge Fazio went into this year's
draft hoping to select former Vanderbilt cornerback Corey Chavous
in the first round to replace the departed Dewayne Washington.
Instead the Vikings used their No. 1 pick on wideout Randy Moss and
traded for New England corner Jimmy Hitchcock. Like most
coordinators in the NFL, Fazio was skeptical of Hitchcock, who had
been inconsistent in three seasons with the Patriots and was
rendered expendable with the first-round addition of Tebucky Jones.
There are no such doubts now about Hitchcock. He has seven
interceptions and has returned three of them for touchdowns. ``He's
not blessed with tremendous ability,'' Fazio said Monday, ``but
Jimmy is a hard worker who studies tape like crazy and has turned
himself into a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Zebra time
</P>
<P>
   As commissioner Paul Tagliabue and aides continued to seek a
viable instant-replay system that does not include a coach's
challenge to trigger a review, game officials suffered through
another tough weekend. Buffalo's comeback bid against the Jets
ended on an interception by strong safety Victor Green that clearly
hit the ground. Bengals cornerback Artrell Hawkins clearly landed
out of bounds while making an interception of a desperation heave
by Pittsburgh's Mike Tomczak. The co-chairmen of the competition
committee, Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren and Tampa Bay GM Rich
McKay, seem ready to lobby for replay at the March owners meetings,
but they prefer a system that is not based on the coach making a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tops
</P>
<P>
   Plummer shares the honor with teammate Frank Sanders, who had 10
catches for 138 yards. The former Auburn wideout now has career
bests in catches (81) and receiving yards (1,039). Of his 10
catches Sunday, seven were for first downs, and three times he
converted third-and-long situations.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive best
</P>
<P>
   New England's Lawyer Milloy, arguably the best young strong
safety in the league, had 14 tackles and two pressures of Steve
Young in the Patriots' victory over San Francisco. Playing close to
the line of scrimmage, Milloy did a solid job of ``spying'' on
Young and rendered the bootleg play ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Truly special
</P>
<P>
   Dallas tight end Eric Bjornson, who doubles as the holder on
placement tries, ran seven yards for a touchdown on a fake
field-goal try. The first rushing attempt of Bjornson's four-year
career was the game's lone touchdown and secured the NFC East title
for the slumping Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing . . . .
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sunday's game, Chicago first-year tailback James
Allen had carried just 13 times for 47 yards in his career. In the
Bears' 24-3 victory over Baltimore, the former Oklahoma standout
replaced an injured Edgar Bennett and rushed for 163 yards _ 135 of
them by halftime _ on 23 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Stat stuff
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Gary Anderson, who hasn't missed a kick all season,
has 153 points. That's two points more than the hapless
Philadelphia Eagles have scored as a team.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate for the worst decision of the year: Eagles quarterback
Bobby Hoying rejected a four-year, $20 million contract offer in
training camp. He might never see that kind of money again. . . .
Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie has earned more than $2.3 million
in bonuses since replacing Rob Johnson as the Bills starter. . . .
Green Bay tailback Dorsey Levens has regained much of his cutting
ability, but he still can't explode as well as he did before
breaking his ankle. . . . Despite the solid late-season performance
of Kent Graham, the Giants still want to add a veteran quarterback
during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's John Randle, who played at least three snaps at each
of the four defensive line positions, on Jacksonville rookie
quarterback Jonathan Quinn: ``After we hit him in the head a few
times, he probably thought he was seeing double. But, nah, that was
just me playing all over the place.''

 &HT;    Levitz eliminating more jobs, closing stores
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Levitz Furniture Corp. is making another round of job
cuts and store closings as it tries to return to profitability. The
company announced Monday it will shut down more than a third of its
stores and cut 25 percent of its workers. About 1,000 of the
company's 4,000 workers will lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Levitz pulled out of the metro Atlanta market when it closed six
stores in February. The Boca Raton, Fla.-based company has been
operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since September
1997. The first wave of cuts closed 18 stores and laid off 300
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's No. 2 furniture retailer will close 27 more stores
in eight states in the South and Midwest while leaving open 63
stores on the east and west coasts and Minneapolis, said Edward L.
Grund, who became the company's chairman and chief executive in
November. Stores are being closed in Florida, Texas, Maryland,
Virginia, Indiana, Louisiana, Kansas and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Levitz also plans to consolidate its 65 warehousing operations
into 17 buildings. The company will use the proceeds from the sale
of closed stores, warehouses and inventory to reduce debt,
refurbish some existing stores and open new ones.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has no plans to reenter the competitive metro
Atlanta market. ``Our share of the market was too fragmented,''
said Mike McCreery, senior vice president and chief financial
officer. ``We're focusing on markets where we have a significant
presence that's profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitz has battled declining sales in recent years as a flood of
new competitors courted consumers with store formats that resembled
home interiors, rather than warehouses. As a result, the company
plans to open seven ``model'' stores that feature dining rooms and
bedrooms.

HOW TO HAVE A PICTURE-PERFECT HOLIDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MEDA KESSLER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Admit it. Somewhere, there is a shoe box or two crammed with
blurry, overexposed holiday memories.
</P>
<P>
   You hang on to them, because, well, you can't just throw away
family photographs; they mean so much. So let's take a look at
them, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, here's one of your 5-year-old putting tinsel on the tree.
Except that she's so far away, you can't make her out from the
family dog _ which you think is also in the photo _ maybe.
</P>
<P>
   And here's another favorite of your husband opening up his
now-prized telescope you got for him a few years back. Except that
all you can see is the top of his forehead. Whoops.
</P>
<P>
   Oooh. And here's one of everyone standing rather stiffly in the
living room. My, doesn't Grandpa look happy to be there?
</P>
<P>
   OK. Stash these away. Now let's figure out how to take quality
photos that will actually make it into a real photo album. Or
frame. Or make a Christmas card for next year.
</P>
<P>
   LIGHTS, CAMERAS, BATTERIES?
</P>
<P>
   These tips are addressed to those who use point-and-shoot
cameras. The manufacturers of these little gems have really worked
to make them quite user-friendly, but they are not totally
idiot-proof. There's always a way to put that finger in front of
the lens if you try hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   1. Stock up on film and batteries. It's very disheartening to
miss out on a great shot because a weak battery prevents the flash
from going off or you used the last roll on those carolers who
stopped by on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   2. Practice. If you've never used a camera before, take a few
practice rolls to see how it works, especially if you're using the
flash. Actually figure out which button you press to take the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   3. Delegate. If you've decided that it's physically impossible
for you to take a good photo, hand the camera off to someone else,
maybe one of the older kids home from college or your
brother-in-law. Arrange this ahead of time and have on hand a small
bag to hold film, batteries and anything else that person might
need. This also ensures that you might actually be in a few photos
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   SAY CHEESE
</P>
<P>
   1. Don't be afraid to get close to your subjects. These cameras
allow you to move in nice and tight _ about two to three feet _
without the flash overexposing the skin tones. Tighter shots mean
less clutter in the background.
</P>
<P>
   2. Try to avoid posed photos. The tree sparkles, the presents
are unwrapped and everyone is having a great time. Why ruin the
mood by insisting that everyone stop what they are doing to stare
uncomfortably in the camera? If you do want posed photos, set up a
small area in your home strictly for photo purposes. Pick out a
comfy chair and pull it away from the wall a bit to avoid harsh
flash shadows. Remove paintings or other wall objects. Drape the
chair with a neutral-colored piece of cloth so as not to clash with
your subjects' clothing. This will be the perfect place to get a
shot of the in-laws or of Grandma holding the new baby.
</P>
<P>
   3. Avoid big group shots. These little cameras just are not
meant for photographing large numbers of people. If you insist on
getting photos of everyone, try breaking them up in small groups.
(See No. 2.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Be aware of your surroundings. A perfect photo can be ruined
by that potted plant growing out of someone's head or those dirty
dishes stacked up in the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   5. Be creative. Hand out disposable cameras to everyone and let
them chronicle the holiday events with their own eye. It's always
fun to see things from a kid's-eye view. Photograph everything.
There's more to Christmas than just unwrapping gifts. Have the
camera handy during the holiday dinner and the kids' nap time. Take
pictures of yourselves. Hold the camera out an arm's length away
and shoot fun couples snapshots of you and your new
daughter-in-law, or even you and the cat.

NEW JAPANESE BUDGET RAISES SPECTER OF HUGE DEBT BURDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government's proposed national budget aims
to lift the economy out of recession, but its vast size underscores
the pressing worry that a big spending spree now will break the
official coffers later.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering the economy was clearly a theme throughout the
process of drawing up the budget, whose details were disclosed
Monday, but the ballooning costs of financing that revival raise
the specter of paying for it and suggest that the government has
only a small window to spur growth before it gets stuck on a
collision course with a looming debt burden.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget amounts to a record 81.86 trillion yen, or
$708 billion, for its next fiscal year, which ends on March 31,
2000. The budget, which is expected to be approved by the Cabinet
on Friday before it goes before the Parliament next month, includes
a significant increase in spending for the construction of roads,
bridges, dams and other public works intended to revive the sinking
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, the world was singing the praises of
Japan's prudent fiscal balances, and the government embarked on a
disciplined fiscal austerity to further trim its budget deficit.
But now, mired in the worst recession since the end of World War
II, the government has been forced to abandon that fiscal
austerity, and its domestic finances are in sorry shape.
</P>
<P>
   At a projected 9.8 percent for this fiscal year, Japan's budget
deficit is already the highest as a percentage of national economic
output, or gross domestic product, among industrial countries.
Moreover, its total national debt is projected to rise to about 110
percent of the national economy for the fiscal year ended in March
2000. That is second only to the national debt level of Italy,
which is bringing that burden down just as Japan's level is rising.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of March 2000, the amount of outstanding government
bonds, which will finance much of the deficit, is expected to rise
to 327 trillion yen, or $2.8 trillion. As tax revenues plummet with
the recessionary economy, the government must rely on issuing more
bonds to cover the larger budget shortfalls. In the next fiscal
year, the government plans to issue a record 71.13 trillion yen in
bonds, including 31 trillion yen, or $269 billion, in new bonds to
meet a deficit shortfall of 40 percent, the first time in nearly
two decades that the gap will be that large.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a time bomb,'' a senior finance ministry
budgetary official said.
</P>
<P>
   The government also proposed raising spending by 5.7 percent, to
nearly 53 trillion yen, or $459 billion, under a special program,
called ``zaito.'' This program is often referred to as the ``shadow
budget'' because the government taps extra money from the postal
savings and insurance system and spends the money on special loans
to small businesses and other projects aimed at stimulating the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Financing growth with debt could not be cheaper because interest
rates are just a sliver above zero. But the rising debt burden
makes the government much more sensitive to increases in interest
rates, which could rise if growth picks up substantially.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the concern lies with the current economic
contraction. Even with the government's big splurge, and even with
long-term tax cuts that are lowering the effective individual and
corporate income tax rates for next year, consumers may still be
wary of stepping up spending. Many are concerned that tax cuts now
will be paid for with tax increases later. Consumers are also
worried that retooling the economy will mean that more companies
will nudge more workers off the payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Taichi Sakaiya, head of the Economic Planning Agency, told
reporters Monday that the unemployment figure, now at a record 4.3
percent, ``might rise for a while'' before it slipped back in the
second half of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The risks of failing to revive the economy became apparent over
the weekend as the government raised its projection for economic
contraction for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   It said that growth in gross domestic product would contract by
2.2 percent, compared with an earlier projected contraction of 1.8
percent. Meanwhile, the government projected economic growth of
five-tenths of a percent in the next fiscal year, a rosier outlook
than forecasts made by private economists.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund said Monday that it projected
that the Japanese economy would contract 2.8 percent this year and
shrink five-tenths of 1 percent in 1999.

 &HT;    Atlanta mag's top nuts: Mayor, Mitch
 &HT;    By Don O' Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At a time of year when many magazines are trotting out
their best and worst lists, Atlanta ($3.50) has launched its first
Golden Goober Awards. There are no ``bests'' here. The magazine
proudly announces that it has compiled the pick of the crop of
1998's ``rogues, rascals, goofballs, doofuses, yahoos and clowns.''
An obvious Golden Goober goes to the U.S. Department of
Transportation for warning airlines that they must create
peanut-free buffer zones around passengers who are allergic to the
legume. Other notable recipients: Mayor Bill Campbell (concerning
that matter of computing crime statistics), Mitch Skandalakis (for
negative campaign ads), Ted Turner (for his overreaction to the
Tailwind scandal) and Ralph David Abernathy III (for his brushes
with the law and sloppy bookkeeping).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The year in Time: By now, we already know that President
Clinton and Kenneth Starr are Time's ($3.95) Men of the Year. But
the magazine also offers entertaining features on winners and
losers of 1998 as well as a fine profile of Mark McGwire. Winners
include Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jesse ``the Mind'' Ventura, Adam
Sandler and Rick Schroder. And there are no surprises on the losers
list: Clinton, ``Godzilla'' and Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Beyond Clinton: Newsweek ($3.50) is packed with news of the
impeachment and impending Senate trial, but the magazine also has
an intriguing interview by author Doris Kearns Goodwin with Hillary
Clinton's former aide Lisa Caputo about the first lady's future.
Caputo predicts Mrs. Clinton will follow Eleanor Roosevelt's
example and enjoy a productive public life for years to come. And,
in a look at the year in literature, Malcolm Jones revisits the
debate over Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in Full.'' In response to charges
by Norman Mailer and John Updike that the novel was
``entertainment,'' not ``literature,'' Wolfe wonders why ``these
old men are rising off their pallets to condemn my book?'' The
answer, he says with his usual modesty, is ``because my book has
cast a very big shadow, and people like Mailer and Updike find
themselves in the dark. And what do you do when you find yourself
in the dark? You whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of Wolfe, Entertainment Weekly ($3.50) anoints the
Atlanta-based novel the No. 1 book of the year in its Best &AMP; Worst
Issue. The worst book? ``Message in a Bottle'' by Nicholas Sparks,
a tear-jerker that is headed for the big screen with Kevin Costner
and Paul Newman. The magazine's picks for best and worst movies are
``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Simon Birch,'' respectively.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Winter writing: In a literary-heavy New Yorker ($3.95),
authors Richard Ford, Annie Proulx and others provide stories to
help the winter nights seem shorter. In ``The Blood Bay,'' Proulx
recasts an old Irish folktale in the plains of Wyoming during the
winter of 1886-87; filmmaker Ethan Coen recounts a man's encounter
with a large deer on a snowy road in ``The Buck Stops Here''; and
Ken Kesey's ``Otto the Bloody'' depicts New Year's Eve in 999.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Luxe ($8), a slick, very upscale marketing
magazine, profiles Virgin Group Chairman Richard Branson. The
founder of Virgin Records and Virgin Airlines operates with the
philosophy that if he wants it, then others will, too. . . .
Jezebel ($3.95), the Atlanta-based magazine, spotlights Southern
actress Lori Petty on the eve of her soon-to-be-released film
``Club Land.'' Also featured are ``Five Master Bedrooms to Die
For'' and a behind-the-scenes look at the Atlanta Channel on local
television.

 &HT;    TV Guide on CNN's Operation Tailwind
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first installment of a detailed four-part story in
TV Guide on CNN's Operation Tailwind fiasco has very little
significant new information. The report, which will continue over
the next three weeks, delves into the background of CNN's report,
which alleged that U.S. military forces used sarin nerve gas in
Laos in 1970. The report aired in June and was retracted in July,
and several lawsuits by veterans are pending against CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Part 1 of the report obviously relies heavily on April Oliver,
the former CNN producer who was fired for her role in the ``Valley
of Death'' report, but who still maintains it was true. (CNN has
never said the story was false.) TV Guide even reports Oliver's CNN
salary: $65,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   TV Guide's report will probably be the most exhaustive on CNN
and Tailwind, at least until the first book is written, but it
follows by several months reports in Brill's Content and American
Journalism Review and does not, in Part 1, add anything that
changes what is already on the public record.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to talk to TV Guide about what is coming in parts 2, 3
and 4 were rebuffed. Editor Steve Reddicliffe was unavailable;
writer Mary Murphy was on vacation.

 &HT;    Report: TV dramas shortchange women
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study of TV dramas from 1994 to 1997 finds that ``despite
incremental changes, men still outnumber women (and) key minority
populations are chronically under-represented,'' with Hispanics the
most under-represented group on television. The study, commissioned
by the Screen Actors Guild, was conducted by George Gerbner of the
Annenberg School of Communications. It looked at characters on
prime-time dramas and daytime soaps.
</P>
<P>
   Among Gerbner's findings:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Men outnumber women two to one.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Male African-American characters have increased until they
outnumber their percentage in the actual population; female
African-American characters still lag.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Low-income wage earners are virtually invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``There has been a decline in the number of characters with
disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Women age faster than men, and as they age they become more
evil.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Seniors of both genders are greatly under-represented and
seem to be vanishing instead of increasing as (they are) in real
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerbner concludes: ``Television is frozen in a time warp of
obsolete and damaging representations.''

JANET MURROW, 88; JOURNALIST, WIFE OF NEWSMAN EDWARD R. MURROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Janet (Brewster) Murrow, a writer and correspondent for CBS and
the British Broadcasting Corp. during World War II, died Friday.
She was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murrow, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, died of
heart failure at North Hill Life Care Center in Needham, Mass. She
was the wife of CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow, who died in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Middletown, Conn. As the president of her
graduating class at Mount Holyoke College in 1933, she met Edward
R. Murrow, who was then president of the National Student
Federation of America. They married in 1934 and lived in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1937, the couple moved to London, when Mr. Murrow was
appointed European director for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Mrs. Murrow began to write scripts for the BBC
before becoming a correspondent for CBS. In addition to her radio
work, she was chairwoman of the London committee of the Bundles for
Britain campaign in which US residents donated clothing, household
supplies, and medicine to the residents of war-torn England.
</P>
<P>
   While in the United States on a lecture tour to mobilize support
for Bundles for Britain, she and her husband were having dinner at
the White House with President Roosevelt and his wife, Eleanor,
when the president was informed of the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor. Neither Mrs. Murrow nor her husband ever reported on the
details of the night.
</P>
<P>
   After the United States entered the war, Mrs. Murrow was
accredited as a war correspondent and filed news reports on the air
ambulance service and Army field hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, she stopped working as a journalist, though she
did host her husband's TV show ``Person to Person'' on two
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's death, she moved to South Hadley,Mass. and
worked in the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum until her
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murrow was a member of the board of directors of Mount
Holyoke College for 20 years. She was also a member of the board of
directors of National Public Radio and was instrumental in the
establishment of the Edward R. Murrow Center at Tufts University in
1965.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, John Gavin, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts, described her as a woman ``of grace and
courage'' who ``played a part in launching the Edward R. Murrow
Center at Fletcher, which links journalists specializing in foreign
affairs to academic scholarship. After her husband's death in 1965,
Mrs. Murrow donated her husband's books and memorabilia to the
Murrow Center _ right down to one of his chairs. Up until the last
few years, when her health began to deteriorate, Mrs. Murrow came
to nearly every Fletcher commencement.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves a son, Casey of Putney, Vt.; and two grandsons.

DEC. 31, 1999: BIG PARTY. BIG HEADACHE. 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Dec. 27) 
(JT) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The night of Dec. 31, 1999, is still over a year away, but
movers and shakers in the travel industry have been hard at work
preparing for what many of them insist will be the biggest party
the world has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise industry, quicker than most to recognize the
financial implications of the millennium, has dozens of millennium
cruises scheduled. To whet interest in those cruises _ and to
justify higher prices _ many of them are being touted as the first
or last such cruise of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Royal Caribbean's Vision of the Seas will be ``the
first ship to enter the Panama Canal from the Caribbean in the new
millennium,'' while Celebrity's Zenith will be ``the first ship to
depart the canal in the new millennium.'' Royal Caribbean also says
that its 142,000-ton Voyager of the Seas, which is to make its
maiden voyage next Nov. 14 with a capacity of 3,114 passengers,
will be ``the largest cruise ship to enter the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the variety of cruises, tours and ad hoc celebrations,
not everyone in the travel industry is confident that millennium
results will live up to the pre-millennium ballyhoo. One reason for
that, travel agents say, is sticker shock. This has already caused
people to cancel tours and cruises they had reserved well before
prices were established and before deposits were due.
</P>
<P>
   While many resorts and tours required deposits at the time
reservations were made, most cruise lines did not require them
before last Nov. 1, by which time typically 25 percent of the total
price was due. Many who have booked since have had to put up 25
percent of the total price within seven days. A cancellation
between Nov. 1 and March 31 (when half the total is due) will
result in forfeiture of that deposit. Full payment is usually due
by June 30, and there will be no refunds after Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, one of the most amazing things about millennium fever
is that people were willing to put down deposits without knowing
the itinerary, the ship, the cabin or the cost,'' said Joe
Galloway, the president of the American Society of Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the lag in bookings, travel agents say, is the
recent erratic behavior of the stock market, which has reminded
people that travel is a discretionary option.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many people are still planning to welcome in 2000 away
from home. Some hotels and millennium events in such cities as New
York, London, Paris, Tokyo, Rome, Venice and Vienna are either sold
out or close to it. ``You'd be surprised how many people say to us,
`I want to be somewhere different for the millennium, since I won't
be around for the next one,''' said Galloway, who is also the owner
of Trans-Continental Travel in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, a travel agency owner in a Rocky Mountain state, who would
speak only anonymously, said, ``I personally think people should
stay home or close to home, because the millennium has the
potential to be the biggest rip-off time in the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not crowds live up to expectations, industry
officials acknowledge that many millennium travelers will probably
be disappointed by the service they receive from overworked and
probably inexperienced staff, and frustrated by hassles resulting
from technological glitches. ``We're suggesting that people who can
should postpone their celebration a week or two, because the level
of service they expect will not likely be there at the
millennium,'' said Doreen Farrugia Cody, a marketing specialist
with Dayton's Travel in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ms. Cody said some some customers had already canceled
reservations for fear of Y2K, the flaw that could cause problems
with computers in the year 2000, creating chaos with airline and
hotel reservations systems.
</P>
<P>
   What the airlines have not yet done, to the consternation of
many travel agents and tour operators, is accept reservations for
travel to millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only accept bookings 11 months in advance,'' said Joe
Hopkins, a United Airlines spokesman, a statement spokesmen for
other big carriers echoed. Airline reservation systems are not
programmed to accept reservations beyond about 330 days, and
airline companies feel little urgency to extend that time period
because, as one industry official put it, ``in the meantime, people
change their mind, divorce or die.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that limitation on airline bookings, travel agents
and operators have been unable to quote final prices for tours,
except for the land portion.
</P>
<P>
   And because they are not yet accepting millennium bookings,
airlines have no reliable way of knowing what the overall demand
will be around that time. Absent such knowledge, they do not yet
know whether or where to add seats.
</P>
<P>
   Since even the biggest airlines keep no more than a few spare
planes for emergencies, additional seats are usually only available
by swapping smaller aircraft used on heavily traveled routes for
bigger aircraft used on less heavily traveled routes. But there are
few, if any, lightly traveled routes during the Christmas-New Year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are not alone in delaying reservations for the
millennium. As of mid-December, Hyatt Hotels also was not taking
them, but said it would soon do so, while many Marriott hotels have
put together millennium packages but have not taken reservations
because they have not yet settled on prices.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels that have been accepting millennium reservations usually
require minimum stays of three to five nights _ at rates much
higher than usual, but usually including numerous extra amenities.
Almost all the 35 Ritz-Carlton hotels worldwide, for example are
offering one lucky (and well-heeled) couple in each hotel the
Millennium Experience, a three-night package for $100,000. The
package at the Ritz-Carlton Bali includes his-and-her 18-carat
Bulgari watches; a 24-hour private concierge, chef, housekeeper,
masseur, butler and interpreter; use of a chauffeured Mercedes-Benz
during the stay; and a commemorative photo album and engraved
stationery.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to New York, however, to come up with several of the
more unusual hotel offerings. For $3 million one can rent the
entire 627-room Millennium Broadway in Times Square and the hotel's
staff from Dec. 31, 1999, through Jan. 2, 2000, while the 155-room
Fitzpatrick Grand Central Hotel and its staff are available those
same three nights for a tidy $1.5 million. The 92-room Fitzpatrick
Manhattan, on Lexington Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets, is
available for $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   So far there have been no takers but enough nibbles to keep all
three offers on the block, no doubt in the expectation that someone
somewhere will regard the much-vaunted biggest party the world has
ever seen as a miserable failure without a hotel of one's own.

CHRISTENDOM'S HOLY DESTINATIONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The little town of Bethlehem is used to becoming a crowded small
city every Christmas Eve, but the extravaganza planned for the year
2000 will transform it into a millennial metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Or so the town's Palestinian officials dearly hope.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly $100 million is being spent rebuilding Manger Square,
Bethlehem's central plaza, installing dramatic new lighting along
Nativity Street, the main thoroughfare, and refurbishing scores of
neglected architectural treasures. There are new luxury hotels and
conference centers and exhibition halls. There will be Eastern-star
laser shows, caroling, a Finnish Christmas tree, Nobel
Prize-winners discussing peace, a Santa Claus, and the Magi and
their gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Planners envision 50,000 visitors thronging repaved streets
outside the venerable Church of the Nativity during millennial
Christmas Masses _ while tens of millions watch it all via
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our dream comes true, there will be a lot of congestion
here,'' said Munib Toukan, a multilingual Palestinian Muslim from
Amman who is a chief organizer of the Bethlehem 2000 Project,
financed by the World Bank and several European governments. That
dream seemed suddenly attainable this month, when town leaders
persauded President Clinton to attend a tree-lighting ceremony in
Manger Square.
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehemites have a special claim on the year 2000, and they
are trying to make the most of it. An unceasing procession of
religious and secular events is planned from the Advent season in
1999 through Easter 2001, which fortuitously falls on the same day
(April 15) that year in both the Gregorian and Orthodox calendars.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 4, the vicars of Jerusalem's 13 Christian churches will
lead an ``ecumenical inauguration of the millennium'' _ the first
time, it is asserted here, that the leaders of these often
quarreling sects have joined ranks for anything. But the millennial
high season really starts with the local Franciscans' globally
televised Dec. 24 midnight Mass at the Church of the Nativity, the
third service of an evening of Bethlehem Masses (after Lutheran and
Anglican Masses).
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 1 festivities are assigned to the Lutherans, after a
New Year's World Party the night before with a promised ``10,000
torches'' and pop music stars.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 6, Christmas for the Eastern Rite churches that
predominate here, there will be midnight Masses for Syrian and
Greek Orthodox Christians, as well as Copts from Ethiopia and
Egypt. Catholics from Latin America will commemorate the Epiphany
with a Three Kings procession. And on Jan. 18, Armenian Orthodox
bishops will celebrate the last of the midnight masses.
</P>
<P>
   Once an outlying village but now virtually a suburb of greater
Jerusalem, barely 20 minutes by car from the city center, Bethlehem
is still a cultural world removed from the Israeli capital.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors pass through the bored stares and cradled Galil assault
rifles of an Israeli military checkpoint into a dusty, bustling
Palestinian commercial center, with BMW's dodging goatherds, and
souvenir shops peddling Holy Land handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
   But the old center is an unpolished gem, and when the bulldozers
leave town late next year, it will have acquired an inviting sheen.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the restoration zone is the Church of the
Nativity, ground zero for most millennial pilgrims. Historians say
the site is probably quite close to the humble dwelling where it is
recorded that Mary and Joseph, natives of Bethlehem, celebrated the
birth of their son. The squat but handsome temple is entered
through what must be the smallest church door in Christendom. With
its sixth-century core and evocative scars from successive saviors
and conquerors, it anchors not just the plaza it faces, but the
entire town.
</P>
<P>
   Within walking distance are other relics of Bethlehem's storied
past, such as Rachel's Tomb. But Christmas Week 2000 may not be
ideal for leisurely architectural inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian National Authority, which governs Bethlehem, has
seized on the year 2000 celebration to remind the Christian world
that most sites associated with the life of Jesus, from Nazareth to
the crest of the Mount of Olives, are in Palestinian towns and
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Though Christians are a small minority here _ at most 5 percent
of the nine million people in Israel and the Palestinian
territories _ almost all of them are Arabs, and proud of their role
as custodians of this heritage.
</P>
<P>
   They also wouldn't mind cashing in a bit. The millennium is seen
as the business opportunity of the, well, millennium, by both the
Palestinian and Israeli tourism boards, for whom the date has no
other transcendental significance.
</P>
<P>
   The official forecast for 2000 is four million visitors or more,
triple the usual number. Most will stay in Israel, which has
tourist amenities the Palestinian areas do not, plus old Jerusalem
and many other biblical sites.
</P>
<P>
   The more apocalyptically minded visitors will head off to
Meggido, famed from scripture as Har Megedon (the Mountain of
Meggido, or Armageddon). Once an embattled crossroads of the
ancient world, the tiny Israeli valley town southeast of Haifa has
been basically quiet since the seventh century B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Jehosophat Valley, the mausoleum-pocked gulch beneath
Jerusalem's walled-shut Golden Gate, is another expected gathering
ground for the Final Days crowd. Swelling the tourist ranks, travel
agencies and academics report, will be those whose literal reading
of the Bible is that the end of the millennium may also mean the
end of the world as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bethlehem 2000 planners are hoping for sunnier, more
mainstream celebrants. Throughout 2000, they will offer classical
music performances (like Bach's Mass in B Minor on Jan. 25, by the
Orchestra of the XVIII Century, a Dutch period-music orchestra),
multicultural art exhibitions (Palestinian textiles, a
world-spanning collection of creches), outdoor rock concerts (no
big names yet) and film festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the typical tourist's routine is a bus trip from a West
Jerusalem hotel interrupted by a hundred-yard dash to the Church of
the Nativity. The average stay in Bethlehem, according to a survey
by a dispirited local professional, is just 45 minutes. The
ambitious stated goal of Palestinian tourist authorities is to
lengthen that to three days.
</P>
<P>
   But with barely 1,000 hotel rooms in the two-star class or
better, even an overnight stay isn't an option for most. Come the
millennium, though, things should improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically,'' Toukan said, ``if they stay for six hours,
this will be good.''

JANET MURROW, 88; JOURNALIST, WIFE OF NEWSMAN EDWARD R. MURROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Janet (Brewster) Murrow, a writer and correspondent for CBS and
the British Broadcasting Corp. during World War II, died Friday.
She was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murrow, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, died of
heart failure at North Hill Life Care Center in Needham, Mass. She
was the wife of CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow, who died in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Middletown, Conn. As the president of her
graduating class at Mount Holyoke College in 1933, she met Edward
R. Murrow, who was then president of the National Student
Federation of America. They married in 1934 and lived in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1937, the couple moved to London, when Mr. Murrow was
appointed European director for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Mrs. Murrow began to write scripts for the BBC
before becoming a correspondent for CBS. In addition to her radio
work, she was chairwoman of the London committee of the Bundles for
Britain campaign in which US residents donated clothing, household
supplies, and medicine to the residents of war-torn England.
</P>
<P>
   While in the United States on a lecture tour to mobilize support
for Bundles for Britain, she and her husband were having dinner at
the White House with President Roosevelt and his wife, Eleanor,
when the president was informed of the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor. Neither Mrs. Murrow nor her husband ever reported on the
details of the night.
</P>
<P>
   After the United States entered the war, Mrs. Murrow was
accredited as a war correspondent and filed news reports on the air
ambulance service and Army field hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, she stopped working as a journalist, though she
did host her husband's TV show ``Person to Person'' on two
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's death, she moved to South Hadley,Mass. and
worked in the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum until her
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murrow was a member of the board of directors of Mount
Holyoke College for 20 years. She was also a member of the board of
directors of National Public Radio and was instrumental in the
establishment of the Edward R. Murrow Center at Tufts University in
1965.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, John Gavin, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts, described her as a woman ``of grace and
courage'' who ``played a part in launching the Edward R. Murrow
Center at Fletcher, which links journalists specializing in foreign
affairs to academic scholarship. After her husband's death in 1965,
Mrs. Murrow donated her husband's books and memorabilia to the
Murrow Center _ right down to one of his chairs. Up until the last
few years, when her health began to deteriorate, Mrs. Murrow came
to nearly every Fletcher commencement.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves a son, Casey of Putney, Vt.; and two grandsons.

<P>
   Like cashiered spies groping for a mission, veteran literary spy
masters are coming out of the Cold War into a new world order that
is hard on current sales and indifferent to their old-fashioned
trench-coat espionage fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Some well-known authors have recently parted with their
publishing houses in search of a fresh approach to increase sales,
a strategy as elusive as KGB moles. Others, like John le Carre,
have found intrigue in new settings. In March his new book, which
promises the thrills of a spy novel in a sinister world of
international finance, will be published. The book begins, of
course, with the execution of a lawyer in horn-rimmed glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Most dramatic, perhaps, is the literary turn taken by Frederick
Forsyth, the author of ``The Day of the Jackal'' and ``The Odessa
File,'' who has changed publishing houses as his sales have
declined, acquired a new literary agent and publicly renounced the
thriller genre to ``try my hand at something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else is a slim volume, a sequel to Gaston Leroux's
1910 novel, ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' that grew out of
discussions with the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, who may stage it
as a musical. Forsyth's publisher of more than 25 years, Bantam,
chose not to buy the manuscript, ``The Phantom of Manhattan,''
which places the disfigured character in a Coney Island factory
cleaning fish. But the author found another taker.
</P>
<P>
   The market is colder than a Siberian winter for espionage tales,
many publishing executives and agents say, blaming the end of the
Cold War and shifts in readers' tastes. Today they prefer the Tom
Clancy style of technological thrillers featuring exotic military
weapons and an executive-style CIA hero to the lonely agent who
survives deception, betrayals and multiplying body counts in the
twilight world of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone like Freddie doesn't want to write them anymore,
then there must be something going on in the world that makes it
difficult for a master,'' said Forsyth's new agent, Ed Victor, who
added that the authors' moves probably reflect ``that spy fiction
has peaked, and people usually look for people to blame, which
means you can fire your publisher, fire your agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Berlin wall crumbled in 1989 and the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991, writers who established themselves by exploring
the duplicitous world of spycraft have had much more difficulty
climbing the heights of the New York Times best-seller list,
occupying those rarefied levels for fewer weeks, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Len Deighton followed the life of Bernard Samson, a
star-crossed British agent, in three trilogies, two of which were
best sellers in the 1980s and 1990. But the last set, published
through 1996, failed to make the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth achieved enduring success with ``The Day of the Jackal''
and ``The Odessa File,'' which lingered on the list for 48 weeks.
But his last best seller, ``Icon,'' a postcommunist thriller set in
a disintegrating Russia, slipped off the list after two weeks.
Paperback sales for ``The Day of the Jackal'' exceeded 3.5 million
copies, while sales for ``Icon'' were a million fewer, a publishing
executive with knowledge of the sales history said.
</P>
<P>
   For his sequel to ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' Forsyth has
signed with an untraditional publisher, Michael Viner, the
president of New Millennium Entertainment in Beverly Hills, Calif.
Viner is better known for publishing tell-all nonfiction like Faye
Resnick's book about Nicole Brown Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, writers like Robert Ludlum and Ken
Follett have left their publishing houses for new ones, moves that
often reflect polite differences about advances or sales
expectations that publishers do not consider promising enough to
justify the generous contracts of flush days.
</P>
<P>
   How the Genre Waxes and Wanes
</P>
<P>
   But the public explanation from Ludlum, Follett and le Carre is
a desire for fresh approaches, a yearning that has seized some
well-known writers like an old-fashioned global conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Ludlum, who achieved his biggest successes in the 1970s with
tales of complex global plots, left his publisher of more than two
decades, Bantam, for St. Martin's Press, which offered him an
eight-figure contract and a new strategy. His sales at Bantam had
settled to a plateau of about 450,000 copies for recent titles like
``The Matarese Countdown,'' whose plot revolved around a CIA rookie
battling a planet-threatening dynasty of killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly harder to get an audience hot about the Cold
War, because it's just not there anymore,'' said Jack Romanos, the
president of Simon &AMP; Schuster, which is publishing le Carre's new
book through its Scribner imprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been difficult to take it to a different area. People
have tried to make it work in South America, the Middle East and
China, but it never had the same cachet as when it was the good old
Americans against the communists.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, spy fiction has flourished and waned with the
inspiration of war or its threat. The first spy novel in Western
literature is credited to James Fenimore Cooper, who in 1821 wrote
``The Spy: A Tale of the Neutral Ground,'' a novel based on a
Revolutionary war spy, said Thomas B. Allen, co-author of a
reference guide, ``Spy Book.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a dry spell until the American Civil War inspired a
spate of exaggerated memoirs by spies on both sides. After another
drought, spy fiction surfaced again in the early 1900s and
flourished in 1930s pulp magazines. But Allen said the two World
Wars produced fewer spy novels than the Cold War, with its tense
and ambiguous atmosphere that could not be defined as real war or
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in a valley,'' Allen said of the present cycle,
noting that some authors are floundering as they search for new
themes. ``The generation of spy novelists that included le Carre
were writing inside their own time about things that were almost
happening. So now we're in a time where nothing much is happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have the FBI in espionage mode; they're more in
accounting mode.''

 &HT;    IRAQ DOWNPLAYS DAMAGE FROM AIRSTRIKES; PROCLAIMS ITS STRENGTH,
EVEN WITH SADDAM'S REGIME ON EDGE
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD _ Even before the U.S. and British military airstrikes
began last week, there were signs that Saddam Hussein's regime was
edgy about its self preservation. Now that the bombing is over,
officials are emphasizing their strength.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz Monday announced figures for
military casualties of the airstrikes, stating that 62 soldiers
were killed -- 38 of Saddam elite Republican Guard -- and 180
wounded. He said that U.S. and British missiles largely hit empty
barracks that will be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni said U.S.
and British bombs and missiles struck 85 of the 100 targets
attacked and 74 were destroyed -- including barracks and command
structures of Saddam's Republican Guards around the country --
before strikes were halted early Sunday, Iraq time.
</P>
<P>
   Zinni told reporters at a Pentagon briefing that among the
targets hit was Saddam's Baath Party headquarters, where Iraqi
officials earlier this month refused to grant full access by U.N.
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our friends in the region and others clearly look at
what happened to Iraq and realize that Saddam suffered a defeat,''
Zinni said when asked about Baghdad's claim that Saddam was the
winner.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed in London that the
airstrikes have set back parts of Iraq's ``military infrastructure
several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz's announcement, however, attempt to show just the opposite:
That the Iraqi regime was still strong despite the barrage of more
than 400 missiles fired by U.S. and British forces.
</P>
<P>
   American President Bill Clinton has stated that he wants to end
the 20-year-reign of Hussein. Though U.S. officials said the four
days of airstrikes were aimed at setting back Hussein's weapons
operation, it is widely believed that they also hope to soften him
up for a coup from within his government or a rebellion from his
people.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz labeled these goals ``heinous intentions'' because the U.S.
has no business in internal Iraqi affairs. He said they will not
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought foolishly that when they sent a few hundred
missiles against Iraq, the people of Iraq would uprise against
their leadership. This is fantasy. This is Rambo-like fantasies,''
Aziz said. ``The Iraqi people strongly, genuinely support their
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hussein's regime has survived numerous larger calamities
in the past, from the 8-year war with Iran to its defeat in the
Gulf War in 1991. Assessing the impact of these recent airstrikes
will take more time.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure, observers say: From extra soldiers on the
streets to loyalty pronouncements in the press to a recent shake-up
of his military, Hussein and his allies are being extra careful.
What's not at all clear is whether these precautions are needed to
meet any threat or just Hussein's way of being cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Even in good times, Hussein's whereabouts are rarely known, he
makes few public appearances and only sparingly meets with foreign
officials -- who are often driven to remote, unknown destinations,
for the encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be in a small, closed society, you always feel in danger,''
said one foreign observer. ``The recent events have shaken the
(Hussein) family and the inner circle.''
</P>
<P>
   There are few reliable reports about damage from the bombings
and no way to confirm Aziz's casualty figures. Iraqis, who have
always kept a close eye on foreign journalists, is naturally even
more restrictive amid concern that its attackers not pick up
newspapers and read details of the condition of their targets.
</P>
<P>
   But, there were signs that even before the bombing Hussein was
seeking to tighten his grip on his own people.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the first attacks, Hussein divided the military
control of the country among four trusted allies and did so in a
public way. While the regime said the changes were needed to resist
the coming missile attacks, the move was likely done for internal
control.
</P>
<P>
   As Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said, Iraq believes
the United States is trying to disrupt communications between
different areas of the country, such as the largely Shiite Muslim
south and the predominantly Sunni Muslim north of the country.
</P>
<P>
   By giving trusted military commanders a degree of autonomy in
each region, it makes it easier for them to crush any rebels who
try to take advantage of a damaged communications network.
</P>
<P>
   The move was announced publicly and two of the leaders made
public statements of loyalty to Hussein, perhaps to show that they
were no threat to supersede his authority in their regions.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Associated Press reported, based on information from
exiled Iraqi opposition leaders, that Hussein's cousin, a military
commander, recently executed several officers for disobeying
orders. The officers were in the southern region, the home of an
active opposition from Shiite Muslims.
</P>

   Most affected by the cooler market are the second-tier authors
who were writing in the genre, said Romanos of Simon &AMP; Schuster.
The well-known authors, he said, had a tougher time keeping their
audience, while ``the next level, the up-and-coming spy fiction,
began to shrink dramatically, so there's hardly any more of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger thriller writers like Daniel Silva, 37, author of ``The
Unlikely Spy'' and ``The Mark of the Assassin,'' draw inspiration
from World War II, but ``going back to the Cold War would be a
little strange,'' he said. ``Instinctively it doesn't feel right.
There's not enough distance and drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Carre, a former British intelligence officer whose real name
is David Cornwell, can be viewed as a case study of shifting to new
themes while tinkering with publishing relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The author left his publisher of 20 years, Alfred A. Knopf,
changed literary agents and is poised to publish a new book,
``Single &AMP; Single,'' that continues his movement away from
espionage themes and the prosaic world of his weary and brooding
spy, George Smiley.
</P>
<P>
   His last book, ``The Tailor of Panama,'' involved an elaborate
plot to void the Panama Canal Treaties. His base of readers has
eroded and his past sales figured into his last advance from Simon
&AMP; Schuster, which dropped to $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   At Scribner, where marketing executives have a one-word view of
Cold War spy fiction (``Done'') the publishers are positioning le
Carre to reach a new generation of readers. Scribner is planning to
print 300,000 copies of the novel.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Wark, a University of Toronto history professor who
specializes in the study of intelligence services and spy fiction,
said the espionage genre still had life but was ``going through a
difficult period when clearly new settings or scenes are
required.''
</P>
<P>
   In Search of a New Lode
</P>
<P>
   Instead of new spy settings, though, writers are switching to
new genres with the intrigue of politics or police work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wait for the Cold War to be quaint as a little
Napoleonic war,'' said Charles McCarry, a former CIA intelligence
officer who has moved from novels about spies to books about
political intrigue like his best-selling ``Lucky Bastard.'' ``After
doing this for almost 30 years,'' McCarry said, ``what happens is
that you live your experience and eventually it runs out. So you
find another vein.''
</P>
<P>
   A contrarian view of the Cold War comes from Follett, who with
his departure this month from Crown for Dutton, an imprint of
Penguin Putnam, intends to write a historical novel based on a
failed launching of an American satellite amid Cold War tensions in
1958. He is careful, however, to correct any typecasting of the
book as a Cold War novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say it's a Cold War story,'' Follett said, ``people
will think it has a character like Smiley and involves a KGB person
and an FBI agent who are at loggerheads. And it isn't like that at
all. None of the principal characters are Russian.''
</P>
<P>
   Follett noted that he had avoided the spy genre in his last two
novels, the latter a contemporary thriller called ``The Hammer of
Eden,'' which centers on aging hippie eco-terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the golden age of the spy story is definitely
over,'' Follett said. ``But that doesn't mean that there aren't
going to be any good ones written. In order to do so, I've had to
set my story in 1958. I don't think it would work in 1998. We're
not afraid of the Russians anymore. You need someone to be afraid
of.''

GOP CHAIR SAYS SHE'LL STEP DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Unhappy over Governor Cellucci's attempt to seize
control of the Republican State Committee, Chairwoman Jean Inman
Monday told Cellucci she would not seek another term as party
chief.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in another move that could have political
ramifications, Cellucci has settled on a career police officer from
New York City to be his secretary of public safety. Sources say
Cellucci will tap Jane Perlov, commanding officer of the Queens
Detective Borough, for that post.
</P>
<P>
   But that selection could create some ill will among both
Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   State Senator James Jajuga, a Democrat from Methuen, had hoped
for the job, as had outgoing Norfolk County District Attorney
Jeffrey A. Locke, the son of former Senate Republican Leader David
Locke.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Cellucci's move to quietly install his own operatives
at the state committee didn't work as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Inman, an Avon businesswoman, was upset Cellucci planned to
replace her six-member state committee staff with his own
operatives.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Cellucci had told Inman he wanted John
Brockelman, who served as his deputy campaign manager in the 1998
campaign, to take over operational responsibilities from Mark
DeCourcey, the committee's current executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sad day for me,'' said Inman. ``I wanted to stay on as
chairman, but as things changed, I reconsidered. I was comfortable
with the team we had here that worked so hard during the last
election cycle. They wanted to replace everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the news that Inman would not seek another two-year term
as chairwoman seemed to surprise the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she did a good job in the most recent (election)
cycle, and I was looking for a little stability with a little new
blood as a way to do an even better job in the 2000 election
cycle,'' Cellucci said. ``I think it would have been nice if Jean
had continued, but that's her decision.''
</P>
<P>
   One source close to Cellucci said two possible replacements were
being considered: Plymouth County Sheriff Peter Forman or state
Senator Richard Tisei of Wakefield. Both have years of experience
in Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   But another source said state committee members, unhappy over
Cellucci's attempt to take over the committee, might sponsor a
candidate of their own for the party's top post.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are unhappy all around,'' the source said. ``It all
depends on whether they turn that unhappiness into action by
fielding an alternative candidate.'' The 80-member state committee
is slated to meet Jan. 14 to chose a chairman for the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her decision not to run again, Inman said she remained a
strong supporter of Cellucci. ``I fully support the governor,''
Inman said. ``One of the things I am most proud of is how we pulled
the party together after an energetic primary and elected a
Republican governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Inman Monday won praise from Jim Rappaport, her predecessor as
Republican Party chairman. ``She came through in the clutch,'' said
Rappaport. ``I think she has been a very able chairwoman.''

MCGINEST SAYS HE'S BACK IN SHAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He has played football, a most violent game,
ever since he can remember, and has endured hits, collisions, and
pain unfathomable to the average Joe. He has conquered them and
moved on.
</P>
<P>
   But for weeks this season, the Patriots' Willie McGinest has
been derailed.
</P>
<P>
   His chiseled 6-foot-5-inch, 270-pound frame has been left on the
sideline with an injury to his upper groin that has caused him
excruciating pain.
</P>
<P>
   For one who makes his living chasing quarterbacks with quick
moves, cuts, and sudden bursts _ the reason he is paid $5 million
annually _ those acts became impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Game after game went by. Twice McGinest tried to return and
twice his body failed him. The frustration mounted. Then he heard
whispers from people who thought he wasn't tough enough to get back
on the field, and those comments felt like a knife through his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday McGinest finally seemed to be feeling relief and the
hope that his injury would no longer be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Though he never said, ``I'm playing Sunday vs. the Jets,'' he
did smile as he said, ``I'm going to surprise you (the media).'' He
added, ``I feel great. I feel like I'm full-speed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was able to run full tilt Monday, a day after
watching his teammates cut the legs out from under the surging San
Francisco 49ers, 24-21, to qualify for the playoffs for the third
straight season.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest owes his possible comeback to a specialist the team
sought for him who is trained in this type of injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I'm strengthening the muscles around the groin
muscle,'' said McGinest. ``Those have to be stimulated so all of
the pressure isn't on the actual groin muscle. When I injured it,
the muscles around it weren't strong, so all the pressure was going
on that one muscle. If the muscles around it are strong I should be
all right.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest said he spoke to Fox TV commentator and former Oakland
Raider Matt Millen, who told McGinest that he was out three months
with a groin injury. ``It's one of those injuries you have to let
heal,'' McGinest said.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that time has come. It was thought McGinest might sit
out the regular-season finale and then play in the playoffs, but
when asked if was taking the week off he said, ``I never take a
week off.'' He certainly sounded like a man who felt better than
he's felt in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, the Patriots' pass rush had been abysmal. In
fact, in the seven games before Sunday's, New England had a total
of eight sacks. But Sunday that changed.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest finally saw a pass rush _ the Patriots had five sacks _
thanks to zone blitzing and tremendous push up front by Chad Eaton,
who sparred with crazyman Kevin Gogan all day. The Patriots were
able to get after the best passer on earth, Steve Young, at the
best possible moments.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest watched carefully and offered advice to young Greg
Spires, who was taking his ``elephant'' role, and even claimed a
part in the big sack Spires had late in the fourth quarter that
stopped the 49ers in their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played good . . . well, he played all right,'' McGinest
said, catching himself. ``You never tell a rookie he played good.
He came up with plays when he needed to. He just did his
assignments. Right before he got his sack I told him they're gonna
try something, probably a boot(leg) to get outside on the edge. I
told him to stay outside. Sure enough, they try a boot and he stays
outside and he gets the sack. He's coming along. A lot of the young
guys who came in contributed.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest believes his return comes at the best possible time,
against Bill Parcells and the Jets. McGinest will get to see all of
his old mates, like Corwin Brown, Curtis Martin, Otis Smith, Keith
Byars, etc., in what has become a great rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we go against Corwin, Curtis, Dave Meggett, and
(coaches) Bill Belichick and Al Groh, we're always going to be
fired up against those guys,'' McGinest said. ``Bill and Al Groh
are brilliant. They've been together so long with the Giants and
here for a few years; they help each other and they do a great job
trying to stop the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest also was pleased to see that Chris Slade, his partner
in pressuring the QB for many years, returned to his normal level
of play after many weeks of struggling with leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, McGinest had his arm around Slade and was
talking to him about what was ahead. Slade responded with a sack
and nine tackles. He was flying around like the player who earned
All-Pro honors last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him that he was going to go out there and play for
the both of us because I couldn't be out there,'' said McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's been tough the past few weeks because he's been
hurt and he hears people saying he's not playing at his level. They
don't know what's going on because they don't know about his
injuries and what they've done to him. They don't come close to
understanding the situation and that when you do what we do and
play this position you need your legs. Your legs are everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him to go out and play like Chris Slade.''
</P>
<P>
   Then McGinest offered his two cents about Pete Carroll vs.
Parcells. He said both have their special ways of motivating
players. McGinest still remembers Parcells benching him on third
downs because he had a poor game rushing the passer and how mad it
made him. He remembered how motivated he was to prove Parcells
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But he understands that Carroll, who has been perceived as being
not as tough on players, stepped into a tough situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to fill some big shoes,'' said McGinest. ``His
obligation and contribution to the team has been great. Any time
the level of the play of this team drops a little bit and
expectations aren't reached right away, it falls on the head man.
That's when all the comparisons start to creep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took pressure off his back by winning on Sunday . . .
finally winning the big game because everybody counted us out of
this game. He coached a good game and he should be satisfied. He
still has more to do this week vs. the Jets and then the playoffs.
But it gave him a little breathing room.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest said he grew up playing under coaches that were far
tougher than Parcells, ``so I knew where he was coming from. I
understood what he was trying to do.'' He remembers Parcells
walking out of practice to prove a point. He remembers before the
final game of the '96 season Parcells, in his pregame speech
``started crying in front of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday, McGinest would like to make Parcells cry again, but
for different reasons. He'd like to have a hand in beating his old
coach. And now, he'll have a leg to stand on as well.

MASTERY OF TV MAY SAVE CLINTON PRESIDENCY YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Italics) 'Twas a week before Christmas and all through the
House
</P>
<P>
   An impeachment was stirring a rancorous joust.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were laid by accusers with care,
</P>
<P>
   In hopes that the Clintons would go on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The prez and his lady indeed did go live,
</P>
<P>
   But said they were staying, not taking a dive.
</P>
<P>
   (End italics)
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by what might have been the most politically astute
support group ever assembled, President Clinton tensed his jaw
muscles Saturday, looked straight into the camera and declared that
he's staying till ``the last hour of the last day'' of his term,
whether that last day comes in two months at the bidding of the
Senate or in two years at the bidding of his naturally chosen
successor.
</P>
<P>
   The last time impeachment escaped the high school civics class
to become a topic of cocktail party chitchat, a less media-savvy
president used television mainly as a conduit of information, first
to say, like Clinton, that he would never resign, then to tell us
he was, well, doing what he said he'd never do.
</P>
<P>
   The indelible images from that time a quarter-century ago are
Richard Nixon's awkward wave and silly grin as he prepared to board
the chopper to ignominy, which is not an island in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to avoid filing the same flight plan, Clinton has
used television more shrewdly _ as part of a strategy and not
simply as a means of responding to journalistic inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested the strategy was ill defined, but I'm not so
sure.
</P>
<P>
   Think what you will of his defiant ``apology'' last August.
Light on contrition, it will be remembered more for its hubris than
its humility. And what about the big lie? When Clinton went on TV
to say he had done nothing improper with ``that woman,'' he was
cheekier than all the ``Saturday Night Live'' spoofs of him.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Clinton has had his moments of introspection and regret _
all well documented _ but the ``defiant leader'' act is something
that wouldn't play nearly as well in print. As ABC's Sam Donaldson
pointed out Saturday, the Democrats who walked out of the Capitol
building to protest the impeachment vote and show their support for
the president weren't doing it for the benefit of newspaper
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Just as humor doesn't always translate well to the printed page,
fits of pique should be seen to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton wants us to feel his pain, but he doesn't want
us to see him as the simpering victim. Victim, yes. Simpering, no.
</P>
<P>
   The president's narcissistic ego won't let him accept defeat, or
even allow him to accept that what he did was wrong, so he (and his
handlers) have gambled on a performance as embattled chief
executive, hoping that sympathy builds in his favor. It seems to be
working. Despite his impeachment, the president's approval rating
remains high.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the best performer the presidency has ever had,
Ronald Reagan's Hollywood credentials notwithstanding. As long as
he remains defiant on TV, right down to the flexing of those jaw
muscles, the message to Americans is clear: ``My enemies are out to
get me, but you and I are bigger than this petty partisan
squabble.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes for good theater of the absurd. And right now, with
apologies to Jon Lovitz, Bill Clinton remains the master Thespian,
because without television he might be in even bigger trouble.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: We just lost a promising employee who
told us the main reason she was leaving was because our company is
not ``cool,'' but she did not clarify what she meant. I am not an
out-of-touch manager, but I don't know what it means to be a cool
company. I have asked a number of people and gotten different
answers. What do you think? C.S.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The notion of cool companies has become a very hot
topic. Some people might say that if you have to ask if your
company is cool, then it's not. There are a number of key
characteristics that differentiate cool companies from uncool ones.
</P>
<P>
   For example, cool companies try to understand and respect their
employees as individuals and provide them with real opportunities
to be heard. They also provide opportunities to foster employee
learning, development and growth. These companies consider the
balance between work and life, and typically implement policies
with this in mind, such as flex time, on-site child care and
telecommuting.
</P>
<P>
   Cool companies act honestly and with integrity, and there is a
genuine respect for employee diversity. These companies have a real
appreciation of the value that diversity of backgrounds,
experiences and cultures can bring to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Such companies embrace the newest technological advances, and
they tend to have a more casual atmosphere, not only in terms of
attire but in terms of the physical and organizational structure.
In fact, their corporate structure is not a pyramid, but tends to
be rather flat.
</P>
<P>
   Research is already showing that turnover in cool companies is
relatively low, and that's pretty cool too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are some employees reluctant to ask questions? I have one
who usually does a good job, but he could do an excellent job if he
would just ask a question or two. I have encouraged him to do this,
but he won't. How can I change this? J.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Why employees refuse to ask questions is a very good
question. The best place to find the answer is to look carefully at
your employee and at yourself as his manager.
</P>
<P>
   There can be any number of personality traits that may be
holding him back. For example, perhaps he has some feelings of
insecurity over the mistaken belief that asking questions can be a
sign of ineptitude. Or, he may have had some negative experiences
that are now preventing him from daring to ask a question.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it may be helpful for you to look at your
leadership style and try to see if you are fully receptive to
employee questions. Is it possible that your potential response may
be preventing him from asking anything in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the most successful managers tailor
their leadership style to meet the individual needs of the
employees they supervise. If this employee needs to be encouraged
to ask some questions, and this can help turn him into an excellent
employee, then it makes unquestionable sense for you to encourage
him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My manager rushed into my office, accompanied by one of the
vice presidents, and said he needed a particular report
immediately. I'm usually quite good at accessing this type of
thing, but I couldn't find it. My manager gave me a dirty look and
they both stormed out. A few minutes later I found the report and
gave it to them, but they said nothing. Should I say something?
W.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Whenever anyone in management storms out of your office, it
is a good idea to do some follow-up to make sure that the storm has
indeed passed. But first, look at your performance history, as this
will set the context for the discussion. In a word, are you truly a
person who can access just about anything that ever crossed your
desk, or are you a person whose desk is the great abyss?
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you do not have to open the discussion with an
apology. In fact, you are arguably entitled to an apology from
anyone who storms out of your office. You should open by saying
that you wanted to discuss what happened the other day. Let your
manager talk, and then respond in kind. No matter how the
discussion goes, let him know about any steps that you are taking
to prevent this type of problem occurring in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If you have established a pattern of being a reliable employee,
this matter will most likely be written off as nothing more than an
isolated incident. However, if you have established a pattern of
being rather unreliable, this incident calls for a change in your
part, lest you be written off.

`ROADSIDE DOG': CRYPTIC SNIPPETS ABOUT THE `LONELY SPECIES' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(rl) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The full text of one of the briefer of the several score brief
chapters in this collection of anecdotes and ruminations by Czeslaw
Milosz is this: ``It looks as if that, ready, formed in every
detail, waited nearby, at a hand's stretching, and had I caught it,
I would not have drawn the thing out of the nothingness all around,
but taken, as if from a shelf, an object already existing.''
</P>
<P>
   You want to read that sentence a few times, striving to absorb
its meaning, to puzzle out the identity of the rather vague
``that'' that is ``ready'' and ``formed in every detail.'' It seems
most likely, though far from certain, that ``that'' is a poem or
another work of the imagination and Milosz, the Polish writer who
won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1980, is commenting on the
difficulty inherent in poetic creation.
</P>
<P>
   The already existing, he seems to be saying, has a power that
can block the writer's struggle to bring creation out of
nothingness, so that the poet instead falls back on words, ideas,
phrases already on the shelf. Mimicry, an unconscious absorption of
the rhetorical culture, can take on an illusory sort of originality
when in fact they make the poet not a creator but a conformist.
</P>
<P>
   Milosz's ``Roadside Dog'' is an elusive as well as allusive
work, a book not exactly of poetry but not of prose either. It is
composed mostly of fragments more or less in the tradition of
Pascal's ``Thoughts,'' though generally it has more of a
valedictory tone than a classically philosophical one.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Milosz's subjects are what one might expect of a poet
whose life has extended for most of the century: memory,
forgetfulness, aging and the depths to which human beings are
capable of falling. Milosz, born in 1911, writes about writing,
about poetry and about those very human frailties of resentment and
self-importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``To believe you are magnificent,'' goes one very lapidary and
especially valedictory passage. ``And gradually to discover that
you are not magnificent. Enough labor for one human life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Roadside Dog'' is, in other words, a difficult pleasure, but
it is a pleasure. Milosz speaks, as he has in his many earlier
works, in phrases that seem almost ordinary, stylistically
unexceptional, but that are in fact cryptic, compact and as closely
carved as pieces of Chinese ivory.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to isolate an overriding preoccupation here, but
one can recognize a basic recurring concern in Milosz's mystical
and difficult fragments. It is the battle against nothingness, the
need to forge some sort of order, moral and spiritual, out of the
chaos represented by the history of recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   In one passage, for example, titled ``Watering Can,'' Milosz
talks of the way in which the movies and photography have created
the habit of paying attention to things as well as people, to ``a
multitude of objects.'' He concludes, ``Precisely in this, in our
clinging to distinctly delineated shapes, does our hope reside, of
salvation from the turbulent waters of nothingness and chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of his more explicitly political ruminations, Milosz
writes of the slaughter of the Warsaw ghetto and how such a tragedy
might in a way be easier for an atheist than a believer. The
atheist, Milosz writes, is freed ``from a quarrel with the Creator
who must be held responsible for the suffering of human beings.''
The atheist ``should accept the world as it is'' with murder of the
weak by the strong an ordinary part of nature. But it is ``whence
comes our protest, our scream: No!'' he writes, that separates
humans from nature and ``makes us a lonely species.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this argument for the ``peculiar place of man'' an argument
for the existence of God? Milosz, who writes of being a Roman
Catholic but makes few other explicit references to religion, seems
to be speaking for the existence of a higher power. But he speaks
for that presence directly in a few concise sentences and without
flinching in the face of the most powerful case that can be made
against it.
</P>
<P>
   Other fragments are less weighty, including some brief
reminiscences about Poland and the world before the cataclysm of
World War II. The very phrase ``roadside dog'' that gave Milosz his
title comes from a memory (or perhaps from Milosz's imagination) of
traveling in a horse-drawn cart from village to village in some
unnamed old country at the beginning of the century. Always, Milosz
writes, ``we were barked at by a dog, assiduous in its duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion is that these essays are like apocrypha,
secondary and somewhat random reflections, not part of one's main
body of work. In one of the longer chapters that come in the second
half of the volume, Milosz writes about fleas, about how we have
forgotten that for much of history people lived lives afflicted by
parasites that ``the civilization of politeness'' required them to
pretend did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Often Milosz seems to invoke secondary events to shed light on
more central concepts. He begins a chapter called ``Ancestors,''
for example, with the startling statement ``To tell the truth, we
should not exist.'' He reminds us of the unspeakable hardships
suffered by past generations who ``died like flies from epidemics,
from starvation, from wars, and though children swarmed, for every
12 of them only one or two survived.''
</P>
<P>
   For one family line to have survived is veritably miraculous,
Milosz concludes, leaving us with one of his densely suggestive
ideas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our species should have disappeared a long time ago, and it is
still alive, incredibly resistant. That you and I happen to be part
of it should be enough to give us pause for meditation.''

SENATORS WARN CLINTON AGAINST CHALLENGING HOUSE IMPEACHMENT VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators from both parties warned President Clinton
Monday not to use the argument that the lame-duck House had no
right to impeach him as a way to delay a Senate trial on whether he
should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that is perceived as parliamentary maneuvering to get
out of this ... is going to be a serious mistake,'' Sen. John B.
Breaux, D-La., said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, also said that the White
House should avoid any legal maneuvers that would ``drag'' the
process out.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, they keep saying that this should be swift,
but at the same time, they're considering something that would
delay this for weeks or months,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart confirmed Monday that the
president's lawyers were considering a legal argument that was
first advanced earlier this month by Yale Law School Professor
Bruce Ackerman in testimony Dec. 8 before the House Judiciary
Committee, which was considering articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said it would be a ``big mistake'' for a House whose
members' terms were about to expire to vote on the articles.
</P>
<P>
   His argument was based on the 20th Amendment to the
Constitution, which in 1933 moved the start of the new Congress
from early March to early January after an election year.
</P>
<P>
   He and others have said the purpose of the amendment was to
abolish lame-duck sessions of Congress _ those held after an
election _ so that any measures passed are more accountable to the
most recent wishes of the people. This would mean that the
impeachment articles passed Saturday by the House of the 105th
Congress would need to be approved by the incoming House of the
106th Congress for the Senate to be able to consider them.
</P>
<P>
   If the White House decides to challenge the validity of the
impeachment vote, it could file a motion at the outset of a Senate
trial with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who is charged by
the Constitution with presiding over such a trial. Or the White
House could to a file a motion in federal court, which could take
weeks or months to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever decision Rehnquist or the Supreme Court might hand
down, the Senate could overrule it by a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart maintained that ``no conclusions'' had been reached on
whether White House lawyers would press the strategy Ackerman
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said it would be a ``real mistake'' if the
president started ``playing procedural games rather than dealing
with the substance of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., also said Sunday that she
believes that the impeachment articles ``continue on through the
changes of sessions.''
</P>
<P>
   If the White House does choose to use the lame-duck Congress
argument to fight the validity of the perjury and
obstruction-of-justice articles approved by the House, it faces a
number of legal hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Many constitutional experts maintain that congressional
procedures and precedents make clear that impeachment is not like
any other legislation and will survive the demise of this Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Research Service, which studied the issue
earlier this year, concluded that ``an impeachment proceeding may
be continued from one Congress to the next.'' The CRS noted that
one of the first impeachment cases _ of federal Judge John
Pickering in 1803-04 _ and one of the most recent _ of federal
Judge Alcee Hastings in 1988-89 _ carried over from one Congress to
the next, as did several impeachment cases in between.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Thomas Jefferson's ``Rules of the House,'' which is
used as a guide on Capitol Hill, says that ``an impeachment is not
discontinued'' by the end of a Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Ackerman acknowledged the previous impeachment
cases but noted that the House vote on them had occurred before
elections, not afterward, as in Clinton's case. He said the
Republicans' losses this year would give the impeachment vote the
flavor of a lame-duck Congress rushing through articles of
impeachment that might not pass in the new House, with its smaller
Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tushnet, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown
University, said Ackerman's argument was ``worthy of
consideration'' but would likely be thrown out by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a pure legal environment, the argument might have a chance
but in this case, the Senate is the final judge, and they (the
senators) seem pretty set against it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Senate opposition, Tushnet said, a White House
challenge could end up ``merely adding a few months onto the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the idea of a censure of the president appeared to be
gaining momentum as several senators made known that they would
consider the option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to start the process of a trial,'' Hutchinson said.
``Whatever happens after that opens a lot of doors and a lot of
options _ including censure.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter
suggested a bipartisan censure resolution voted by the Senate and
accepted by Clinton. The proposal would require Clinton to admit he
lied under oath, something he has refused to do. Earlier this
month, Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee, proposed
that both houses of Congress approve a joint resolution of censure
that Clinton would be required to sign.

<P>
   A novel form of cancer treatment has neared the end of its
preliminary trials with promising results at the same time as new
research has cast doubt on its original rationale.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts, not yet resolved, may mean that the treatment is
less harmless to normal cells than thought. But it is also possible
that the treatment may be applicable to a much wider range of
cancers than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   The agent of treatment is a genetically altered adenovirus, one
of the viruses that cause the common cold. Called Onyx-015 by its
developer, Onyx Pharmaceuticals of Richmond, Calif., the virus is
injected directly into tumors. Enormous doses can be used without
apparent harm to the patient because the virus is designed to kill
certain types of tumor cells but not healthy cells.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is based on recent insights into the basic
genetics of tumor cells, and in particular the protective genes
that are subverted when a cell becomes cancerous. The virus is
designed for specific attacks on the many types of tumor cells that
have knocked out a critical gene called p53.
</P>
<P>
   Onyx-015 is being tested in patients with several types of
cancer but the trials with head and neck cancers are furthest
along. Onyx Pharmaceuticals reported last month that in 16 out of
26 patients with head and neck cancer, or 62 percent, the tumors
had shrunk by more than half, and that in six of those patients the
tumors had entirely disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In all cases, the patients received a standard chemotherapeutic
drug as well as the virus, because earlier tests had shown the two
agents in combination were more effective than either alone.
</P>
<P>
   The results are impressive because the patients were at an
advanced stage, all of them having failed to benefit from
conventional treatments. But because the test is a Phase 2 trial,
designed to explore the most effective dose with only a small
number of patients, the results cannot be regarded as conclusive.
The company now hopes, with Food and Drug Administration approval,
to move to a Phase 3 trial, with enough patients to arrive at a
statistically significant outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Arseneau, a doctor at the Albany (N.Y.) Medical
Center, is one of those testing the virus. Of the eight patients
with head and neck cancer whom he has treated so far, ``three have
had really superb results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With one guy, the tumor all went away,'' he said. ``In
another, there's just an area of thickness but the initial mass has
gone. The others had more minor responses. But given the situation
these people are in, with far advanced disease, I think it is
really remarkable they have done as well as they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on another track, several researchers experimenting
with the Onyx-015 virus in the laboratory say they find it behaves
rather differently than Onyx had proposed on the basis of its own
laboratory tests. The question of exactly how the virus works bears
both on its safety and on the range of tumor types it may be able
to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Normal cells have an intricate circuitry of interacting genes
and proteins that control their proliferation. The circuitry is
designed to make sure the cells divide when the body requires them
to, but to halt or even kill the cell if it attempts an
unauthorized division that might lead to cancer, such as after
invasion by a virus or damage to the chromosomes. Division is
tightly controlled by a system centered on a protein known as Rb.
The cell-arrest and cell-suicide programs are under the direction
of another protein, p53.
</P>
<P>
   For a cell to become tumorous, it must subvert the
division-control circuitry. Many tumor cells have sabotaged the Rb
gene and in about 60 percent the p53 gene is also mutated.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists have recently come to recognize that viruses, like
incipient tumor cells, must defeat the division-control circuitry
and that in the course of evolution, several viruses have targeted
the products of the very same genes that are mutated in tumor
cells. Adenovirus has at least three genes for this purpose. Its
E1A gene makes a substance that disrupts the Rb protein, while
E1B-55K blocks the division-arrest function of p53, and E1B-19K
jams p53's cell-suicide program.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Onyx's chief scientific officer at the time, Frank
McCormick, realized that the frequent mutation of the p53 gene in
tumor cells created a critical difference between them and the
healthy cells that could be exploited by a defective form of
adenovirus. An adenovirus lacking the E1B-55K gene that thwarts the
division-arrest mechanism of p53 would be unable to replicate in
normal cells, because their p53 system would block the division
process. But the defective virus could replicate in tumor cells
that had disabled their own p53, and go on to attack other tumor
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept is a very powerful one,'' said Dr. Scott Lowe, a
molecular biologist at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long
Island, N.Y. ``Once he told us, everyone said, `Why didn't I think
of that before?'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Onyx-015 is an adenovirus that lacks the E1B-55K
anti-division-arrest gene. In preclinical studies, the company
reported that the defective virus killed laboratory cultures of
p53-deficient tumor cells but was harmless to normal cells.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few months other researchers have come up with
contradictory results that ``question the reliability of Onyx's
original preclinical studies,'' said Dr. Steven Linke, a molecular
biologist at the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCormick has an excellent idea and I hope it will work,''
Linke said. ``But in the new studies, the Onyx virus in some cases
is unable to kill tumor cells that lack p53 function. The
conclusion would have to be that the killing mechanism is
independent of p53, although if the clinical trials are successful,
it may not matter too much how the virus works.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormick, who is now director of the cancer center at the
University of California at San Francisco, agrees it is now clear
that Onyx-015 can replicate in cancer cells with an intact p53
gene, ``which is not consistent with the original hypothesis at
all.'' But he believes a new discovery about the genetics of tumor
cells goes far toward explaining the apparently contradictory
results.
</P>
<P>
   Even in tumor cells where the p53 gene itself is intact, other
things may go wrong in the pathways through which p53 operates or
is activated. Biologists have recently discovered the genetic relay
through which Rb signals to p53 that an improper division is in
progress. This gene, known as p14-arf, turns out to be mutated in
many tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick says that all tumor cells may have mutations in either
the p53 gene or the p14-arf gene, so that either directly or
indirectly their p53 system is inactivated. This would explain why
Onyx-015 can replicate in tumor cells with normal p53 genes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the reports that Onyx-015 can infect normal cells in
laboratory culture, McCormick said it appears that the process of
culturing cells to make them grow outside the body can inactivate
p14-arf, again creating the conditions for Onyx-015 to flourish. He
noted there was no sign that Onyx-015 attacked normal cells in the
living body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viruses are highly conserved and everything they do is for a
clear purpose,'' McCormick said. ``If you accept that the virus
makes E1B-55K to neutralize p53, then our original hypothesis has
to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts say the suggestion that all tumor cells have
knocked out either p53 or p14-arf is plausible but has yet to be
fully demonstrated. They said that regardless of exactly how
Onyx-015 works, the general idea of using viruses to target the
Achilles' heels of tumor cells is highly promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite these bumps in the road, I still think it is a very
exciting strategy,'' Lowe said. ``If this virus doesn't work,
probably some other virus will.''

 &HT;    HEALTH: Multiple births can carry deadly danger for babies
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (l) Lifestyle categories.)
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ To women who have struggled to get pregnant, the
arrival of octuplets might seem to be a blessing, but multiple
births always cause alarm among doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Infertility treatments are becoming easier to take and more
popular, and multiple births are becoming more common, doctors say.
But their frequency doesn't diminish their danger.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their prematurity and their extraordinarily low birth
weight, the eight babies born to a 27-year-old Houston woman will
immediately face life-threatening dangers and won't be out of
harm's way for weeks. And aggressive infertility treatment will be
to blame if the octuplets _ one of whom was born two weeks ago _
don't survive these traumatic early years, experts said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is one baby,'' says Kaylen Silverberg, a physician
with the Texas Fertility Center in Austin. Any other outcome is
deemed less than successful, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But like Bobbi McCaughey, the Iowa woman who gave birth to the
first set of live septuplets in the United States last year, Nkem
Chukwu had more than one baby in part because of the fertility
drugs she was taking.
</P>
<P>
   Fertility drugs, which come in both pill and injectable forms,
stimulate the production of eggs in the ovaries and greatly
increase the chances of getting pregnant. Typically, women will
take the drugs for 8 to 12 days in a row, injecting themselves at
home.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what fertility medication Chukwu had been taking.
McCaughey took Pergonal, a drug that can be difficult and painful
to administer. The newest injectable varieties _ Fertinex,
Follistim and Gonal F _ are easier to use and can be more effective
than the older drugs, Silverberg says. But they must be
administered carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're using fertility drugs and you get eight fetuses,
it's not a success at the beginning,'' says Margaret Thompson, an
obstetrician at Renaissance Women's Group in Austin. ``In fact, I
think that would be viewed by most of us _ I hate to say failure _
it's not the desired result of fertility treatments. In most cases,
you would lose these fetuses.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Chukwu was remarkably lucky to carry seven of the
babies for 30 weeks, which is past the point in normal, 40-week
pregnancies when single babies would be considered dangerously
premature, Thompson said. The gestational age of a baby is the most
important factor in its development, though in this case the birth
weights will also be significant.
</P>
<P>
   The Chukwu octuplets ranged in size from 11 ounces to 1 pound,
11 ounces. Most babies born between the 28th and 30th weeks
typically weigh between 2 1/2 and 3 pounds, and the McCaughey
septuplets, who also were born in the 30th week, all weighed more
than 2 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say any babies born as small and as early as the Chukwu
octuplets face several threats to their survival. Their lungs will
struggle to function and could be injured by the machines used to
support them. Blood vessels deep in the babies' brains are fragile
and could spontaneously rupture, leading to serious neurological
problems, such as mental retardation and cerebral palsy. And their
intestinal tracts could become infected, causing inflammation of
the bowels. With the additional risk of infection, the octuplets
will need around-the-clock attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite everybody's best intention, you just can't do as good
a job of taking care of that many babies as you can with a lesser
numbers of babies,'' says Todd Scharnberg, chief of neonatology for
the Seton HealthCare Network in Austin. ``It's a huge concern,
because dealing with one baby at that gestation is a difficult
problem. Dealing with three or four or six or eight would strain
the capabilities of any intensive care unit in this country and
just make it more difficult to take care of the babies.''

 &HT;    ABP wants to sell book publisher, grow elsewhere
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ American Business Products said Monday it will sell
BookCrafters, its least-profitable division.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based ABP hired SunTrust Equitable Securities to sell
the short-run book printing company based in Chelsea, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is part of a move to enhance profitability, ABP said.
BookCrafters made a profit of $1.7 million on revenues of $50
million in 1997, a margin of about 3.3 percent, according to
Robinson-Humphrey, an Atlanta research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The division, one of five, generated revenue of about $45
million in the first 11 months of this year. No margins figures
have been released.
</P>
<P>
   ABP's shares closed Monday at $23.68 3/4, up 75 cents, on
above-average volume. BookCrafters will be counted as a
discontinued operation. ABP expects to record a material charge in
the fourth quarter of 1998 to account for the move.
</P>
<P>
   ABP employs 100 at its Atlanta headquarters, off Northside Drive
near I-285. Curtis 1000, an ABP subsidiary, employs 350 at a Duluth
manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   ABP is focusing its growth on its flexible packaging and custom
printing businesses, said Richard Smith, chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said ABP does not plan to sell Curtis 1000, its largest
division. Curtis is a digital printer of customized envelopes,
forms, labels, presentation folders and design services for small-
and medium-sized businesses. Starting in 1996, Curtis went through
an aggressive restructuring that closed 12 plants and expanded the
Duluth factory.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the company plans to use the proceeds from the
BookCrafters sale to develop and market new products and to
possibly acquire businesses in the industries in which its other
divisions compete.
</P>
<P>
   ABP's business supplies printing division includes Curtis 1000;
International Envelope, which makes Tyvek, a water resistant,
tear-free material used in envelopes and the backing for
self-adhesive postage stamps; Discount Labels; and Jen-Coat, which
makes special coatings for product labels and packaging materials,
such as Equal and Sweet'n Low.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he sees potential growth in selling alternative,
non-cardboard packaging to online and catalog retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ABP bought BookCrafters in 1972. The company typically prints
short runs, usually 1,000 to 10,000 books.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Smith, an analyst with Robinson-Humphrey, said the plans
were expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``BookCrafters had been slowing,'' he said. ``It didn't fit, and
it had the lowest return on asset of any business in the company.''

 &HT;    Pentagon OKs Lockheed fighter
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Pentagon has approved initial production of
Lockheed Martin's F-22 fighter, a milestone for the program headed
at the company's Marietta, Ga. plant.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts worth $761 million passed final review by a top
Pentagon panel. One, for $571 million, will fund two production
test planes. Another, for $190 million, includes advance payments
on six more of the state-of-the-art warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a favorable review,'' Gloria Cales, an Air Force
spokeswoman, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts still must be signed by Defense Secretary William
Cohen, a formality expected within days.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft covered by the contracts are the first of 339 F-22s
the Air Force plans to buy over the next 16 years for up to $41
billion, plus $19 billion in development costs.
</P>
<P>
   Final assembly is to be done in Marietta, where Lockheed
Martin's Aeronautical Systems unit oversees the F-22 program.
Boeing Co. is a major partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This moves the program to the production phase from the
development stage we've been in for the last few years,'' said Tom
Burbage, vice president and general manager of F-22 programs at the
Marietta plant. ``It's a nice way to end the year.''
</P>
<P>
   So far Lockheed Martin has produced three F-22s, two for flight
tests and one for ground tests.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract funds two planes, called Production
Representative Test Vehicles, to be built in 1999. They'll be used
to certify assembly line processes and, unlike the existing test
planes, will later go into service.
</P>
<P>
   Full funding for the next batch of six planes would be awarded
late next year, assuming the program receives continued support
from the Pentagon and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After that, production would ramp up to 24 planes annually by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 of the Marietta plant's 9,400 employees work on the
F-22. Burbage said that number will stay fairly constant, as
employment on the engineering side drops while production manpower
rises.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, F-22 flight testing fell behind schedule,
prompting the General Accounting Office to recommend delaying the
program. But the plane in November met the Pentagon's requirement
for 184.4 test hours _ 4 percent of the total planned _ before
initial production was approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the program is very solid technically,'' Burbage said.

 &HT;    Georgia companies rank high in Fortune's list
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fortune magazine says that two of the nation's best
employers are in a Georgia city that seldom gets out of the shadow
of image-conscious Atlanta. The magazine's Jan. 11 edition ranks
Columbus-based Synovus Financial and AFLAC in the top 15 of the 100
best companies to work for in America.
</P>
<P>
   Synovus, a banking and credit card processing company, took the
top spot in the annual ranking. AFLAC, an insurance company, ranked
13th in the magazine, which will be on newsstands beginning Dec.
28.
</P>
<P>
   The only other city with two entries in the top 15 was Dallas.
One Atlanta company broke the top 100: flooring company Interface
is ranked 96.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year when it was ranked number 11 by Fortune, Synovus
added a program giving all 10,000 of its employees stock options,
created a $1 million-year leadership training program for workers
and began offering a $5,000 assistance benefit to employees who
want to adopt a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recognition means a lot to our company, but the most
important thing is we know we still have to do a lot,'' said
Elizabeth ``Lee Lee'' James, who heads up Synovus Service Corp.,
the company's administrative arm. ``We focus on making sure every
person in our company knows that somebody cares about them.'' The
company pays up to 21 percent of salary annually toward employee
retirement, produces a magazine describing how it helps employees
who have faced personal tragedies, and purchased 3,200 bricks _
each with the name of employees _ for a new $100 million campus in
downtown Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Synovus has $10 billion in assets and owns 36 banks in the
Southeast. It also owns 80.7 percent of Total System Services, one
of the world's biggest credit and debit card processing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune said it polled more than 27,000 employees and
collaborated with best-selling authors Robert Levering and Milton
Moskowitz to come up with the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   AFLAC CEO Dan Amos said he competes for top employees with
Synovus, across town, and he wanted a boost when recruiting
out-of-state job candidates to Columbus. ``My main goal was to have
been in the top 100. To be the top insurance company is more than I
ever dreamed of in one year.''
</P>
<P>
   AFLAC began giving employees stock options this year, brought in
a service where employees can buy prepared dinners to warm up when
they get home, and created a walk-in medical clinic where employees
pay $10 for treatment of minor ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus business boosters and economic development recruiters
hope to capitalize on the double listing in Fortune.

SIGNS OF DECAY AND SURVIVAL IN A NATION FROZEN IN TIME 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also IRAQ-MILITARY) 
(JT)

<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ At one newsstand in downtown Baghdad, a magazine
on display reports that the Prince of Wales has been seen with Lady
Diana Spencer and speculates that a romance might be blossoming. At
another the prize offering is a maintenance manual for the 1988
Oldsmobile.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is a nation frozen in time, and the recent wave of American
and British bombing seems to have done nothing that would hasten a
thaw.
</P>
<P>
   The oddest thing about the bombing campaign, at least as viewed
from Baghdad, is how little it changed anything. Monday life
continued as if the explosions that were heard last week were
nothing more than a fireworks show.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there was an air of theater about the streaking
antiaircraft fire that lit up the sky during the bombing raids.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Iraqi fire, if not all of it, came from low-caliber
weapons that had no more chance of shooting down a jet fighter than
a popgun would have. Its only purpose was to give Iraqis a sense
that they were in some way masters of their destiny and not simply
mute subjects.
</P>
<P>
   That sense was probably inaccurate. Iraq may still be able to
defy the West, but people here cannot affect the course of
President Saddam Hussein's government.
</P>
<P>
   Out of necessity, if for no other reason, Iraqis seem to have
accepted their fate. As they adjusted Monday to a new period of
peace, they continued to live in a world that for nearly a decade
has not progressed a bit and in fact has slowly deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this more visible than along the banks of the Tigris,
which runs through the heart of Baghdad. For generations its
landscaped banks were one of the most romantic places to stroll in
the entire Middle East, lined with seafood restaurants that were
packed until late at night.
</P>
<P>
   Now the once-magnificent parks are overgrown with weeds, and the
ruins of the restaurants are home only to vermin. Monday afternoon,
groups of unemployed men sat silently in chairs along the opposite
sidewalk, gazing toward the river and perhaps recalling the city's
lost glory.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad's central bazaar resembles Cairo's or Istanbul's played
in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fair amount to buy, but nothing like what is
available even in comparably tiny cities like Amman, Jordan, or
Manama, Bahrain. The bursting commercial energy that throbs through
the rest of the Middle East is absent here, as if someone had
sprinkled the population with sleeping powder.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after the United Nations imposed punishing economic
sanctions on Iraq, people here have devised two distinct strategies
for dealing with the country's steady decline.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary people have simply reduced their expectations. They
live on what can be produced inside the country and on rations
distributed by the United Nations. For them the only affordable
goods from abroad are cheap Chinese clothing, toothbrushes from
Thailand and colognes with incongruous names like America, Top Gun
and Route 66.
</P>
<P>
   The elite have found ways to maintain the good life. There are
villas along leafy avenues and new Toyota sedans, which under the
right circumstances might someday be traded for the latest BMW or
Mercedes models. In places like the Samsung dealership downtown,
televisions, computers and microwave ovens are available at bargain
prices, courtesy of sanctions-busting smugglers working from
Persian Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 30 percent of the people can afford what we sell,'' a
Samsung salesman said as he tested a new computer game. ``There is
still a market.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Samsung showroom and the stores nearby that sell
expensive items like imported marble floor tiles, the idea of
rebelling against President Hussein, as the United States has been
urging, seems far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   He not only summarily executes everyone he suspects of plotting
against him, but he offers privileges to his elite that make
loyalty pay off.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many Iraqis, the image of the United States is
reflected not by dazzling consumer goods or terrifying weapons, but
rather by the decaying United States Embassy, which sits forlornly
on a Baghdad street corner, guarded by three friendly young
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the embassy, yellowing photos of San Diego, Houston and
other cities line the main stairwell. The emblem of the Marine
Corps decorates the door of one empty office, while a reproduction
of Edward Hopper's ``Nighthawks'' hangs in another.
</P>
<P>
   One shelf holds a set of American Heritage magazines, the latest
dated June 1990, just before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the
resulting evacuation of American diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   A Polish diplomat now sits in the office that was used by the
last United States Ambassador, April Glaspie. He represents
American interests in Iraq, presumably no more ambiguously than Ms.
Glaspie, who gave Saddam fateful signals that he apparently
interpreted as a go-ahead for his invasion of Kuwait in August
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Along streets near the embassy, shopping malls lie quiet, shut
long ago when sanctions began to bite. Storefronts that once housed
travel agencies are still plastered with KLM and Air France decals,
but with the airlines unable to fly here, no one has opened their
doors for years.
</P>
<P>
   At Al Rashid Hotel, one of the few hotels still functioning,
pictures of Santa Claus and cherubs hang from the walls. Monday an
ersatz Christmas tree, fully decorated, was placed in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone entering the hotel must walk across a large floor panel
bearing a diabolical likeness of George Bush and the motto ``Bush
Is Criminal.'' Employees said there was no plan to update it by
adding President Clinton's image.

   Faced with a choice between a crash landing in the Himalayas or
the possibility of being forced down by China's armed forces, three
balloonists seeking to circle the world nonstop pressed on into
Chinese airspace Monday, hoping for a last-minute change of heart
by the Beijing government.
</P>
<P>
   During the fourth day of their flight, the three-member crew _
Richard Branson, Per Lindstrand and Steve Fossett _ encountered the
first serious check to their rapid progress. Soon after they had
committed their 160-foot-high balloon to a course taking it over
the Himalayas from India, the Chinese foreign ministry sent word
that the overflight permission it had granted the balloonists on
Nov. 26 had been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   In a satellite telephone interview Monday while the balloon was
over Nepal at an altitude of 29,000 feet, Fossett said: ``We're in
a real jam. We're already over the Himalayas and there's no place
to land. We have to keep going into China, and once over Chinese
territory they could order us to land, or might even shoot us
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't turn back, we can't land and we can't avoid China,''
Fossett said.
</P>
<P>
   As Fossett spoke, the balloon was 29,000 feet high and a scant
15 miles from the Chinese border. Two hours later in the darkness
of night the balloon crossed into China in a region dominated by
the highest mountains in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair announced that his
government had appealed to China to let the ICO Global Challenge
pass. Branson (who is the billionaire chairman of the Virgin Group)
and Lindstrand, chairman of Lindstrand Balloons, Ltd., are British
subjects. Fossett, a wealthy commodities broker and a champion
long-distance balloonist, is American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I'm an American, we're also trying to get Washington to
appeal to China to let us pass,'' Fossett said. ``If we can just
get past China there are no further political obstacles, and we
have enough fuel to complete the trip. But right now it's touch and
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the ICO Global Challenge rose from its launching site at
Marrakesh, Morocco, on Friday, jet-stream winds have whisked it
nearly a third of the way around the world. But the flight has been
anything but relaxing. On Saturday the balloonists were forced to
fly through a dangerous corridor between a line of powerful
thunderstorms in southern Turkey and the border of hostile Iraq.
The balloon also had to carefully thread its way around the borders
of Iran and Russia, which denied it overflight permission.
</P>
<P>
   Although a balloon cannot steer, it can rise or descend, seeking
out winds blowing in the desired direction. For this, a team of
ground-based meteorologists in London constantly analyzing weather
data provides the ICO Global Challenge with essential guidance.
</P>
<P>
   No balloonists have ever come close to circling the earth
nonstop, but more teams are expected to try in the coming months
than ever before. Seven teams besides the ICO Global Challenge have
announced plans to try their luck. Two of them _ Switzerland's
Breitling Orbiter 3 and Britain's Cable &AMP; Wireless Balloon _ are
already at their launching pads in the Swiss Alps and Spain
awaiting favorable weather to start. Two others hope to be ready
before the season's weather opportunity ends in mid February. Three
other balloon teams are planning attempts from the southern
hemisphere next July.

MULTIPLE BIRTHS CAN BE DANGEROUS SIDE EFFECT TO USE OF FERTILITY
DRUGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By T.J. MILLING 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Fertility drugs may be a godsend to couples desperate
to have children, but multiple births like the octuplets born in
Houston are a dangerous side effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human being was meant to have one baby,'' said Dr. Brian
Kirshon, a high-risk obstetrician/gynecologist who delivered the
octuplets Sunday at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital. ``When you get
up to these high-order pregnancies, it's so unusual to be able to
keep the babies alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The type of fertility treatment given to octuplet mom Nkem
Chukwu was similar to that given to the mothers in other recent
multiple births _ a septuplet mom in Iowa, a sextuplet mom from
Kingwood, Texas, and an octuplet mom in England who lost all her
fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   St. Luke's Hospital, where the Chukwu octuplets were delivered,
did not administer the fertility treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is a combination of hormones, one that promotes
maturation of the ovarian follicle, and another that causes the
ovum to pop off the ovary and enter the fallopian tube where it can
be fertilized by sperm.
</P>
<P>
   After the administration of the first, the doctor can use a
scope to look at the ovary and see how many ovarian follicles _ the
structures that contain the ova, commonly called eggs _ are mature
enough to ovulate. The ethical question for a fertility doctor is
whether to administer the second hormone when he sees multiple
mature follicles that could lead to multiple fetuses and major
complications for mother and children.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting babies are commonly born premature, facing lung,
heart and metabolic problems, and an increased risk of developing
abnormalities like cerebral palsy. The mother has a high risk of
developing diabetes or high blood pressure or both.
</P>
<P>
   The ova can be removed and united with sperm in a test tube, a
process called in vitro fertilization, and then one to five
fertilized ova can be reimplanted in the uterus. Kirshon said
doctors generally are implanting lower numbers of ova, say one or
two, to avoid the problems of multiple births, but regardless there
cannot possibly be more fetuses than ova implanted.
</P>
<P>
   When the hormone cocktail is used with natural fertilization,
many ova can pop into the fallopian tube, be fertilized and
eventually roll down into the uterus for implantation.
</P>
<P>
   There is a process called reduction in which the doctor
selectively removes some of the implanted ova to give the others a
better chance of surviving. But many women object to that procedure
on religious or philosophical grounds, likening it to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Kirshon said it is a difficult line for doctors to walk, trying
to give women enough treatment to get pregnant but not too much,
and all the while dealing with their desperate desire to have
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women will go to any lengths to get pregnant,'' he said.

IMELDA'S CLAIMS OF MARCOS WEALTH STUNS EVEN JADED FILIPINOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ In the pre-Christmas bustle of this
teeming city, a ghost of the Philippine past has suddenly
re-emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Imelda Marcos, the 69-year-old widow of the dictator Ferdinand
E. Marcos, has announced that she plans to file a lawsuit to
recover more than $12 billion in assets that she claims belonged to
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   After insisting for years that her husband had not been a
kleptocrat but a public servant who made other people rich, she
declared in an interview with The Philippine Inquirer, ``We own
practically everything in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a startling admission, even from a woman known for Norma
Desmond-like theatricality. From people here, who have watched Mrs.
Marcos laugh, weep, rant and burst into song for more than three
decades, one could almost hear the collective reaction: ``She's
b-a-a-a-ck.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the former first lady has actually been back for a
while. Since returning from exile in Hawaii in 1991, Mrs. Marcos
has run for the House of Representatives and won, run for the
presidency and lost, been convicted of graft by a Philippine court
and been acquitted on appeal by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   These days, she lives in a plush apartment in central Manila,
where she holds court with a dwindling retinue of friends and
hangers-on. More marginalized than ever, Mrs. Marcos has become a
virtual caricature of herself, a loquacious woman referred to by
less generous people as the Madwoman of Manila.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Mrs. Marcos has caught everyone's attention again.
Not only has she freely acknowledged that her husband had amassed
vast business interests, but she is identifying the assets in
question. She said that Marcos owned more than $12 billion worth of
shares in dozens of companies, including institutions like
Philippine Airlines and Philippine Long Distance Telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Marcos said her husband had entrusted the shares to his
close associates. Several of these friends went on to become the
wealthiest business tycoons in the Philippines, and they came to
epitomize the crony capitalism that took poisonous root here and in
other Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Marcos told The Inquirer that the cronies to whom Marcos
had entrusted his money became ``so rich that they got too
greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' she said, ``they refuse to turn over the top firms that
the Marcoses rightfully owned.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Marcos' public comments have alarmed her daughter, Imee
Marcos, who is a legislator from her father's old district. The
younger Ms. Marcos said her family is still anxious to reach a
compromise with the government over her father's wealth. Her
mother, she said half-jokingly, is ``wild and crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the initial japes and raised eyebrows, people here
said Mrs. Marcos' claims would resonate in a country that is still
struggling to move out of the long shadow of Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imelda's pronouncement have awoken people's consciousness
about what was done under Marcos,'' said Bernardo Villegas, dean of
the School of Economics at the University of Asia and the Pacific.
``That's why, in a way, critics of the government are watching this
case very closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Worries about cronyism have resurfaced under the new president,
Joseph E. Estrada, a genial former movie star who has befriended
some of the most notorious cronies of the Marcos era.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos, elected president in 1965, was ousted in a popular
revolt in 1986. He denied any wrongdoing and died in exile in
Hawaii three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada recently interceded in some business deals in a way that
has benefited his friends and campaign supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a Hong Kong company acquired control of Philippine
Long Distance Telephone by buying $781 million worth of shares from
the Cojuangco family, a business dynasty that was close to Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing an old-time crony earn such lucre, Mrs. Marcos
swung into action. She said that the Cojuangco shares really
belonged to Marcos, who gave them to Ramon Cojuangco in a trust.
Cojuangco's son, Antonio Cojuangco, has challenged Mrs. Marcos to
show proof.
</P>
<P>
   Given the dubious provenance of so many fortunes here, some
experts said Mrs. Marcos may have a case. But Sergio Osmena, a
senator who was jailed by Marcos in 1972, said she risked more
litigation with her claims. If the Marcoses owned so many shares,
he asked, ``why didn't they pay taxes on them?''
</P>
<P>
   Few people take such a comment as a serious threat to the Marcos
family. By one count, the government has filed 60 lawsuits against
the Marcos family over the last 11 years, but has yet to win a
conviction. And Estrada favors a compromise under which Mrs. Marcos
would return some assets to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Several political analysts here said that Mrs. Marcos'
disclosures were a sign of her self-confidence. ``Imelda has been
acquitted by the Supreme Court, and she may feel more comfortable
with the current administration,'' said Christian Monzad, a former
chairman of the Philippine Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Marcos has retained the law firm of Senator Juan Ponce
Enrile, who was her husband's Defense Secretary but who turned on
him when the ``People Power'' movement began to gather momentum
against his boss.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reaction to her claims, Enrile is not taking any
chances. After several days of incendiary quotes in The Philippine
Inquirer, he imposed a gag order on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gets herself into trouble whenever she opens her mouth,''
said one of her advisers, passing along the news that, incredibly,
Imelda Marcos did not want to talk.

LIBYA THREATENED WITH FURTHER SANCTIONS IF BOMB SUSPECTS ARE NOT
TURNED OVER  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ On the 10th anniversary of the bombing of a Pan
Am jet over Scotland, the United States told Libya Monday that it
would face more sanctions if two Libyan suspects are not turned
over for trial by a Scottish judge in the Netherlands by February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years is much too long to wait for justice,'' said Peter
Burleigh, the American representative on the Security Council,
which discussed the issue Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Libya, however, Col. Moammar Gadhafi only widened the breach
Monday, apparently rejecting the compromise plan for a trial in the
Netherlands by saying that he wanted an international tribunal to
hear the case. Earlier this month Libya's national assembly seemed
to endorse the plan for a Scottish trial after a personal appeal to
Gadhafi from Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who went to Libya on
Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``An international court is the solution,'' Gadhafi told a Dutch
television interviewer in a program taped last week and broadcast
in the Netherlands Monday, ``with judges from America, Libya,
England and other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, at a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery marking
the bombing, President Clinton said the plan to hold the trial in
the Netherlands was a ``take it or leave it'' deal. ``We will not
negotiate its terms,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For years Libya refused to allow American or British courts to
try the suspects in the bombing, which killed 270 people, including
11 on the ground in Lockerbie, the Scottish town where the plane
came down. In August Britain and the United States offered the
compromise of a trial in a third country, and the Netherlands
agreed to allow a Scottish court to be set up for that purpose in
Utrecht.
</P>
<P>
   But Libya, under U.N. sanctions since 1992, continued to stall,
raising a number of questions about the treatment of the suspects
and where they would be imprisoned if convicted. British officials
and the secretary-general's legal counsel, Under Secretary-General
Hans Corell, replied exhaustively to the Libyans.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative at the United
Nations, said Monday that all the questions raised by Libya had
been answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``These clarifications show that we have no hidden agenda and
that we are acting in good faith,'' he said after the Council
meeting Monday morning. ``Our objective is simply a free and fair
trial before the eyes of the world. If acquitted the two accused
would be free to return to Libya.''
</P>
<P>
   Arab diplomats say that Libya is concerned that the two
suspects, Basset Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah,
could be pressed by Western intelligence agencies or trial
prosecutors to talk about more than Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said again Monday that he remains optimistic that Libya
will eventually comply with the request to send the suspects to the
Netherlands. But the signs from Libya seem to be pointing in
another direction.
</P>
<P>
   In February the Security Council will review the sanctions on
Libya, which include a ban on international air travel to and from
the country, an arms embargo and a bar on the sale of spare parts
for aircraft and the oil industry. The sanctions would be suspended
immediately if the suspects were handed over.
</P>
<P>
   By February, Burleigh said Monday, ``the Libyan government will
have had six months to accept the offer it long said it would
accept.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If by that time, the government of Libya has not handed over
the suspects for trial before a Scottish court in the
Netherlands,'' he said, ``we will seek additional measures to
compel compliance.''

CROWDS FROM ALL NATIONS _ EXCEPT ONE _ ARE TRAVELING TO AND FROM
CUBA
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   For the past two years, Cuba's leaders have made an energetic
effort to open up Cuban society to the outside world. Almost every
week the island has hosted an international gathering of one kind
or another.
</P>
<P>
   Since the highly celebrated visit of Pope John Paul II last
January, professional organizations around the hemisphere have been
scheduling conventions and conferences there. Fidel Castro
personally welcomes many of them when he is not making state visits
to other Caribbean, Latin American or European countries. His
speaking and traveling schedule this year has resembled that of an
U.S. politician running for his party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Portugal, Castro encountered King Juan Carlos of
Spain. He playfully reminded the monarch that the governor
general's palace in Havana, built in 1791, contains a throne
installed in expectation of a visit by a Spanish king, but one
never came. Cuba has preserved both the palace and the throne for
200 years as national historic treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope you will come and see us,'' Castro teasingly beckoned
to Juan Carlos. ``We have your chair all ready for you.''
</P>
<P>
   As spokesman in chief for the island nation, the bearded leader
displays a freewheeling style. A few weeks ago, he welcomed U.S.
editors and publishers, answering their questions _ some at
unexpected length. At one point, the conversation turned to the
pennant-winning New York Yankees' stellar performer, Cuban
expatriate Orlando ``Duke'' Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Castro insisted that his country has many more where the Duke
came from. He promptly offered to field an entire big-league team
if the majors were interested. ``Why not?'' he pressed. ``Canada
has a big-league team.''
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian journalist interrupted to stress that Canada has two
major-league teams. ``Good point!'' replied Castro. ``We'll raise
you two teams!''
</P>
<P>
   The week I was there in November, Havana was entertaining a
conclave of artists and writers. The Cuban leader's speech to the
group was broadcast on nationwide television. Next only to
baseball, the fine arts claim the country's most devoted following.
</P>
<P>
   Around picturesque old plazas in the evenings echo the strains
of string instruments, with occasional bongo accompaniment.
Informal mariachi-style ensembles serenade diners at the little
bars and restaurants. At schools and village gatherings, amateur
artists are encouraged to perform.
</P>
<P>
   During my visit, the Cuban arts community was host to a
worldwide ballet festival featuring internationally prominent
performers from nine countries. Havana's ornate old Opera House was
jammed to capacity for each performance _ someone in every seat, a
vertical figure in every imaginable standing space. In Cuba, ballet
is not an elitist escape. Admission is only 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The overflow crowd at the Friday night finale rose in standing
ovation at the entrance in the balcony of Alicia Alonso, Cuba's
former prima ballerina. Now in her late 70s and blind, the
indomitable woman is considered a national treasure. She personally
choreographed one of the evening's numbers, insisting that even if
she can't see, she can feel the movement.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest surprise of all was the tumultuous response of
the crowd to a multiracial, 13-member troupe of 10- to 15-year-old,
mostly inner-city kids from Los Angeles. They didn't attempt
classical ballet. They tap-danced.
</P>
<P>
   Their fresh-faced routine, performed to an orchestral
arrangement of ``It Don't Mean a Thing if It Ain't Got That
Swing,'' brought down the house at every performance. The North
American kids, judging by length of applause and audience-demanded
encores, were easily the most popular performers among a standout
cast of professionals. Whatever else this may say, it told me that
there's no popular animus here toward Americans _ certainly not
toward our children.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for an ideological meaning in the audience's
preferences would have to be puzzled, however. The
next-most-applauded presentation was an innovative number by
Italian ballerina Carla Fracci, featuring her imaginative use of an
enormous scarlet veil.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of her energetic dance was performed to a
stirring accompaniment of the socialist anthem, the
``Internationale.'' Then, as the martial rhythm faded, the music
segued to a slow, clear-voiced operatic rendition of ``Ave Maria.''
The ballerina contrived at one point to shape the bright red scarf
into the form of a cross. The two themes blended into the heartily
cheered performance.
</P>
<P>
   We may be excused, perhaps, if curiosity prompts us to grope for
meaning. The enthusiastic audience reaction may have been saying,
as Lorenzo Albacete suggested in the Jan. 26 edition of ``The New
Yorker,'' that a new generation of Cuban Roman Catholics finds no
unbridgeable gulf between the social goals of the Revolution and
the social mission of the Church. Or all this may merely reflect
the universality of art. Or could it bespeak some inchoate yearning
for a reconciliation of the family of man?

UNDATED: family of man? 
<TEXT>
<P>
   International visitors have always been celebrated in Cuba, and
Ernest Hemingway may be the most beloved. The La Bodeguita
restaurant, on a narrow cobbled side street off Cathedral Plaza,
advertises itself as the famous novelist's favorite hangout.
</P>
<P>
   Memory has it that ``Papa'' Hemingway enjoyed sitting in the
crowded bar, where the names of ancient patrons in graffiti now
adorn almost every available inch of interior wall space. Here the
moody author would down Mojitos, an island drink concocted of sugar
cane, rum, lime juice and crushed mint. Then he'd stroll a few
blocks to the Floridita Bar, where he'd order daiquiris. After
satisfying his thirst, Hemingway would repair in good spirits to
his residence and continue composing whatever work absorbed him at
the time, perhaps ``The Old Man and the Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   On the wall above the corner in the Floridita where the writer
so frequently sat regaling bartenders, there appears a framed
photograph of a white-bearded Hemingway talking with a youthful
Castro. The seat on his favorite bar stool has been removed, and
the upright pipe that supported it is chained off. This spot where
locals swear Hemingway took his last drink before going home and
shooting himself is permanently retired from occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   At the newly restored Hotel Nacional, Havana's premier hostelry
of bygone decades, tourists and conventioneers can see full walls
overprinted with mural photographs of Jack Dempsey, Errol Flynn,
Rita Hayworth, George Raft and a host of other popular American
performers who appeared there in the pre-Castro years when Havana
was a gambling mecca and local night life was dominated by mob
figures like Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky. Pictures of these,
too, adorn the wall of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   But tourists seeking richer history, dating back to Christopher
Columbus and Hernando De Soto, find it lovingly preserved in La
Habana Vieja, the Old City. Cubans take pride in the United
Nations' designation of their ancient capital as one of the world's
historic cities. They see it as a sanctuary from modernity's visual
and aural blights. In restoring their Hotel Row for tourists, they
make clear that they have in mind no mimicry of Las Vegas. ``And
the Caribbean doesn't need two Miami Beaches,'' one told me. Havana
has more in common, I'm thinking, with New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The city's seven plazas commemorate in art and statuary the
country's unique variety of cultural and historic heroes. Here is a
bronze statue to Santa Isabella _ De Soto's widow and the only
woman ever designated governor of Cuba. There is one to Jose Marti,
independence martyr of the war against Spain. And the Plaza de
Armas, built on the site of Fulgencio Batista's former military
headquarters, features displays of the 1959 Revolution. There's
even a 1950s vintage armored tank, from which (popular legend has
it) Castro himself shot and sank one of the landing boats at the
1961 U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion attempt.
</P>
<P>
   To the west of the city, past the duty-free zone with its
industrial assembly park, a road follows the shoreline curve
through lush foliage and ends at a seaside medical resort dedicated
to long-term treatment of children's diseases. Here I saw a softer
side of Cuban life.
</P>
<P>
   Two formal hospital wards, several playground areas and 45 large
guest houses for patients and parents sprawl in a natural grassy
setting that slopes off to the sea. Here a group of specialists
provides treatment and a therapeutic recovery environment for young
people suffering from malignancies and leukemia, chronic kidney and
renal ailments, and various psychosomatic disorders.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of youngsters greets our small party's arrival. Some
want their pictures taken with us. A tow-headed 10-year-old boy has
spots of baldness. His hair is just returning after chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julio Medina, physician in charge, explains that treatment
is free for Cuban youth and selected others who come as ``guests of
the Cuban people.'' The facility, for example, has provided
treatment and rehabilitative services for about 300 young
Ukrainians afflicted by the nuclear accident at Chernobyl a decade
ago. Some have discovered delayed symptoms only in the past year or
so.
</P>
<P>
   I talked with Dr. Gennady L. Korneinko of Kiev, who helps raise
money in Ukraine to transport these young patients to Cuba. No
comparable treatment is available, he assures us, anywhere in
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A Ukrainian father, here with his 15-year-old daughter, tells me
she has been given ``a second chance for life.'' He is full of
gratitude to the Cuban people.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts like these have helped Cuba win respect from other
nations. No longer a social pariah, it now maintains friendly
diplomatic and trade relations with almost every nation except our
own. An estimated 1 million to 4 million tourists visited the
island this year, spending close to $2 billion there. More are
expected next year.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond doubt, our continued economic embargo has hurt the Cuban
economy and its people. Considerable economic recovery has occurred
in spite of it. But the embargo has made recovery slower,
identifiably more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The great irony is that the purpose of our sanctions was to
convince the Cubans to overthrow Castro. In reality, they've had
the exact opposite effect. For years they gave Cuba's hard-liners
an excuse for economic failure.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Dominguez, Harvard's resident Cuba expert, wrote in 1993:
``The Castro regime endures in part because its enemies unwittingly
help it to survive.'' The sanctions provide a convenient and
creditable scapegoat on which to blame shortages and high prices of
almost any sort, say longtime observers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, three former U.S. secretaries of state and a
bipartisan group of senators called on President Clinton to appoint
a blue-ribbon commission to recommend a new approach to U.S.-Cuban
relations. One hundred years have passed since the Spanish-American
War, 38 since the Bay of Pigs invasion attempt, and 36 since the
missile crisis. Our lease on Guantanamo Bay will expire in 2002. It
does seem time for a fresh approach.

ROME PREPARES FOR A WORLDWIDE INVASION OF PILGRIMS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beneath the soaring porch of St. Peter's Basilica, toward the
right, is the towering bronze Holy Door, surmounted by inscriptions
in Latin and Greek. Striking the door three times with a ceremonial
hammer next Christmas Eve, Pope John Paul II, clad in white and
gold vestments, will usher in a millennial Holy Year that will last
until early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church and the Italian government, each in
its own way, are making that a special year for visiting Rome.
Roman Catholics will need little inducement. Other visitors, of all
faiths or none, will have a chance to witness the pageantry with
which the church celebrates such occasions.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the promise of this magnificent yet tarnished city
renewing its ancient splendor.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Peter's and the three other patriarchal basilicas _ St.
John Lateran, St. Mary Major and St. Paul Without the Walls _ there
will be special Masses, including some in the colorful rites of the
Oriental churches, stressing the pope's role as leader of the
universal Church.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Day 1999, the pope or a cardinal designated by him
will open a second Holy Door, at St. John Lateran, John Paul's
cathedral as Bishop of Rome; on Jan. 18, 2000, a third Holy Door,
at St. Paul Without the Walls, opens to begin a week of prayer for
the unity of Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Year will end on the Feast of the Epiphany, Jan. 6,
2001, when the pope celebrates a solemn Mass and ceremonially
closes the Holy Door at St. Peter's. But before that, grand events
gathering hundreds of thousands in celebration and prayer will
occur, with the high point in the summer of 2000, when a world
youth day is expected to attract as many as two million.
</P>
<P>
   In celebrating the Holy Year, Pope John Paul sets forth a
tradition begun in 1300, when Pope Boniface VIII adapted a Jewish
ideal _ in which every 50th year all land is to be returned to
rightful owners, slaves freed and debts forgiven _ to Christian
use.
</P>
<P>
   The popes, by evoking the tradition, sought to cement Rome's
image as the new Jerusalem, and Christians around the world were
urged to pray and do penance and, if possible, visit Rome.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no ordinary jubilee, it is millennial stuff, and
with the rise of modern tourism and air travel, it will mean crowds
unlike any that Rome has seen in Holy Years before. Moreover, John
Paul, who has been unusually sensitive to the opportunities the
church calendar offers for symbolic gestures, is putting his
imprint on the events.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the day for Christian unity, there will be a day
of asking forgiveness for the failures of Christianity, a theme
John Paul has stressed in the past, and a day (March 3, 2000)
dedicated to Christian dialogue with the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has often spoken of the emotion with which he looks
forward to receiving pilgrims from around the world for the
jubilee. On assuming the papacy in 1978, John Paul was told by his
spiritual mentor, Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski, the Primate of Poland,
that he would lead the church into the third millennium, and he has
always looked upon those words as prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   Liturgical events will include Masses, processions, blessings,
public praying of the rosary, and the public celebration of
baptisms and the ordinations of priests.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo Scelzo, the spokesman for the Vatican's Jubilee
Committee, said that few detailed plans had thus far been laid for
many of the events. But he said they can be expected to be
particularly splendid in their pageantry, and John Paul and other
celebrants will, as has been the custom in previous Holy Years, don
many of the Vatican's most treasured vestments.
</P>
<P>
   At the last Holy Year, in 1983, he often bore a 10th-century
gold three-staved pastoral staff of a kind that popes had not used
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Some ceremonies, like the ordination of new bishops on Jan. 6,
2000, will be in St. Peter's; basilicas nearly as grand will
provide the stage for others. While most events will be in the
rites of the Roman Catholic Church, some will be in the colorful
and exotic ceremonials of Oriental churches that remain in
communion with Rome, like the Coptic, Armenian, and Syrian
churches.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Events regularly celebrated by the pope in any year will gain
added splendor. On March 8, 2000, Ash Wednesday, traffic in much of
Rome will stop as the pope, clad in purple vestments signifying
grief and accompanied by members of the College of Cardinals, walks
in penitential procession the mile or so from the venerable
Basilica of Santa Sabina on the Aventine Hill, one of the earliest
Christian places of worship, to the Circus Maximus.
</P>
<P>
   First, he will have his forehead anointed with ashes by one of
the cardinals, then proceed to the Circus for the ceremony of
asking forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the year, days of Masses and prayers will be set
aside for special groups. On Jan. 2, 2000, for example, there will
be a Jubilee of the Children, to which thousands of families from
around the world will be invited. The pope will celebrate a solemn
Mass, during which hundreds of infants will be baptized.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 18, 2000, a Jubilee of Artists will take place, to which
the pope will invite painters, sculptors, writers, musicians,
actors, film directors and others. Preceding it will be
performances and art exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, 2000, a Marathon of Peace will be sponsored by the
Vatican and the city of Rome; 50,000 runners are expected. From
June 18 to 25, 2000, the pope will preside over a World Eucharistic
Congress, a gathering of prayer and discussion for invited
religious and lay people, in St. John Lateran; on Aug. 19 and 20,
2000, World Youth Day will take place at Tor Vergata, a campus of
the University of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   It still remains unclear just where all the visitors will stay.
Forecasts suggest a profile of visitors with less means than the
typical tourist to Rome, including many pilgrims from the former
Communist countries of Central Europe, like the pope's native
Poland. In addition to Rome's hotels, many convents and monasteries
will open their doors to pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk of erecting large tent cities, though no
details have yet emerged, and for mass gatherings like World Youth
Day, large numbers of young visitors may simply set up impromptu
camping grounds under Rome's usually cloudless August skies. But
Ciro dell'Acqua, a spokesman for the municipal agency helping to
organize the jubilee, confessed that, `'we don't yet know exactly
how the Vatican wants to put all these people up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rome's civil government looks on all this with delight, as a
means to promote its tourist attractions, if indeed they needed
such promotion. New museums have opened, like the Palazzo Altemps
and the Palazzo Massimo, while others, including the Palazzo
Barberini and the Capitoline Museums, are being refurbished. The
opera and the philharmonic orchestra of Santa Cecilia will have
special jubilee programs.
</P>
<P>
   Rome's hugely successful private museum, Palazzo delle
Esposizioni, will feature the exhibit ``Christian Rome From the
Third to Sixth Century.''
</P>
<P>
   In the former stables of the Quirinal Palace, once the papal
residence and now home to the Italian president, the architect Gae
Aulenti is designing a new museum for the jubilee. It will include
an exhibit on the event whose occurrence 2,000 years ago provided
the reason for all the festivity and prayer _ the Nativity of
Christ.

for up to $3,000 per child per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cashing in on the current three and the next one,'' the
52-year-old assistant vice president said with a laugh. `'I figure
I'll have 11 years of (college) expenses paid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Future Leaders Grant Program, as the new tuition plan is
called, is one of the many perks and programs that earned Finova a
prime spot on ``Fortune'' magazine's second annual ``100 Best
Companies to Work for in America'' list. The rankings were
announced Monday and are included in the Jan. 11 issue, out next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly traded company, which was spun off from the old
Dial conglomerate in 1992, ranked No. 12 in its debut on the list,
and was the only Arizona-based company to make a showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're certainly one of the best companies that we looked at
in terms of how little perks and little benefits'' add up, said
Robert Levering, workplace author and co-founder of the Great Place
to Work Institute, which produced the list in collaboration with
``Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Levering singled out the college tuition plan as among the most
unique and generous he's seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of too many other companies that do anything like
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most tuition programs cover a limited number of employees'
children, usually those at the top of the class. Under Finova's any
employee's child is eligible as long as they have the grades to get
into an accredited institution, whether its DeVry or Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely unusual,'' Levering said.
</P>
<P>
   Also unusual about Finova, Levering and his colleagues found:
the high regard employees have for Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Sam Eichenfield.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the research for the ``Fortune'' list is a random
employee survey, and Finova employees gave their boss top marks for
everything from leadership to personal birthday cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's spoken of very, very warmly by so many people,'' Levering
said. ``It's definitely one of the more notable things about the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the gushing about the CEO is not as extreme as at
Southwest Airlines, last year's top winner and No. 4 this year, but
``it's certainly right up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichenfield, a 62-year-old down-to-earth executive who joined
the company in 1987 when it was known as Greyhound Financial, was
pleased with the recognition by ``Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to me because we think the company has a role
in society and a role for its people and it's nice to see that you
can be successful in taking care of both of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finova decided to submit its name for consideration after it
looked at the benefits offered by last year's winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that we did most of things that they do and in many
cases I felt that we do more,'' said Bill Roche, senior vice
president of human resources. ``And, I know how our employees feel
about the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who works in Finova's portfolio policy and analysis
department and has been with the company for 11 years, said it's
the whole package, from the concierge service that got him tickets
to a sold out Celene Dion concert to the company's extensive ``Care
and Share'' charity program, of which he's on the board.
</P>
<P>
   He's worked at big-name compa nies such as IBM and Dun and
Bradstreet and says ``nothing compares to this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you send in your resume for a high-paying job at Finova _
the average salary in the Phoenix area is $57,000 plus a bonus of
$10,300, excluding excluding senior executives _ keep in mind that
the company doesn't have big hiring plans. While it's growing at a
good clip, much of the growth is from acquisitions or cross-selling
to existing customers. Also, turnover is a relatively modest 10
percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   Roche said Finova will probably hire just 30 to 40 people _
around the country _ in the first half of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business conditions could change that as well as an
acquisition, but otherwise we are fairly steady,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the word is already out about the company.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said every time there was a job opening in his former
department a few years ago ``we'd get like 80 to 100 resumes.''
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible for the ``Fortune'' ranking, a company had to be
at least 10 years old and have a minimum of 500 employees. The
magazine said 206 companies participated in the entire selection
process. Employees of the eligible companies had to complete the
survey, which were designed to evaluate trust in management, pride
in work and camaraderies, among other factors. The companies had to
submit company newsletters, employee handbooks and videos. &QL;

CLINTON FOCUSES ON JOB AS SENATE TRIAL LOOMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For President Clinton, Monday was a day to help the
poor, mourn the victims of terrorism, and play host to the
capital's hungry media.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a time to dwell on the fact that as of Saturday he
stands as only the second president in U.S. history to be impeached
by the House and now faces a Senate trial on charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The president left to others, including spokesman Joe Lockhart
and Vice President Al Gore, the task of blasting impeachment
advocates and fleshing out his strategy for dealing with the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers noted that his climbing approval ratings are
due to the view by the public that he continues to deal with their
problems and has not let the impeachment issue distract him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American public understands that this president has
remained focused on the job they sent him here to do and they
approve of the job he's done,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore that perception, the president and first lady
devoted the early afternoon to making lasagna for the homeless and
needy at a kitchen run by a nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few blocks from the Capital building where two days ago
House Republicans rammed through the impeachment vote, the first
couple donned aprons and ladled sauce over noodles.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the Senate could expect from his defense team
regarding impeachment, the president tersely replied, ``a few days
to celebrate the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he have a holiday message for Congress and the country? ``I
hope everyone in the country will take some time to think about
other people and do something in the spirit of the season like
this,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Clintons traveled to Arlington National Cemetery
where they helped lead the 10th anniversary memorial service for
the victims of Pan Am flight 103 that exploded over Lockerbie,
Scotland, as a result of a terrorist bomb.
</P>
<P>
   At the outdoor ceremony, which commenced at the exact moment
that the airplane exploded, bells tolled for two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the 270 victims were read by relatives. And Clinton
assured them that his administration was doing everything possible
to bring the perpetrators, believed to be sheltered by Libya, to
justice.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony the president and first lady laid a wreath at
the memorial cairn built in honor of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons then returned to the White House where preparations
were under way for the annual Christmas party for the hordes of
journalists, pundits and columnists who have relentlessly covered
the president's travails this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a large tent set up on the White House South Lawn, members of
the normally adversarial national press, dropped their professional
duties for a few hours to be the guests of the impeached president.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before Christmas, Clinton is expected to continue
his strategy of staying above the impeachment fray.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled Tuesday to do his annual Christmas reading to
children and Wednesday will visit Baltimore with Secretary of
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo to highlight housing issues.

EARLY BIRDS GET THE PASSPORTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Dec. 27. Do you know how old your passport is? Or where it
is? January, when business is slow at the passport office, is a
good time to renew if the passport expires anytime in 1999 and you
plan to travel outside the country. Many countries will not admit
travelers with passports that have less than six months' validity
left.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, mail is the way to go for renewal. It is fastest
at this time of year. The official estimate is that getting a
passport by mail takes 25 working days, starting from the time the
government receives the material until it is back in the
applicant's hands. A little time can be saved by enclosing a
request for an express return by mail, Federal Express or other
services, plus payment for the extra cost.
</P>
<P>
   But you might do even better right now. Do not dally until
March: the pace picks up radically and continues at fever pitch
until September.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year ended in October, 6.4 million passports were
issued; in 1995, the number was 5.3 million. There are 45 million
valid passports in the country now, a State Department spokeswoman
says, compared with 33 million in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   One more statistic. In 1995, more than two-thirds of passports
were issued to new applicants, a reversal of the situation the year
before. This trend is continuing: new applications _ many of them
from newly naturalized citizens eager to revisit the home country _
numbered 4.9 million, and renewal applications totaled 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   With the opening in 1992 of a huge passport factory in
Portsmouth, N.H., service by mail has been growing as passport
demand has expanded beyond the capacity of downtown offices. Vistas
of young people in sleeping bags outside passport offices are
becoming part of the banished folkways of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, the New York Passport Agency flabbergasted its
constituency by saying it would not start the passport process for
people who arrived on its doorstep unannounced. The agency had
already said it would serve those applying in person only if they
had air tickets for travel within 14 days. But in 1996, to cut the
jam-up further, it began to require phone appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The by-appointment, immediate-travelers-only system has been
adopted by three other agencies this year: Miami, Los Angeles and
most recently Washington (in November). The automated numbers for
appointments are: Miami, (305) 539-3600; Los Angeles, (310)
575-5700 and Washington, (202) 647-0518. The numbers work only with
touch-tone phones.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the other regional offices would eventually also refuse
to accept walk-ups, a spokeswoman for the State Department, Maria
Rudensky, said that the pressure was not equally great nationwide;
New Orleans and Seattle, for example, have lower demand. There are
also regional offices in Boston, Chicago, Honolulu, Houston,
Portsmouth (site of the mail-order fulfillment house),
Philadelphia, San Francisco and Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Passport Agency is now at 376 Hudson St. on the
corner of West Houston St. People with tickets for departures in
the next 14 days, or who are traveling soon but need some extra
time to get visas, can make appointments within the next 14
calendar days by calling (212) 206-3500. This line also provides
general information on getting a passport.
</P>
<P>
   A new adult passport costs $60. An adult renewal costs $40, but
people going to the appointment-only agencies for a new or renewed
passport will pay $35 more for the expedited service. Information
and forms to be printed out may be found on the Internet at
travel.state.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Applications may be mailed to the National Passport Center, Post
Office Box 371971, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15250. These are taken directly
to Portsmouth. Those sent to regional centers may be worked on
there or relayed to Portsmouth if the local offices are jammed up.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department last month began phasing in passports with
digitized pictures and other added security features. The old
requirements for the photos you must supply, two identical
photographs 2 by 2 inches (color or black and white), still apply,
despite the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman, James P. Rubin, the computer-generated
photograph of the bearer makes the passport much less vulnerable to
alteration by criminals. Rubin said 15,000 United States passports
were stolen abroad in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1999, all domestic passport agencies will be
equipped to issue these new versions, although replacements issued
by embassies or consulates overseas will continue to be the
old-fashioned kind. Because adults' passports are valid for 10
years, and may be renewed for two years after that, it will take 12
years before all passports issued in the United States will have
been created by the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   If the desired effect is achieved, passports should be less
attractive targets for thieves because their resale value will
decline. Until then, having a digitized passport provides no
particular benefit to the holder.
</P>
<P>
   The first machines to produce the new passports were installed
in Portsmouth, but not all the machines there have been replaced,
so there is no way to guess whether you will get a new model if you
mail your application this early.
</P>
<P>
   A reader, A. Lawrence Katzman of New York, wrote about an
experience he and his wife, Shirley, had with visas in Turkey that
may guide others traveling there. The Katzmans had visas put into
their passports at the consulate in New York in August for a cruise
they were taking from Istanbul later that month. They paid $45 each
for what proved to be single-entry visas, which were stamped on
their arrival in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned from the cruise, they were required to get
second visas, again paying $45 each. They then learned that for the
same $45 they could have bought multiple-entry visas good for three
months, all they needed. The Katzmans said they were not told this
initially, although a spokesman for the Turkish Mission to the
United Nations said they should have been.
</P>
<P>
   An information sheet provided by the Consulate General of
Turkey, 821 United Nations Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10017, says: ``If
you are going to Turkey on a cruise line and leaving with the same
cruise line (a) visa is not required.'' This, of course, applies
only to travelers who board a ship elsewhere and make Turkey a stop
on the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   As to the $45 fee, Penar Palti at the Consulate said it was
adopted in February, a rise from $20, after the United States
raised to $45 from $20 the fee for applying for a United States
visa. ``And if the United States raises its fee again, so will
we,'' Ms. Palti said.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of back-and-forth has been going on for a few years.
However, the United States fee covers only the application; there
is no guarantee a visa will be granted. If it is, no further
payment is needed; if not, the fee is forfeited. ``It's the cost
just to play the game,'' Ms. Rudensky said.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, Turkey is more liberal. It sells visas to
tourists at the port of entry for the same $45.

LAWYERS QUESTION FAIRNESS OF TEXAS' CLEMENCY PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Attorneys for two death row inmates, including a
Canadian whose case has attracted international attention, argued
before a federal judge Monday that Texas' clemency process is
unfair and shrouded in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers maintain that the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles
should be required to hold a public meeting on a condemned inmate's
clemency request and provide reasons for denying or granting it.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the 17 board members vote by fax or phone and don't
explain their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks stayed the
executions of Stanley Faulder, a Canadian citizen, and Danny Lee
Barber on grounds that Texas' clemency process should be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the evidence will show that Mr. Faulder did not
receive meaningful review by the board,'' attorney Sandra Babcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks adjourned Monday's hearing for a day to allow the
inmates' attorneys more time to review state documents before
closing arguments. He also hinted that attorneys for the state
might want to reconsider their decision not to call any witnesses
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surprising to me the state would rest without any
evidence,'' Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make a determination,'' he noted, adding he will
base his decision on the evidence presented, rather than on the
burden-of-proof theory in which the inmates' attorneys would bear
the greater responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's hearing, Victor Rodriguez, chairman of the
pardons and paroles panel, defended the clemency process, saying
board members take their job very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every piece of information that is sent to us is reviewed,''
Rodriguez said when one attorney asked if board members really have
enough time to properly handle clemency requests. ``We make time
for these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he did not believe board members ought to be
required to disclose publicly their reasons for denying or
recommending clemency for an inmate because of possible court
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe whatever reason we give, it would not be good
enough for the attorneys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In making a decision, board members review documents submitted
by the inmate. They also can launch an investigation, but Rodriguez
said members have not done so in recent years because they didn't
think it was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The board decides whether to recommend clemency to the governor.
Gov. George W. Bush can commute a death sentence to life in prison
only if the board recommends he do so.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1995, when Bush took office, the state has
executed 77 people. Only one person was spared: Henry Lee Lucas.
Bush said he accepted the board's recommendation to commute his
death sentence to life because there was doubt Lucas committed the
1979 slaying of a woman near Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder, 61, was convicted of killing an East Texas woman in
1975. His case has generated controversy in Canada, where there is
no death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Barber, 43, was sentenced to death for the beating death of a
woman more than 19 years ago in Balch Springs, a Dallas suburb.

THE MYSTIQUE OF THE MAYA WITH A SUBTLE DIFFERENCE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Italy _ Of the many empires and cultures that flourished
in pre-conquest Mesoamerica, the Maya have enjoyed the best press.
The European travelers who rediscovered their ruined cities
imagined them idealistically as a spiritual, artistic and pacific
people. They were, it was said, the Greeks to the Aztecs' Romans.
To this day, their majestic temples at Palenque, Uxmal, Chichen
Izta and Tikal are among the most admired pre-Columbian sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Maya,'' an exhibition at the Palazzo Grassi here through
May 16, confirms their privileged status. The gallery on the Grand
Canal previously has organized blockbusters on the Phoenicians, the
Celts and the Western Greeks. But this is the first time it has put
the spotlight on a non-European civilization, bringing together 600
objects and artifacts from 40 museums in Mexico, Central America,
the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this show different is that profiting from epigraphic
and archaeological breakthroughs of recent years, ``The Maya'' has
been able to go beyond stereotypical images of the people and their
art to show the workings of their society and religion in a more
complex and subtle light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we know much more about these peoples,'' Mercedes de la
Garza, a Mexican expert, writes in an introduction to the catalog.
``But this does not mean that we have the absolute truth and that
the 21st century will not reject many of our interpretations, just
as we have discarded those of the 18th and 19th centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   One fundamental reading of the Maya has not been challenged. It
is that they had a cosmic vision of life, one that conceived their
gods, nature and man as inseparable (with the first humans born of
the sacred corn). Thus, their entire existence was dictated by
religious beliefs, with their study of astronomy and mathematics,
their social and political organization, their artistic creation
and even their wars all a function of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Yet scholars believe they recently have learned much that is new
about each of these facets of Maya life. Turning their focus from
the gods toward the people, they have begun investigating everyday
life, settlement patterns, farming practices and relations between
different Maya city-states and between the sprawling Maya region
(covering today's southern and southeast Mexico, Belize, Guatemala
and part of Honduras and El Salvador) and other important ethnic
groups, notably the Olmecs and Toltecs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Palazzo Grassi has chosen not to present the
Maya chronologically through their three identifiable periods:
Pre-Classic (1800 B.C. to A.D. 250), Classic (A.D. 250 to 900) and
Post-Classic (A.D. 900 to 1524).
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is displayed through themes. First, in the
atrium, it presents monumental works too heavy to be shown
elsewhere. These include a large stele representing a ruling lord
from the Calakmul site in southeast Mexico and an ornate altar
portraying a feathered serpent from Copan in Honduras. More
familiar is Chichen Itza's ``Chac-mool,'' a stone figure in a
reclining position with a tray on its stomach for sacrificial
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition proper opens with the Maya and their relationship
to nature, with fish, animals and insects portrayed delightfully on
ceramic plates and in ceramic and stone sculptures, including one
of a turkey, which is native to the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The show then turns to the urban environment and social
organization of the Maya, illustrated with examples of temple
decoration, jade sculptures and jewelry found in tombs and stone
statues and painted ceramic vessels suggesting clothes and
ornaments worn by important local personalities. Some of the most
touching ceramic figures are the smallest among them one just seven
inches high showing what appears to be an orator in full voice.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasis is given to the section dealing with everyday life. The
story is told through ceramic and stone objects found at Maya
sites, but it dwells on hunting, fishing, cooking and weaving. A
stone metate, used to grind corn into dough in the late Classic
period, is similar to those used to prepare corn tortillas in
Mexico today.
</P>
<P>
   Where the exhibition sometimes falters is in linking the objects
on display with the Maya sites where they originated, making it
more difficult for visitors who have not traveled there to imagine
grandiose pyramid cities, often hidden by jungle. But some amends
have been made by a reconstruction of one of the rooms from the
Bonampak Maya site with frescoes of battle scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the show addresses spiritual aspects of the
Maya, although it is now thought that Maya lords also associated
themselves with the gods to enhance their earthly powers. The gods
themselves are portrayed in myriad forms, sometime as fertility
figures, other times as warriors, often as birds. The religious
ballgame called pelota, in which the ball, like the sun, was to be
kept in permanent motion, is illustrated by two figures from Jaina
Island showing players in action.
</P>
<P>
   The Palazzo Grassi has also benefited from progress made in
recent years in understanding both the glyphic writing and numbers
used by the Maya, and it offers a lesson in how they worked. The
Maya's grasp of mathematics and astronomy was noteworthy: they
invented the concept of zero a millennium before it was introduced
in Western civilization. Their numerous calendars included one of
365 days. They calculated that the Maya era began on August 11,
3114 B.C., and will end on Dec. 21, 2012.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Maya culture is no more likely to
disappear 14 years hence than it was after Hernan Cortes sent
Francisco de Montejo to the Yucatan in 1527 to complete the
conquest that he had begun in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan six
years earlier. Much of the area was subjugated by 1546, but one
mountain region to the south held out until 1697.
</P>
<P>
   There were sporadic Indian uprisings until, in 1847, a broad
Maya rebellion known as the Caste War erupted in the Yucatan. (The
besieged elite of Merida, the capital of the Yucatan, even offered
to become an American colony in exchange for protection against the
Maya.) The uprising was put down with huge loss of life, although
some Maya communities were not pacified until 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Maya culture survives through the languages, costumes, social
organization and religious practices of more than a score of ethnic
groups in Mexico's southernmost state of Chiapas and in Guatemala.
Perhaps the link between these peoples and the exhibition in Venice
may at times seem tenuous, yet the new rebellion launched by the
Zapatista National Liberation Front in Chiapas on Jan. 1, 1994,
would suggest that, 500 years after the Spanish Conquest, a Maya
identity remains intact.

HIGGINBOTHAM'S LEGACY TO THE AGES CITED AT FUNERAL RITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Civil rights legend Rosa Parks, a constellation of
legal luminaries, and hundreds whose lives he touched celebrated
the legacy of A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., saying the prominent
jurist's courageous voice will echo down the generations.
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham, a former chief justice of the US 3d Circuit Court
of Appeals and winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, died
last week after a series of strokes. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   But during services at Peoples Baptist Church in Roxbury which
were alternately poignant, inspirational, and hilarious,
Higginbotham's spirit danced before an overflow congregation that
included Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer and NAACP
President Kweisi Mfume.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us he was a Herculean giant, who marched for freedom and
equality with presidents and kings,'' said Stephanie
Franklin-Suber, Philadelphia's city solicitor and a former law
student of Higginbotham.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us he was a living legend, who traveled the corridors of
history in search of social justice and human rights,'' she said.
``To us he was a force of nature. . . . As is fitting, he finally
sits on the high court of history.''
</P>
<P>
   There were tributes read from President Clinton and South
African President Nelson Mandela. There were testimonials from
fellow judges and former students. And there was a reverential
silent standing salute to Parks, who walked slowly along the front
of the church just before the service began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really interested in people who needed help and needed
work,'' Parks, 85, said of Higginbotham after the memorial service.
``I think he really had a great idea that we are all equal
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks's refusal to give up her seat to a white passenger led to
a boycott of Montgomery buses in 1955 by the city's black residents
and, ultimately, the desegregation of public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   It was a turning point in the fight for civil rights _ a
movement to which Higginbotham, the son of a Trenton, N.J.,
domestic, would dedicate his career.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Brown III, who grew up with Higginbotham and later
practiced law with him, recalled that when his lifelong friend
enrolled at Purdue University, after graduating high school at age
16, he wanted to become an engineer. But like his childhood dream
to pursue a career in firefighting, Jim Crow stood in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no room at Purdue's inn for black students,'' said
Brown. ``Leon and his fellow black Purdue classmates were forced to
reside in an unheated attic in a house off of campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it was racism that prevented Leon from becoming a fire
commissioner and perhaps even the CEO of IBM. However, it is clear
that no matter what career path Leon traveled, he would eventually
rise to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``While he did not become a firefighter,'' said Brown, ``he
helped dampen the fires of discrimination. While he did not become
a civil engineer, he did become a social engineer through his
decisions as a trial judge.''
</P>
<P>
   When President Lyndon Johnson appointed him a federal district
court in 1964, Higginbotham, at 35, became the youngest appointee
to the federal bench in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham was a professor at Harvard University's John F.
Kennedy School of Government at the time of his death. And his
colleagues and law students talked of his relentless drive and his
ability to juggle many demanding jobs at once.
</P>
<P>
   In a written tribute from the White House, President Clinton
hailed Higginbotham's career and thanked him for his testimony
earlier this month before the Judiciary Committee in which the
former judge pronounced the president's actions, which Republicans
deemed perjury, not impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He backed up his heartfelt commitment with action,'' wrote
Clinton, who awarded Higginbotham the nation's highest civilian
honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, after his retirement from
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a brilliant mind and eloquent voice and a tenacious
spirit, he became a champion of civil rights and the rule of law.
As a lawyer, scholar and distinguished jurist Judge Higginbotham
strived throughout his career to ensure that America lives up to
its promise of justice for all.''
</P>
<P>
   In a postscript which read, ``I will never forget how he spoke
up for me,'' Clinton underlined the word ``never.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, in his written condolences to Higginbotham's family,
called the former judge ``a powerful voice of the voiceless, a
tireless defender of the oppressed and an unparalleled champion of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the memorial's emotional apex, Higginbotham's daughter, Dr.
Karen Higginbotham, a clinical psychologist, painted a loving
portrait of her father _ the man who took her to Washington to
listen to Martin Luther King's landmark ``I Have a Dream Speech''
and taught her to respect those on the lower rungs of life's
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   At the courthouses where he worked, she said, his children
learned the names of every security guard and every person in
housekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Then she told the story of a woman who approached her father one
night when he was dressed in black tie. Higginbotham was the
keynote speaker, but the woman mistook him for a waiter and ordered
a glass of whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned to the woman and said: `Is that on the rocks or with
water?' '' Karen Higginbotham said. ``And then he got her the drink
_ with a napkin.''
</P>
<P>
   When the woman, visibly embarrassed, later approached him, his
daughter recalled, Higginbotham answered with aplomb: ``I knew you
were thirsty. I knew you just wanted a drink.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Joseph Rice, a plaintiffs' lawyer here who
negotiated the recent $206 billion tobacco settlement, was feted by
state attorneys general at a hotel dinner this month in Coral
Gables, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of their efforts, Rice and two other lawyers _
his partner, Ronald Motley, and Richard Scruggs, from Pascagoula,
Miss. _ received rather unusual mementoes: wood-lined cigar boxes.
But a few hours earlier, they had been pondering far weightier
matters. The three men had met on Scruggs' yacht, anchored in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., to discuss how to divide an unparalleled windfall
in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   In coming years, dozens of plaintiffs' lawyers nationwide, all
hired to represent states in claims to recover health care costs
from cigarette makers, will become multimillionaires. And by all
accounts, Rice and his firm _ Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson &AMP;
Poole _ will be the biggest winners of all. Out of a total pie
estimated at anywhere from $10 billion to $30 billion, the firm is
guaranteed $1 billion _ just for starters. Rice's cut will easily
be in the tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is already set to get a share of the money paid to
lawyers for nine of the 12 states that recently resolved fee claims
through arbitration or negotiation, including the $8.2 billion that
went on Dec. 11 to lawyers who represented Florida, Texas and
Mississippi. From those three states alone, Rice and his firm will
collect about $1 billion in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just a down payment. The firm also worked for 23
other states, including giants like New York, whose settlement is
worth $25 billion over 25 years. Rice estimates that his firm,
depending on which state is involved, will get from 3 percent to 50
percent of the total legal fees in each state it represented.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, a tall, slightly paunchy 44-year-old, said it is a payday
well earned. His firm, he said, invested thousands of hours and
spent $20 million to $30 million to sue tobacco companies on behalf
of states, a gamble that looked shaky when the state lawsuits
started in 1994. And he said he was convinced that the deal would
save lives and that the lawyers involved should get paid as well as
the tobacco executives are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the lawyers who carried the burden and led the
fight not be paid like a chief executive officer of a
corporation?'' Rice asked.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy employed by Rice's firm may qualify it as one of
the business world's most successful franchise operations. After
getting a toehold in the first state tobacco lawsuit, filed in 1994
by Mississippi, Rice and other Ness, Motley lawyers fanned out
around the country offering regulators in state after state
essentially a package deal that could be used in pursuing cigarette
makers.
</P>
<P>
   Included were thousands of coded and computerized tobacco
industry documents, testimony from dozens of expert witnesses,
legions of lawyers and battalions of researchers. In return, state
officials signed contracts guaranteeing Ness, Motley and affiliated
firms 15 percent to 25 percent of any recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Ness, Motley also activated a network of law firms nationwide
with which it had existing ties. It advanced those lawyers millions
of dollars to pay costs ranging from salaries to new desks to
computer equipment. And when Christine Gregoire, the attorney
general for the state of Washington, ran low on money, Rice says
his firm also kicked in, advancing that state $150,000 a month to
finance its lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Rice played a central role in negotiating the $368.5
billion tobacco settlement plan that collapsed in Congress this
spring. But by then, a new round of secret talks had begun, and
Rice became the chief negotiator in the talks that led to the
latest deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe clearly sat in the No. 1 seat in the state settlement,''
said Phil Carlton, a lawyer who served as one of the tobacco
industry's principal lobbyists and negotiators. ``You get yourself
in a real good bargaining position when you can deliver 20
settlements instead of one.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a custom-made role for Rice. Unlike the free-wheeling
Scruggs, who joined Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore in
filing the first state action, Rice prefers operating behind closed
doors. And when tobacco lawyers insisted that Scruggs not be told
about the new talks because they feared he would disclose them to
the media, Rice obliged, even though Scruggs represented many of
the same states that Ness, Motley did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told that if Dickie were here, people were going to read
about them,'' said Rice, referring to Scruggs.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said his relationship with Scruggs was ruptured for a time.
But all those involved in the tobacco talks _ state officials,
industry lawyers and anti-smoking advocates _ agreed that Rice was
a tough, tenacious negotiator who pressed to get the best deal he
could for state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Myers, a lawyer with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids
in Washington, said he disagreed at times with Rice because Rice
refused to simply walk away from talks when cigarette makers would
not budge. But he was impressed by Rice's determination and
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He squeezed out every possible cent,'' Myers said. ``He
wouldn't give up just because he failed in a single approach.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Rice got along well with outside negotiators hired
by cigarette makers like Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds because
he, like those lawyers, was focused on forging a deal, rather than
going to court. One industry lawyer, Meyer Koplow of New York, had
previously worked with Rice to settle thousands of asbestos claims
brought by Ness, Motley.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's style, however, might not fit that well in corporate
suites. His office, in a six-story building in Charleston's
historic downtown district, is decorated with a statue of a bucking
bronco, pictures of horses and other mementoes of a ``Texas
wannabe,'' which Rice happily admits that he is. He owns a large
weekend home on the nearby Intracoastal Waterway, where he keeps 20
horses, and his idea of a good time is to go riding with his wife
and 14-year-old daughter or to go on cattle drives.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's firm had used the same type of legal roundup that it did
in the tobacco cases in suing asbestos producers, which is where it
made its reputation and its wealth. In those cases, as with
tobacco, its efforts to control litigation by dominating as many
cases as possible also led critics to charge it with conflicts of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   While the firm has profited from asbestos litigation for more
than a decade, last year the Supreme Court threw out one landmark
case, a $1.3 billion class-action settlement between asbestos
producers and plaintiffs' lawyers, including Rice, that not only
settled claims by existing asbestos victims but restricted the
legal options of people who might be sickened by asbestos in the
future. Opponents of the deal charged that lawyers like Rice
effectively sold out the legal rights of future victims so they
could reap hundreds of millions in fees by settling their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought what they were doing was unethical and illegal,''
said Brian Wolfman, a lawyer with Public Citizen, an advocacy group
in Washington that opposed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ness, Motley rejected any suggestion of conflict.
But at one point in the tobacco cases, the firm represented both
states and smokers in separate lawsuits, a problematic position
because the groups might have vied for settlement funds. It
withdrew from cases brought by smokers, but it now finds itself in
a similar position after signing up to represent New York state,
New York City and Erie County because state and local officials are
fighting for their share of New York's payout.
</P>
<P>
   A part of that fight will also involve lawyers' fees going to
Ness, Motley, said one lawyer involved in the New York case who
insisted on anonymity. And Rice also has some unfinished business
with Scruggs, the Mississippi lawyer. When Ness, Motley and
Scruggs' firm, Scruggs, Millette, Lawson, Bozeman &AMP; Dent, joined
forces on state tobacco cases, they had no written agreement on how
to split up fees.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said no decision had been made, but that Ness, Motley had
far more lawyers working on the tobacco cases than Scruggs' firm
did. And Rice said his firm had additional fee-sharing agreements
with other law firms involved in state tobacco cases to be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   While the tobacco industry is limiting its payouts through
arbitration to plaintiffs' lawyers to $500 million annually, some
$94 million of that first installment is likely to go to Ness,
Motley this year. Producers will continue to pay lawyers until all
the claims are resolved, so Rice's firm will be getting similar
paychecks for decades.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Rice, who recently bought a $1.5 million yacht, says he
does not have any immediate plans for his cut. Nor does he intend
to stop working, though an end to round-the-clock junk-food-filled
negotiations with tobacco industry lawyers has let him trim eight
pounds from his waistline.
</P>
<P>
   As he strolled around his office, he pointed out a newspaper
cartoon that a colleague had taped to his office. It shows a group
of fat lawyers with lighted cigars and raised glasses holding
bulging sacks of cash representing the take in Florida, Mississippi
and Texas. The caption of the cartoon, which ran in The Florida
Times-Union of Jacksonville, reads: ``To The Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's a lot of money,'' Rice said. ``But nobody gave us a
chance in hell when we started out.''

SENATORS DISCUSS CENSURE AS ALTERNATIVE PUNISHMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican and Democratic senators indicated Monday
that some form of censure could be considered as an alternative
punishment for President Clinton when they take up the articles of
impeachment against him early next month.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and television appearances, most seemed to be open
to the idea of a bipartisan compromise like censure to avoid the
removal of the president from office or the possibility that he
could get off without any punishment for his conduct in the Monica
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, at some point, censure certainly is going to be one
of the options,'' Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, told Cable
News Network.
</P>
<P>
   But she warned the White House, as did several Democratic
senators, not to play politics with the issue and to tone down the
rhetoric aimed at averting a trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sentiment I'm hearing (from colleagues) is that we
need to start the process of a trial. What happens after that
starts opens a lot of doors and a lot of options,'' Hutchison said.
``All of us want to have a strong bipartisan solution that people
can rally around.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said there must be no ``deal''
between the White House and the Senate. He said a negotiated
settlement would undermine the seriousness of the historic task the
Senate is expected to take up almost immediately after it convenes
Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders hope that impeachment proceedings can be wrapped
up by Jan. 19, when Clinton is scheduled to deliver his State of
the Union address. But they caution a Senate trial could drag on
for months.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said he is open to a bipartisan solution as long as it is
worked out among senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether there is a trial or whether there is some other
solution, that decision must be made by senators, and it must be
bipartisan or it will have absolutely no credibility with the
public,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   The senators' comments came after former Presidents Carter and
Ford proposed Monday that the Senate adopt a bipartisan resolution
declaring that Clinton lied under oath rather than drag the country
through what could be a lengthy and sordid public trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow we must reach a conclusion that most Americans can
embrace and that posterity will approve,'' Democrat Carter and
Republican Ford wrote in an opinion piece published in The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake, the judgment of history does matter. It
matters profoundly,'' the two continued, adding that the
``impeachment by the full House has already brought profound
disgrace'' on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter-Ford proposal would require Clinton to admit that he
lied under oath, something that he has not been willing to do for
fear he might be indicted on perjury charges when he leaves office
by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. The Carter-Ford proposal,
however, would prevent Clinton's admission from being used against
him in a future trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., said the proposal was worth
examining. But he raised concerns that it could be viewed as ``a
pardon'' along the lines of the one Ford gave Nixon in Watergate
and the amnesty Carter granted to those who sought to avoid the
Vietnam draft.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials stopped short Monday of endorsing the
Carter-Ford suggestion. But Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said the
president was willing to look at any ``reasonable ideas'' that
would bring the ordeal to a swift conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said he hopes the Senate will ``forge a
fair, bipartisan compromise to end this matter promptly _ and to
end it in a way that will respect the will and the wisdom of the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued to insist that Saturday's vote on impeachment in
the House ``was wrong ... for our Constitution and wrong for
America.'' He said he hopes the Senate will ``rise to the moment''
and ``be the voice of reason, deliberation and healing that America
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president's lawyers will continue to prepare
``a whole series of legal and constitutional'' arguments against
impeachment in the event there is a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's view is that we need to work hard to find a
bipartisan solution to put this behind us,'' Lockhart said. ``But I
think the president's lawyers, as is their obligation, will prepare
an effective and persuasive defense if it does move to a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats warned the White House to back off any legal
challenge that might question whether the Senate has the right to
begin a trial based on impeachment articles drawn up by the
current, lame-duck 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., suggested that such actions could
backfire by eroding support for Clinton in the Senate and also with
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anything that is seen as parliamentary maneuvering to
get out of this is not going to be accepted by the American
public,'' Breaux told CNN. ``It's going to have to be out front. It
is going to have to be fair. I think if we try and solve this on
parliamentary maneuvering, it is going to be a serious mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., called for a ``a cooling off period''
over the holidays to give parties on both sides of the issue time
to reflect on what could lie ahead as the Senate prepares to take
up the two articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have the ball, I think it's up to us to handle it
coolly, objectively and with dignity,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   He called on the White House and the public ``to let us do our
jobs'' without the influence of public opinion polls, the latest of
which shows Clinton's job approval rate rising to a record 73
percent in the aftermath of his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Several polls also indicate that two-thirds of the American
people favor a compromise rather than Clinton's removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be hard to avoid the beginning of a trial, some
senators who do not like the idea of removing a popularly elected
president from office hope to force a vote to dismiss the case. If
that vote fails, they'll move to censure Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those ... fail, then, presumably, we would move on to a
trial,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. If it goes to trial, it
would take a two-thirds vote by the Senate to convict.
</P>
<P>
   About the only option not being considered as a way out of the
impeachment quagmire is resignation, even though some former
Clinton aides have suggested that his conduct has left him unfit to
govern.
</P>
<P>
   Former Press Secretary Mike McCurry has told the British
Broadcasting Co. he has ``enormous doubts because of the
recklessness of his (Clinton's) behavior. The nature of this
particular affair, and then the way he did conceal it, really does
raise some very profound, troubling matters.''

SENATORS DISCUSS CENSURE AS ALTERNATIVE PUNISHMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican and Democratic senators indicated Monday
that some form of censure could be considered as an alternative
punishment for President Clinton when they take up the articles of
impeachment against him early next month.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and television appearances, most seemed to be open
to the idea of a bipartisan compromise like censure to avoid the
removal of the president from office or the possibility that he
could get off without any punishment for his conduct in the Monica
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, at some point, censure certainly is going to be one
of the options,'' Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, told Cable
News Network.
</P>
<P>
   But she warned the White House, as did several Democratic
senators, not to play politics with the issue and to tone down the
rhetoric aimed at averting a trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sentiment I'm hearing (from colleagues) is that we
need to start the process of a trial. What happens after that
starts opens a lot of doors and a lot of options,'' Hutchison said.
``All of us want to have a strong bipartisan solution that people
can rally around.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said there must be no ``deal''
between the White House and the Senate. He said a negotiated
settlement would undermine the seriousness of the historic task the
Senate is expected to take up almost immediately after it convenes
Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders hope that impeachment proceedings can be wrapped
up by Jan. 19, when Clinton is scheduled to deliver his State of
the Union address. But they caution a Senate trial could drag on
for months.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said he is open to a bipartisan solution as long as it is
worked out among senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether there is a trial or whether there is some other
solution, that decision must be made by senators, and it must be
bipartisan or it will have absolutely no credibility with the
public,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   The senators' comments came after former Presidents Carter and
Ford proposed Monday that the Senate adopt a bipartisan resolution
declaring that Clinton lied under oath rather than drag the country
through what could be a lengthy and sordid public trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow we must reach a conclusion that most Americans can
embrace and that posterity will approve,'' Democrat Carter and
Republican Ford wrote in an opinion piece published in The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake, the judgment of history does matter. It
matters profoundly,'' the two continued, adding that the
``impeachment by the full House has already brought profound
disgrace'' on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter-Ford proposal would require Clinton to admit that he
lied under oath, something that he has not been willing to do for
fear he might be indicted on perjury charges when he leaves office
by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. The Carter-Ford proposal,
however, would prevent Clinton's admission from being used against
him in a future trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., said the proposal was worth
examining. But he raised concerns that it could be viewed as ``a
pardon'' along the lines of the one Ford gave Nixon in Watergate
and the amnesty Carter granted to those who sought to avoid the
Vietnam draft.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials stopped short Monday of endorsing the
Carter-Ford suggestion. But Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said the
president was willing to look at any ``reasonable ideas'' that
would bring the ordeal to a swift conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said he hopes the Senate will ``forge a
fair, bipartisan compromise to end this matter promptly _ and to
end it in a way that will respect the will and the wisdom of the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued to insist that Saturday's vote on impeachment in
the House ``was wrong ... for our Constitution and wrong for
America.'' He said he hopes the Senate will ``rise to the moment''
and ``be the voice of reason, deliberation and healing that America

 &HT;    HEALTH: Low-weight multiple-birth babies often must put up fight
to survive
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Chukwu octuplets face a fierce fight for their
lives in the next weeks _ and probably other challenges in the
years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple births are notoriously risky because the babies tend to
be significantly lower in weight and underdeveloped at birth. The
smaller they are and the more prematurely they are born, the more
medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Those surviving infancy may suffer health problems ranging from
learning disabilities to cerebral palsy because of neurological
damage. Such damage is caused by bleeding in the brain or the
inability of the babies' underdeveloped lungs to deliver sufficient
oxygen to their brains.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are drugs you can give for these premature babies to
reduce the respiratory distress syndrome, to mature their lungs,''
said Dr. Joe Massey of Reproductive Biology Associates of Atlanta,
the state's largest infertility clinic. ``But it can only be
incompletely effective at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Massey predicts problems are more likely with the Chukwu
octuplets than with the McCaughey septuplets, born 13 months ago to
Bobbi McCaughey of Iowa. The McCaughey babies, born in the 30th
week of gestation, were all at least 2 pounds at birth. The normal
gestation period is 40 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Chukwu babies are much smaller. One girl was
born Dec. 8 at 28 weeks, followed Sunday by the remaining seven at
30 weeks. The largest weighed 1 pound, 10 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   In multiple pregnancies, each baby has at least a 10 percent
risk of experiencing neurological handicaps, Massey said, compared
to 1 percent or less for a single baby born at 40 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Multiples are also much more likely than ``singletons,'' or
single babies, to die in infancy. In 1995, multiple babies
comprised less than 3 percent of all U.S. births, but 16 percent of
neonatal deaths, according to the National Center for Health
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the McCaugheys' success has encouraged some mothers
to be more confident about multiple pregnancies, Massey said.
</P>
<P>
   Reproductive Biology patients deliver twins at least monthly and
triplets five to 10 times a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there still are occasional losses of triplets,'' Massey
added, pointing out that Nkem Chukwu, who conceived via fertility
drugs, miscarried triplets earlier this year. ``Those are very sad
stories. People who have triplets or quadruplets and lose them at
five months, you don't hear about.''
</P>
<P>
   Reduction, selectively aborting some fetuses, is an option for
multiple pregnancies. But Reproductive Biology doctors don't advise
patients one way or the other, only warn them of the risks and
discuss reduction as one option.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Reduction) doesn't clearly prolong the pregnancy as well as
we thought it would, but the babies are a little bigger,'' Massey
said. ``It probably reduces the risk. It's the worst decision our
patients ever have to face.''

 &HT;    Reeves might miss playoff
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves, who had heart bypass
surgery eight days ago, will not help prepare for this Sunday's
final regular-season game against Miami and could miss the team's
first playoff game on Jan. 9 or 10.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, 54, was re-admitted to Piedmont Hospital on Sunday
afternoon after experiencing an accelerated heart rate a few hours
before the Falcons' game at Detroit. Atlanta defeated the Lions
24-17 to clinch the NFC West title and earn a bye through the first
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' condition is stable, but he will stay at Piedmont at
least until Wednesday. Doctors and team officials said he was not
getting enough rest at his Buckhead home after being discharged
last Friday, four days after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after his hospital release, Reeves and his
doctors predicted a part-time role for him this week and a full
return for the playoffs. Instead, he's in a private room where even
visits by family members are limited.
</P>
<P>
   He will not speak by phone with his assistants this week,
including Rich Brooks, the assistant head coach and defensive
coordinator serving as interim coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He overdid it,'' Brooks said about Reeves, who apparently
fielded too many phone calls, took too many visitors and wore
himself out with a Saturday morning trip to team headquarters to
address the team. ``He is not to be in contact with us at all this
week _ doctor's orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will have no involvement in the upcoming game. We don't
know what the return schedule will be. The doctors will determine
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Reeves miss the first playoff game? ``It's conceivable,
yes,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Kauten, the heart surgeon who operated on Reeves,
would not comment specifically about Reeves but said an irregular
heart rhythm is common among bypass patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, it will occur post-op between 10 and 30 percent of
the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the irregularity is unknown, but doctors think it
probably is a combination of patients being on a heart-lung machine
during surgery and post-operative dehydration. It can be resolved
with medicine given for two or three months after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons team internist Dr. Charlie Harrison, who was talkative
last week, issued only a brief statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not feeling well and felt that something was, 'Not
right.' We decided to bring him back into the hospital in order to
run some tests and adjust his medication,'' the statement said.
``He remains in . . . good spirits and thrilled about his
championship team.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who had angioplasty procedures to clear heart blockages
in August 1990 and January 1991, began experiencing similar
symptoms after a 27-17 victory at New Orleans on Dec. 13. He
mentioned them to Harrison. The next morning, after an angiogram at
Piedmont, he was in surgery within a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves had four bypasses to circumvent blockages in three heart
arteries. He was walking and talking the next day and held an
emotional news conference after his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he really needs is rest, and what he didn't get last week
was rest,'' said Brooks, who is getting his information from team
physician Andrew Bishop. ``That's part our fault, part (the
media's) fault and part his fault. Dan needs to take care of
himself right now, and we need to take care of the football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor is going to make sure he doesn't overdo it again,
and if that means missing the first playoff game, he'll miss the
first playoff game. It's obviously a hell of a lot more important
that he regain his health and get strong than a football game.''

IRAQIS COUNT DEAD, SCOFF AT BOMBINGS' EFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD _ Iraqi officials say US and British air raids had
killed 62 soldiers, and had wounded 180.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also asserted Monday that civilian casualties were
``much, much higher,'' but they refused to offer details on that
death toll, which the Iraqi United Nations ambassador, Nizar
Hamdoon, had said on Sunday was in the ``thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   The official Iraqi military casualty count is impossible for a
tightly controlled press corps to confirm here.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Iraqi Health Ministry had said that 42
civilians had been killed in the attacks, and about 100 were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi leaders also acknowledged that the four days of
sustained missile attacks, which ended Saturday, had demolished
missile factories and had severed telephone communication between
the north and south of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But they scoffed at the notion that splitting the predominantly
Sunni Muslim northern part of the country and the Shiite Muslim
south would lead to a revolt against Saddam Hussein. They dismissed
the idea as an American ``Rambo-like fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz added that the United States
and Britain had failed to harm seriously the Iraqi government or
military. ``They boasted of great success,'' he said. ``They
lied.''
</P>
<P>
   General Anthony Zinni of the Marine Corps said in Washington on
Monday that the strikes had hit 85 percent of their targets, 74
percent of them successfully. He said that damage assessment from
cruise missile and bombing attacks probably will take a few more
days.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq says the missiles also targeted civilians in colleges, post
offices, dormitories, a museum and an oil refinery. ``This is a
policy of hatred,'' Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi authorities have refused foreign journalists access to
sites where they say significant civilian casualties were recorded.
</P>
<P>
   But Aziz offered a complete breakdown of the military
casualties. He said the elite Republican Guard, a primary target of
the attacks, especially in the south, had lost 20 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen soldiers of the Special Republican Guard, whose duties
Aziz refused to describe, and 24 soldiers in other branches of the
military, were also killed, and 180 soldiers were wounded. But most
of the strikes hit empty barracks, Aziz said, adding, ``These
barracks could be and will be rebuilt.'
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Aziz directly addressed what some analysts
see as a US strategy to divide the north and the south to
destabilize Hussein's regime. ``They thought foolishly that the
people of Iraq will uprise. This is a fantasy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Shiites in the south rose in rebellion after the Gulf War of
1991. That uprising was crushed by troops loyal to Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Western observers in Baghdad say, the regime appears to be
showing some concern about a possible rebellion, and thus has taken
steps to tighten its grip on the military.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein divided Iraq into four military districts Wednesday
after the US and British air raids began. The observers say that he
appointed loyal military commanders to direct the regional
quadrants to thwart possible civilian uprisings.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi opposition groups in London and Cairo say that Hussein's
cousin, former Defense Minister Ali Hasan Al-Majid, was named the
commander in the sensitive southern region. The opposition claims
that Al-Majid ordered the executions of several officers in the
south immediately after he took control.
</P>
<P>
   The Western observers also offered an explanation why the Iraqi
military offered so little resistance during the fighting. They
surmised that Iraq withheld its surface-to-air missiles, which
could have been used to defend against the attacks, to avoid
targeting by allied forces.

   HOUSTON _ The two sons and six daughters of Nkem Chukwu remained
in critical condition at Texas Children's Hospital Monday, sedated,
incubated and all eight of them together weighing just a breath
over 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   While news of the birth of the Chukwu octuplets _ which the
family had tried to keep private but which had leaked out to
Houston media outlets on Sunday _ had drawn dozens of reporters and
television crews to the hospital and was being greeted by many
Monday as a cause for celebration, it was raising deep concern
among leading reproductive specialists around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should not be a cause for celebration,'' said Dr. Mark
Perloe, director of reproductive endocrinology at the Atlanta
Reproductive Health Center. ``The cost of caring for these babies
and the pregnancy will run into the millions of dollars. The risk
of death still exists. And there is a significant risk that they
will have lifelong health problems. I think this is a wake-up call
for the medical profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Increases in the use of the same kinds of fertility drugs that
had been given to Ms. Chukwu have caused a surge of multiple births
in the last decade, specialists said. ``If you look at the
statistics, you see that there is a growing increase in the number
of multiple gestations,'' said Dr. Benjamin Younger, executive
director of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, based
in Birmingham, Ala. ``Some of it is due to in-vitro fertilization,
some is due to an expanded use of the medications but some of it is
just because we are seeing the results of the baby boomers who
delayed in having their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a situation has led many aging and childless couples to
demand the types of aggressive fertility therapies more likely to
produce multiple births.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish this couple well and I hope the babies do well, but
this scares me,'' said Dr. Alan Copperman, director of reproductive
endocrinology at Mt. Sinai-NYU Medical Center and Health System in
New York. ``It seems there is almost an acceptance these days of
quads or quints or even more, and the outrage gets less and less as
we hear about more and more of these cases. The fact is that the
vast majority of these cases end in disaster, sometimes for the
mom, most often for the babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Chukwu babies are the only known living octuplets in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a successful octuplet pregnancy in the
history of mankind,'' said Dr. Mark Evans, chairman of the
department of obstetrics and gynecology at Wayne State University
in Detroit. ``Although these babies were born alive, the odds are,
unfortunately, that there will not be happy outcomes for at least
several of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, nine infants were born to a mother in Sydney,
Australia, but all subsequently died. And there have been three
other cases of octuplet births in the last 13 years, one in Spain,
one in Britain and one in Turkey, but in each case at least some of
the infants soon died.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a case comes along like that of Ms. Chukwu _ or Bobbi
McCaughey, who gave birth to seven babies in November 1997 in
Carlisle, Iowa, all of whom still survive _ some desperate couples
become more willing to take greater risks, Copperman said. ``It's
almost like an arms race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chukwu children all maintained a fragile hold on life
Monday, doctors said, and the next three days will be the most
critical, as it becomes clear whether the infants' lungs, hearts,
brains and internal organs are developed enough to keep them alive.
Even after that, doctors said, dangers remain from infections or
metabolic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chukwu, 27, was born in Nigeria but is now an American
citizen living in the Houston area. The hospital declined to
release any personal information about the couple, at their
request, though The Houston Chronicle identified her husband, Iyke,
as a respiratory therapist.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had been trying to conceive for several years and Ms.
Chukwu had lost triplets earlier this year, doctors said, so she
entered her most recent pregnancy with a solemn determination. At a
news conference at the hospital on Sunday, Dr. Patti Savrick
described the new mother as unusually tall and ``very serene, a
very spiritual woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The fertility drugs Ms. Chukwu was receiving, hospitals
officials said, were pure FSH, which stimulates ovulation, and HCG,
or human chorionic gonadatropin, which is normally produced by a
healthy placenta to maintain pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chukwu was admitted to St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in
early October as she and doctors struggled to forestall the birth
of the fetuses until they were old enough to survive. She gave
birth to her first daughter on Dec. 8, 15 weeks premature, but
doctors were able to delay the other births until Sunday morning.
It was not until after the first birth that a sonogram revealed
there were seven more living fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chukwu remained confined to her hospital bed for the two
weeks following her initial delivery with her pelvis raised above
her head, to remove pressure on her cervix, and was administered a
trio of drugs (magnesium sulfate, terbutaline and indomethicin) to
delay the birth of the remaining fetuses, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining seven children were born during a 45-minute
Caesarian section at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital early Sunday and
ferried to the adjacent Texas Children's Hospital by a team of more
than two dozen doctors. The family immediately asserted its
privacy, refusing to give interviews, to appoint a family spokesman
or to allow photos of the tiny infants, forcing journalists to set
up camp outside the hospital, which by Monday was giving no more
press briefings and simply releasing updates every six hours on its
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   The premature Chukwu children remained unnamed Monday at Texas
Children's Hospital, where they were being referred to as babies
A-through-H. The largest of them was 26 ounces, the smallest 10.3
ounces. Exact measurements were unavailable.

<P>
   ``The smallest one, Baby E, is small enough to fit in a woman's
hand, as small as a beanie baby,'' said Laura Floyd, a hospital
spokeswoman. All of the babies were in incubators and under
sedation, and seven remained attached to ventilators to aid their
underdeveloped lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, their mother had to undergo further surgery Monday
morning to correct internal bleeding, which doctors described as a
``generalized ooze'' in her abdomen. ``It was something not
anticipated,'' said Dr. Brian Kirshon, a specialist in high-risk
births who delivered the Chukwu children.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said they expected Ms. Chukwu to be well enough to go
home in about a week, though the infants, if they survive, would
likely remain hospitalized for many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kirshon and other members of the medical team involved in the
Chukwu births told reporters on Sunday that, of course, bearing
octuplets was not the desired result of fertility treatments. ``The
human being was meant to have one baby,'' Kirshon said. It had
happened, in this case, both because the fertility drugs which had
made Ms. Chukwu's pregnancy possible had also led to the
fertilization of so many eggs and because the family, when given
the option early in her pregnancy to stop the growth of some of the
fertilized embryos, a procedure called selective or multi-fetal
reduction, had declined to allow it.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is highly controversial and some patients and
doctors consider it unethical, a form of early abortion. Proponents
argue that, while it is not the ideal outcome, the procedure does
provide a potentially better chance for the remaining embryos to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``With every single patient that undergoes treatment with these
fertility drugs I discuss the dangers and I discuss multi-fetal
reduction,'' Copperman said. ``If they say yes, they will allow
reduction, it perhaps allows you a little more leeway to give
fertility drugs. With others, say they can't emotionally or
religiously or ethically tolerate the procedure, you have to be
more careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Such issues only come into play in procedures involving these
fertility drugs, doctors say. In those cases where in-vitro
fertilization is used, under 10 percent of all cases, the number of
eggs implanted into the mother can be controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``With in-vitro, you have a tremendous amount of control, but
with these fertility drugs, when you don't use in-vitro, you can
cause the woman to make a lot of eggs and you don't have quite as
much control,'' Copperman said.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes, in some extreme cases, a bit of a guessing game, and
not all doctors administering the fertility drugs have as much
training as they might need, said Perloe. ``There are no
restrictions on who can use these drugs. A gynecologist with four
weeks training during his residency has just as much access as
someone who has done a fellowship and trained two to three years,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, Younger said, is that prospective parents
sometimes must pay for their own fertility procedures when medical
insurers decline to cover them. ``And since they're paying for it,
and it is very costly, they often demand the most aggressive form
of therapy and they get into a situation of unnecessary risk
taking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Younger said, the federal government has
steadfastly refused to allocate money for reproductive research,
largely because ``the issue inevitably always becomes entwined with
the abortion debate.'' Conservatives in Congress have expressed
concerns over research involving the use of human embryos, Younger
said, choking off funding both for that kind of research and for
other fertility research, even if it doesn't involve the use of
embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The end result, he said, is that during the same years when the
use of such fertility drugs was going up and the demand was
increasing from aging, childless couples, very little research was
being done in the United States on the proper use of the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd been doing the research, we might have looked to
develop some protocols on how to best use these drugs, protocols
that would have lessened the likelihood of something like this
happening,'' Younger said. ``The dearth of research has left a
great void in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   On the brighter side, doctors in the field have become much more
scrupulous about warning patients of the dangers involved, he said.
The problem is that the patients, desperate to get pregnant, don't
always listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients develop what we call selective hearing,'' Younger
said. ``They just filter the warnings down to a lower level and
concentrate on the part about getting pregnant.''

 &HT;    Respite is in order for Reeves
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mostly, Monday's injury report for the Falcons was
unremarkable, encouraging. With one large exception:
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves _ out (strained patience).
</P>
<P>
   Rich Brooks, the undefeated interim head coach of the Falcons,
is no doctor, but his diagnosis of the reversal that landed Reeves
back in the hospital Sunday afternoon was expert enough for our
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much, too soon,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't you see it coming? Wasn't it obvious with his teary
news conference Friday _ just four days after heart bypass surgery
_ and his insistence upon visiting the team at Suwanee on Saturday
before it left for Detroit that Reeves was pushing it? His mind was
making too many promises that his body couldn't fill.
</P>
<P>
   The coach needed one more lesson on being a good patient, and it
came in the form of a racing heartbeat before the Falcons had taken
the field in Detroit. His body was calling for a time-out; and you
only get a limited amount in this life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You worry about (Reeves rushing back),'' team president Taylor
Smith said. ``It's almost was like he felt he was letting everybody
down. I think he needs to be relieved of that pressure for a while,
(to) get well. And he will.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment, they say, is to get as far away from professional
football as possible. May we suggest a week in Charlotte?
</P>
<P>
   Failing that, Reeves will be cloistered away from the team, its
fans and the media, just as the celebration over the NFC West title
begins to peak. He is in strict medical exile, which seems to make
a lot more sense than the original plan to jump back into the fray.
One prognosis had him being able to help game-plan for the Dolphins
this Sunday, which always did seem more hopeful fantasy than
medical possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know his return schedule,'' Brooks says now.
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as it is to say, the Falcons might as well proceed
from here under the assumption that Reeves is lost for the season.
The realistic approach is to press on into the playoffs, without
expectation that their coach will show them the way.
</P>
<P>
   We all tried to fool ourselves that he would be able to shake it
off and be fit for the Falcons most promising postseason run in 18
years. More than anyone, Reeves is the man who rightfully should be
leading this parade. But that doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Players miss seasons to breaks and tears. Good heavens, a week
ago the coach had his chest cracked like a walnut while surgeons
constructed a little I-285 around his heart. Yes, he can get a
written doctor's excuse to sit down during the playoffs, maybe
watch them from a booth.
</P>
<P>
   How hard will it be to rein in Reeves now that the reality of
his situation is more plain? ``For a little while, not too hard,''
Brooks said. ``As he starts feeling stronger, then it will be
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the time of Falcons plenty, the architect of it all is
asked to partake in none of it. That has to be nearly as painful as
any incision.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to face the truth that for the next month Reeves
can't lead as he has. This very well might hurt the Falcons. But
racing back to the sidelines before he is truly able does no one
any good.

CONNECTICUT SEEKS TO INSURE UNSOLD SEAT LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Connecticut is shopping worldwide for an insurance
policy to cover as much as $13 million annually in unsold luxury
seats the state has guaranteed at the planned New England Patriots
stadium in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The state's insurance agent is soliciting competitive bids for a
policy that could cost as much as $5 million a year for financial
protection on vacant club seats and luxury suites.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an inquiry from the state that said we have this
exposure, can it be insured,'' said the agent, Fred Tanguay, a vice
president at the Hartford-based R. C. Knox &AMP; Co. ``I went out into
the market, and I am still out in the marketplace, talking to
numerous companies. In fact, there is a certain level of interest
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there is no deadline and no urgency for the state
seeking proposals. However, although the target date for the $375
million stadium opening is 2001, a decision to purchase a policy
must be made well before then.
</P>
<P>
   If there are indications corporate support for suites is soft,
potential underwriters may smell more of a risk and increase the
premium prices. In simpler terms, it would be like looking for an
insurance policy after the car accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the insurance capital of the world, it would not be
unusal that one of the domestic companies here would have an
interest,'' Tanguay said. ``But it being of a competitive bidding
nature, it's going to be best price, best coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The otherwise unlikely confluence of insurance and sports is
becoming less so in Hartford, home to some of the largest and most
well-known insurers in the world _ including Travelers and Aetna.
The city even has the chairman of Pheonix Mutual Home Life
Insurance Co. heading up the $1 billion Adriaen's Landing urban
redevelopment project, of which the stadium would be part.
</P>
<P>
   But while the state has insured halfcourt prize shots at
University of Connecticut basketball games, this could be one of
the more complicated and interesting policies ever taken out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most unusual,'' Tanguay said.
</P>
<P>
   The premium range, likely between $1 million and $5 million,
will depend on whether the policy offers full coverage and what the
deductible is set at. Anything costing more than $5 million would
not be prudent for the state, Tanguay said.
</P>
<P>
   Potential underwriters are looking at National Football League
market analyses from seven other areas to evaluate the price of
club seats, how many are sold, economic demographics, population,
wealth, corporate vibrancy.
</P>
<P>
   To make a decision, insurers will have to weigh the probability
of selling 6,000 club seats at $4,000 apiece and as much as 150
luxury suites at $100,000 a piece, given all those factors in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the type of things that go into it,'' Tanguay added.
``It's not a typical type of exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one company is publicly known to be negotiating for
the policy. That is General Star Indemnity, based in Stamford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an insurable interest and there's the potential for
an unexpected and unintended loss, then you can generally insure
it,'' said Kevin Brooks, president of General Star, which insures
hole-in-one golf contests, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Tanguay said the policy would be some form of a contingent
liability, meaning all or part of the state's exposure would be
covered if the seats are not sold.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the popular parlance of Hartford, he added: ``The
discussions are along the lines of terms, conditions, deductables,
co-insurance.''

INVESTORS SHRUG OFF IMPEACHMENT; DOW UP 85 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fallout from political turmoil at home or military action
abroad often rains down on financial markets. Not so for the first
impeachment of a US president since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Investors Monday pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up
85.22 points to close at 8988.85 in the first day of trading since
the House of Representatives' bipartisan vote Saturday to impeach
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The gain _ for a third consecutive day _ brought the Dow closer
to its 9374.27 high reached on the Monday before Thanksgiving.
Despite a volatile year, the Dow is up a respectable 13.66 percent
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A bull market in dark political times seemed to be testament to
investors' blind and determined optimism about the economy and its
prospects _ no matter what is unfolding in Washington, D.C., or how
many bombs are falling in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complacency of the market is outstanding,'' said Kathleen
Camilli, chief economist for Tucker Anthony Inc. in New York.
``Corporate America has been so successful increasing the wealth of
average Americans, does it really matter what happens in
Washington? It doesn't really affect us that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has a history of reacting to political events only
when they have a direct impact on the economy, analysts said. For
example, the 1990 bombing of Iraq by President Bush triggered a
market drop. But, the economy at the time was sinking into
recession, and there was a fear retaliation against Iraq's
oil-producing neighbors would worsen it.
</P>
<P>
   Bombings in Iraq have become almost familiar since. Meanwhile,
analysts said, Wall Street views Clinton's troubles as either a
largely Republican attack on the Democratic president, or destined
to come to a screeching halt when a more temperate Senate takes
over and possibly votes for a censure of the president, for his
behavior in the investigation of an affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day for the country and clearly a sad day for
the Clintons, but it's not clear what the economic impact'' of
impeachment is, said James Weiss, deputy head of equities for State
Street Research &AMP; Management Co. ``So, at the moment it's not
affecting the market.''
</P>
<P>
   But a closer look at the market reveals what appears to be
irrational hopes are investors whose decisions are tinged with
wariness. Investors have restricted much of their confidence to the
large high-tech company stocks, which are pulling along a market
that, otherwise, is in the doldrums, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the 12 best performing stocks in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 accounted for just over half the index's total gain of
22.5 percent for the year through Dec. 18, according to an analysis
by BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of Microsoft Corp. has more than doubled in price
since January, rising 2 5/8 Monday to close at 140 7/16. Other Blue
Chip computer giants also gained: Lucent Technologies up 5 1/2,
closing at 103 7/8; Cisco Systems rose 4 1/4 to 94 11/16; Intel
added 2 11/16 to 122 11/16; and Dell Computer Corp. climbed 4 1/16,
to 71 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fab Five _ Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Lucent, Dell, and
Intel _ are clearly providing the leadership for the market as they
have been for the last couple of months,'' said Ned Riley,
BankBoston's chief investment officer.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``When the average investor looks at his or her mutual fund
holdings, the question automatically asked is, `Why didn't my funds
do as well as the S&AMP;P?' '' he said. ``Because their mutual fund
didn't hold Microsoft at the same weighting as the S&AMP;P or Intel,
which was up 71 percent through last Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Many investors have money in growth funds invested in small
stocks, which have not performed well this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Parke, who heads the equity group for Massachusetts
Financial Services, agrees gains are ``concentrated in the
fast-growing blue chip technology companies,'' while ``the rest of
the market was left in the dust for the past few days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small stocks is down 8.05 percent for
the year. And blue chip companies such as Gillette Co. have
languished, because they don't give investors what they want:
strong earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   The razor and consumer products company's stock has dropped from
highs of around 62 a share in April and in July as profits fell
below expectations. Gillette's stock dipped 5/16 Monday, closing at
43.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a market that wants earnings certainty, and it's
willing to pay for any company with earnings certainty. Therefore,
the rich stocks just get richer,'' Parke said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets have been further fortified by successfully
shaking off the turmoil _ and fears of recession _ triggered by
disasters in Asia and Russia last summer. And though economists
predict US growth is expected to slow, interest rate cuts by the
Federal Reserve, copied by European central banks, also reassured
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Events in the political world could have consequences in 1999,
however, if the Senate is forced to move ahead with a full trial
and conviction of President Clinton. But investors ``presume the
Senate will not move forward with a trial'' of the president,
Camilli said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, investors ``are finding a very safe haven in the middle
of this herd,'' said BankBoston's Riley. ``As long as the herd
continues to pour money into the biggest and most successful tech
stocks, they will feel comfortable. But . . . if the leaderhip
shift takes place, it could be very traumatic.''

COMPANY SAYS THERE'S NO DEAL YET FOR COPPER MINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Anglo American Corp. of South
Africa said Monday that reports coming out of Zambia this weekend
that it had agreed to buy three of Zambia's most important copper
mines are ``premature.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nchanga, Nkana and Konkola mines are the richest prizes of
the state-owned copper company, and their sale is crucial to the
country's privatization program.
</P>
<P>
   News reports from Lusaka quoted Zambia's finance minister, Edith
Nawakwi, as saying a deal had been reached for Anglo American to
take over the mines for $10 million in royalties and a commitment
to spend $1.1 billion upgrading them. Negotiations to sell them to
another consortium went on for two years, with the sale price
regularly falling with copper prices.
</P>
<P>
   Anglo American said Monday that its negotiating team had signed
``a non-legally binding memorandum of understanding'' with the
Zambian government. But it said the document would become effective
only when ratified by both the government and the board of the
Anglo American subsidiary that already owns a 27 percent interest
in the mines.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are continuing, Anglo American said.
</P>
<P>
   A protocol officer for the finance minister said she was in an
urgent Cabinet meeting and could not be reached for comment.

CLINTON FIRES FIRST SHOT IN THE BANANA WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With an impeachment trial looming and the conflict
with Iraq temporarily subsiding, the Clinton administration chose
Monday to fire its first salvo in the banana war.
</P>
<P>
   After months of threats, the administration announced that in
retaliation for Europe's refusal to open its market to bananas
shipped by two American companies _ Dole Food Co. and Chiquita
Brands International, which is controlled by Carl Lindner, a major
contributor to both political parties _ it would impose 100 percent
tariffs on a variety of European-made products.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions will begin as early as February, the
administration insisted, unless Europe backs down in a dispute that
stretches back six years. And the list of European products slated
to soar in price could send a chill along Rodeo Drive and through
the aisles at Balducci's.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Vuitton handbags are on the list. So is pecorino, a hard,
sharp Italian cheese, ``in original loaves, not suitable for
grating.'' European-made cotton bed linens are subject to the huge
tariffs, along with ``sweaters, pullovers, sweat shirts, waistcoats
and similar articles,'' although only those made ``wholly of
cashmere.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mindful of not harming the president's job-approval
ratings in the holiday season, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky kept all wine off the list. But she included
European-made bath salts, tapered candles and Mont Blanc pens, a
step that one senior administration official said Monday would
``hit them where it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   One might think that amid impeachment and war, policy-makers
would give scant attention to the banana trade. But the White House
insists that President Clinton spent a considerable part of Friday
dealing with the banana dispute, even as the House of
Representatives debated the impeachment articles against him.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch with the leaders of the European Union, Clinton
threatened to approve the sanctions unless the Europeans relented
on banana quotas that the World Trade Organization has ruled
several times violate international trading rules. Eager to show
that the president was not consumed with his own troubles, White
House aides offered reporters details on Friday of how Clinton
jousted with Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's insistent trade minister.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to Sir Leon's accent, the president declared that ``the
only thing that makes this discussion almost tolerable is listening
to you pronounce `bo-non-nas.'''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Clinton had no more success persuading the
Europeans to relent on bananas than he had in persuading moderate
Republicans to vote against impeachment. The difference is that in
the banana dispute, Clinton had an immediate way to strike back,
which is exactly what he did Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   American officials insist that more than bananas is at stake _
although they admit, somewhat sheepishly, that their tough-minded
sanctions will scarcely protect any American jobs. Dole and
Chiquita grow almost all of their bananas in Ecuador, Guatemala,
Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at stake here is the credibility of the World Trade
Organization,'' insisted Peter Scher, chief American negotiator on
agricultural issues. ``This is the first case in which any country
has essentially refused to comply with rulings of the WTO. Even the
Japanese, when they lose a case, sit down and negotiate a
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cannot demonstrate that there is a price to pay for
refusing to comply with the WTO, then there is no incentive to use
this system.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Leon, in a statement issued in Brussels, shot back that the
United States was threatening ``European firms and jobs, which have
no link with the banana dispute whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to think of a more obvious breach of the
multilateral trade system than to take the law into your own hands
in defiance of the WTO rules,'' Sir Leon said.
</P>
<P>
   The banana battles have for years been fought with tremendous
passion _ much like the arguments with Japan over rice (which were
also under way Monday after Japanese farmers persuaded their
government last week to put 1,000 percent tariffs on imports) and
with Canada over wheat. There is little question that Washington
has a good case. The United States has won several challenges to
Europe's complex quota system, which the WTO has declared blatantly
discriminatory, intended to assure that European concerns get the
advantage in bringing Latin American and Caribbean bananas into the
continent.

 &HT;    Time Warner Entertainment to pay over $250 million to theme park
in damages
 &HT;    By Michael Weiss
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Gwinnett County Superior Court jury awarded
investors in Six Flags Over Georgia $257 million in punitive
damages Monday, adding to what was already the largest civil award
in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's award brings the total Time Warner Entertainment and
three former theme park subsidiaries must pay to $454 million,
including the $197 million in actual damages the jury awarded
Friday. Time Warner Entertainment is three-quarters owned by Time
Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a statement today that the big companies can't use the
little companies like that,'' jury foreman Judy Garner said after
deliberations, which took about 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Vice Chairman Ted Turner took the stand yesterday,
but apparently didn't sway the jury. ``The whole thing surprises me
and disappoints me, what happened here,'' Turner said on the stand.
``If we've done anything wrong, I want to apologize for it.''
Turner said he flew in from New Mexico yesterday, which was his
wedding anniversary and the birthday of his wife, Jane Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Entertainment President Richard Parsons also
testified.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of partnerships that formerly owned the Cobb County theme
park sued Time Warner Entertainment, whom they had contracted to
manage the park, accusing the media giant of delaying renovations
and refusing to bring popular rides to the park. Time Warner has
since sold its interest in the park to Premier Parks of Oklahoma
City.
</P>
<P>
   The partnerships said Time Warner deliberately kept the Batman
roller coaster away from the facility and let maintenance fall $7
million behind in an effort to renew the management contract at a
lower rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did it for profit because their goal was to get the
Georgia park and to get it cheap,'' Columbus, Ga. attorney Jim
Butler, who represented the partnerships, said in his closing
argument.
</P>
<P>
   Butler was also the attorney in a 1993 case when a Fulton County
jury handed down what was then the state's biggest award: $105
million to a Snellville couple who sued General Motors after their
son died in a car crash. That verdict was reversed the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Butler told the jury that Ted Turner had little to do with the
case _ Turner admitted he had been to the park only once or twice
in his life _ and accused Time Warner lawyers of using his
celebrity to try to sway the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner attorney Evan Chesler said after the five-week trial
that Turner's fame had nothing to do with his testimony. ``He's the
vice chairman of the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chesler said he didn't know if Time Warner would appeal the
verdict.

TO PALESTINIANS, ISRAEL IS PUTTING POLITICS BEFORE PEACE _ AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: ISRAEL-POLITICS) 
 (nk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ With their latest accord with Israel
already frozen, Palestinian officials view Israel's early elections
as a gamble that holds out a prospect for change but insures a
deepening peace stalemate in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   There was a strong sense among lawmakers gathered here Monday
for a session of the Palestinian Legislative Council that peace
efforts between Israel and the Palestinians have once again become
subject to the vagaries of Israeli domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Courting the right's support before the Israeli legislature
voted on new elections Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
secured Cabinet approval on Sunday for a series of conditions for
further troop withdrawals in the West Bank, effectively suspending
the land-for-security accord signed on Oct. 23 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among those conditions was a demand that the Palestinian
Authority ``abandon its intention to unilaterally declare a
Palestinian state'' on May 4, 1999, when the interim self-rule
agreements expire. Other demands include an end to incitement and
violence, collection of illegal weapons and acceptance of Israel's
terms for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu contends that he simply wants an end to Palestinian
violations of the agreement. But to Palestinian ears his conditions
_ the platform for his call for new elections _ are excuses to
renege on the accord, boding ill for the coming months even though
Netanyahu might ultimately be unseated.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinian officials expect a deepening diplomatic
paralysis as the Israelis become embroiled in an election campaign
and Netanyahu stakes out tough positions to garner votes from the
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should not kidnap the peace process as a hostage to achieve
what he is planning,'' said Ahmed Qurei, known as Abu Ala, speaker
of the legislative council and an architect of the 1993 Oslo peace
accords with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt this election will freeze the agreement and it will
be very dangerous,'' Qurei said. ``We are waiting for May 4. This
is the last chance for this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   With Netanyahu effectively suspending the latest accord, the
announced intention by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to declare
a state on May 4 has given the Palestinians potent diplomatic
leverage, eliciting dire warnings from Netanyahu and injecting a
sense of urgency into the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, warned that
stagnation could have grave consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Netanyahu is trying to gather the right wing around him
and he has already decided to freeze the peace process,'' said
Erekat, ``but how can we survive the next months with settlements,
and confiscation of land? He is turning the Palestinians into
enemies as a theme in his election campaign. He is creating a
pressure-cooker situation on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers, however, saw an opportunity in the elections,
noting that Netanyahu had already halted the latest agreement
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there were no elections, the process is frozen,'' said
Ziyad Abu Zayyad, a Palestinian lawmaker from Jerusalem. ``I would
rather see new elections, because maybe they will bring a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanan Ashrawi, a former Palestinian cabinet minister, said:
``This is not bad news. It is a test for the Israeli people whether
they will cast a vote for peace or for consolidation of the extreme
right-wing hold on the Israeli body politic.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials assert that the Israeli government is
bound by the latest accord, regardless of any election campaign.
They maintain that despite Netanyahu's accusations to the contrary,
they have kept their part of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that articles of the Palestine Liberation
Organization charter calling for the destruction of Israel have
been revoked, that decrees have been issued against incitement and
illegal weapons, and that suspects wanted by Israel have been
jailed. Israel, meanwhile, did not carry out a further West Bank
withdrawal that was supposed to have occurred last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Salah Taamari, a legislator from the Bethlehem area, said he
sought to avoid potentially false hopes that Netanyahu would be
defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford the luxury of waiting to see if the Labor
Party will win,'' Taamari said, referring to the Israeli party
under whose leadership the Oslo agreement was reached. ``It all
depends on what happens on the ground in these few months. How much
land are we going to lose? How many lives are we going to lose?''

KOSOVO'S RIVAL FORCES ARE MOVING CLOSER TO A NEW WAR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE O'CONNOR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERANE, Yugoslavia _ Yugoslav forces and ethnic Albanian rebels
seem to be goading each other into a major new round of fighting,
with the people of Kosovo and the Western countries able to do
little more than watch.
</P>
<P>
   Military and police units have been on the move in the last few
days. Long convoys, including tanks and armored personnel carriers,
are leaving bases where the government had promised their forces
would remain and are putting men in new positions or taking
territory from the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who moved into many areas vacated by the Serbs in
October, are stepping up the recruiting and training of fighters
and are obtaining large amounts of military gear, according to
diplomats. In the last week eight Serbs have been slain. Serbs are
convinced that the rebels are responsible, and many are threatening
to take their revenge against ethnic Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's top commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, and senior
U.S. diplomats went to Belgrade on Monday to tell top Yugoslav
officials to rein in their forces.
</P>
<P>
   But many Western diplomats in Yugoslavia say they doubt that
they can stop renewed combat on a large scale, even though it had
been held that the harsh Balkan winter would prevent any new
conflict. The chief Western diplomat in Kosovo, William Walker, an
American, is more optimistic than others. Still, he said there was
not much the West could do except try to persuade the rebels and
the government to act peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope no one is overestimating the tools at our disposal,''
Walker said. ``We don't have many.''
</P>
<P>
   In a month or so, as many as 2,000 international observers are
scheduled to be on the ground in Kosovo, monitoring each side and
trying to ease tensions. Now, however, there is a question whether
war will erupt before most monitors are in place.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western diplomat, referring to the rebel-run Kosovo
Liberation Army, said: ``The government's decided enough is enough;
the KLA is out of control. If the government responds the way it
seems to be getting ready to do, then the monitors will have to get
out because there'll be war everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday in this village, six tanks were involved in combat with
rebel forces that recently moved into the area. The tanks left
their base over the weekend for what the government called a
training exercise. New rebel trenches have been set up on the hills
around the fighting and near the main road to the provincial
capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting here, along with the appearance Monday of heavily
armed Serbian paramilitary policemen on the roads nearby, comes
after a police official was shot to death as he walked to work
Monday morning in a neighboring town.
</P>
<P>
   None of this was supposed to happen after Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, under threat of NATO air strikes, agreed to
stop offensive operations and withdraw many of his forces from
Kosovo in October. Diplomats, led by Americans, thought that if the
government halted their attacks, the rebels would honor a
cease-fire, allowing negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiations have made little progress. Most ethnic
Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo's population,
want independence. The government is offering limited autonomy, and
there are deep divisions among ethnic Albanian political leaders
over what level of autonomy would be acceptable. Rebel leaders
generally feel that they can win independence through war.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, as the body of the deputy mayor of Kosovo Polje, a
few miles west of Pristina, was found by the roadside shot to
death, Mirolslav Mijailovic, one of the 1,000 or so residents of
the village of Velika Hoca, was welcoming guests to his home. It
was his family's annual ceremony in homage to its patron, St.
Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   Dishes of potatoes, sweet peppers, cabbage rolls, fish and
cookies nearly overflowed the long table as people tried to find
solace in talk of religion and tradition. But it did not work,
because they said they could feel Kosovo sliding quickly into war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are not to blame for what is coming, not the Serb
people or the Albanian,'' Mijailovic said. ``Everyone wants what we
had before, peace. But there are leaders on both sides who are
setting a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Serbs and ethnic Albanians have been very close in
the area of western Kosovo around Velika Hoca. But now, the guests
said, they are terrified by the rebel fighters they see on the
hills around the village.
</P>
<P>
   The two peoples were so close that one guest, the Serbian mayor
of the city of Orahovac, three miles away, said one of his best
friends was the man who is now the rebel commander for the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he started his chicken farm, he came to me for the money
to buy the first load of chicken feed,'' said the mayor, Andjelko
Kolasinac
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the limits of our patience,'' Kolasinac said. ``The
West must put enough pressure on the KLA that they stop what they
are doing. Otherwise what I see coming will not be stopped.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the government has taken action against the rebels in the
past, it has usually been so brutal that it has only increased the
conviction among ethnic Albanians that they must create their own
country.
</P>
<P>
   A large military offensive over the summer forced as many as
300,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes. Government forces
then looted and burned an estimated 20,000 houses. It was the
prospect of mass starvation and deaths caused by exposure in the
Balkan winter that prompted Western countries to intercede so that
refugees could feel safe enough to move back to their villages.
</P>
<P>
   But even now, in response to the rebel actions, government
forces often brutalize ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   After the funerals last Wednesday of six young Serbs shot in a
coffee shop in the city of Pec, the police went on a rampage for
several days, arresting and severely beating dozens of ethnic
Albanian men.
</P>
<P>
   Many victims said they had not even been questioned about the
killings, only beaten.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, government forces retook a nearby village,
causing hundreds of ethnic Albanian civilians to flee the area.
</P>
<P>
   As his children packed clothes, blankets and bags of flour and a
red kerosene lantern into a wagon behind the family tractor in the
village of Glodanje, Nysret Maloku echoed the appeal Serbs are
making to Western countries. ``You must stop these attacks on us,''
he said. ``We want peace, but we want to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   And just as Serbs are insisting that government forces be
unleashed against the rebels, Maloku said he wanted the Kosovo
Liberation Army to strike back at the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to protect us from the regime,'' he said. ``Any army
is supposed to protect its people.''

 &HT;    Pentagon OKs Lockheed fighter
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Pentagon has approved initial production of
Lockheed Martin's F-22 fighter, a milestone for the program headed
at the company's Marietta, Ga. plant.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts worth $761 million passed final review by a top
Pentagon panel. One, for $571 million, will fund two production
test planes. Another, for $190 million, includes advance payments
on six more of the state-of-the-art warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a favorable review,'' Gloria Cales, an Air Force
spokeswoman, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts still must be signed by Defense Secretary William
Cohen, a formality expected within days.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft covered by the contracts are the first of 339 F-22s
the Air Force plans to buy over the next 16 years for up to $41
billion, plus $19 billion in development costs.
</P>
<P>
   Final assembly is to be done in Marietta, where Lockheed
Martin's Aeronautical Systems unit oversees the F-22 program.
Boeing Co. is a major partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This moves the program to the production phase from the
development stage we've been in for the last few years,'' said Tom
Burbage, vice president and general manager of F-22 programs at the
Marietta plant. ``It's a nice way to end the year.''
</P>
<P>
   So far Lockheed Martin has produced three F-22s, two for flight
tests and one for ground tests.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract funds two planes, called Production
Representative Test Vehicles, to be built in 1999. They'll be used
to certify assembly line processes and, unlike the existing test
planes, will later go into service.
</P>
<P>
   Full funding for the next batch of six planes would be awarded
late next year, assuming the program receives continued support
from the Pentagon and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After that, production would ramp up to 24 planes annually by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 of the Marietta plant's 9,400 employees work on the
F-22. Burbage said that number will stay fairly constant, as
employment on the engineering side drops while production manpower
rises.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, F-22 flight testing fell behind schedule,
prompting the General Accounting Office to recommend delaying the
program. But the plane in November met the Pentagon's requirement
for 184.4 test hours _ 4 percent of the total planned _ before
initial production was approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the program is very solid technically,'' Burbage said.

IRAQ REJECTS FRENCH PROPOSAL FOR NEW INSPECTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: See also IRAQ-MILITARY, IRAQ-SCENE, IRAQ-U.N.) 
(rl) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ Iraq on Monday rejected suggestions that it
might change its decision to end cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors if the composition or leadership of the inspection teams
was changed.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz brushed
aside a proposal from President Jacques Chirac of France under
which U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq over its invasion of Kuwait
would be lifted while a new team of inspectors monitors sites where
Iraq is suspected of producing weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   He condemned Chirac's proposal for ``concentrating on Iraq
selectively'' and asked, ``Why doesn't he make a proposal to look
after what Israel has?''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz also said that reconstituting the inspection teams under a
chairman other than Richard Butler, whose work he has sharply
criticized, would not be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Butler is a cheap pawn in the hands of the
Americans,'' Aziz said. ``He is not the issue. The issue is the
American and British position during the whole period, which
prevented the Security Council from making any serious effort to
lift the sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz reiterated the country's position, expressed after U.S. and
British bombing raids began last week, that it has decided to halt
all cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weapons inspections were killed by the American and
British missiles,'' he said. ``I cannot give them another life.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz said Iraq would not accept any resumption of inspections
until the United Nations votes for a ``condemnation of the
aggressor'' and lifts the economic sanctions it imposed on Iraq
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without that it will be difficult for Iraq to talk,'' he said.
``How can I receive a suggestion from a party that does not condemn
the aggression? How can I discuss a solution if that solution does
not include an end to the sanctions?''
</P>
<P>
   In condemning Chirac's proposal, Aziz said: ``In all this
bombing, not a trace of chemical or biological weapons was
detected. All this rhetoric about weapons of mass destruction is a
big lie.''
</P>
<P>
   By ending its cooperation with weapons inspectors, Iraq risked
further isolating itself at a time when it appeared to be winning
at least grudging sympathy from France, Russia, China and several
Islamic nations.
</P>
<P>
   It also effectively challenged the United States and Britain to
see if they can sustain a policy of periodic bombing of Iraq, which
they may now decide is the only way to control what they say is
President Saddam Hussein's deadly arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz described the Clinton administration as criminal and
accused Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain of turning his country
into ``a tail of the fox that is in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall never accept any conditions made by Clinton or
Blair,'' he said. ``I refuse all these conditions totally and
strongly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not damage our relations with the United Nations. They
damaged the United Nations itself. They acted according to the law
of the jungle. They did not act according to international law. It
is their responsibility to rebuild their relations with the
international community and their relations with the Security
Council and the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   The weapons inspectors made thousands of inspections and
installed scores of cameras and monitoring devices in factories and
other facilities. They repeatedly complained, however, that Iraqi
officials were denying them access to suspicious sites and seeking
to impede and limit their work.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has said it would not lift sanctions until
the inspectors certify that Iraq is not hiding nuclear, chemical or
biological weapons or the means to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Monday, Aziz, who was dressed in military
fatigues, also gave the first full Iraqi assessment of the damage
from last week's bombing raids. He said 62 Iraqi officers and
soldiers had been killed and another 180 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Although he gave no figures for civilian casualties, he said
they were ``much higher.'' He said bombs had hit military barracks
and government offices, but charged that others had fallen on
``hospitals, private homes, schools and other civilian sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz's assessment of the damage contrasted sharply with that of
U.S. and British officials, who have asserted that their bombs fell
only on military targets.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the U.S. decision to close embassies in Africa
temporarily because of the threat of terrorist reprisals, Aziz
replied: ``America is afraid of the people because America is a
criminal, and I mean the American administration. They know that
the people in the world hate them, hate them because they are
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz also ridiculed U.S. and British hopes that bombing raids
would spark an uprising against the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Rambo-like fantasy,'' he said. ``The Iraqi people
strongly and genuinely support their leadership.''

 &HT;    Cheap oil prices keep holiday visitors on the road
 &HT;    By Marcus Franklin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ There is good news for holiday travelers:
Gasoline prices are down, despite U.S. military airstrikes against
Iraq last week and tensions between the United States and other
Middle Eastern countries, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently there has not been any real jitter for a disruption
(of the flow on oil to this country),'' Keaton said. ``Refiners are
still operating at 92 percent to 96 percent of their capacity. It's
all very dependent on how much the war might escalate.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the average price of self-serve regular unleaded gas
decreased this month to $1 a gallon, down about 3 cents since
November, according to AAA.
</P>
<P>
   Travel experts anticipate that a record 45.2 million people will
travel 100 miles or more from home during the Christmas and New
Year's holidays, a 2 percent increase over last year's 42.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 million will go by automobile and nearly 10 million by
airplane, train or bus, according to AAA.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Dallas-based Greyhound carried 1.25 million people
around the nation to be with loved ones for the holidays. This
year, the company expects its ridership to increase by at least 5
percent, according to company spokeswoman Katherine Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Those who travel by airplane should be prepared for delays
because of the recent U.S. airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you plan to fly and take a present to your
nephew in Florida this week, don't gift wrap it. If you do, airport
security people will unwrap it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the same level of security we've been on since the
Persian Gulf war,'' said John Sears, a spokesman at Dayton
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Sears said the only change is that last year's Federal Aviation
Administration ``advice'' to unwrap packages at security
checkpoints this year is a directive.

OCTUPLETS STRUGGLE FOR LIFE, WORLD WRESTLES WITH IMPLICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The first surviving set of octuplets, born of modern
chemistry and their mother's persistence, clung to life Monday
under plastic blankets and the eyes of a world left to wonder about
the boundaries of science.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Texas Children's Hospital were taking
``minute-by-minute'' care of Nkem Chukwu's six daughters and two
sons, who collectively weighed just over 10 pounds, or the
equivalent of a single large newborn.
</P>
<P>
   Although statistically they had an 85 percent chance of
survival, all remained in critical condition and two appeared to be
struggling somewhat Monday, said chief neonatologist Dr. Leonard
Weisman. All face two to three months of intensive care at an
anticipated cost of $250,000 each, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven were born Sunday by caesarean section, 13 weeks before
their normal due date; one was delivered vaginally 12 days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Their 27-year-old mother, who had taken fertility drugs, had
surgery Monday to repair damage from the extreme measures she took
to keep her babies growing inside her, which included spending
weeks nearly upside down to minimize pressure on her midsection.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman said the babies were being monitored for
life-threatening disorders common among premature infants. ``Our
main concern is that we get through the first few days, which we
usually associate with breathing or heart problems,'' he said in an
interview. ``The next phase will be nutrition, focusing on whether
we are giving them enough fluids, sugar, proteins, fats.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Monday, a media horde had assembled and pledges of
donations were streaming into St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, where
the children were born before being whisked to the neonatal
intensive care unit at adjacent Texas Children's.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pledges were a lifetime supply of diapers from an
anonymous donor; a lifetime supply of wipes and disposable training
pants from the Drypers Corp.; a one-year supply of baby formula
from Mead Johnson Nutritional; and a year's supply of groceries
from Randall's, a Houston supermarket chain, said Marianne Dwyer,
assistant director of health care philanthropy at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous callers also offered financial help, and the hospital
was in the process of setting up a trust fund for the family, she
said. A load of toys, flowers and balloons also was en route to the
Chukwus.
</P>
<P>
   The seven babies born Sunday were all breathing with help from a
ventilator Monday. The first baby was taken off the ventilator and
was only receiving supplemental oxygen. She had begun feeding
through a tube in her mouth, while her siblings were receiving
intravenous fluids with dissolved sugar and salt. All remained
under the warmth of artificial light and plastic blankets designed
to help them retain fluid.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly two-week gap between births was possible because each
baby grew inside its own amniotic sac; after the first girl was
born Dec. 8, doctors gave Mrs. Chukwu drugs that ceased labor and
helped her cervix to close, giving the remaining babies added time
inside the womb, Weisman said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian Kirshon, a high-risk obstetrician, said Mrs. Chukwu
underwent surgery Monday to control abdominal bleeding caused by
those measures. He called the surgery successful and said Mrs.
Chukwu might go home by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Chukwus, Nigerian-born US citizens living in southwest
Houston, had not told hospital officials of their decisions about
baby names, and so each was designated with a letter, a system that
used up one-third of the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   The largest was Baby G, a boy who weighed 1 pound and 10 ounces
at birth; the smallest was Baby E, a girl who weighed just over 10
ounces. Weisman said it appeared Baby E had been ``crowded'' by her
siblings, and her diminutive size made her prospects unclear. The
smallest of the septuplets born last year to an Iowa family, the
McCaugheys, weighed in excess of a half-pound more than the largest
Chukwu octuplet.
</P>
<P>
   Even the largest among the octoplets face uncertain futures. By
two weeks of age, each baby will be tested to see if there is
bleeding into the brain; beginning at six weeks, each will be given
regular eye tests because impaired vision is common among premature
infants. Infections are an ongoing concern, and doctors will
continually monitor their physical and emotional development, which
might be delayed or impaired, Weisman said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He defended the cost of the babies' care _ more than 25 times
the expense of eight uneventful, single births _ contrasting it
with the amount of money spent on geriatric patients near the end
of their lives. ``If a baby gets a quarter-of-a-million dollars in
care and lives to be 83, when you consider the number of years of
productive life, it's not that much. From our perspective, we think
these costs are worthwhile,'' Weisman said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors knew Mrs. Chukwu was carrying multiple fetuses, but
learned exactly how many only after the Dec. 8 birth. They kept it
a secret until Sunday at the request of her and her husband Iyke, a
physical therapist at a Houston hospital.

   Doctors had discussed aborting one or more fetus to give the
others more room to grow, but the Chukwus declined, citing their
religious beliefs. The Chukwus had long sought unsuccessfully to
have children before taking fertility drugs, and she suffered a
miscarriage of triplets earlier this year while also taking the
drugs, Kirshon said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hurdles that remain, the births were nothing short
of a medical marvel and a testament to Mrs. Chukwu's fortitude.
Hospitalized since October and confined to bed for six weeks, she
was fed intravenously to shrink her stomach and give her babies
room to grow. She spent the days leading up to the caesarean tilted
nearly upside down to keep pressure off her lower body.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was determined to give these babies the best chance
possible by trying to prolong the pregnancy,'' Wiseman said.
``Imagine putting a 25- to 30-pound bowling ball on your belly and
lying upside down for two weeks. Anything she could do, she did.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest recorded multiple birth was nine babies in Sydney,
Australia, in 1971, according to the Guinness Book of World
Records. All the children died. Three other cases of octuplets have
been recorded in the past 13 years. In two cases, all the babies
died, but in 1996 a Spanish woman delivered six healthy babies
after two fetuses died in utero.

<P>
   In a setback for computer users looking for deep pockets to help
pay the cost of dealing with year 2000 problems, J. Baker, an
apparel retailer, has dropped its claim that Andersen Consulting,
the designer of a computer system Baker installed in 1991, is
liable for the system's year 2000 defects.
</P>
<P>
   Baker had been threatening to sue New York-based Andersen when
the consulting company instead rushed to a Massachusetts state
court in August asking for a ruling that there was no basis for
such a suit. The contract said nothing about the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said Monday that as a result of a mediator's report
backing Andersen it had agreed that Andersen owed it nothing for
year 2000 repairs. Andersen is dropping its request for a state
court ruling.

   Baker, based in Canton, Mass., operates several retail clothing
chains, including Casual Male Big and Tall.

ISRAELI PARLIAMENT GIVES INITIAL APPROVAL FOR EARLY ELECTIONS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel's Parliament rejected Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's peace policies Monday and then took the first step
toward dissolving itself and holding early elections.
</P>
<P>
   The action is likely to put the brakes on peacemaking with the
Palestinians for several months.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 81 of the 120 members of the parliament, the Knesset,
voted to dissolve the body and hold elections, including several
from Netanyahu's coalition and his own Likud Party. The preliminary
vote took place just minutes after the packed assembly defeated the
prime minister's plan calling on the Palestinians to fulfill
specific peace commitments before Israel would agree to cede more
West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting slumped in his seat and looking dejected, Netanyahu cast
his vote in favor of the bill, brought by the opposition Labor
Party, after making a last-ditch call for a national unity
government. The offer was rejected immediately by Labor's leader,
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The victory of the new elections bill represents a blow to
Netanyahu, who had hoped that he could instead muster enough votes
to pass his plan for peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   His plan would have required commitments from Palestinians to
renounce all claims to statehood and Jerusalem; stop violence and
incitement to violence; seize illegal arms; and accept Israel's
terms for release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote, Netanyahu said he was confident that a majority
of the Israeli public backed his tough peace policies for the
Palestinians. But should the Knesset vote for early elections, he
predicted, he would be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that people want peace with reciprocity and
Jerusalem as Israel's capital,'' Netanyahu said. ``We will fight
for our opinions and if there will be new elections, we will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Netanyahu's plan, approved by his right-wing
Cabinet on Sunday, was defeated by a vote of 56 to 48. Then the
bill for early elections passed its first reading. It must pass two
more readings, which may take place as soon as next week, before it
becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said he would not fight the bill's second and third
readings, and Israeli press reports predicted that elections would
be set for sometime between March and June of next year, about a
year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Knesset, it seemed that election season had already
begun.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the vote, Barak chided Netanyahu for leading
Israel down a path of stalemate in negotiations with the
Palestinians and promised Israelis that his Labor party would be
able to deliver in peacemaking where Netanyahu had failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got another road to offer,'' Barak told the packed
Parliament in a speech broadcast on Israel TV. ``We want to get
this country back on track, invest in education, not in the
(Israeli) settlements (on the West Bank and Gaza).
</P>
<P>
   ``We started the peace process, and we are going to change
Israel into a better place for all of us,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote ended two weeks of frantic maneuvering by Netanyahu to
save his crumbling coalition, which began when members of Labor and
Meretz, a smaller left-wing party, proposed the bill for early
elections.
</P>
<P>
   To buy time then, Netanyahu asked a coalition partner to attach
a no-confidence motion to the bill, which postponed the vote for
one week, according to Knesset rules. But the vote was held up for
two weeks to accommodate President Clinton's visit to Israel and
the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the no-confidence motion was withdrawn, leaving the
Parliament to vote on Netanyahu's peace plan and the bill for early
elections only.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians blasted the prospect of months of campaigning,
which likely will divert attention from peacemaking and make it
virtually impossible for Israel to carry out more land-transfers
and other obligations made in the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a bad signal if Israel stops the peace process,'' said
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. ``In my view, this is the
greatest violation of the Wye agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials refrained from commenting on Israel's internal
politics, but said they expected the Wye agreement to be carried
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The position of the United States is that the Wye River
memorandum should be implemented as signed and without new
conditions,'' said State Department spokesman James Foley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians have worked hard to implement many of their
commitments under the agreement, including annulling clauses in the
Palestine National Charter and stepping up the fight against
terror,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Monday's vote, Netanyahu appeared to be in trouble
with Israel's voters. A poll taken last week concluded that 80
percent of Israelis supported the Wye agreement, 53 percent were
unsatisfied with Netanyahu's handling of the peace process and 63
percent wanted to see former army chief-of-staff Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, touted as a favorite to beat Netanyahu, enter
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Up until the last minute, Netanyahu portrayed himself as a tough
negotiator who could get the best deal possible in negotiations
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise you that Arafat is the first person who thinks any
alternative is better than Netanyahu,'' Netanyahu said. ``The whole
world understands this. Every Palestinian understands this. And
most of the nation understands this.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks rose for a third consecutive session Monday,
pushed higher by continued flows into popular large-capitalization
issues and torrid demand for companies that do business on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and traders said that the House vote on Saturday to
impeach President Clinton had virtually no effect on investors, who
lifted the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock and Nasdaq composite indexes
to record high closes Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major issue is conviction, and the market seems to think
that at most Mr. Clinton will be censured,'' said Ned Riley Jr.,
chief investment officer at BankBoston, who noted that the Federal
Reserve chairman and the Treasury secretary, had more power to move
markets. ``In terms of influence, the markets look at Alan
Greenspan first, Bob Rubin second and Bill Clinton third,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A far more critical issue to most mutual fund managers,
according to Riley and others, has been their failure to meet or
surpass key benchmark market gauges this year. Trying to make up
for lost time, many mutual funds during the last few sessions have
been increasing their weightings in the stocks that have done the
most to move those gauges to their current lofty levels.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy buying in a handful of big technolgy companies was
instrumental in driving the S&AMP;P 500 and Nasdaq to new highs.. The
S&AMP;P rose 14.81 points, or 1.25 percent, to 1,202.84. Nasdaq jumped
51.89 points, or 2.5 percent, to 2,138.03. For the year, Nasdaq is
up nearly 36 percent, and it has risen 50.7 percent since its
52-week low on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the 85.22-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial
average seemed almost mundane. The Dow closed at 8,988.85, up about
1 percent. Five of the 30 stocks that make up the blue-chip index
set records.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of smaller stocks also rose, but at a much more sedate
pace. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks closed at
401.83, up 4.41 points, or 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is primarily a big-cap rally, which suggests there is a
certain amount of haste'' by mutual fund managers to get into the
market, said Christine Callies, chief investment strategist at
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Through Friday, the S&AMP;P 500 was up 22.5 percent for the year.
But Riley noted the average growth and income mutual funds, and
equity income mutual funds, are only up 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge disparity,'' he said. ``I believe there is a
year-end rush to dress up portfolios to show that holdings of the
S&AMP;P best performers are now in proportion to the weightings of
those stocks in the index.''
</P>
<P>
   Most popular are seven technology stocks that Riley said are
responsible for nearly two-thirds of the 23.95 percent gain in the
S&AMP;P 500 this year: Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Dell Computer, Cisco
Systems, Lucent Technologies and MCI Worldcom. All of those issues
gained more than a point Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Microsoft jumped 2|, to 140 7/16. Cisco added 4\,
to 94 11/16. And Lucent was up 5|, to 104.
</P>
<P>
   I.B.M. was one of five Dow stocks to hit highs, climbing 4
13/16, to 176]. The other Dow stocks to post new records were AT&AMP;T,
GE, Wal-Mart and McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks soared again, driven by strongly positive
comments from Mary Meeker, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst
whose views on the business are respected by investors. In an
interview with Barron's, Ms. Meeker said the sharp increase in
Internet users over the last three years makes Internet stocks
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Among Internet companies, Amazon.com jumped 32 1/16, to 318}.
Yahoo gained 30 9/16, to 242~. And Onsale Inc. gained 24 5/16, to
68.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent mania for Internet stocks also helped to lift the
stocks of brokerage houses that offer discount trading over the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Charles Schwab, the largest online brokerage firm,
rose 7 5/16, to 51 11/16. E-Trade Group, the second-biggest online
broker, gained 4 13/16, to 32[. And Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
which owns Discover Brokerage Direct, gained 4 15/16, to 76 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Other big winners Monday included Amgen, the world's leading
biotechnology company.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen shares soard 12 3/16, to 100 5/16 after the company said
it had won all rights to a once-a-week version of Epogen, its
anemia drug, in an arbitration fight with Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
Johnson &AMP; Johnson shares fell 2{, to 77.
</P>
<P>
   The strong performance of the stock market stood in stark relief
to a poor performance by bonds. Before Tuesday's meeting of the
Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee, prices of
the government's benchmark 30-year bond fell by nearly a point and
its yield rose to 5.06 percent from 5.00 percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than worrying about Clinton, perhaps the more
significant question is whether the performance of the bond market
and the stock market can continue to diverge,'' said Ms. Callies of
Credit Suisse First Boston. ``The market doesn't have a lot of
support in terms of good corporate earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Three cuts in short-term interest rates by the Fed since late
September have been instrumental in the stock market's remarkable
recovery. But most analysts do not expect the Fed to cut further
until it sees additional signs of weakness in the economy.

CASUAL DRINKING HURTS WORK PERFORMANCE, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a season of holiday office parties and year-end boozing,
Boston researchers have offered surprising new evidence on who is
responsible for most alcohol-related problems in the workplace: Not
the classic ``problem drinkers'' but the majority of workers who
occasionally imbibe too much on weeknights or have a drink with
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The new view, which upsets a half-dozen assumptions about
alcohol and job performance, emerges from surveys of almost 14,000
managers and hourly workers in seven Fortune 500 companies. The
surveys were conducted by researchers from Harvard and Boston
Universities and the Boston consulting firm of John Snow, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis found that 77 percent of workers who occasionally
drink to excess the night before a workday, or have any alcohol
with lunch, account for almost 60 percent of productivity problems
_ absenteeism, coming late to work or leaving early, poor work
performance, and workplace strife.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take classic hangover symptoms such as nausea and
headache to lower productivity, noted Jonathan Howland of Boston
University School of Public Health, one of the study authors.
``Excessive alcohol use which upsets sleep and decreases
concentration can affect the employee, and productivity goes
downhill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are based on questionnaires mailed to the homes of
managers and workers from 130 US work sites. First researchers
sorted respondents into levels of alcohol use, classifying about
one-fifth as alcohol-dependent, 61 percent as non-dependent
drinkers, and 20 percent as abstainers.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of workers considered alcohol-dependent is based
on a fairly broad, but generally accepted, definition that includes
individuals who answer ``yes'' to two or more questions such as:
``Have you ever felt the need to cut down on your drinking?'' or
``Have you ever felt guilty about your drinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the yearly rate of work performance problems among the
three groups, researchers not surprisingly found that
alcohol-dependent workers ranked highest, with nearly seven
episodes of work performance problems a year, compared to about
four episodes among abstainers. Nondependent drinkers were
intermediate, with 5.4 episodes on average.
</P>
<P>
   However, because there were so many more non-dependent drinkers,
they accounted for a larger fraction of workplace productivity
problems _ 59 percent, versus 41 percent for the classic problem
drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for American firms, the researchers said, is
that companies are ignoring the largest source of their
alcohol-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This provocative new study raises interesting questions about
our understanding of the alcohol problem in America,'' said Dr.
Steven A. Schroeder, president of the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation, which funded the study. ``It tests conventional wisdom
and offers insight into the nature of the harms caused by alcohol
in the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors, drawing on several years of research, say their
findings justify a new look at workplace policies focussed for
decades on counselling and treating (or firing) the obvious
alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   Citing recent revisions of societal thinking about drinking and
driving, college binge drinking, and cigarette smoking, the
researchers said it ``may now be time to revisit workplace alcohol
policies and practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed, but some cautioned against management preachments
that intrude into employees' personal lives, lest that produce
resentment rather than behavioral change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study is a wakeup call,'' said Bruce Davidson, manager of
employee assistance and work life programs at Compaq Computer
Corporation in Maynard, Mass. ``But you shouldn't cross the magic
line that separates the workplace from what people do in their
private time, or you'll get a backlash. Nobody likes to be told
what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason why heavy-handed management pronouncements might
not work, the study suggests, is that managers do more than their
share of daytime drinking with adverse consequences on their own
productivity. The study found that managers were three times more
likely than hourly workers to drink during working hours _ usually
at lunch or at company-sponsored functions.
</P>
<P>
   But one alcohol researcher said there is accumulating evidence
that nondependent drinkers may give up ``risky drinking'' behavior
quite readily, in contrast to those who are classic alcohol
addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news on this story is there is 20 years of research
and 40 to 50 clinical trials around the world showing that what we
call `risky drinking' can be reduced in many cases by as little as
five minutes of simple advice to people,'' said John Higgins-Biddle
of the University of Connecticut Medical School. ``When we tell
them about the negative consequences of their drinking and suggest
simple things people can do to cut down, people tend to get the
point.''

 &HT;    Voinovich ready to deal with Senate trial
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ohio Gov. George Voinovich on Monday treaded gently
on the topic of President Clinton's up-coming impeachment trial in
the Senate, but said he doesn't think a trial can be avoided by
striking a plea deal that punishes the president with a reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich, a Republican from Cleveland, will join the Senate in
January as that 100-member body prepares to deal with two articles
of impeachment against Clinton that were approved by the House of
Representatives last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me from what I've read, that in order to end a
process, you have to begin the process,'' Voinovich said. ``A trial
has to start.''
</P>
<P>
   But Voinovich also said many options are being discussed to
resolve the Clinton crisis and said, ``I'm not closing my mind to
any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Clinton became the second president in American
history to be impeached by the House of Representatives. The
closest America has come to impeaching a president since Andrew
Johnson 130 years ago was when President Nixon resigned before the
drafted articles of impeachment could be approved on a floor vote
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved two articles of impeachment against Clinton.
The first charges him with committing perjury in front of a grand
jury when he was questioned about his affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. The other article charges him with
obstruction of justice for a host of alleged acts including
tampering with witnesses and concealing evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment charges have been forwarded to the Senate for a
trial in which the outcome is determined by a two-thirds vote and
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court William Rehnquist presides. But
scholars and politicos have been debating whether the Constitution
will permit the Senate to dodge the unpopular prospect of a trial
by censuring Clinton and perhaps assessing a fine.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, a Republican from Cedarville, issued a
statement Monday saying he will remain impartial as a ``juror'' for
the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich, who replaces retiring Democrat John Glenn, also
steered clear of offering any opinions on the evidence against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly speaking, I'm really not going to have a lot to say on
it.''

IRAQ CHALLENGES U.S. ASSERTION OF `HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL' BOMBINGS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The confrontation with Iraq shifted from bombs to
words Monday, with the U.S. military touting the accuracy and
destructiveness of air strikes against Saddam Hussein's military
infrastructure, while Iraq claimed the onslaught killed mostly
innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corp. Gen. Anthony Zinni, field commander of bombing
campaign, said the massive operation destroyed 74 percent of its
intended targets. Among them were Iraqi military barracks,
communication stations and facilities where chemical and biological
weapons were being constructed, Zinni said.
</P>
<P>
   He displayed black and white pictures of a bombed out airfields
and facilities that he said housed Iraq's elite Republican Guard
troops, the defense ministry and the headquarters of Saddam's Baath
Party.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 cruise missiles were fired and 600 bombs dropped
during Operation Desert Fox, and 85 percent of the targets were hit
at least once during the four-day assault that ended Saturday. The
campaign also involved more than 600 sorties _ including 300 at
night _ and more than 40 ships in strike and support roles, Zinni
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen called the bombing campaign
``highly successful,'' saying the operation set Iraqi weapons
development back at least one year. Cohen also repeated warnings
that the United States would resume attacks if the Iraqi leader
continued to threaten his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to make it more difficult for Iraq to use deadly
chemical and biological chemicals against its neighbors,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz challenged the U.S.
claims, saying the bombing campaign focused not on his nation's war
making capability but on civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians were killed in hospitals, homes and schools, the same
targets U.S. bombs struck during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Aziz
said, calling such attacks ``the American way of making war.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz conceded that Republic Guard barracks were hit, killing 62
soldiers. But he said the number of civilian deaths was even
greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four days of intensive bombings with all the smart missiles
and bombs, the high-tech precision weapons, these are the real
results,'' Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows what these people are in reality,'' he added,
referring to U.S. military leaders. ``They lie. They boast. They
disinform and misinform their peole and the whole world in order to
justify a criminal policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But authorities in Iraq did not follow the past practice of
taking foreign journalists to areas of heavy civilian casualties,
leading to speculation that the number of civilian deaths was not
high.
</P>
<P>
   Zinni said the most surprising aspect of Desert Fox was the
``complete lack of resistance'' from the Iraqi military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hesitate to make a judgment why other than to say I
think that the Iraqi military is fully aware what could happen if
they reacted in any way,'' Zinni said. ``Obviously, if you turn on
a radar, react in any way, we're prepared to handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the U.S. military ``a force of stability in the
region,'' Zinni said U.S. forces remain ready to attack again
should Saddam persist with trying to build weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those in the region view him as a threat and those in
the region appreciate us being there providing a counter and a
deterrent to that threat,'' said Zinni, who heads the U.S. Central
Command, which oversees the U.S. military's Middle East operations.
``I think Saddam may have learned from this, and if he's smart, he
wouldn't want to see a repeat.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain launched the operation after
United Nations weapons inspectors reported that Iraqi forces barred
them from entering some facilities suspect in the production of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the bombing focused
solely on legitimate Iraqi military targets and successfully
undermined Saddam's war-making capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can take it from me that, along with the air
defense systems, the missile production capability, the
command-and-control system of the whole army, the special
Republican Guard were targeted particularly,'' Blair told Cable
News Network. ``And they were badly hit.''

(DW) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Jason Robert Brown, setting out to write the
music and lyrics for ``Parade'' was hard, but not for the reasons
one might expect.
</P>
<P>
   It was not because he was 24 at the time _ he is now 28 _ and
never had written a musical before. It was not because two renowned
veterans of the theater _ the Tony award-winning director Harold
Prince, who helped conceive the show, and the Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwright Alfred Uhry, who wrote its book _ had
decided to gamble on a complete unknown. Nor was it because it
would be tough for anyone to write a musical about a man who was
lynched after being wrongly convicted of murdering a teen-age girl.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult, Brown says, because he wanted to bring to life
Leo Frank, the man at the center of the play, a New York Jew
working as a superintendent at a pencil factory in Atlanta in 1913.
The character eluded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The piece had historical resonance and political resonance,
but I couldn't find a lot of personal resonance,'' said Brown in an
interview shortly before ``Parade'' opened last week at the Vivian
Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   Although critical reaction to ``Parade'' has been mixed, the
play arguably represents the most ambitious new work of the season,
given that large-scale original musicals rarely come along these
days, and that ``Parade'' deals with such weighty subjects: the
trial of a man falsely accused, the specter of anti-Semitism, the
transformation from an agrarian to industrial society, the testing
of a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parade'' also has been closely watched as part of the saga of
Livent Inc., co-producer of the show with Lincoln Center Theater;
the company recently sought bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   The production marks the joining of two forces in the theater:
Prince, whose productions have included ``Phantom of the Opera,''
``Evita'' and ``Sweeney Todd,'' and Uhry, author of ``Last Night of
Ballyhoo'' and ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Such collaborators might intimidate even the most seasoned of
composers, particularly given that Prince turned to Brown after
Stephen Sondheim turned down this project. But Brown said he felt
up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have doubts about the musical end of it,'' he said.
``I was much more concerned about the language. There was a
delicacy to the language of those times. There was a lot of
gentility and precision in the way they spoke. I'm much more a
product of spitting things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince said it was not such a leap of faith. He said he had
worked with the songwriting team of John Kander and Fred Ebb when
they were starting out, and with Sondheim in his early days as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great confidence in young people,'' Prince said.
``Jason's view of things is understandably more contemporary, and I
have more experience, more knowledge. We're good for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince's daughter, Daisy, discovered Brown's work at a piano bar
in Manhattan and brought the young composer to her father's
attention. Prince recalled being particularly impressed by a song
Brown had written about Betsy Ross. ``I thought it was
miraculous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In writing ``Parade,'' Brown worked closely with Uhry, who grew
up in Atlanta and whose great-uncle owned the pencil factory run by
Leo Frank. Just about every time Brown sat down to write a song, he
was working from a text by Uhry, whom the composer described as a
generous and kind partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leaned on Alfred to give me as much color as he could,''
Brown said. ``It was in his bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Uhry said he was impressed by how quickly Brown keyed into a
world Uhry knew so well. ``The first song he played me was `The Old
Red Hills of Home,' and he's never been in the state of Georgia,''
Uhry said. ``I got a big lump in my throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown also steeped himself in research about the Frank case and
about the period, reading newspaper articles from the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make sure I understood the idiom and the
people and the kind of rage that could make this happen in the
first place,'' Brown said. ``I implicitly understood Howard Beach,
and I implicitly understood the L.A. riots. And I guess, being
inside this particular issue, I couldn't understand Atlanta in
1913.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Leo Frank, Brown, who grew up in Rockland County, is
Jewish. He said he came late to making a personal connection to the
character. ``I didn't see Leo as being me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, Brent Carver stepped into the role of Frank
for the workshop production of ``Parade.'' Something about Carver's
interpretation of the role, which he also plays in the current
production, made Brown identify with Frank for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing Brent do it, I was finally able to put myself up
there,'' Brown said. ``I saw what he was looking for, saw what he
needed and saw that I hadn't given it to him. There was something
about the way he was closed off and bristled around people that I
really recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   Uhry said he had come to see a lot of Frank in Brown as well.
``I see a reserved person who feels like a fish out of water a lot
of the time,'' Uhry said, ``and reins in his real feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that he developed his sense of outsiderness and
reserve as a young boy. Being skipped from the middle of third
grade to the middle of fourth grade left him in a strange no man's
land of academic distinction and social alienation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids didn't want to let me into the club,'' he said. ``I spent
10 years trying to figure out where I fit into a world where
everyone was older.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 8, he asked for a piano because he wanted to grow up and
be Billy Joel. ``The minute I started doing it, I knew what I
wanted to be doing,'' Brown said. ``Sitting behind that piano, I
could express myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of college at the Eastman School of Music in
Rochester, Brown dropped out and followed a girlfriend to Miami,
where he taught at a performing arts high school. In 1990 he came
to New York, and supported himself by playing in piano bars and
middle-school productions.
</P>
<P>
   All along Brown had been writing songs. He decided to put some
of them together for cabaret singers at one of the clubs where he
played, Eighty-Eight's. One night Ms. Prince was in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   She directed the revue off-Broadway as ``Songs for a New World''
in October 1995, and the score was recorded by RCA Victor.
</P>
<P>
   There are only about 15 minutes of ``Parade'' without music. Yet
he has tackled other projects while working on ``Parade,'' like
writing the arrangements for William Finn's ``New Brain'' at
Lincoln Center and ``Dinah Was'' at the Gramercy Theater, as well
as orchestrations for ``Love's Fire'' at the Joseph Papp Public
Theater. All of which, Brown said, left him looking forward simply
to sleeping past noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone asks, `What after `Parade'?'' he said. ``And I just
sit there and stare at them.''

MOTHER SAYS FAGAN SHOULD BE TRIED IN '79 KIDNAP OF DAUGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Fla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For the first time Monday, Middlesex County District
Attorney Thomas F. Reilly and his successor, Martha Coakley, met
with Barbara Kurth in part to determine if she was willing to allow
her former husband to plead guilty to kidnapping their two
daughters 19 years ago in exchange for his avoiding jail.
</P>
<P>
   But Kurth wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob M. Atwood, the Boston attorney who represents Kurth, said
his client told prosecutors that she believes Stephen Fagan must be
punished for having taken their daughters, then 5 and 2 years old,
away from her to Florida and raising them under an assumed identity
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, however, the two daughters, Rachel, 24 and Lisa,
21, met for about an hour with the same prosecutors to make the
case on Fagan's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was expected that the young women would urge the
prosecutors to agree to the plea deal, Brian Heffron, a spokesman
for Reilly's office, declined comment on the discussions or whether
any decisions have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said that Reilly, Coakley, and assistant district
attorney Lynn Rooney did not ask Kurth her reaction to a plea
bargain. But Atwood said that Kurth opposes such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believes he should be punished for what he did, but she
believes it is up to the judicial system to decide what that
punishment should be,'' Atwood said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' meeting with Kurth, which lasted for more than
an hour, was their first with her since Fagan was arrested last
April 16 at his Palm Beach mansion and charged with kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth felt that her 75-minute meeting with the prosecutors was
``productive'' in that it provided Reilly and Coakley, who takes
over as Middlesex district attorney next month, an opportunity to
gauge her potential credibility as a witness in the case, Atwood
said.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for the trial but a previously scheduled
hearing is set for Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan has maintained that he took his daughters from their
mother's home in North Adams after a weekend visit because Kurth
was an alcoholic and neglectful of the children. Kurth has denied
that she had a drinking problem and insists that she took good care
of the children.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Reilly's office reportedly was exploring the
possibility of reaching a plea agreement with Fagan. Heffron
declined to say whether Reilly's office had scheduled the separate
meetings with Kurth and the daughters to explore such a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   In prior discussions, Richard M. Egbert of Boston, Fagan's
lawyer, has told the prosecutors that he is confident that he can
defend Fagan successfully but is willing to engage in plea bargain
negotiations to avoid a trial. Egbert declined comment on any
discussions Monday.

PROMINENT CHINESE DISSIDENTS SENTENCED TO LONG PRISON TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also CHINA-U.S., CHINA-LIU) 
(mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ By sentencing two of the country's most prominent
democracy campaigners to long prison terms, China on Monday took
its harshest steps yet in its current crackdown on organized
political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   After a trial that lasted just three and a half hours, Xu Wenli
_ at 55 the dean of the dissident movement, and a man who has
already spent 12 years in prison for advocating democracy _ was
sentenced to 13 years for ``subversion of state power.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu's alleged crimes included helping to organize a new political
party, calling for an end to Communist rule in interviews with
foreign journalists, calling for independent labor unions and,
prosecutors said, accepting $500 from a dissident abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He was defended by a lawyer who was appointed by the court just
four days ago and met his client only once.
</P>
<P>
   Also sentenced Monday, to 11 years in prison, was Wang Youcai,
32, founder of the China Democracy Party, which has now been
suppressed. Wang was tried on subversion charges on Thursday in a
brief court session, with no defense lawyer, in the eastern city of
Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   The punishment of a third veteran democracy campaigner, Qin
Yongmin, 44, has not been announced. His trial began in the central
city of Wuhan on Thursday and may reconvene on Tuesday, relatives
said. A similarly long sentence is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's sentences, which came just six months after President
Clinton's visit to Beijing, where he publicly challenged China's
leaders to move quickly toward political reform, were harshly
criticized by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   They also appeared to spell the effective end here of the China
Democracy Party, which these three men, along with hundreds of
lesser-known individuals, tried to organize in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The long sentences also crushed the hopes of many liberal
intellectuals here that China's warming relations with the United
States in recent years and its signing of global treaties on human
rights might bring a significant easing of political controls.
</P>
<P>
   Xu was tried Monday morning in the Beijing Intermediate Court.
When after a brief recess the three-judge panel announced his
13-year sentence, Xu stood up and shouted, ``I protest!'' said his
wife of 28 years, He Xintong.
</P>
<P>
   Then, said Ms. He and lawyers who were present, he shouted that
the judges were unfair and that he would not appeal his case
because the proceedings were illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   With the sentencing of Xu, China's Communist government has
silenced one of its most energetic and persistent critics, one who
has given over his adult life to the cause of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Xu first came to prominence during the Democracy Wall movement
of the late 1970s, then served 12 years in prison, much of it in
solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, sensing a new opportunity to speak
out and making constant use of fax machines and e-mail, he and Qin
tried to draw attention to China's obligations under two
international covenants it has signed _ one on economic and
cultural rights, and one on civil and political rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of several temporary detentions and stiff warnings,
they continued their activities.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, in contrast, first became involved in dissident activities
in 1989, while a graduate student in physics in Beijing, when he
became a leader of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. After the
student movement was smashed by the army, he was on the most-wanted
list, then was arrested and spent two years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's visit to China in June, Wang announced the
formation of the China Democracy Party. Hundreds around the
country, including Xu and Qin, began promoting the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But while the government has allowed somewhat freer discussion
of political topics in universities and obscure journals in the
last year, it has not allowed any challenges _ in print or in the
form of organized groups _ to the principle of Communist Party
rule.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on Friday celebrating 20 years of economic reforms,
the president and Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, emphasized
the primacy of the party, saying, ``The Western mode of political
systems must never be adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   After learning of Monday's sentences, the American Embassy here,
which has spent the last two years building improved relations
between China and the United States, issued a strong condemnation
of what it termed the ``deplorable decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply disappointed with both the guilty verdicts and
the extremely harsh sentences,'' the statement said. ``No
individual should be arrested, tried and sentenced for exercising
internationally recognized freedoms, including those guaranteed in
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which
China has committed itself.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like Thursday's trials, both of which proceeded with no defense
attorneys because prospective lawyers had been warned off by police
or detained, Monday's proceeding showed that in cases involving
security issues, police and courts could write their own rules.
</P>
<P>
   According to the criminal procedure law, defendants are to be
notified at least 10 days before a trial, but Xu was told only four
days ago that his trial would be Monday. His wife, who until Monday
had not been allowed to contact him since his arrest on Nov. 30,
was told three days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, defendants also have the right to a lawyer of
their choice, but Xu was assigned a lawyer by the court late last
week. Before Monday morning's trial, the lawyer, Mo Shaoping, saw
his client only for one brief meeting, an associate of Mo's said.
</P>
<P>
   Xu's wife refused to meet the lawyer before the trial. ``Meeting
him would be tantamount to cooperating with the whole charade,''
she said in a telephone interview this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the accusations during Monday morning's trial,
Xu's lawyer argued that Xu had engaged in the peaceful expression
of his own views and that this could not amount to subversive
activities against the state, an associate of the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a decision that was clearly preordained, the court
declared Xu guilty and sentenced him to spend what may be much of
the rest of his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1943 in the southeastern province of Jiangxi, Xu was
interested in politics even as a teen-ager, his wife said. In the
1960s, as an idealistic Marxist, he decided to get his learning in
society rather than attend a university.
</P>
<P>
   He served in the navy for five years, then became an electrician
with the Beijing railroad before becoming involved with the
democracy movement and going to prison.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, in a police station hours after the trial
finished, Xu was allowed a half-hour with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he'd be able to handle the pain,'' she later
recounted in a telephone interview. ``He said that this would give
him time to think things over and calmly reflect on what has
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. He, who has been married to Xu since 1971, said she expected
to see him in monthly visits to prison. The couple has a daughter,
Xu Jin, who is a graduate student in fine arts at Boston
University.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier interview, soon after her husband was arrested on
Nov. 30, Ms. He said Xu had told her, ``I can't change the way I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   If he received a long sentence, he told his wife, she should go
on and enjoy her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I die,'' Xu said as they parted that day, ``please
plant a tree for me.''

 &HT;        CLINTON'S LEGAL DEFENSE FUND GETS STEADY DONATIONS, BUT
LEGAL FEES GROW   By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 21, -- The impeachment process could not only
cost President Bill Clinton his job, but also a small fortune in
legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons already owe $7 million and counting in lawyer's
bills from the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and Whitewater
land deal investigation, according to Tony Essaye, executive
director of the Clinton Legal Expense Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone with those kind of legal fees would be
incredibly concerned,'' said Essaye, who oversees a trust of
private donations collected to help pay for the Clintons' legal
costs. ``We are doing the best we can to meet this enormous
potential burden to the Clintons. We are cautiously optimistic
about what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The trust had raised only $2.2 million as of August, the last
time numbers were made available.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the White House and Essaye said they didn't know
yet how much the impeachment process has cost Clinton in personal
legal fees. They also could not estimate the cost of a Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In his official capacity, Clinton is represented by the White
House counsel, which is paid for by taxpayers, Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton must pay fees to his private lawyer, David Kendall,
whom he hired to assist the White House counsel in defending him,
Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
   The government will wind up paying most costs related to the
impeachment process. But if the $900,000 the House Judiciary
Committee spent pursuing Clinton in the impeachment inquiry alone
is any indication, he will have to pay plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's insurance policy paid off the $850,000 settlement in
the Paula Jones case, according to a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the presidential legal bill was $6 million. The trust
had collected $2.2 million dollars and paid out 1.25 million to the
president's lawyers, Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president would have to pay any amount leftover from what
we could not pay,'' Essaye said. ``Of course, the president could
always make money doing lectures and appearances when he leaves
office. But I think there is a better use of his time.''
</P>
<P>
   During the impeachment process, the trust has received a
``steady flow of donations,'' from individuals allowed to
contribute up to $10,000 a year. Essaye said the trust received
calls from folks concerned with Clinton's bills.
</P>
<P>
   Essaye would not release information about how much money has
been raised since August and said the next figures would be made
available in February.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the trust, Richard M. Lucas, said he was
confident the donations would ``substantially'' reduce the amount
owed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's approval rating has been high and people want
to help him,'' Lucas said. ``There have been no peaks or valleys in
donations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said he didn't think Clinton's impeachment battle needed
publicity. The direct mailings soliciting donations for Clinton's
legal bills don't mention it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donors are well aware of what they [the Clintons] are going
through.'' Lucas said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the fullest military assessment since the
bombing of Iraq ended, the American commander who led four days of
strikes said Monday that American and British forces hit 85 percent
of their targets and badly damaged the Republican Guards.
</P>
<P>
   While there were no signs of an uprising against President
Saddam Hussein in the wake of the attack, as some planners had
hoped, the commander, Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni, said the
strikes had weakened the Baghdad government, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   He noted Iraq's decision on the eve of the strikes, which began
last Wednesday, to divide the country into four military zones. He
said such a step appeared aimed as much at quashing internal
dissent as defending the country from American and British missile
and air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to make a judgment, I would say that was for
internal control,'' Zinni said. ``And I would point to that one
very open and obvious move on his part as maybe an indication he
lacks confidence in his own ability to continue to ruthlessly
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   After he spoke, the Pentagon issued its most detailed assessment
of the damage. Although the first incomplete assessments showed
modest success, Monday's data showed 43 of 100 targets had been
severely damaged or destroyed, while 30 received moderate damage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 12 targets suffered only light damage, and at least 13
suffered none at all. Most of these were surface-to-air missile
batteries that are easily moved. Zinni said the analysts who decide
how badly targets are damaged are by necessity conservative in
their estimates.
</P>
<P>
   He also said targets that appeared only slightly damaged can in
fact suffer greatly. As an example he showed an aerial photograph
of the headquarters of Saddam's Baath Party. It had holes punched
in its roof but was otherwise still standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our analysts would say this is moderate or light
damage,'' he said. ``But I guarantee you, nobody is working this
morning in Baath Party headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   That has not diminished Iraq's invective. Ever since the raids
stopped, Saddam's deputies have responded with defiance, declaring
both a military and moral victory and vowing never to resume
cooperation with United Nations weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said the attacks
had very little effect on Iraq's military, killing only 62
``martyrs'' in the entire military and only 38 in the Republican
Guard units that were a focus of four nights of bombings.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to confirm Iraq's assertions on casualties, but
Zinni did not dispute them. ``We are not in the business of body
counting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did confirm that the Republican Guards had abandoned their
barracks and headquarters before the strikes began, presumably
tipped off that an attack was imminent when the U.N. weapons
inspectors withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Zinni said the attacks focused on the bases and equipment of
four Republican Guard divisions and caused significant damage. He
also emphasized the impact of the destruction of barracks and
headquarters _ ``pretty tough,'' he said, ``if you're a troop in
the field and you've got no place to go home to at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the campaign underscored the limits of air and missile
strikes _ even one that proved to be the largest against Iraq since
the Gulf War ended in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said the strikes accomplished the
relatively limited objective of ``degrading'' Iraq's ability to
threaten its neighbors and to produce nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons, without losing any American or British troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you measure that as a victory in any way,''
Zinni said. ``I think our friends in the region and others clearly
look at what happened to Iraq and realize that Saddam suffered a
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   But the attack has ended what the administration considered the
best way to monitor Iraq's military activities: the United Nations
inspectors. And Saddam is as defiant as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the attack has come at a steep cost. The United States
spent $2 billion last year on its forces in the Persian Gulf; this
attack will add hundreds of millions more. Zinni said it was too
early to estimate the cost of the campaign, but each of the 400 or
so cruise missiles the United States used alone costs an average of
$1 million.

PANEL TO URGE REVAMP OF CHILD-RESTRAINT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Eight months after a teenager died while being subdued
by workers in a group home, a panel of law enforcement and human
service professionals has found state policies on restraining
children and adolescents to be ``almost devoid of any standard of
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday a task force will call on Massachusetts officials to do
a much better job of monitoring and guiding children's residential
programs on the use of restraints.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary William D. O'Leary convened
the task force in response to the death on April 29 of Mark Soares,
16, of Hyde Park. A spokesman for O'Leary said the secretary will
carry out the task force's recommendations, which are meant to cut
down on the use of restraints and injuries resulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will make Massachusetts a leader nationally on the issue
of restraints,'' said Larry Swartz an aid to O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   However, Michael Weekes, director of the Massachusetts Council
of Human Service Providers, said the focus of the task force was
too narrow, failing to examine the forces that have fueled the use
of restraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have become more violent and staff are less trained,''
said Weekes.
</P>
<P>
   State regulations will be revamped next spring to allow mental
health, mental retardation, juvenile justice and social service
programs to use physical force to temporarily immobilize children
only in instances when the children are endangering themselves or
other people. Current regulations also allow children to be subdued
if they are causing property damage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the programs will have to begin filing quarterly
reports with the state, detailing how often restraints were applied
and resulted in injuries. The state also will conduct formal
reviews if a child or worker is repeatedly involved restraints to
ensure the child is in the appropriate program and the worker has
been properly trained.
</P>
<P>
   Up to this point, programs have only had to report to the state
instances where the use of restraints led to injuries requiring
medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years the state has confirmed 20 instances when
children and adolescents were hurt while being placed or held in
restraints. Most suffered bloody noses, bruises and broken limbs
and noses. Three of them died, including Soares.
</P>
<P>
   A medical examiner ruled that Soares died of neck injuries he
sustained while be restrained by workers at the Wayside Carriage
House, a Marlborough group home for troubled youth under contract
with the state.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a judge who presided over the inquest into the death
of Soares concluded the workers, Jason Childs and Michael Comforti,
had not acted with ``criminal negligence'' as they struggled to
control Soares.
</P>
<P>
   But the inquest report by Judge John S. McCann revealed a series
of troubling events leading up to Soares' death.
</P>
<P>
   After Soares punched and head-butted Childs, Childs wrapped his
arm around Soares' neck, periodically lifting the teen off the
floor as he pushed him back toward a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Although the headlock was prohibited by Wayside and has been
barred by O'Leary, the judge believed Childs had no other way to
try to control Soares at that point.
</P>
<P>
   The headlock lasted only ten to 30 seconds, but was applied with
enough force to damage the neck artery leading to Soares' head,
causing the teen's blood pressure to drop. He was able to speak,
but had only minutes left to live unless he received medical
attention.
</P>
<P>
   After Childs wrestled the teen onto the floor face-down, the
worker placed his upper body on Soares' back and ``hyperextended''
his neck by holding his head about eight inches off the floor.
Although Childs did not realize it, those two moves, which impeded
the teen's breathing, in combination with the neck injury proved
fatal, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   During the restraint, Childs and other workers had a discussion
about whether Soares was breathing, with Childs concluding the teen
was playing possum.
</P>
<P>
   Before falling silent, Soares cried in an increasingly weak
voice, ``I can't breathe...I can't breathe...Please stop.'' But
Childs, who was lying on top of him, did not hear the cries,
according to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   While the task force did not examine the specific circumstances
of Soares' death, it called on residential providers to train their
staff on how to properly monitor a child's breathing during
restraint and to treat distress as a medical rather than behavioral
issue.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 different types of restraint techniques are in use
in Massachusetts, some widely recognized, others the creation of
individual programs. The panel urged the state to consult medical
specialists to find out which techniques are dangerous, and to hold
annual conferences to inform providers about safe restraint
techniques and methods for preventing the need for restraints in
the first place.

 &HT;    Coaching carousel spins on
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was 1989 when Steve Spurrier first realized that
being a lame-duck coach was for the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before leading Duke into the All-America Bowl, Spurrier
told his players that he had accepted an offer to return to
Florida, his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mistake,'' Spurrier said. ``A big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   During the game, Spurrier caught one of the Blue Devils loafing
and gave the guy an earful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just looked at me and smiled,'' Spurrier said. ``I could
see it in his eyes. `Hey, I don't have to listen to you. You're not
my coach anymore.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Spurrier gave Gators assistant coaches Bob Stoops and
Carl Franks his blessing earlier this month when they were hired as
head coaches at Kansas State and Duke, respectively. They offered
to remain longer and contribute to Florida's preparation for the
Jan. 2 Orange Bowl against Syracuse, but Spurrier said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told them that they needed to concentrate on their new
teams,'' he said. ``We have plenty of good coaches around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier's problem has become an all-too-familiar one in college
football this time of year. The bowl preparation time of December
is also the time of greatest movement of coaches from one job to
another. With less than a month before a bowl game, schools find
themselves without key assistants or, in some case, no head coach.
It puts both the schools and the coaches in an uncomfortable
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches, at least most of them, want to do right by their old
employer, particularly if that school is playing in a big bowl
game. But the new employer usually is offering a significant salary
increase and wants the new coach on the road recruiting and
rebuilding the program.
</P>
<P>
   In this season's national championship game, No. 1 Tennessee
(12-0) plays No. 2 Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4.
without its offensive coordinator. David Cutcliffe resigned after
the SEC championship game on Dec. 5 to become the new coach at
Mississippi. Running backs coach Randy Sanders, 33, has received
the job on a permanent basis. Having to replace a coordinator on
the eve of one of the biggest games in school history should be a
stressful proposition, but coach Phillip Fulmer insists that it
will not be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy played quarterback at Tennessee and has been coaching
running backs and wide receivers ever since, so he knows our
system,'' Fulmer said. ``I may get a little more involved in
special situations now, but I have complete confidence in Randy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer was a little miffed that Ole Miss hired Cutcliffe on the
eve of the SEC championship game, but he understood that he would
not have his good friend for the Fiesta Bowl. It is the nature of
the profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that sooner or later David would become a head coach,
because he was ready,'' Fulmer said. ``We will miss him, but in
this case all we can do is wish him well.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Orange fans might not be so gracious should Tennessee be
unable to move the ball against Florida State, which wields the
nation's No. 1 defense. Tulane (11-0) will not be playing for a
championship when it takes on BYU in the Dec. 31 Liberty Bowl. But
the Green Wave will be going for its first undefeated season since
1931, which is a big deal for a school that has struggled as much
as Tulane. But Tulane will be without Tommy Bowden, who left to
become coach at Clemson. Assistant head coach Rich Rodriguez, the
offensive coordinator, was the choice of players and some boosters,
but athletics director Sandy Barbour picked Georgia assistant head
coach Chris Scelfo, a native of New Iberia, La.
</P>
<P>
   Since being tapped for the job on Dec. 7, Scelfo has been
scrambling to assemble a staff, get them out recruiting and prepare
the current team to play one of the biggest games in school
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough, because our kids have been through a lot in
just a few days,'' said Scelfo, whose brother, Frank, already was a
member of the Tulane staff. ``There's no question that this whole
thing is disruptive, and the ones who get hurt the most are the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting calendar is one of the pressures causing coaches
to move in December. Coaches can begin direct contact with recruits
on Dec. 1, and the pressure is tremendous on new coaches to hit the
road recruiting for the new school immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Once a new coach is in place, it creates a domino effect
throughout the coaching profession as he tries to assemble a staff.
</P>
<P>
   Help may be on the way. Grant Teaff, the executive director of
the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), says his group is
working on a plan that would keep coaches on campus more in
December, when their teams need them most. The AFCA hopes that the
result will be that schools won't feel pressured to hire a new
coach immediately. The goal is for schools to wait until after the
bowls before raiding the staffs of other schools. ``There's too
much pressure on the school and certainly too much pressure on the
coaches,'' Teaff said. ``It's not healthy for the profession. We
hope to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaff's group plans to submit its proposal to the NCAA early
next year. Given the current legislative structure of the NCAA, any
meaningful change is probably a year away.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the coaching merry-go-round continues. Each
opening filled creates an opening somewhere else, where another
group of players will be disappointed and maybe even disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's part of the profession, but sometimes our players
get caught in the shuffle in this thing,'' Scelfo said. ``All of us
need to remember that.''

   NEW YORK _ When it comes to spreading seasonal cheer, Santa
Claus isn't alone. As he has annually since 1985, this is the time
of year when Peter Schickele sets up satirical shop at Carnegie
Hall in the guise of the zany professor who unearthed the works of
P.D.Q. Bach, ``the oddest of Johann Sebastian Bach's 20-odd
children.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's concert is titled ``Songs My Mother Wouldn't Teach
Me the Words To'' and is scheduled for two performances, at 2 p.m.
Sunday and 8 p.m. next Tuesday. The program features the ``leeric''
tenor Archie Worley, the New York Pickup Ensemble, the
``semi-conductor'' Kenneth Jean, and such P.D.Q. masterworks as
``Einstein on the Fritz'' and ``The Abduction of Figaro.''

   NEW YORK _ Theodore Mann, who joined with Jose Quintero to
restore the reputation of Eugene O'Neill with their Circle in the
Square revival of ``The Iceman Cometh'' in 1956, will receive the
O'Neill Society's medal for his ``monumental contributions'' to the
playwright's work. With Circle in the Square, Mann produced 14
O'Neill plays.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony will take place when the society meets for four
days beginning on Jan. 7 in Bermuda, where representatives of 10
countries will deliver scholarly papers, see performances and hear
music associated with the Nobel Prize-winning playwright. Another
medal will be awarded, to Joy Bluck Waters, who owns and restored
Spithead, the Bermuda house where O'Neill worked on ``Strange
Interlude,'' ``Lazarus Laughed'' and ``Marco Millions'' in the
mid-1920s.

GOP MODERATES COULD HOLD KEY TO SHIFT TO CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's prospects of avoiding a lengthy
impeachment trial improved slightly Monday as a senior Republican
senator from New England expressed preliminary support for a
censure alternative that could cut short the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that some other moderate GOP lawmakers from the region
might follow, Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island said in an
interview that censure ultimately could ``be a very attractive
alternative'' to a protracted Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee's comments came after Senator James M. Jeffords,
Republican of Vermont, expressed reservations over the weekend even
about trying Clinton on the House-approved impeachment charges of
perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from his sexual affair
with the former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   With formal impeachment proceedings all but certain to begin
next month in the Senate, Chafee and Jeffords are critical to the
White House goal of gaining enough support to strike a censure deal
to resolve the crisis short of a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   If all 45 Senate Democrats united behind a censure plan, they
would need only six Republicans to forge a majority that could
dismiss the House articles and end the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, who served as Navy secretary under President Richard M.
Nixon before he entered the Senate in 1976, stressed that there is
no alternative to starting the impeachment proceedings. But, he
said, ``It may well be that as we go along that censure would be a
very attractive alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   The developments unfolded as Senate officials prepared for the
historic proceedings, the White House pondered its public relations
and legal defense strategies, and Vice President Al Gore appealed
to his former Senate colleagues to strike ``a fair, bipartisan
compromise'' to censure the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his first full business day as the only impeached
president since 1868 by consulting with Senator Edward M. Kennedy,
one of the most influential Democrats on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agenda was Kennedy's concern about advancing
education, health care, and New England fisheries interests in the
administration's budget for the next fiscal year, the conversation
turned to impeachment during the 30-minute meeting at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator emphasized his intention to do all that he could
to see that the Senate deals with this issue fairly and
expeditiously,'' according to sources familiar with the
conversation. The sources would not discuss the president's private
comments to Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential support from Chafee and Jeffords for a
censure plan, the White House suffered a widely anticipated setback
Monday when Senator Robert C. Byrd, the Senate's senior Democrat,
voiced his opposition to any censure proposal involving White House
participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the good of our nation, there must be no `deal' involving
the White House or any entity beyond the current membership of the
US Senate,'' Byrd said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a former Senate majority leader, will be a pivotal figure
in the impeachment proceedings because senators in both parties
consider him the leading constitutional scholar in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take my cues from Senator Byrd,'' said Senator
Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who will control much of the
proceedings as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee. ``I think
he's the expert,'' McConnell said of Byrd on NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said: ``Whether there is a trial or whether there is some
other solution, that decision must be made by senators, and it must
be bipartisan or it will have absolutely no credibility with the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, buoyed by a joint call for censure Monday by
former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, stepped up its
pursuit for the alternative resolution, even as Clinton's lawyers
weighed a wide of range of defense strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main focus is trying to bring this to a bipartisan closure
promptly,'' said James Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House
counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore continued to expand his role as a chief
advocate for Clinton's censure despite the prospect of fallout from
the Lewinsky matter tainting his bid for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do hope that the United States Senate will rise to this
moment, as it so often does, to be the voice of reason,
deliberation, and healing that America needs,'' Gore said in
appealing for a censure alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the Senate will, therefore, forge a fair bipartisan
compromise to end this matter promptly and to end it in a way that
will respect the will and the wisdom of the American people,'' said
Gore, who served in the Senate from 1984 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refrained from commenting publicly on his impeachment
crisis, focusing instead on budget meetings, commemorating the 10th
anniversary of the Pan Am 103 disaster, and visiting a Washington
soup kitchen to promote community service.
</P>
<P>
   But the president continues to consult regularly with former
Senator George S. Mitchell of Maine about strategies to resolve the
impeachment proceedings, according to White House spokesman, Joseph
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   The two current Maine senators, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan M.
Collins, are moderate Republicans who are central to the White
House strategy to forge a bipartisan compromise. But neither has
taken a public position on censure, and both declined comment
Monday about the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords appears to have made the strongest statement of any
Senate Republican about the preference for censure. ``I would hope,
perhaps, we could reach consensus so that a trial wouldn't be
necessary,'' Jeffords told the Sunday Rutland Herald. ``It seems to
be an awful low bar for impeaching future presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry said he is ``certainly open to a
reasonable approach.'' But Kerry indicated he is focusing on
challenging the impeachment charges within the Senate proceedings.
``It seems to me we should consider right up front whether we can
have a motion for summary judgment,'' or dismissal, he said. ``In
other words to determine up front whether these facts at their
worst rise to the level of an impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton received surprise support for censure from
four House Republicans who voted for impeachment: Representatives
Sherwood L. Boehlert and Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, Michael N.
Castle of Delaware, and James C. Greenwood of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, the four
wrote: ``We urge you to allow the Senate to consider strong censure
as a remedy. We are not convinced, and do not want our votes
interpreted to mean that we view removal from office as the only
reasonable conclusion of this case.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday accepted
the inevitability of his government's downfall, striking a deal
with the political opposition to hold new elections sometime next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, an overwhelming majority of the parliament,
including Netanyahu, voted to dissolve his foundering government
after an unexpected last-minute effort by the prime minister to
establish a unity government failed.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, before a chaotic session of parliament even
began, both sides agreed to withdraw a scheduled vote of
no-confidence in the government, which, by law, would have
propelled them into early elections in 60 days _ too soon for
anyone's taste.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they switched procedural tactics to dissolve rather
than to topple the government, entering furious negotiations on the
election date, although none was set on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis immediately moved forward into what is bound to be
a turbulent campaign, with battles for leadership on both the right
and the center-left. As early as Tuesday, it is expected that
members of Netanyahu's Likud Party will come forward to challenge
him. It is also expected that a new center party, as yet unnamed
and undeclared, possibly headed by the popular army former chief of
staff, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, will emerge to chip away at support for
the two major parties, Likud and Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Almost certainly, the political fallout will extend to the
American-brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, which
President Clinton tried to salvage in a diplomatic mission here
last week. To the fury of Palestinians, the Israelis are likely to
maintain their freeze on compliance with the land-for-security
peace plan until after elections are held, sometime between March
and May.
</P>
<P>
   While the Palestinians issued a statement on Monday night
imploring the Israelis to honor their commitments, some expressed
hope at the prospect of a new Israeli leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression among Palestinians is that any change is better
than the current situation,'' said Ziyad Abu Amr, a Palestinian
legislator. ``There is a freeze anyway, and if this means that in a
few months there could be a hope of implementation, then
Palestinians can live with it, although the uncertainty will be
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In a televised speech to parliament that came across as the
opening salvo in his election campaign, Netanyahu chose to present
his defeat as a failure of parliament rather than his own. As he
was furiously heckled by left and right, he predicted that he would
be re-elected prime minister because, he said, a majority of
Israelis, if not the members of parliament, support his tough
stance toward the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you replace the people or you replace the parliament,''
he said. ``And I agree to replace the parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Israeli system, the prime minister and the parliament
are directly elected by popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   It was a raucous day in parliament, in which the political
situation evolved and devolved by the hour. Several times, Dan
Tichon, the speaker, threw up his hands and shouted, ``Wait a
minute. What's going on here?''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the parliament rejected Netanyahu's last-minute
plea for a 72-hour delay in which to explore the possibility of a
national unity government, 81 of 120 members of parliament voted to
bring down the government, two years before its term expires.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the bill, sponsored by the Labor Party, requires a
second and third reading, both expected next week. But the vote
cast on Monday night, which ultimately came as no surprise,
launched the election season, into which Netanyahu promised to
gallop like ``a stallion racing to battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the vote was taken, posters went up across Israel on
Monday carrying the Labor Party's campaign message, designed by
American political strategists for its leader, Ehud Barak. ``One
Israel,'' the billboards said, ``for the sake of everyone and not
just the extremists.'' This message attempts to strike at a
perception held by many Israelis that Netanyahu has often acceded
to the will of the far right in order to keep his governing
coalition together.
</P>
<P>
   After he signed a peace agreement with the Palestinians in
October, Netanyahu's right-wing coalition fell apart. In the last
few weeks, the prime minister was seen to have lurched rightward
once more, seeking to regain support as he issued ultimatums to the
Palestinians following an upsurge in violent unrest in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last week, citing what he said were a host of Palestinian
violations of the most recent peace accord, Netanyahu chose to
disregard the agreement's timetable, refusing to transfer a chunk
of the West Bank to Palestinian control as the schedule demanded.
His Cabinet endorsed the freeze on Sunday, setting a slate of
conditions _ some of them unlikely ever to be accepted _ that the
Palestinians must meet before the freeze is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding at times as if he were campaigning against the
Palestinians themselves, Netanyahu told the parliament, ``Members
of the Palestinian Authority are saying ``Peace,'' in English, but
in Arabic they continue to say, ``Jihad,'' or Holy War.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I promise you that Arafat is the first person who
thinks any alternative is better than Netanyahu.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Netanyahu is believed to favor holding elections at the
end of April, just days before May 4. That is the date when Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, has threatened to make a unilateral
declaration of Palestinian statehood, especially if Israeli
compliance with the peace agreement remains stalled. Netanyahu is
believed to think he can capitalize on Israeli fears of that
declaration.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN START HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the prime minister's premise that he is their only
alternative, leaders of the Jewish settlers' movement, who oppose
any territorial compromise, have returned to his camp in the last
few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I end up preferring Benjamin Netanyahu to Ehud Barak even
though he made the decision to retreat from Judea and Samaria,''
Pinchas Wallerstein, a movement leader, said, using the Biblical
term for the West Bank. ``It's not even a guess that Ehud Barak
will turn over even more land, so what are we going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The same begrudging support came from the few members of
parliament willing to express their support for the prime minister.
``Democracy does not give out many alternatives, and Bibi Netanyahu
is the best we can do for this period,'' said Naomi Blumenthal, a
member of the Likud, using Netanyahu's nickname.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Benny Begin, a former minister under
Netanyahu and a harsh critic within his own party, shouted out
during his speech, ``I ask for the prime minister to tell the truth
to the parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dalia Itzik, a member of Labor, cried out in retort, ``What
kind of request is that? You've got to be kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is considered to a master campaigner, while Barak, a
former army chief of staff, has been faulted for coming across as
overly intellectual and wooden.
</P>
<P>
   The real wild card in the upcoming race, however, belongs to
Lipkin-Shahak, another former chief of staff. He is likely to come
forward as the candidate for a new center party that is being
organized by Dan Meridor, the former finance minister, and Roni
Milo, the former mayor of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Lipkin-Shahak, who has beaten both Netanyahu and Barak in polls,
has yet to be tested in political combat. He has not yet even
resigned from the army, although that is expected to on Tuesday,
after which he is required either to wait 100 days to enter
politics or to win a special dispensation from the Israeli
president to enter sooner.
</P>
<P>
   He draws part of his political appeal from the perception that
he is above the fray, but that perception may stem in large measure
from army regulations that have prevented him from stating his
political views until he resigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shahak's advantage in public opinion polls is composed of
three parts,'' wrote Nahum Barnea, a political columnist for the
Yediot Ahronoth newspaper. ``He is far from the political mud; his
opinions have not been revealed; and he instills calm and
credibility against the backdrop of a loathsome and screaming
political body.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who has urged Lipkin-Shahak to join forces with him, is
reportedly pushing for elections to be held in late March _ based
partly on a calculation that, by then, the general's popularity
will have dimmed somewhat after he has been forced to present and
defend himself and his views.
</P>
<P>
   Sketching out his political platform for the first time on
Monday night, Barak endorsed carrying out the peace agreement,
which calls for Israeli withdrawal from about 40 percent of the
West Bank. But he said his ultimate vision, reflecting what he said
was a popular consensus, consisted of ``physical separation''
between the Israelis and the Palestinians _ ``us here, them
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only such a physical separation will bring peace and mutual
respect,'' he said.

CONNECTICUT SEEKS TO INSURE UNSOLD SEAT LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Connecticut is shopping worldwide for an insurance
policy to cover as much as $13 million annually in unsold luxury
seats the state has guaranteed at the planned New England Patriots
stadium in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The state's insurance agent is soliciting competitive bids for a
policy that could cost as much as $5 million a year for financial
protection on vacant club seats and luxury suites.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an inquiry from the state that said we have this
exposure, can it be insured,'' said the agent, Fred Tanguay, a vice
president at the Hartford-based R. C. Knox &AMP; Co. ``I went out into
the market, and I am still out in the marketplace, talking to
numerous companies. In fact, there is a certain level of interest
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there is no deadline and no urgency for the state
seeking proposals. However, although the target date for the $375
million stadium opening is 2001, a decision to purchase a policy
must be made well before then.
</P>
<P>
   If there are indications corporate support for suites is soft,
potential underwriters may smell more of a risk and increase the
premium prices. In simpler terms, it would be like looking for an
insurance policy after the car accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the insurance capital of the world, it would not be
unusal that one of the domestic companies here would have an
interest,'' Tanguay said. ``But it being of a competitive bidding
nature, it's going to be best price, best coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The otherwise unlikely confluence of insurance and sports is
becoming less so in Hartford, home to some of the largest and most
well-known insurers in the world _ including Travelers and Aetna.
The city even has the chairman of Pheonix Mutual Home Life
Insurance Co. heading up the $1 billion Adriaen's Landing urban
redevelopment project, of which the stadium would be part.
</P>
<P>
   But while the state has insured halfcourt prize shots at
University of Connecticut basketball games, this could be one of
the more complicated and interesting policies ever taken out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most unusual,'' Tanguay said.
</P>
<P>
   The premium range, likely between $1 million and $5 million,
will depend on whether the policy offers full coverage and what the
deductible is set at. Anything costing more than $5 million would
not be prudent for the state, Tanguay said.
</P>
<P>
   Potential underwriters are looking at National Football League
market analyses from seven other areas to evaluate the price of
club seats, how many are sold, economic demographics, population,
wealth, corporate vibrancy.
</P>
<P>
   To make a decision, insurers will have to weigh the probability
of selling 6,000 club seats at $4,000 apiece and as much as 150
luxury suites at $100,000 a piece, given all those factors in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the type of things that go into it,'' Tanguay added.
``It's not a typical type of exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one company is publicly known to be negotiating for
the policy. That is General Star Indemnity, based in Stamford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an insurable interest and there's the potential for
an unexpected and unintended loss, then you can generally insure
it,'' said Kevin Brooks, president of General Star, which insures
hole-in-one golf contests, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Tanguay said the policy would be some form of a contingent
liability, meaning all or part of the state's exposure would be
covered if the seats are not sold.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the popular parlance of Hartford, he added: ``The
discussions are along the lines of terms, conditions, deductables,
co-insurance.''

CANADIAN INMATE'S CASE CHALLENGES LEGALITY OF TEXAS BOARD'S
CLEMENCY PROCEDURES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Defending the procedures of the State Board of
Pardons and Paroles, Chairman Victor Rodriguez sparred verbally
with a death row lawyer in federal court Monday and was admonished
by the judge to give ``yes or no answers'' and to avoid ``making
speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   One exchange came when Rodriguez was being questioned by Sandra
Babcock, attorney for Joseph Stanley Faulder, a 61-year-old
Canadian who has been on death row since 1977. Does the board
conduct investigations to verify the truthfulness of information
that goes into an inmate's clemency petition file, she asked?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to ask you something,'' Rodriguez responded. ``What
do you mean by investigation? Before I leave the courtroom, I'd
like to have some idea what you mean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the witness, I'm the lawyer,'' Babcock said. ``You
don't get to question me.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks, who issued a temporary
restraining order two weeks ago that stayed the execution of
Faulder and another inmate, weighed in on her side.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't question the lawyers,'' he told Rodriguez, who has
appeared testy at times in the past few weeks as the parole board
has been bombarded with lawsuits challenging the legality of its
clemency procedures.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 30, state District Judge Paul Davis, ruling in a
class-action lawsuit filed by condemned prisoners, found that the
parole board's procedures violate the state constitution and the
Open Meetings Act. He ordered the board to begin holding public
meetings to deliberate clemency petitions, to vote in public and to
record the reasons for their votes.
</P>
<P>
   When that order was blocked by the state Supreme Court,
attorneys for Faulder, who was convicted of murdering an elderly
East Texas woman in 1975, and Danny Lee Barber, 43, who was
sentenced to die for beating and stabbing to death a Dallas-area
woman in 1979, challenged the state's clemency process in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder and Barber were scheduled to die on consecutive days
early this month, but were spared by Sparks, who ruled that it is
``difficult to determine what the Texas (clemency) law is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the court knows for certain is that the plaintiff filed a
petition for clemency and the board voted against clemency. The
record is void of any reason for the board's action. The board
identifies no procedures to avoid arbitrary and capricious
determinations of clemency decisions that otherwise fail to comport
with due process. It is unclear how the board can document that its
procedures are not arbitrary if it does not document its procedures
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, the 18-member parole board had not held
meetings to discuss clemency actions. The petitions are sent by air
express and fax to each member, who cast a ballot by fax.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, two state courts have ruled that failing to
record votes and the reasons for them violated the state
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock, arguing that it is also a violation of the U.S.
Constitution's guarantee of ``minimal due process,'' questioned
Rodriguez about the board's refusal to record the reasons for its
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Turning combative once more, Rodriguez said, ``We do give a
reason for the decision. We tell you that we did not recommend
clemency because a majority of the board members would not vote to
recommend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, Sparks interrupted the testimony and drew muffled
laughter when he invoked recent presidential testimony:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give that answer again,'' he said. ``To me, that is like
asking what `is' is or what `alone' means.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was on the witness stand for less than an hour before
the noon recess. Before leaving the bench, the judge instructed him
to give ``yes or no answers'' when his testimony resumed and to
avoid making speeches in response to the attorneys' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Through the day, Sparks frequently interrupted lawyers who filed
the lawsuit to remind them that the hearing was concerned with only
one issue: Did Faulder and Barber receive ``minimal due process''
from the parole board?
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that until last March, clemency was an executive
prerogative, not a judicial matter, but the law changed with a
Supreme Court opinion in a lawsuit brought by an Ohio inmate
against that state's clemency process.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no constitutional right to clemency, the high
court ruled, ``some minimal procedural safeguards apply to clemency
proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks will hear another day of testimony Tuesday and then
decide whether to issue a preliminary injunction against the parole
board.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, there is a growing belief in the Capital
that the way the parole board operates will be altered by
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Elliott Naishtat, who had filed two bills to reform
the board's procedures, attended part of Monday's hearing and
predicted that the system will become more open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pardon and parole board is an established government body
that should comply with existing state law,'' he said.

ADVERTISING: FOR SCOTCH, OUT WITH STODGY, IN WITH COOL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.Y., N.J.)   (jw) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like your scotch neat? On the rocks? Pretension, be gone. A new
campaign portrays it as way cool.
</P>
<P>
   A brand perceived as stolid, even stodgy, has hired an upstart
agency for an infusion of what is hoped will be a hipper, more
irreverent attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Gyro Worldwide in Philadelphia has become the agency in the
United States for the Glenfiddich brand of single-malt Scotch
whisky, distilled and sold by the British company William Grant &AMP;
Sons Ltd. The assignment for the rest of the world remains at
McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York, part of the
McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign that was created by McCann, calling Glenfiddich ``the
Friday Scotch,'' ran ``for about three years and delivered some
solid numbers,'' said Mark Teasdale, senior vice president and
marketing director at the American unit of Grant, William Grant &AMP;
Sons Inc. in Edison, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``It moved the needle for us, but a little slower than we
liked,'' he said. ``So we decided to be a little more aggressive''
and talked to several ``small, independent shops'' before choosing
Gyro.
</P>
<P>
   The assignment is indicative of a trend whereby several large
marketers have awarded parts of their accounts to smaller agencies
with creative reputations while maintaining ties with the behemoth
shops on their rosters. Among those marketers are Anheuser-Busch,
Kellogg, Philip Morris, Sony, Texaco and Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   Gyro is known for provocative campaigns aimed at consumers in
their 20s and 30s for such products as clothing, alcoholic
beverages and cigarettes. Critics have complained that the agency
courts controversy to gain attention for its work; an ad it created
for a clothing retailer, Zipper Head, for example, showed Charles
Manson with the headline ``Everyone has the occasional urge to go
wild and do something completely outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   One current Gyro campaign is for the Red Kamel cigarette brand
sold by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings.
The ads, in the ``retro chic'' vein, present such implausible
images of World War II as an all-women rifle corps clad in khaki
skirts and shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to a fresh perspective, a different attitude
than what a more traditional ad agency would come up with,''
declared Steven Grasse, chief executive at Gyro.
</P>
<P>
   Gyro came to mind for the Glenfiddich assignment, Grasse said,
because Teasdale had dealt with the agency while working for
another liquor marketer, Paddington Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In looking at advertising in the scotch category, Grasse said,
``We've always laughed at its pretentiousness, which didn't appeal
to the kinds of consumers we now see drinking scotch, people in
their late 20s and early 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't drinking it to be pretentious,'' he added. ``They
were drinking it as if it were a more sophisticated microbrew.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Gyro developed ads for Glenfiddich, the nation's No. 2
single malt behind Glenlivet, that are meant to ``be
straightforward and tell it like it is,'' Grasse said, focusing on
such elements as Glenfiddich's 111-year heritage and its family
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   In Gyro-speak, those elements are conveyed with headlines like
``Made the same damn way since 1887,'' ``One hundred eleven years
of obstinacy equals integrity,'' ``Some families hug. We make
Scotch'' and ``For the year 2000, we are proud to announce not a
single damn thing.'' To further communicate the intended
no-nonsense attitude, the ads are in a minimalist style, showing
only the Glenfiddich bottle and stag logo.
</P>
<P>
   In adopting what Teasdale described as ``a harder-edged attitude
of obstinacy and stubbornness'' for the Glenfiddich brand image,
``we're fully aware,'' he said, ``that it's a fairly new approach
for a staid category like single-malt scotch'' as well as ``a
little bit of a double-edged sword in terms of maybe putting off
some of our current customers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But getting new customers outweighed the risk,'' he added.
``We feel confident it's the right way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant will spend $6 million on the campaign, Teasdale said, in
magazines with ``a younger skew than we had with `the Friday
Scotch.''' So such publications as Details, ESPN Magazine, George,
Icon, Out, P.O.V. and Wired were added to the media plan, he said,
while ``a lot of the general business books'' such as Business Week
were subtracted.

 LYME VACCINE APPROVED, WITH CAVEATS  (jw) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved the
marketing of a vaccine against Lyme disease for the first time. But
the federal agency was unusually cautious in recommending use of
the vaccine, known as Lymerix, which is manufactured by SmithKline
Beecham Pharmaceuticals of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Lymerix, which will be available in January, does not
protect everyone who takes it against Lyme disease, a bacterial
infection transmitted through tick bites. For maximum protection,
three injections of the vaccine must be taken over a year. Studies
have shown that taking three injections provides 78 percent
protection against Lyme disease, while taking two injections
provides only 50 percent protection.
</P>
<P>
   Also, because the experimental trials did not involve children
or those over 70, the FDA approved the vaccine only for people 15
to 70. It is intended primarily for those who live or work in
grassy or wooded areas where infected ticks are present and for
those who plan to travel to such areas.
</P>
<P>
   Getting vaccinated may prove tricky for travelers who do not
plan their vacations far in advance, however. The recommendations
call for an initial injection, a second shot a month later, and
then a third injection 12 months after the first. Still, regular
summer vacationers to tick-prone areas and people who make
long-term plans should consider taking the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the seasonal nature of Lyme disease, the drug agency
cautioned that the time of year the vaccine was taken was
important. The first two injections in the experimental trial were
given between January and April, before the peak tick season in the
northeast United States.
</P>
<P>
   The agency advised those vaccinated against Lyme to continue to
take standard preventive measures against the infection. These
include wearing protective clothing, using tick repellant and
removing attached ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Lymerix is made from a genetically engineered protein known as
OspA, located on the outer surface of the bacterium Borrelia
burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. The manufacturer said that
protection seems to result from the vaccine's stimulation of the
body's immune system to produce antibodies against the spiral
bacteria. When a vaccinated person is bitten by an infected tick,
the antibody is taken up into the tick's intestine where it kills
the bacteria, preventing infection.
</P>
<P>
   In unanimously recommending approval of Lymerix in May, an
advisory committee of the FDA expressed serious concerns about its
safety and effectiveness. One concern is that scientists do not
know how long protection lasts, and thus, whether booster doses
will be needed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The percentage of people who gain protection from vaccines
ranges widely. Vaccines against polio, hepatitis A and B, and some
other infections offer protection 90 percent of the time or better.
For chickenpox, the figure is about 80 percent; for pneumococcal
vaccine, about 60 percent, and for influenza, the protection rate
can be less.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA also said that no safety data existed for people with
rheumatoid arthritis and certain heart conditions because they were
not included in the experimental trials that SmithKline Beecham
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   More than 16,000 cases of Lyme disease were reported from 45
states in 1996, the last year for which federal officials have
statistics. The disease is rarely fatal. It is often characterized
by a bull's-eye rash and flulike symptoms including headache, fever
and muscle and joint aches in its early stages. Occasionally it
causes facial weakness and heart problems. In the late stages of
Lyme disease, some people develop chronic arthritis and
neurological problems.
</P>
<P>
   Because one attack of Lyme disease may not confer protection
against another, people who have had the disease may benefit from
Lymerix, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Pasteur Merieux Connaught of Swiftwater, Pa., has tested another
Lyme vaccine, in more than 5,000 people. A spokesman for the
company said it planned to apply to the FDA for approval of its
Lyme vaccine early next year.

IN NEW YORK, CHINESE ACTIVIST DENOUNCES HIS GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also CHINA-DISSIDENTS, CHINA-U.S.) 
(mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Chinese dissident who arrived in New York on Sunday
accused the government in Beijing Monday of ``trampling on human
rights'' and said he had been beaten while in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   After serving more than two and a half years in a labor camp,
the activist, Liu Nianchun, managed to give a faint smile and
convey his appreciation to the U.S. government for his new-found
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife and 10-year-old daughter by his side during an
hourlong news conference at the Manhattan office of Human Rights
Watch, Liu described the human rights situation in his home
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``My release into exile for medical treatment cannot be seen as
an improvement of China's human rights situation,'' he said. ``The
very fact I am here, forced to leave China in order to receive
medical treatment, is a serious violation of human rights in
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent events like the broadcasting of President Clinton's human
rights debate with President Jiang Zemin on Chinese television were
significant steps, Liu said, but do not reflect the true nature of
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presently and practically speaking,'' he said, ``these events
have masked and diminished perception of the actual situation on
gross human rights abuse, leading some democratic countries to
claim that China has already shown marked change in the realm of
human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu recalled beatings by prison guards for offenses as minor as
not saluting when entering the bathroom or dining hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refused to do that,'' he said. ``It was an insult to my
personal dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a `re-education through labor' camp in China. I was
extremely sick, and it was very difficult to get a medical
examination, and even more difficult to obtain treatment. My living
conditions were deplorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu said his 80-year-old mother had gone on a hunger strike to
protest his incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   And his wife, Chu Hailan, who arrived with him in the United
States on Sunday, was beaten by police when protesting on his
behalf, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must urge the Chinese government to match deeds and words
and desist in openly trampling on human rights,'' Liu said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through a translator throughout the news conference, he
said he hoped to return to China someday but for now would work in
exile for a democratic China.
</P>
<P>
   He said he suffered from seven illnesses, but he identified only
one, high blood pressure.

<P>
   GENEVA _ After 317 days in captivity in Chechnya a French aid
worker was recently freed by Russian commandos in a gunfight that
killed three kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   The ending could have been quite different for the worker,
Vincent Cochetel, 37. Other foreigners have been kidnapped in what
appears to have become a routine way to raise cash in the breakaway
Caucasus republic. The heads of four foreign hostages were found
this month in a sack on a roadside. Their kidnappers are reportedly
demanding ransom for the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Cochetel, looking thin and wan, spoke to reporters after his
return to Geneva last week, the end of an ordeal that began in the
early hours of Jan. 29, when he was seized at his apartment by
three masked men.
</P>
<P>
   Cochetel was head of the U.N. refugee agency office in
Vladikavkaz, capital of North Ossetia, another Caucasus region that
borders Chechnya. As with other foreigners who continue to take the
risk of living and working in the Caucasus mountains, he said never
believed that he would be kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   French and U.N. officials negotiated for Cochetel's freedom.
Despite many demands for ransom, the refugee agency said none was
paid. The case attracted the attention of President Jacques Chirac
of France, who contacted President Boris Yeltsin of Russia to urge
the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   He was freed on Dec. 11, when, Cochetel recalled, he was
awakened in the middle of the night, blindfolded and driven to the
border between Chechnya and Ingushetia, another Russian republic,
where Russian anti-terrorist forces were waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't now whether I was being liberated,'' he said. ``The
soldiers said nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   He heard automatic gunfire, and with his handcuffed hands behind
his back he tumbled out of the car to the ground. Two Russian
soldiers dragged him to another vehicle. When he looked back, he
added, he saw two cars that had exploded. The operation left three
kidnappers dead. Cochetel was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Cochetel said he spent the first three days and nights of his
captivity locked in the trunk of a car in freezing weather and
without anything to eat. He was shuffled among 10 hiding places, he
estimated. In each, he said, showing handcuff marks on his wrists,
he was chained almost the entire time. He received a pail of water
daily for drinking and washing and another to use as a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 15 minutes of light each day either from a candle or a
lantern,'' he said. ``Then they took it away when I finished my
meal,'' the single daily meal that usually consisted of soup and
bread.
</P>
<P>
   Cochetel lost 44 pounds in 11 months. ``I was too heavy
before,'' he said after arriving here, where he is being treated in
a hospital.

COMMENTARY: AND CAULDRON BUBBLE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Should Linda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg and Kenneth Starr
decide who is to be president of the United States? When you
analyze the principal argument made for the impeachment of
President Clinton, you are brought inevitably to that question.
</P>
<P>
   Perjury was the House Republican mantra, the argument pressed by
the hard right to bring moderates to heel. In the debate, one
Republican after another said he or she had to vote to impeach Bill
Clinton because he lied under oath. But that proposition overlooks
what the trio did.
</P>
<P>
   The president tried to keep his sexual improprieties secret.
That was neither surprising nor ignoble. Henry Hyde and Robert
Livingston did the same, and so men have done since the Creation.
</P>
<P>
   But Monica Lewinsky told Mrs. Tripp, a former White House
employee who had been trying for years to harm Clinton. At the
urging of Ms. Goldberg, a right-wing literary agent, Mrs. Tripp
taped her telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. She told Paula
Jones' lawyers and Starr about the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting trap was sprung on the president at his deposition
in the Jones case. That was the fount of his troubles. So it is
vital to understand how his testimony has effectively been judged.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied, famously, having had ``sexual relations'' with
Ms. Lewinsky. The definition of that was so obscure that no jury
was likely to convict him of perjury in his denial. And the House
of Representatives evidently took the same view. It rejected the
article of impeachment charging him with perjury in the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Starr had another string for his bow. He called the president
before a grand jury, where he was asked about his statements in the
Jones deposition. Then Starr charged that Clinton's answers were
false.
</P>
<P>
   Again, I doubt that a jury would have convicted Clinton of
perjury. Millions of Americans saw the videotape of his grand jury
appearance and most sympathized with him _ indeed, were outraged at
what he was put through.
</P>
<P>
   But House Republicans said that the president's answers to the
Starr prosecutors were perjurious. That is, answers that the House
found were not perjurious at the original proceeding became high
crimes when the same answers were given again.
</P>
<P>
   No other American would have had to undergo that second turn of
the screw. Targets of prosecutors customarily invoke the Fifth
Amendment; Justice Department rules discourage calling them before
grand juries. But Starr, determined to get something on him after
four years of fruitless investigation, guessed correctly that for
political reasons the president would not refuse to testify.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, many House Republicans who cited perjury as their
ground for impeachment had deeper reasons. They do not like this
president. An unmistakable venom ran through the whole process.
</P>
<P>
   An astute foreign eye saw it clearly. Philip Stevens of The
Financial Times wrote: ``This was not about the sacred Constitution
of the United States. It wasn't even honest politics. The
impeachment of Bill Clinton was personal. It was an act of
vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have hated Bill Clinton since the day he took
office. Some conservative commentators, broadcast and print, seem
obsessed by the man. Robert Livingston, before he gave up the
speaker's job, showed his distorting animus when he said: ``Richard
Nixon's crime was covering up a crime he did not commit. Clinton is
covering up a crime he did commit.''
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons for politicians, Democratic and Republican, to
distrust Bill Clinton. He has not played straight with many of
them. And the public has reason to have been offended at his false
assurance that he had not had sexual relations with that woman. But
those are not grounds for impeachment, or resignation, unless we
are going to make the impeachment process a vote of no confidence
and move toward a parliamentary system of government.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I do not believe that the Senate or the public will
want to reward hatred. I do not believe they will want our
political fate to be decided by Linda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg and
Kenneth Starr.

FRENCH RESISTANCE'S `COL. PASSY' DIES AT 87 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: U.S. Military Posts, France, Norway, Britain, Germany,
Senegal)  By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Andre de Wavrin, the ``Col. Passy'' who forged a
Resistance intelligence network for de Gaulle during World War II,
died at his home in Paris last Sunday, friends said. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Paris in 1911 and a graduate of the Ecole Polytechnique,
the leading French engineering school, de Wavrin was a 29-year-old
captain teaching fortifications at the French military academy of
St.-Cyr when war broke out.
</P>
<P>
   He first saw action in a British-French expedition to retake the
northern Norwegian port of Narvik from the Germans in 1940. The
expedition was recalled after France's defenses against the Germans
collapsed, and de Wavrin ended up stranded with the other French
officers near Manchester, England.
</P>
<P>
   Though his wife and family were still in France, de Wavrin
decided to stay in Britain and, on July 1, 1940, found the
headquarters that de Gaulle had set up in London, and volunteered
for whatever duty the general might see fit to give him.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged from a brief meeting with the job of organizing the
Free French operational and intelligence organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing had prepared Passy for this unprecedented mission,''
de Gaulle wrote in his memoirs, ``but I preferred it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   De Wavrin and three lieutenants picked their Resistance
pseudonyms from a map of the Paris Metro. He chose Passy, the name
of a station near his home in the 16th Arrondissement, and decided
to concentrate on the intelligence part of the assignment de Gaulle
had given him.
</P>
<P>
   Working out of a three-room suite at the Resistance's new London
headquarters at 4 Carlton Gardens, de Wavrin and his men scoured
military camps and hospitals in southern England to recruit
volunteers for a service that had to be built from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, with skeptical help from the British and despite fierce
rivalries within de Gaulle's organization, de Wavrin's group began
sending agents across the English Channel in boats.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, with piercing blue eyes whose constant scanning unnerved
many who dealt with him, de Wavrin soon built up a roster of
enemies almost as long as those of his agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``His enemies accused him of operating a small-scale Gestapo
office in London, complete with dungeons for the uncooperative,''
the American historian Gordon Wright later wrote, and de Wavrin was
accused (falsely, he insisted) of having been associated with an
extreme-right subversive organization, the Cagoule, before the war.
</P>
<P>
   One of his own agents, Gilbert Renault, known by the code name
Remy, recalled that Col. Passy had initially received him ``with
all the warmth accorded an unwelcome traveling salesman,'' as an
American historian, Douglas Porch, put it.
</P>
<P>
   There were setbacks, notably the failure of a mission with de
Gaulle to Dakar, Senegal, in 1940 to try to persuade the French
garrison there to rally to the Resistance. There were also fiascos
over de Wavrin's attempts to keep enemy agents from penetrating his
group. Its relationship with the British was strained by rivalry
and suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had practically no means, while the English had
everything,'' de Wavrin wrote, and that included the radios on
which his organization depended for contact with agents in occupied
France.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the British from eavesdropping, de Wavrin established
a separate French code. Annoyed, the British started delivering the
messages to him only at midnight. He retaliated by summoning
British secret service officials to his headquarters to receive
inconsequential messages at odd hours of the night. ``Miraculously
the telegrams began to arrive at more normal hours,'' he related
later.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1942 and 1943 his Bureau Central de Renseignements et
d'Action attracted people in France like Jean Moulin, who were
disaffected with the Vichy occupation regime. Moulin, later a
martyred hero, was part of a group that worked to unify all the
various strands of the Resistance, under de Gaulle's leadership,
and de Wavrin began planning for a new political organization in
France.
</P>
<P>
   By D-Day, June 6, 1944, de Wavrin's network had mounted
extensive sabotage operations and provided Eisenhower, the Allied
commander, with so much information that he said the Resistance was
worth six allied divisions.
</P>
<P>
   De Wavrin himself parachuted into Brittany in August 1944 and
helped take charge of a force of 2,500 Resistance soldiers
operating with advancing American units. The force captured 2,000
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945 de Wavrin became director general of the precursor of
the present-day French foreign intelligence service, the Direction
Generale de la Securite Exterieure.
</P>
<P>
   But three months after he resigned in February 1946, he was
arrested and charged with setting up secret bank accounts in
Britain and Paris with diverted intelligence money. He was
imprisoned for three months in an affair judged later to have had
mostly to do with communist desires to discredit de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
   Decorated with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor in 1981,
de Wavrin was later a banker with the private Banque Worms and a
director of several French companies.

GETTING A PRESENT FOR THE BOSS A TRICKY PROPOSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Don't give him a tie.
</P>
<P>
   That's the only bit of advice that experts in workplace
etiquette agree on when it comes to the slippery question of what's
an appropriate gift for the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ties are for sons, daughters and spouses to give,'' said Tom
Welch, whose latest book is ``Work Happy, Live Healthy ... New
Solutions for Career Satisfaction Including More Time &AMP; Money.''
``If he doesn't wear it, he feels bad and you feel bad. So no
ties.''
</P>
<P>
   But the larger issue of buying a gift at all is far more
complicated. ``I don't think there's really a right or wrong answer
but a guideline is that if you're unsure, you're probably safer not
giving a gift,'' said Welch, who calls himself ``America's Career
Coach.'' ``If you're contemplating it, you might try to find out
what they think before you put them on the spot but if you put my
feet to the fire, I'd say you're better off not giving.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from deflating your wallet, giving your boss a gift may
have several unintended consequences such as causing bad feelings
among co-workers who didn't pony up; making the boss feel
uncomfortable that you expect a social relationship outside the
job; and competition with co-workers for who can give the most
impressive gift.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles psychologist Robert Butterworth advocates that
supervisors discourage the practice. ``It causes all sorts of guilt
and obligations,'' he explained. ``This is a case where Scrooge is
alive and well in the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, contends Robyn Spizman, author of ``The Perfect
Present, the Ultimate Gift Guide for Every Occasion.'' Her view _
there's nothing wrong with getting into the holiday spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe you should not resist a generous impulse,'' she
said. ``You can do it something as simple as a homemade baked gift
or write a letter explaining how he helped you do a better job
during the year. Words are free and fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by American Express found plenty of gift-giving
to bosses, with 27 percent of U.S. employees planing to take that
step and spend an average of $54.
</P>
<P>
   Spizman suggests a joint gift as a way to ease worries about
associates feeling left out. ``If you want to be considerate of
your co-workers, that's a very successful route,'' she said. ``The
boss can thank everyone at once, which is far more comfortable for
him or her.''
</P>
<P>
   Spizman recommends pens (``They don't scream out how much they
cost and they're useful''), business biographies, personalized
leather-bound organizers (``Double-check to make sure you spell the
name right'') and donations to a charity in the boss's name.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Chilcott, vice president of retail at leather goods
specialist Cole-Haan, shrugs off the notion that gifts to bosses
carry ulterior motives. ``I think most is in the true spirit of the
holidays, particularly if things are going well with the economy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As to what to buy, Chilcott recommends thinking about how you
and the boss get along. ``What people buy really runs the gamut and
depends on what kind of relationship they have,'' he said, adding
that current popular items include business-related gifts such as
leather luggage for those who travel a lot and Palm Pilot organizer
covers.
</P>
<P>
   But for those needing the confidence to follow through on
stiffing the boss, Welch offers this advice: ``The best gift you
can give a boss is great job performance. Do the best job you can
and a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you absolutely must give a gift, think of it as a token
of friendship, Welch advises. ``You might want to give something
that's oriented toward the business, like a book about the business
that you're in, rather than something personal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And no ties.

 &HT;    Judge says Blue Cross windfall must be more widely shared
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The for-profit conversion of Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Georgia was turning into a windfall for 70,000
policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   If WellPoint Health Networks' acquisition of Blue Cross were to
be approved early next year, as expected, the 70,000 policyholders,
at no initial cost, would have a choice of taking $4,000 or the
equivalent in WellPoint stock.
</P>
<P>
   Now the value of that freebie may be cut to about $1,850.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge in Richmond County has ruled that an
estimated 74,000 more policyholders at the time of the conversion
also are entitled to the same five shares in Cerulean, the parent
company of Blue Cross, that the original 70,000 received.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, favoring the plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit,
is expected to delay the closing of the acquisition of Cerulean by
California-based WellPoint. The deal was to close in the first
quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross said Monday it might appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But WellPoint and Blue Cross said the acquisition price, $500
million, would remain the same. ``It won't have any impact on the
terms of the deal,'' said WellPoint spokesman John Cygul.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Harman, a Blue Cross vice president, added: ``Cerulean
and WellPoint remain committed to the merger and the closing as
soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The original 70,000 stockholders had individual Blue Cross
policies, or were members of Blue Cross employer plans that aren't
self-insured. After a mailing to about 144,000 policyholders that
qualified in those two categories, 70,000 signed up to receive the
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Harman said the purpose of the signup offer was to tell
policyholders about a possible tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge J. Carlisle Overstreet's ruling requires all those
eligible _ including those who didn't sign up _ to receive the
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Cerulean shares were offered as a result of Blue Cross'
controversial 1996 conversion from a nonprofit to a for-profit
company.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders still must approve the WellPoint-Blue Cross merger.
</P>
<P>
   A date for the shareholder meeting has not been set. Blue Cross
is awaiting the final Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission's approval
of the proxy.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what effect, if any, the judge's ruling would have
on a July settlement agreement reached between Blue Cross and
several consumer groups that had filed a lawsuit over the
conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Blue Cross agreed to endow a health care
foundation with shares and warrants that had an initial value of
about $80 million.

TRAVEL INDUSTRY FEARS COMPUTER NIGHTMARE IN MILLENNIUM
PREPARATIONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27)  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Planes absolutely, positively will not fall out of the sky
because of the Year 2000 computer flaw, aviation experts insist. It
is possible, though, that some will not leave the gate.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of other computer-controlled systems, from hotel door
locks to trains to ordinary traffic signals, could stop working.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem, known to the digerati as Y2K, occurs when
computers that store the year portion of a date as a two-digit
number are confronted with the year after 1999 and conclude that 00
means 1900. In isolation, a computer that is confused about the
date would be a minor annoyance, but computers that are linked
together _ like those in the air traffic control system _ could
stop talking to each other and freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every industry faces problems, but travel and,
specifically, aviation could be particularly vulnerable because of
a huge number of linked systems. The Federal Aviation
Administration, prompted by Y2K to make its first thorough
inventory of hardware and software, counted 155 systems that are
``mission critical'' and must be repaired in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency said that it has found relatively few problems,
and has nearly completed its search, having designed fixes for 153
of the 155 systems. It must still make those changes on computers
in the field and test them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a very short time to finish what's left,'' said
Raymond Long, the head of the FAA's $191 million Y2K effort, but he
said that the agency would be ready. It is now turning its focus to
what others in the business, like airlines and airports, are doing
about Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic airlines sound confident that they will avoid Y2K
problems, but only after a huge effort. The Air Transport
Association, the trade organization made up mainly of the big
American airlines, allocated $15 million n 1998 and 1999 on Y2K,
mostly on the gathering and dissemination of information; that is
more than the group spent on all activities in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But planes will not crash, said Thomas J. Browne, the director
of the association's Y2K program. The only part of a plane that
really needs to know the date, he said, is the flight management
computer, which handles navigation and related chores.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the plane pushes back from the gate, that
computer receives a data feed from a computer on the ground. If the
on-board computer cannot handle the data it is given, it will
display an error message like ``date out of range,'' Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless that can be resolved quickly, he added, ``The pilot will
look at it and say, `I'm not taking off in this airplane.' '' Thus,
he said, ``There's no safety-of-flight issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine an FAA inspector walking in to an airline on
Jan. 2 and saying, `All your flights are grounded because all your
pilots' medical exams expired 100 years ago,' '' Browne said. But
the airlines all have written records, too, he said, if such
confusions arise.
</P>
<P>
   Other computers calculate passenger and cargo loads and
integrate weather data to determine how much fuel should be loaded.
All that work can be done by hand, but not smoothly and promptly.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign carriers, and especially foreign air-traffic control
systems, may lag behind their counterparts in the United States.
The International Civil Aviation Organization, acting on a motion
made by the head of the FAA, has agreed to require all member
nations to publicly report by next July 31 their progress in
preparing their air traffic control systems for the rollover.
</P>
<P>
   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said that it might ground some flights,
depending on how much progress is made at a destination. Other
airlines have not made public statements but are watching
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Controllers can generally still handle traffic without
computers, just much less of it, meaning that a Y2K crisis might
make the system work the way it does when there is a computer crash
or a big snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   But for planes to fly, lots of other parts of airport systems
have to work correctly, including jetways, fueling systems and even
airport parking-lot cashier stations. Some airports are checking
with the companies that manufacture fire trucks to make sure that
the embedded computer chips in those trucks will not lock up; if an
airport has no fire truck, it must shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Airports differ in their level of preparedness, said Christopher
J. Tebo of the American Association of Airport Executives, and the
responsibility for equipment, like baggage systems or fuel systems,
differs from airport to airport.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines that see a problem can spend money immediately to solve
it. But, Tebo said, some airports are public entities with
cumbersome appropriations processes, and some did not foresee that
they would need more resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely going to be a level of inconvenience the
traveling public is going to incur,'' Tebo said. ``I don't know
whether it will be having to walk up escalators, or there won't be
as many flights to certain destinations.''
</P>
<P>
   If the system runs badly, he said, it could be like a day when a
major blizzard disrupts air service _ repeated daily for a month or
so.
</P>
<P>
   A few travel agencies are sounding cautious. Unicorn Holidays,
an English company that specializes in travel to Spain, France and
Portugal, does not plan to book any tours for New Year's weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The airplanes might work just fine, said Jim Southon, Unicorn's
managing director, but any of a thousand things could go wrong and
ruin a vacation. The computer that runs a municipal water
purification plant could fail _ or one that runs a ski lift, a
telephone system, a power system, an oil refinery that makes jet
fuel, or the traffic lights on the way to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farther one goes from the states or Northern Europe, the
more trouble there will be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, of course, the outbound portion of the trip, in 1999, could
go just fine, but the vacation could be extended involuntarily
because something crucial stops working on Jan. 1, delaying the
return.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of the problems that could strike on a trip could
strike at home, too, perhaps even in St. Albans, north of London,
where Unicorn is based. But, Southon said, ``If you stayed home and
got into all types of problems, you wouldn't come back to me and
say it's my fault.''

PESSIMISTIC INVESTORS PUSH BRAZIL STOCKS LOWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Just a month ago, markets here were
rallying as the International Monetary Fund moved toward announcing
a $41 billion bailout for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In a spree of optimism that some analysts warned was wildly
excessive, Brazilian stocks rose 91 percent in a nine-week period
through Nov. 27, and 22.5 percent in November alone.
</P>
<P>
   There was no obvious cause for such enthusiasm, either in
company performance or in the government's progress toward fiscal
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   This month stocks are bouncing wildly again, but mostly in the
opposite direction. As of Friday, they had fallen 21.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the benchmark Brazilian stock index shot up 6.19
percent Monday, at least some of the buying was attributed to
market gains elsewhere. The underlying sense in Brazil is that more
irrational selling is in store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as unbridled pessimism, which has no foundation,''
said Rodrigo Fiaes, chief of equity research at Banco Icatu here.
``When the market was on the upswing, people were not discounting
negatives. Now the market is only discounting the negatives, and
not taking positive developments into account.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the urge to dump shares of Brazilian companies was not
completely unwarranted, and some analysts consider it a correction
of excessive confidence. Since the IMF bailout was announced, there
have been some signs that the Brazilian Congress may not be as
quick, or as pliant, in accepting the economic belt-tightening
proposals of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration
as investors had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Congress rejected a proposal to make retired civil servants pay
into the pension system, and it went home for the holidays without
approving the government's revised 1999 budget, or extending and
increasing a special financial-transactions tax that officials are
counting on to meet revenue targets promised to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a razor-edge situation,'' said Edmar Bacha, executive
director of BBA Securities in New York. ``Because the price is not
as low as indicating default, nor as high as indicating that Brazil
is over the hump, there's a tremendous uncertainty right now as to
which way Brazil is going to go. Is it Russia or Korea?''
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume has fallen tremendously, with daily trades
totaling $225 million toward the end of last week _ one-third of
what they were before the global financial crisis began. With such
low liquidity, the stock exchange has become a kind of fun-house
mirror, magnifying small movements of capital at price extremes.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1997, about 30 percent of the trading was done by
foreigners. By now, most foreign investors have fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is leaving aside the fundamentals, and reacting
strongly to any news related to Congress, or to the austerity
package,'' said Roque Sut Ribeiro of the Marka Nikko Asset Fund
here.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's dollar reserves, now at $49 billion after it received a
first installment of nearly $10 billion IMF aid in recent days, are
still in decline. As of the end of last week, $2.64 billion had
flowed from foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
   If trading takes place among a smaller number of investors these
days, the number of companies they are trading is also minuscule,
compared with those traded on stock exchanges in the United States.
Brazil's main index, the Bovespa in Sao Paulo, is made up of a
handful of blue-chip companies, including Telebras, Petrobras and
Eletrobras.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be watching for new appointments that Cardoso is
expected to make on Wednesday. He is expected to create some new
jobs in his Cabinet, including a civilian minister of defense and,
later, a minister of production who would wield considerable power.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important announcements for markets this week will
involve appointments to head Petrobras; a savings institution, the
Caixa Economica Federal; the Banco do Brasil; and the National Bank
for Development.
</P>
<P>
   One name that has been mentioned to head the development bank is
Maria Silvia Marques, the chief executive of CSN, the national
steel company. Her appointment would be taken as a sign by
investors that privatization would continue to be a government
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Cardoso can get it right, in the sense of sending a
positive signal to the market,'' Fiaes said, ``and if the market
will be satisfied with the options, we'll see a general improvement
in sentiment toward Brazil.''

 By JAMES BENNET and ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A handful of moderate Republicans who voted to
impeach President Clinton appealed to the Senate on Monday to
consider censuring the president instead of convicting him, as many
lawmakers scrambled to find a way to avoid a lengthy, embarrassing
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Because most senators, used to deciding things in clubby
caucuses, are away and the only precedents for a presidential trial
are 130 years old, there was no evidence that a consensus existed,
nor any clear idea if Senate rules would hamper or assist one if it
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, through Vice President Al Gore, continued to
demand that the Senate quickly ``forge a fair bipartisan
compromise.'' For his part, the president publicly ignored the
issue and turned to the symbolic duties of his office in a holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   But the day's most striking development was the letter from
Reps. Sherry Boehlert and Benjamin Gilman of New York, Mike Castle
of Delaware and Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania, which they prepared
to send to Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader. They released
its text on Monday night, and plan to send it on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not convinced, and do not want our votes interpreted to
mean, that we view removal from office as the only reasonable
conclusion of this case,'' they wrote, although the articles of
impeachment for which they voted each concluded: ``Wherefore,
William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, warrants impeachment
and trial and removal from office.''
</P>
<P>
   They argued in their letter that while it was ``questionable''
whether the House had authority to deal with censure, the Senate
clearly ``does have the authority and the precedents to consider a
range of options. Those options should include a tough censure
proposal, which would impose a fine and block any pardon.'' The
congressmen all voted Saturday against allowing the consideration
of a Democratic move to allow a House vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   Another House Republican who voted for impeachment, W. J. Tauzin
of Louisiana, was consulting with colleagues on Monday about asking
the Senate to avert a trial. His spokesman, Ken Johnson, said,
``The feeling is the president paid a terrible price for his
actions. The Clinton presidency has been indelibly stained by
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said House Republicans could vote only up or down on
impeachment. ``That was a lousy choice, but the only one allowed
under the Constitution,'' he said. ``Our hands were tied. Too much
blood has been spilled already and there's a time to begin the
healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite a rising clamor among past and present politicians
for censure, the alternatives put forward so far face two
formidable obstacles, at least today.
</P>
<P>
   Most such proposals, including the one offered on Monday by
former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, require that
Clinton concede he lied under oath, a step his aides insist he will
not take. With that in mind, or perhaps merely as a bargaining
tactic, some WHite House aides say censure may be unworkable,
</P>
<P>
   ``It just may be there's no acceptable form of censure, so why
go through that?'' said one Clinton adviser. A trial, he said,
would provide the country with a ``definitive end to this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to fault us for mounting a defense,'' he said.
``And believe me, we're going to mount one. Believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, several senior Republican senators have said that they
have a constitutional duty to at least begin a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is likely to play a prominent
role in any trial, said that he would like to see the Senate vote
on the two articles of impeachment approved on Saturday before
considering any alternatives. But he said he believed it could be
done quickly.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview there was ``a lot of discussion about at
what point is censure an appropriate discussion. My view is we need
to commence the trial. Otherwise it just completely makes short
shrift of the action of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have said that they expect Sen. Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., the Senate's leading expert on rules and procedures, to
support their contention that the Senate is obliged to open a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Byrd kept his options open. ``Whether there is a
trial or whether there is some other solution, that decision must
be made by senators,'' he said, ``and it must be bipartisan or it
will have absolutely no credibility with the public.''
</P>
<P>
   He made a similar argument for the primacy of the Senate. He
warned that the White House should not expect to control the terms
of a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the good of our nation, there must be no 'deal' involving
the White House or any entity beyond the current membership of the
U.S. Senate,'' he said in a written statement that signaled that at
least some Senate Democrats would maintain some distance from the
president.

   WASHINGTON _ Linda Tripp, world-famous taper of presidential
inamorata, was back at her office in the Pentagon on Monday after
working from home at her $90,000-a-year job while the wheels of
justice ground their way through the last 11 months to the
impeachment of the commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in, but she's gone,'' a secretary told a visitor at
room 1E776 in the outermost of the Pentagon's five rings.
</P>
<P>
   Festooned with a door-front Christmas wreath, the office houses
the Pentagon's Institute for Planning and Long Range Preparation, a
typically plain workplace that Mrs. Tripp was freed from using
under a government arrangement known as flexi-place.
</P>
<P>
   She rocketed to the heights of Washington controversy when she
shared with criminal and civil investigators the fruits of her
furtive tape recordings of Monica Lewinsky. Mrs. Tripp's anguished
declaration to the nation as the year luridly roared forward _ ``I
am you'' _ has become one of the folkloric quotations of the
presidential scandal, ranking with the utterance of William
Ginsburg, Ms. Lewinsky's first lawyer: ``No one ever lies. People
often do what they have to do to make their story sound right.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the catacomb-like corridors of the Pentagon, Linda Tripp
sightings have been claimed in recent days by passing military
professionals as if they had glimpsed one of the F-117 ``stealth''
attack-fighters designed to fall upon the enemy without ever being
seen by eye or radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spotted her with her publicist,'' one alert colonel
announced tersely to a friend. For months, the Pentagon has been
extremely reluctant to discuss Mrs. Tripp's work situation and no
new word was offered Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp's return occurred on a gray day when the capital city
struggled to find some post-impeachment serenity.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton volunteered at a soup kitchen, ladling tomato
sauce over pasta and wishing Congress a merry Christmas as his
aides strategized privately to spare him a Senate conviction and
expulsion from office. He also played host at the Winter Holiday
Festival _ the annual Christmas party for news workers, many of
whom were tracking the president's year of scandal and impeachment
even as they took time out for the White House wassail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is payback time,'' one journalist commented evenly,
jammed amid a throng of 4,000 invitees wending their way toward a
South lawn tent where they found cookies, soft drinks, beer, wine
and coffee plus a platoon of clowns to amuse the young ones in the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Miffed journalists noted there were none of the more sumptuous
offerings _ lamb chops and the like _ of the more commodious media
parties thrown by the president last year, a month before the press
plunged into the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrants were distracted by media celebrities intent on a
moment's seasonal peace amid the impeachment story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the clowns?'' a small boy asked Bob Novak, who
seemed Dickensian as he put aside his usual ``Crossfire'' scowl to
smile upon the lad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this nice?'' Geraldo Rivera asked his little children as
they approached the richly twinkling White House Christmas tree.
``This is where the president gets his presents,'' said Rivera, who
has been as tireless as Santa every night on cable television
searching out who's been good and bad in the Clinton scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The city's impeachment anxieties were not easy to put aside. For
some reason, one of the first portraits displayed beyond the
entryway was of Andrew Johnson, the 19th century president who
preceded Clinton in impeachment and survived conviction by a single
Senate vote. The slow going by the thick mob of party invitees lent
a Jackson-era aura of heatedness to the evening, particularly when
some veteran White House reporters were stopped at the door,
informed their names were not to be found on the computerized
security check list.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're destroying my reputation!'' one of them angrily
announced, dressing down security workers and unleashing cell phone
alarums to various White House sources.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, the president smiled gently upon one and all
passing what Mrs. Tripp termed the ``jumbo'' office photos that Ms.
Lewinsky used to muse upon in her tell-all conversations.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's largest office building, spilling up and out
through Dantesque office rings, the Pentagon would seem like an
ideal place to go unnoticed, with security clearances at all the
entrances and hordes of workers in the halls. But not for Mrs.
Tripp, and not in this tumultuous year.
</P>
<P>
   Other federal workers in the vast bureaucracy have closely
tracked her working arrangements and salary, which doubled since
she worked at the White House for the first two years of the
Clinton administration. Under her job, involving computer planning
work on the Pentagon's annual Joint Civilian Orientation
Conference, Pentagon officials confirmed Mrs. Tripp would be
eligible for the proposed 4.4 percent wage increase announced
Monday by the Clinton administration.

PROPOSAL FOR CLOSED-DOOR SENATE TESTIMONY UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-LIVINGSTON, IMPEACH-MEDIA.)

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To keep President Clinton's impeachment trial from
becoming an unseemly spectacle, some Senators want to have
witnesses like Monica S. Lewinsky testify in closed session or to
avoid witnesses altogether and simply accept the evidence presented
by independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   But that would break with precedent and require a change in
Senate rules. As a practical matter, it probably could not happen
unless all Senators agreed, and the idea of closed proceedings has
already brought criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Senate rules require all testimony to be in public, and the
Senate Historical Office says no impeachment trial has ever been
held without public witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who will become chairman of the
Rules Committee next year, argues that the trial could be &UR;  &LR; abridged
to spare senators the embarrassment of taking testimony on
scurrilous matters in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the rules that requires every piece of
testimony to be taken in open session,'' McConnell said in an
interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain now infamous characters in this seamy
episode from whom we've heard quite enough,'' he said. ``If it's
deemed necessary to take testimony embarrassing to the children of
this country, we can take it in private. The transcript could be
subsequently released. We just wouldn't make it a television
event.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell and other Republicans are presumably reading the
opinion polls showing that most people opposed impeachment and now
oppose a trial.
</P>
<P>
   But many authorities on impeachment rules, which were written
for President Andrew Johnson's impeachment in 1868 and have not
been significantly changed since, take issue with McConnell's
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   They cite Rule XX, which states: ``At all times while the Senate
is sitting upon the trial of an impeachment, the doors of the
Senate shall be kept open.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate can waive or rewrite its rules, but it requires a
two-thirds vote if any senator objects to the change. As a
practical matter, rules are almost never altered unless senators
agree unanimously to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Unanimous consent might be difficult to come by in the current
climate. For instance, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said that
she would resist efforts to hear witnesses behind locked doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I for one would have very strong opposition to any kind of
star chamber proceeding that's held in private,'' Feinstein said
Sunday in an interview on CNN. ``After all, this is now removal of
the president from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Some leading Republican senators, including Phil Gramm of Texas
and Orrin Hatch of Utah, said in interviews that they thought the
Senate could basically rely on the evidence gathered in Starr's
investigation, the way the House Judiciary Committee had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no reason to call Monica Lewinsky,'' Hatch said.
``Nothing she said has been rebutted.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gerhardt, a law professor at the College of William and
Mary who is an authority on impeachment, said he thought it was
possible the senators might agree unanimously to hear certain
witnesses like Ms. Lewinsky in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time believing anyone would feel comfortable
about having her testify in public,'' Gerhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that a Senate trial could occur without
testimony from Ms. Lewinsky, beyond doubt the most important
witness in the case other than the president himself. But it is
also not clear whether the lawyers for the House or those for the
president would be the ones to call her to the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhardt said he doubted that the senators could accept Starr's
evidence as fact the way the House Judiciary Committee did. ``They
must get public support for what they're trying to do.'' Gerhardt
said. ``For them to take shortcuts that don't inspire confidence in
the outcome would be extraordinarily risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Koed, the assistant Senate historian, said in an interview
that witnesses had testified publicly in all impeachment trials
that had reached a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 11 such trials. Seven of them, all of federal
judges, ended in convictions. Four officials, including Johnson,
the only president to stand trial, were acquitted, and two
officials who were impeached had their cases dismissed before their
trial had run its course.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Clinton and the Senate reach an accommodation in the next
two weeks to avoid a trial, the first stage will begin on Jan. 6
when the 106th Congress convenes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The House managers, the group of representatives from the
Judiciary Committee selected to act as prosecutors in the trial,
will walk across the Capitol that afternoon, be ushered into the
Senate chamber and read the two articles of impeachment that the
House approved on Saturday _ one charging the president with
perjury before a federal grand jury and the other charging him with
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will then notify Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
that it is beginning an impeachment trial. The founding fathers
realized it would be a conflict of interest for the vice president
to preside, so the Constitution provides for the chief justice to
preside during the impeachment trial of a president.
</P>
<P>
   After being sworn in himself, the chief justice will swear in
the 100 senators to sit as jurors. The next step will be for the
Senate to instruct its sergeant at arms send the articles of
impeachment to the president and set a time for him to reply.
Chances are the president will be given a month or more to submit
his ``answer'' to the charges, and House managers will then be
given 10 days or so to file their ``replication'' responding to the
president's submission.
</P>
<P>
   The next stage will involve pretrial motions. Presumably, the
president's lawyers will move for dismissal. Other motions may
involve topics like what kind of evidence will be allowed and
whether the standard for the burden of proof will be ``beyond
reasonable doubt'' like a criminal trial, ``preponderance of
evidence'' like a civil trial or something else completely
different.
</P>
<P>
   The senators will debate all such motions in closed session and
rule on them by majority vote. Any rulings by the chief justice can
be overridden by a majority of the senators.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, once it begins, will take place in the Senate chamber
and will resemble a courtroom trial in many respects. The lawyers
will make opening arguments, examine and cross-examine witnesses,
present documentary evidence and make closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   All this time, the senators must sit silently. To question
witnesses, they may pass notes to the chief justice, who will pose
questions for them.
</P>
<P>
   The deliberations over motions and the final verdict will take
place in closed sessions. Senate ethics rules prohibit senators
from divulging what is said in these sessions. Of course, the
senators could decide by unanimous consent to debate the verdict in
open session.
</P>
<P>
   Short of this, the only time the senators will speak publicly
during the entire trial is when they declare whether they find the
president ``guilty'' or ``not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   It requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate to convict the
president, which would automatically remove him from office.

CENTRAL AMERICA COPES WITH AFTERMATH OF MITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 27)  
(JT) 
 By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ Even for a region accustomed to disasters,
Hurricane Mitch was in a class by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Central America is struggling to recover from the storm, which
last month left a death toll reported at 11,000, displaced a
million residents and inflicted at least $3 billion in property
damage. The recovery is not proving easy, and people thinking of
traveling to the region need to anticipate the circumstances they
will face.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side: Most key tourist attractions, such as the
Maya ruins at Copan in Honduras, are reported to be intact, and
curfews imposed early in November to prevent looting of food and
fuel in major cities have been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Sanitation and basic infrastructure, however, are even more
precarious than usual, leading the U.S. Department of State, in a
Consular Information Sheet issued on Nov. 25, to warn of difficult
conditions in the areas where Mitch did the most serious damage,
such as Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four countries in the storm's path, Guatemala was the
least damaged, and its main tourist areas, such as the Maya city of
Tikal, were barely affected. By early December the Pan-American
Highway west from the capital toward Mexico, as well as the main
branches north to the popular market town of Chichicastenango and
south to Lake Atitlan and its surrounding volcanos, were already
back to their normal state of congestion.
</P>
<P>
   El Salvador, still largely off the tourist track, also got off
relatively easily. Much of Honduras and parts of Nicaragua,
however, were so severely battered that government officials say it
will be years before the situation returns to normal. As a result
of such pronouncements, hotels have been filled not with tourists
but with relief workers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, major hotels in both countries, such as the
Honduras Maya and Plaza San Martin in Tegucigalpa or the Grand
Hotel Sula and the new Camino Real in San Pedro Sula are operating
normally, as are airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in good shape,'' Honduras Minister of Tourism Norman
Garcia said in a recent interview. ``If we had the slightest doubt,
we would not invite tourists to come, because the bad word of mouth
would send us to the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assurances notwithstanding, damage to roads and
communications, water and sewer systems means that the travel
experience in Honduras and some parts of Nicaragua has been
fundamentally altered. Even the region's lush tropical landscape, a
lure to eco-tourists, has been affected, with the combination of
winds and floods denuding or toppling trees in places like Guanaja,
one of the Bay Islands of Honduras popular with divers.
</P>
<P>
   Before Mitch, a drive across the mountains from Tegucigalpa to
San Pedro Sula, for instance, took as little as three hours. But
with many bridges still out, the trip now takes up to six hours,
thanks to the many detours drivers need to make across pontoons and
fords. In addition, while long lines for gasoline have all but
disappeared, authorities advise that diesel fuel is still scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Even in normal times, it is never advisable to drink tap water
in Central America. But that is even more the case now, especially
in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potable water is in short supply in much of the country,'' the
department of state warned. ``Normal water supplies to Tegucigalpa
and many other cities and towns remain at least partially
interrupted or polluted due to broken water and sewer mains.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a few hotels in the Bay Islands, among them the
Posada del Sol and the Anthony's Key Resort, were still closed for
repairs as of mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, recent visitors say offshore diving areas,
the main lure to the three islands, are closer to pristine than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the hurricane weather, the reefs are very clean,''
said Sidney Haylock, a member of the mayor's staff in Guanaja. ``We
have a lot more sea life and the diving sites are improved.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nicaragua, the bulk of the hurricane damage is concentrated
in the far northwest, in the area around Chinandega. Road travel
from Managua to Leon is back to normal, and conditions in Managua
itself and points south were never an issue even at the peak of the
storm. But once beyond Leon, delays and some inconveniences can
still be expected.
</P>
<P>
   It is advisable to avoid the Honduras-Nicaragua border area and
rural sections of some of Nicaragua's north-central provinces, suchas Matagalpa and Jinotega. During the Sandinista-Contra civil war
of the 1980s, land mines were buried in many of those areas.
Mitch's heavy rains exposed or washed away hundreds of the weapons,
several of which have killed or crippled farmers.  &QL;

SENTENCINGS IN CHINA PUT WHITE HOUSE ON DEFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (Eds: See also CHINA-DISSIDENTS, CHINA-LIU) 
(mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six months after President Clinton traveled to
Beijing and challenged China's leaders to move rapidly toward
political reform, the administration's policy of engaging Beijing
was called into question Monday when Chinese courts sentenced two
of the nation's most prominent dissidents to long jail sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of China on Capitol Hill and human rights groups said
the tough prison terms were evidence of the failure of the
administration's policy of encouraging trade and diplomatic ties
with China in hopes of democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The dissidents _ Xu Wenli, who was sentenced Monday to 13 years
in prison, and Wang Youcai, who received an 11-year sentence _ had
been charged with subversion.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said it had received reports from sources
it did not identify that a third leading democracy campaigner, Qin
Yongmin, had been sentenced to 13 years in prison after a trial
last week in the city of Wuhan. Relatives of Qin in China denied
the reports, however, and said that his trial continued.
</P>
<P>
   Given Clinton's effusive praise for China's senior leaders
during his trip to Beijing last summer, the administration found
itself on the defensive Monday and harshly criticized the prison
sentences, even as it continued to insist that the administration's
policy of engagement was helping push Beijing toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said the United
States ``deeply deplores'' the jail terms and called for the
immediate release of the dissidents. ``These three men appear to
have been involved in nothing more than efforts to form a new
political party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While condemning the prison sentences, Foley and other American
officials were careful to note the administration's assessment that
there had been progress in human rights in China, some of it linked
to Clinton's meeting in Beijing with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been improvements in the human rights situation in
China, modest improvements,'' Foley said. The severe prison terms _
and other recent instances of harassment of democracy campaigners
in China _ are ``steps backward in relationship to what had been an
improved human rights performance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the administration's China policy noted that the long
prison sentences were handed out less than a week after Jiang
delivered a pointed speech in Beijing in which he made clear that
China's economic reforms were not a prelude to Western-style
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Western mode of political systems must never be copied,''
he said, adding that those who challenged the Communist Party's
supremacy would be crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has long been among China's
harshest critics in Congress, said the prison sentences handed out
to Xu and Wang were ``the clearest demonstration'' since the
president's visit to China last summer of Beijing's ``true
intentions regarding human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pathetic, really pathetic,'' she said of the
administration. ``The administration can say what it wants, but it
must know Monday that its policy on China is an embarrassment. What
the Chinese have learned is that they have all the latitude in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights Group,
said the jail terms were proof of the need for the administration
to revise its China policy, which he described as ``almost
entirely'' driven by the administration's desire to encourage
trade.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while there had been some signs of progress in the
human rights situation in China over the last year _ notably,
China's agreement to sign international treaties on civil and
economic rights _ the overall picture was bleak.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance,'' he said, ``any progress China has made by
allowing greater openness may have been canceled out by a more
repressive attitude.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch, the largest American-based human rights
group, called on the administration to consider postponing or
canceling a planned visit to China early next year by Commerce
Secretary William Daley and a high-level trade delegation as a
protest over the prison sentences. ``That would get Beijing's
attention,'' Jendrzejczck said.
</P>
<P>
   Other China experts and scholars insisted that the
administration was right to continue its policy of engagement with
China, and that there was reason to believe that political reform
would follow economic reform, as Clinton has argued.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Rodman, a former Nixon and Reagan administration official
now at the Nixon Center in Washington, said that ``the United
States cannot control the evolution of a society as complex as
China's.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the harsh prison sentences given out Monday to the
dissidents were to be expected, especially since Xu and Wang had
been involved in trying to set up a political party to challenge
the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pattern of this regime is that every once in a while, they
ease up a bit and somebody goes too far and there's a crisis,'' he
said. ``I don't think you can blame the United States for this
crackdown, nor can you give us credit for any political reforms. On
human rights, I just don't think there's much more we can do.''

 &HT;    World's first surviving set of octuplets in critical condition
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The world's first surviving set of octuplets remained
in critical condition Monday, but their pediatrician sounded
optimistic that all eight could live to see their first Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Nkem Chukwu, a 27-year-old Houston woman, gave birth to five
girls and two boys Sunday morning by Cesarean section at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital, two weeks after the first of the octuplets, a
girl, was born in a normal delivery. The first baby born fifteen
weeks prematurely, is breathing on her own while her siblings, born
13 weeks early, will remain on ventilators until at least Thursday,
hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu, who used fertility drugs to get pregnant, was in good
spirits Monday following early morning surgery to control internal
bleeding, said Dr. Patti Savrick, the babies' pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   ``She seemed very happy this morning,'' Savrick said, adding
that the exhausted mother wants to recover more before making any
statement to media which had descended on the hospital from around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The staff at St. Luke's and at the adjoining Texas Children's
Hospital, where the babies were taken immediately after birth,
still refer to the unnamed infants as babies A through H. All eight
weighed less than two pounds at birth.
</P>
<P>
   But it is baby E, the tiniest of the eighth, that has doctors
most concerned. Weighing just 10.3 ounces, she had been carefully
watched in the womb after doctors detected reduced blood flow to
her body through her umbilical chord.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Chukwu went into labor around 5 a.m. Sunday, ``We
were really concerned that this baby may not survive much longer,''
said Dr. Brian Kirshon, who delivered the octuplets.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them are still critically ill, but she's the most
critically ill,'' Savrick said, adding that baby E, like her
siblings needs a ventilator and oxygen to help her undeveloped
lungs function.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people up in the (neo-natal intensive care unit) are
working very hard on each baby individually, monitoring every
aspect of vital signs and fluid and oxygen level... on literally a
minute by minute basis,'' Savrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the infants could be in hospital for up to two
months, while their mother may be released within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Kirshon said Chukwu and her husband, Iyke, a respiratory
therapist at a Houston hospital, rejected the idea of ``selective
reduction,'' a technique in which doctors abort some fetuses so
that the others have a better chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally out of the question,'' to the deeply religious,
Nigerian born couple, Kirshon said.
</P>
<P>
   After Chukwu went into labor Sunday, medical teams from both
hospitals sprung into action.
</P>
<P>
   At about 7 a.m. _ roughly two hours after her contractions began
_ doctors had given Chukwu an anesthetic to numb her from the waist
down.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of the end of a grueling pregnancy. She had
spent the previous six weeks in bed, the last two inclined with her
head tilted toward the floor to take pressure off her abdomen.
Kirshon said Chukwu had not slept the night before and got only
about two hours of sleep a night in the days leading up to the
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   She also stopped eating and was fed intravenously to give the
babies more room.
</P>
<P>
   With teams from the Children's Hospital waiting in the hallway
to stabilize each infant, Kirshon performed the Cesarean Section in
a jammed packed delivery room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine _ one baby after the next _ its like a
factory, a conveyor belt,'' Krishon said. He said Chukwu was able
to see her newborns about an hour after the delivery as staff
members filed past her with the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked at the babies and she smiled. She was excited,''
Kirshon said.
</P>
<P>
   So was nurse Kasie Clark, 25, who helped coordinate the eighteen
to twenty people who crowded the delivery room at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that I may never personally see again in my
career,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   People and businesses from Houston and beyond responded quickly
Monday with gifts for the city's newest celebrities. One anonymous
donor pledged a lifetime supply of diapers; the Drypers Corp.
pledged a lifetime supply of baby wipes and disposable training
pants; Randall's Food Market donated a one-year supply of
groceries; Mead Johnson Nutrionals offered a one-year supply of
formula; and Holt Educational Outlet donated educational toys.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers at the hospital said multiple births have become more
common as more women opt for fertility drugs. Last month a woman
delivered sextuplets at the hospital_five survived_and as of
Monday, 36 babies from multiple births were being cared for at the
Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Now doctors are waiting for the Chukwu's to replace their babies
letters with names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to have some names because it would be easier to
keep track of the babies,'' Savrick said.

 WASHINGTON: the president.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who suggested on Sunday that
senators return to Washington and work things out immediately, said
on Monday in an interview that it was hard for senators to sound
each other out and seek agreement. He said, ``One of the
difficulties here _ it also may be a blessing from the leaderships'
standpoint _ is we're not in session.''
</P>
<P>
   The four congressmen behind Monday's letter said that the Senate
should take into account such issues as the connection between
Clinton's conduct and his official duties and ``the will of the
American voter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe those factors may lead the Senate to conclude that
a remedy short of removal is in order,'' they wrote, and urged Lott
to make sure the Senate could have a full debate on censure.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the president's press secretary, Joseph
Lockhart, continued to urge a quick compromise. ``The overwhelming
majority of Americans want this over with and they'd like it over
with soon,'' he said. ``I don't see any advantage _ nor does anyone
that works here see an advantage _ in not finding some way to
quickly dispatch this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Clinton advisers are not convinced that censure will prove
to be in the president's interest. They argue that the charges
against Clinton are flimsy, and would not withstand the robust
examination that the White House could make during a Senate trial.
A trial that resulted in acquittal, these advisers believe, would
bolster Clinton and do lasting damage to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But generally, White House officials are concerned about
Clinton's ability to govern in the interim. Some sort of quick
compromise, they say, is in the country's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made that appeal on Monday, speaking at the White House as
he presented an award for the use of plain language by federal
employees. He called the impeachment vote by the House on Saturday
``wrong for our Constitution and wrong for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks suggested that he intends to serve in a
high-profile defense role before the Senate, where he served for
eight years before becoming vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do hope that the United States Senate will rise to this
moment, as it so often does, to be the voice of reason,
deliberation, and healing that America needs,'' he continued. He
urged the Senate to ``end this matter promptly'' and to end it ``in
a way that will respect the will and the wisdom of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that he and the president would ``continue to focus
all of our energies on the business of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried to do so by example on Monday, stopping by the
D.C. Central Kitchen, a non-profit organization, and putting on a
white apron to spend about a half-hour helping make lasagna for the
hungry with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When cameras and reporters were admitted to the kitchen _ for
the image the White House wanted to project and the questions it
could not avoid _ Clinton was asked what the Senate could expect
from him and his defense team.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few days to celebrate the season,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had a message for Congress, Clinton said, ``I hope
everyone in the country will take some time to think about other
people and do something in the spirit of the season like this.''

MAKER OF GENERIC DRUGS ACCUSED OF ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Fla., Ill., Minn., N.Y., N.C., Ohio, Pa., W.Va.,
Wis.)  (rl) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission charged Monday that
Mylan Laboratories, one of the world's biggest makers of generic
drugs, had violated antitrust laws, and the government said it
would seek $120 million in refunds for consumers of two medications
widely used to treat symptoms of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys general from 10 states planned to file a lawsuit
making similar accusations this week.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said Mylan had entered illegal agreements with
one of its suppliers to eliminate competition in the market for the
two generic drugs. Doctors write more than 21 million prescriptions
a year for the medications.
</P>
<P>
   Mylan denied all the charges. Milan Puskar, chairman of the
Pittsburgh-based company, said the commission's action was
``radical, rushed and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Mylan's shares dropped $3.3125, to $26.75, in New York Stock
Exchange trading after the accusations were announced.
</P>
<P>
   The government asserts that after locking up the supply of raw
materials, Mylan was able to raise prices to an astounding degree.
In January, the agency said,Mylan raised the wholesale price for
one drug, clorazepate, to $377 for a bottle of 500 tablets, up from
$11.36 for the same quantity. And in March, it said, the wholesale
price for the other drug, lorazepam, went to $190, from $7.30, for
a bottle of 500 tablets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mylan's outrageous price increases have cost consumers at
least $120 million in higher prices,'' said William Baer, director
of the agency's bureau of competition. Patients, many of them
elderly, take these drugs for long periods, and it may be dangerous
for them to halt treatment suddenly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baer said Mylan's price increases had generated ``a tremendous
number of consumer complaints,'' more than any other issue in the
last four years, as well as a large number of protests from members
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the generic drugs cost much less than the
brand-name versions, even after the price increases. But he said
the lawsuit was justified as a way to preserve competition among
makers of generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The brand-name version of lorazepam is Ativan, made by the
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories unit of American Home Products Corp. The
brand-name version of clorazepate, Tranxene, is made by Abbott
Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Arquit of Rogers &AMP; Wells, a lawyer for Mylan, said,
``Mylan's prices for the generic drugs are less than half of the
prices for the brand-name products, which are therapeutically
identical.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted 4 to 0 Monday to sue Mylan in federal
court. The complaint will name four defendants: Mylan; Profarmaco,
an Italian company that supplies raw materials to Mylan; the
Cambrex Corporation of East Rutherford, N.J., which is the parent
of Profarmaco, and Gyma Laboratories of America, based in Westbury,
N.Y., a distributor for Profarmaco.
</P>
<P>
   In demanding refunds, the commission is testing a relatively new
enforcement strategy. The agency often seeks injunctions requiring
violators of the antitrust laws to halt their illegal conduct, but
it has rarely tried to force companies to surrender what the
commission regards as ill-gotten gains.
</P>
<P>
   Mylan said its agreement with Profarmaco had a legitimate
purpose: to guarantee an adequate, uninterrupted supply of
chemicals. But, it said, in the last few weeks it decided not to
enforce provisions of the contract under which Mylan was to receive
all the output of certain chemicals made by Profarmaco.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest annual report, Mylan said that it had taken ``a
very aggressive position and raised prices'' on many products.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Hovenkamp, a University of Iowa professor who wrote a
leading treatise on antitrust law, said a court order requiring
consumer refunds was ``an aggressive remedy'' for the FTC to seek
at the start of an case.
</P>
<P>
   Baer said the complaint would charge that Mylan had violated
Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, which
outlaws ``unfair methods of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission is accusing Mylan of restraint of trade,
monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize the markets for the two
generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has often won refunds in cases that involve
direct mail or telemarketing fraud that enticed consumers to invest
in get-rich-quick schemes or to buy lottery tickets or vacation
trips. Typically, the government or the company establishes a pool
of money, reviews claims and pays refunds to consumers. But that
sort of remedy is unusual in FTC antitrust cases.
</P>
<P>
   Baer said the price increases by themselves would not have been
illegal. ``What's unlawful,'' he said, ``is for companies to get
together and conspire to exclude rivals and raise price. By
cornering the supply of raw materials _ even if you don't corner
100 percent of the supply, if you corner a substantial percentage
of it _ that gives you market power, the power over price. When
Mylan went to Profarmaco, it knew that if it was able to achieve an
exclusive agreement, it would be able to raise price, and that's
exactly what it did.''
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report, Mylan stated that it was losing money on
41 of 97 generic products in December 1997, and that it ``faced a
business decision: raise prices on the specific products or stop
manufacturing them altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   The states that said they would join in a lawsuit against Mylan
are New York, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania,
Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

FASHION NOTES AND NEWS  
(JT)

<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No Rest on 7th Ave. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When American designers announced that they would show their
fall 1999 women's wear in February, two months earlier than usual,
there was a collective gulp on Seventh Avenue: The new schedule
meant the fashion industry's long year-end vacations might be cut
short.
</P>
<P>
   Now the holiday season has arrived and Marc Jacobs is in Paris,
working through the holidays on his collection for Louis Vuitton.
In New York, where Jacobs' office has usually been closed from
Christmas to New Year's, his business partner, Robert Duffy, will
keep the lights on.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, Marc could take a couple of weeks off in November
after the women's opening,'' Duffy said. ``This year, we started
the fall women's collection before we opened spring.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Badgley Mischka. ``Basically, we knew our schedules would
change, so we started working on fall earlier than usual,'' James
Mischka said. His partner, Mark Badgley, added, ``We've been going
crazy, but we will be in Los Angeles with our families for
Christmas and then on to Palm Beach, so I can get used to my new
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan will manage to take a holiday, ``but not with a lot
of peace of mind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be going from the mountains to the beach over the
holidays,'' she said, ``but I don't know how much I can relax,
knowing that I'll be opening menswear January 12 in Milan, DKNY
here on February 14 and the collection on February 19.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bartlett, whose Italian offices were closed for two weeks
last year, had planned a vacation in South Africa this year. But
between getting his Byblos menswear ready for a Jan. 8 opening in
Milan, Italy, along with preparing for the moved-up showing of his
John Bartlett collection of men's and women's wear in New York, he
has cut back to a three-day vacation with his family in Cincinnati.
``Cape Town will have to wait,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Yeohlee Goes Home &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Yeohlee Teng, whose clothes are in the ``Cubism and Fashion''
exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, will celebrate the
turning of the century as the featured designer in a clothing and
architecture exhibition in her native Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   She and the architect Ken Yeang will show what they call
environmentally responsive clothing and architecture, first in
Kuala Lumpur in March 2000, and later that year in Penang. The
designer said she would also try to link fashion and art in the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Met show opened my eyes to fashion as art,'' said Ms.
Teng, whose label is called Yeohlee. ``I see fashion as art with a
function attached to it. It is an art form that only succeeds when
it works as clothing.'' She cited her cubist black-and-white
one-size-fits-all silk jacquard cape in the Met show as wearable
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``While art has emotional content, it doesn't have a real
function,'' she said. ``It may lift your soul, but it doesn't
necessarily keep you warm.''
</P>
<P>
   The cape will keep you warm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Rainbow of Silks &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In what promises to be one of the most colorful spring seasons
in years, it will be possible to wear Easter-egg colors during the
Easter season. Shalini, a New York designer, is making the most of
fashion's new coalition with the rainbow by offering several
designs in an astonishing 60 shades. That's the number of colors
offered by one of her suppliers, Taroni Mills of Italy, a prominent
silk maker, for specific fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   The designer gives retailers the Italian mills' color swatches,
they show them to customers and Shalini delivers the outfit four to
six weeks later. Shalini, whose full name is Shalini Kumar, has a
spring collection priced from about $600 for pants and skirts to
$1,200 for jackets. They will be available in January at Saks Fifth
Avenue stores in New York and elsewhere, and at Ultimo in Chicago.

LOTS OF SPORTS GAMES FOR KIDS FOUND AT THESE SITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attention kids: That big holiday gift overwhelming the others in
the front room might very well be a fully loaded, Internet-ready
computer this year.
</P>
<P>
   Attention parents: If that's the case _ and chances are the
youngsters have scratched off enough wrapping paper to tell _ it's
time to get acquainted with all of the youth-related sports Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, before you visit any of these sites, make sure you're
loaded with the Macromedia Shockwave (www.macromedia.com) plug-in.
You'll need this handy downloadable free software for the many
interactive games found at these user-friendly sites:
</P>
<P>
   NFL (www.nfl.com/playfootball): The NFL's official site has
several Shockwave games, including Soak the Coach, a game in which
users control the coach, who has a new suit and is avoiding a
Goop-ade shower from his players.
</P>
<P>
   Another cool game is the 2-Minute Drill, a good place for those
knuckleheads who think Cowboys coach Chan Gailey has an easy job as
offensive coordinator. Simply direct the team of your choice _
select Cowboys for the challenge _ 70 yards for the winning
touchdown with two minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Young users can also check out information about NFL-sponsored
flag football; punt, pass and kick contests and summer skill camps
and the always-popular take-a-player-to-school program.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball (www.majorleaguebaseball.com): The site's
Fun and Games section has three interactive games. The best is Big
League Vendor, a game in which users toss hot dogs, peanuts and
beer to ballpark fans for points. Users must hit 7 of 10 targets to
advance to each level. It's not easy and, at the beer level, users
lose points for throwing a beer to a minor.
</P>
<P>
   The site's other interactive games are Batting Practice and
Relief Pitcher. If the site's games grow tiresome, it also has
links to sites featuring recent video-game releases.
</P>
<P>
   nhl4kids (www.nhl4kids.com): NHL.com, the league's official
site, has developed an impressive site for young NHL fans. It has
instructional sections (Yo, Coach and Hockey Talk), merchandise and
yes, several games.
</P>
<P>
   The best game might be Dress the Players, where the object is to
fully clothe a player or goalie in the proper sequence. Any mistake
_ such as putting on a glove before pants _ means the game won't
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Illustrated'' for Kids (www.sikids.com): Besides sports
advice and other features found in the magazine, the SI for Kids
site specializes in Shockwave games in all sports.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more popular is the Deion vs. Deion game in which
Deion Sanders battles himself as receiver and defensive back. The
best thing about this game: No worries about him injuring his toe.
</P>
<P>
   Football Frenzy is an interesting game, too. Players must battle
killer cheerleaders, crazed cheeseheads and a runaway army tank to
reach the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The advice section takes on tough questions, including this
current post: ``What if you're not the best player on your team and
it seems like you're getting in the way?''
</P>
<P>
   CHAT HIGHLIGHTS: Orlando Miracle player Nykesha Sales is
scheduled to chat live on WNBA.com, the WNBA's official site, at
3:30 p.m. Tuesday ... San Diego Chargers linebacker Junior Seau on
NFL.com's Quarterback Club (www.nfl.com/qbclub) at 7 p.m. Tuesday
... Tampa Bay quarterback Trent Dilfer, 8 p.m. Tuesday, Team NFL on
America Online (keyword: live).
</P>
<P>
   BEST SPORTS SITE: ESPN.com was selected top sports site,
according to Yahoo! Internet Life in its third annual Top o' the
Net survey. CBS SportsLine was No. 2 and CNN/SI.com was No. 3.

 &HT;    Neal V. Loving defied gravity, prejudice
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Neal V. Loving, who became an aviator despite
racial prejudice and kept flying long after a glider accident
resulted in the amputation of his legs, died Saturday at
Springfield Community Hospital. The retired research aerospace
engineer from Yellow Springs, Ohio was 82.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an extremely nice man _ you couldn't find a better
one,'' said Robert Cavanagh, who worked with Loving at the Flight
Dynamics Laboratory. ``His accomplishments _ you almost stood in
awe.''
</P>
<P>
   If, as he said in an interview with the Dayton Daily News last
year, ``success is loving what you do,'' Mr. Loving was a very
successful man.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Detroit on Feb. 4, 1916, Mr. Loving was smitten by
aviation after seeing his first airplane in 1926. A Detroit high
school principal told him in 1931 that there was ``no place for
colored people'' in aviation, and he learned that his race
disqualified him for the Army Air Corps, but that didn't stop him
from learning to fly. He built his first aircraft, a glider, in
1936.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, Mr. Loving's glider nose-dived 100 feet and crashed at
65 mph. Doctors had to amputate both of Mr. Loving's legs, and
while he was in the hospital, his mother died and his fiancee
backed out of their engagement.
</P>
<P>
   He resumed flying after his recovery, and started his own flying
school in 1946. He also continued to design and build full-sized
aircraft. One of his planes, a racer called ``Loving's Love,'' was
donated to the Experimental Aircraft Association's Air Education
Museum in Oshkosh, Wis. The plane's name became the title of his
autobiography, published in 1994 by the Smithsonian Institution
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Loving flew Loving's Love in 1953 to Jamaica, where he met
Clare Barnett, who became his wife in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, at the age of 40, Mr. Loving started work on a college
degree in aeronautical engineering. He became an engineer with the
Flight Dynamics Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in
1961, remaining there until his retirement in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Loving continued to fly planes until 1991. His many honors
include the George ``JR'' Wedekind Award at the United States Air
Show, and the EAA Major Achievement Award, both presented in 1995.
In 1997, the Aviation Trail presented him with the Trailblazer
Award, given to Miami Valley residents who have made a significant
contribution to aviation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neal has been recognized as quite a figure in aviation
circles, overcoming all the obstacles he had,'' said, Wedekind the
president of Aviation Trails and one of the original organizers of
the United States Air and Trade Show. ``We're of course saddened by
the loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Loving is survived by his wife, his son, Paul, and his
daughter, Michelle.
</P>
<P>
   Donations can be made in Mr. Loving's memory to the EAA's Young
Eagles Program, P.O. Box 3086, Oshkosh, Wis. 54903-3086

 U.S. URGED TO EASE CALL TO INSPECT ATOMIC ARMS  (Eds: See also(mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Clinton administration, under pressure to
make some concession to other Security Council members after the
bombing of Iraq, may be willing to consider closing the file on
nuclear inspections, diplomats and independent arms control experts
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Security Council assembled Monday morning to
begin what was expected to be weeks of assessing where the United
Nations goes next on Iraq, it was apparent to diplomats that the
United States would have to compromise on something if other arms
inspections _ of biological, chemical and missile systems _ were to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   American officials would not speculate on what step the United
States might be prepared to make, saying the topic was being
discussed in Washington. They said Samuel Berger, the national
security adviser, was planning to clarify policy on Iraq in a
speech on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said Monday that closing the nuclear option seemed to
be the most palatable of limited choices for Washington as the
Council begins to negotiate a compromise plan to deal with Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is resisting strong pressure to replace
Richard Butler as head of the U.N. Special Commission. Again
Monday, the Russians insisted that Butler remained an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't trust him,'' said Yuri Fedotov, deputy Russian
representative on the Council.
</P>
<P>
   Other members say the Russian opposition to Butler is gaining
some support, if only as a way to remove a stumbling block for
dealing with the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has not resolved the nuclear issue, which is
sensitive. A spokesman for the National Security Council, David
Leavy, said Monday, referring to the International Atomic Energy
Agency: ``The nuclear file is closer to being closed than the
others. And when the IAEA says to close it we'll agree to close it.
But the U.S. government's position as of Monday stays the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent experts who say they believe that the question might
be closed say the Energy Department is stepping up efforts at its
nuclear laboratories at Los Alamos and Livermore to develop more
sophisticated sensors for environmental monitoring of Iraq, the
system that the United Nations would have to rely on after most
spot inspections had ended.
</P>
<P>
   For a year the atomic agency has been reporting that it cannot
find evidence of a nuclear-weapons program in Iraq. That finding
would allow the Security Council to end a period of intrusive
inspections that began in 1991 and shift to long-term monitoring.
The United States has blocked all Council efforts to do that.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and Britain flatly oppose removing
Butler from the special commission, which oversees the inspections
of biological, chemical and missile systems. Washington also
opposes calls to reorganize the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombing, Iraq has ruled out any further cooperation
with weapons inspectors. But it is willing to have the IAEA run its
monitoring from inside Iraq. The agency insists that its monitoring
can detect nuclear activity.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Leventhal, president of the independent Nuclear Control
Institute in Washington, who opposes closing the books on Iraqi
nuclear work, said in an interview Monday that the administration
appeared to believe that agreeing to close the nuclear file would
save the special commission. He added that in view of the pressures
on Butler and Iraq's determination not to work with him or his
commission, it may not be possible to keep the old inspection
system intact. All the inspectors have left Iraq.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Nuclear Control Institute has recommended that the
commission be given control of nuclear inspections, because,
Leventhal said, the International Atomic Energy Agency has been
``bamboozled'' by the Iraqis and let Saddam's government off too
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least the IAEA should be held accountable for its
nonalarmist assessment of Iraq's nuclear-weapons program,''
Leventhal said. ``The IAEA trivializes all missing information.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article to be published this week in Arms Control Today,
the journal of the independent Arms Control Association in
Washington, two other experts say, ``Essentially all of Iraq's
pre-gulf war nuclear facilities and equipment have been eliminated
or converted to nonproscribed purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the article finds that Iraq has continued intensive research
to solve problems that the bomb program had encountered earlier.
The article was written by David Albright, president of the
Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, and
Khidhir Hamza, an exile Iraqi nuclear scientist who was formerly in
charge of developing a nuclear weapon for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The article said, ``Iraq could make a nuclear device within two
to 12 months after deciding to do so, assuming it acquired
sufficient fissile material.''

RESPECTED MILITARY LEADER SHAHAK A FAVORITE TO BECOME ISRAELI PRIME
MINISTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ He is a respected military leader, a charismatic
speaker and a nimble peacemaker whom the late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin entrusted to negotiate peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, 54, a former military chief of
staff, also became a favorite for prime minister of Israel after
the Knesset gave preliminary approval to a bill to dissolve the
parliament and hold early elections.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had been expected to pass, because Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu virtually endorsed early elections last
week. On Monday, the measure flew through the legislature with
support from both coalition and opposition members.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all eyes are on Shahak, a popular war veteran. Speculation
of his impending entry into Israeli politics underscores the
emergence of a new political center _ one that is gaining momentum
among a sector of the population greatly dissatisfied with the two
major parities.
</P>
<P>
   Soon to become a private citizen, the general hasn't formally
entered the political fray, and it remains to be seen whether he'll
be able to for the upcoming election. According to Israeli law, a
retired high-ranking army officer must wait 100 days after leaving
the service before he can formally enter politics.
</P>
<P>
   But, already he's being touted as the Israeli most likely to
beat Netanyahu and opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak. An
opinion poll conducted earlier this month showed Shahak trouncing
Netanyahu by 52 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another poll taken this month found that 63 percent wanted
Shahak to enter politics, 32 percent as the head of a new centrist
party and 50 percent as Barak's No. Two in the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he's kind of the Colin Powell of Israeli
politics,'' said Mark Heller, an analyst with the Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University who was referring to the
retired U.S. general.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Shahak) hasn't been in Israeli politics so he's seen as a
kind of white arrow, a straight neck, and that's what makes him
popular,'' Heller said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 and 1995, Shahak led Israel's negotiating team during
talks that produced the Cairo Agreement, better known in Israel as
Oslo II, a huge, meticulously negotiated document that fleshed out
the details of land-transfers to the Palestinians, security
arrangements and civilian questions referred to more broadly in the
initial agreement negotiated in Oslo, Norway, in 1993. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; As a result, he earned a reputation for being pro-Oslo, even
though as an army officer, he refrained from making political
statements. Today, he still hasn't disclosed in public his stand on
peacemaking with the Palestinians _ or any other issues of Israeli
politics. But he once said that Israel should not run the lives of
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The same poll in which 63 percent of Israelis wanted Shahak to
enter politics found that 73 percent did not know what his views
were on any of the important questions on the national agenda.
</P>
<P>
   With new elections on the horizon, there will be increasing
pressure on Shahak to say what he believes in. But the fact that he
is immensely popular without staking out a political platform is
telling commentary on a public that both implicitly trusts military
leaders and searches for someone who can carry Rabin's torch in
peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Barak held this image when he first took the helm of the Labor
Party last year. But unlike Shahak, he lacks charisma, often coming
across intelligent but lifeless on television, an image that has
hurt him in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak hasn't come through very well,'' said David Kimche, an
author and former director of Israel's Foreign Ministry. ``He lacks
experience with the media. (Shahak) has a better chance of beating
Netanyahu than Barak does today.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming months, Barak's deadpan image may change. He's hired
U.S. spin-meisters James Carville and two others to help him
repackage himself. But Barak's supporters are still worried.
Rabin's widow, Leah, asked Shahak to join Labor instead.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the general has refused and insisted instead on forging
a new centrist party, possibly with Likud moderate Dan Meridor, one
of Netanyahu's former ministers who resigned months ago in protest.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect has Netanyahu worried that Shahak will beat Barak
in a three-way race and leave Netanyahu to face him in a runoff.
Some of Netanyahu's advisers are counseling the prime minister to
resign so that elections would be held in 60 days _ a tactic that
would prevent Shahak from running because of the 100-day
no-politics rule military officers must observe.
</P>
<P>
   Other Netanyahu advisers say he should stave off elections as
long as possible, both to allow the excitement over Shahak to
dissipate as his political views become known and to wait for
Israel's sagging economy to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, said Kimche, Shahak is the man to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a man who is still very clean as far as politics are
concerned,'' he said. ``He's fresh out of the army, with a very
good record in the army, and considered by the people to speak
clearly about the need for the country, so people look to him as a
way out of the country's morass.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Kimche added, ``it depends on what his election platform
will be. It's still very early.''

   EUROPEAN GOODS FACE TARIFFS IN BANANA DISPUTE
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said that as early as February it
would put 100 percent tariffs on $500 million worth of
European-made goods because European leaders have refused to open
their markets to bananas shipped by two U.S. companies, Dole Food
and Chiquita Brands International.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the sanctions is to force the nations to open
their markets, and the list of European products that will soar in
price includes Louis Vuitton handbags, cotton bed linens and
cashmere sweaters. So far there is little hint of a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN PROPOSES SPENDING SPREE
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government's proposed $708 billion budget aims to
lift the economy out of recession, but its vast size underscores
the pressing worry that a big spending spree now will break the
official coffers later. The budget includes a significant increase
in spending for roads, bridges, dams and other public works
intended to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's trade surplus declined in November for the first time in
20 months, but economists said that it would stay large and that
concerns about trade friction with the United States would persist
until Japan's economy recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund lowered its projection for 1999
world economic growth for the second time in three months, to 2.2
percent from 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   German exports plunged in the third quarter as recessions in
Japan and Russia eroded demand for autos, chemicals and machinery
made in Europe's largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   BIG GAINS FOR NETWORK SOLUTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Even as the government is moving forward with plans to hand
administration of the Internet's address system over to a nonprofit
corporation, Network Solutions, which now has an exclusive
government contract for registering Internet addresses in the
popular domains of .com, .net and .org, has joined the list of
Internet stocks rising to dizzying heights, more than tripling in
the last two weeks. One reason is alliances the company has reached
with Netscape, Yahoo and others.
</P>
<P>
   AMA OPPOSES AETNA ACQUISITION
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association has asked the Justice
Department to challenge Aetna Inc.'s $1 billion purchase of the
health-care business of Prudential Insurance. The doctors' group
says the deal, which would create the United States' largest HMO,
threatens consumers' ability to choose a health-care plan.
</P>
<P>
   YEAR 2000 LIABILITY CASE DROPPED
</P>
<P>
   In a setback for computer users looking for deep pockets to help
pay the cost of dealing with Year 2000 problems, J. Baker, an
apparel retailer, has dropped its claim that Andersen Consulting,
the designer of a computer system Baker installed in 1991, is
liable for the system's Year 2000 defects.

   TWO INSURGENTS ELECTED BY NASD

</P>
<P>
   BOND YIELDS HIT 3-WEEK HIGH
</P>
<P>
   Prices of U.S. bonds fell for a second time in three sessions,
pushing yields to a three-week high as rising prices for stocks
from New York to Hong Kong dimmed the allure of less risky
Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose
to 5.06 percent, from 5.00 percent on Friday.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The future looked bleak for Donald Byrd and his
modern-dance company, Donald Byrd/The Group, this time last year.
``The Harlem Nutcracker'' was a critical and popular success, but
the company's national tour of the lavish production was
foundering. As costs climbed, bills went unpaid. Some performances
had to be canceled. It looked as if the group might go under.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Byrd and his troupe are well on their way to
financial recovery. His faith in ``The Harlem Nutcracker,'' a
nine-year labor of love that begins a two-week engagement Tuesday
at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, has paid off. The company has
whittled down a debt of ``one-point-something million'' dollars
connected with the production, as Byrd put it recently, to
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company has an accumulated debt of about $250,000
that is not associated with ``The Harlem Nutcracker,'' it finished
its fiscal year with a surplus of several thousand dollars, a rare
occurrence in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the Duke Ellington-Billy Strayhorn ``Nutcracker
Suite,'' to which it is partly set, the reworking of the classic by
Byrd places the narrative in modern-day Harlem, where a black
grandmother reminisces about her youth. The production represented
a step up the ladder for the small, experimentalist New York
troupe, which seemed poised for major success.
</P>
<P>
   The company extended its five-city tour this winter to eight
weeks from five. ``We are planning next year to send out two
companies,'' said Benjamin Mordecai, the theatrical producer and
assistant dean at the Yale School of Drama, whom Byrd brought in
last year as executive producer of ``The Harlem Nutcracker.'' ``We
have enough interest to fill up about eight weeks for each company.
And we're hoping to go to more cities, ideally 10 altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   A 16-member jazz ensemble made up of senior Ellington musicians
has replaced the quartet that toured with the company. The choirs
that were hired in each city, in addition to 27 local child
performers, are now gospel choruses. ``The Harlem Nutcracker'' now
features a cast of more than 80 dancers, singers and musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd has tinkered with the production, too, rechoreographing and
recostuming some parts that had disappointed him, streamlining the
physical production and rehearsing his dancers even harder than
usual. ``It is exciting to see disciplined bodies working,'' he
said. ``With a rigorousness of approach, with authenticity and
honesty, the experience is being recreated every evening as if it
were the first time the dance is being done.''
</P>
<P>
   Streamlining the ballet's technical requirements helped get the
scenery up faster, said Mordecai, now a consultant to the company.
``Before I became involved, it took three days. Now it takes 10
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The producer also has made better deals with presenting
theaters, Byrd said. ``Ben asked for fees appropriate to what we
were doing,'' he said. ``We had been underselling the production
because of our desire to run it as a community-based operation.
Presenters made money before, but we lost. We've had to think a
little more commercially.''
</P>
<P>
   Another important factor in the production's resurgence has been
the involvement of Aetna. In addition to the sponsorship fee, Aetna
is involved in setting up community events like opening-night
benefits for local community organizations in tour cities. Aetna
has contributed $250,000, according to Willard I. Hill, vice
president and head of emerging markets for Aetna Retirement
Services, the division sponsoring the production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sponsorship is tied into a new business operation I am
creating and managing, targeting the high-growth segments of the
African-American, Latino and women business-owners markets,'' Hill
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ``Nutcracker'' debacle, the company has been able to
continue touring a new full-evening piece, ``Jazz Train.'' Byrd is
at work on several one-act dances in celebration of the centenary
of Ellington's birth next year, for a New York season in March. But
Byrd admits to a lingering worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me a little nervous that dance doesn't just need to
be interesting, it needs to be an event,'' he said. ``Has American
dance caught up with the rest of American culture and become a
commodity? We had to be mindful of that trend and use some of the
methods other media use. I still have to remember that artistic
quality matters. If work is not very good, then people won't
come.''

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Robert Livingston saw Larry Flynt's ad in The
Washington Post in October offering $1 million to anyone who could
prove the sexual indiscretions of members of Congress, but he said
he shrugged it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I didn't think of the impact of a million bucks,''
Livingston rued on Monday. ``I just can't believe that somebody
would do that to me. Welcome to the big leagues. Welcome to the big
world. Welcome to the world of Larry Flynt. I just didn't think it
possible that he would do what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Livingston pressed on over the next weeks of Republican
tumult, offering himself as a candidate for speaker of the House
without telling his colleagues what he was finally forced to admit
on Thursday _ that he had ``on occasion strayed from my marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure came only after he was made aware last week for
the first time that Flynt, the publisher of Hustler, the sex
magazine, was investigating his past. Word of the investigation led
to Livingston's breathtaking announcement Saturday in the midst of
the impeachment debate on the House floor that he would not stand
for speaker and that he would quit Congress altogether in six
months.
</P>
<P>
   And because Livingston is so liked by his colleagues, his
resignation has escalated the debate over the intersection of
public and private behavior and whether politicians like Livingston
should in essence give in to the neo-Puritanism that seems to
demand sainthood in office-holders.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy interview on Monday in his office, Livingston, by
turns doleful and then smarting at certain lines of inquiry, said
he resigned for several reasons. He said he had ``no defense'' for
his extramarital behavior, that he had undermined his own
credibility and that he wanted to send a message about the
destruction caused by people like Flynt.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was uncertain himself what the limits were of
legitimate inquiry into the private lives of public figures. ``This
is so far beyond anything I ever thought about,'' he said. ``I'm
not blaming anybody. I only have myself to blame for what happened,
and I'm not justifying it, I'm not shaking fingers. But if it's
going to be government-by-Larry-Flynt, the country's in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Certainly, people have a right to believe in their
leaders. But it's your professional life that counts most. That
being said, I don't tolerate lying under oath, I've never lied
under oath, and I've not committed any crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynt has said that his ad in The Washington Post drew 2,000
responses. He said that he believed about 48 of them were
legitimate and that he relied on 12 of those for a story to be
published, perhaps as soon as January, in which he details the
indiscretions of a dozen Republicans, including Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt, who said he wanted to expose the ``hypocrisy'' of those
who were going after President Clinton for lying about his sex
life, said that his investigators found that Livingston had been
involved with four women outside his marriage in the last 10 years.
He has not disclosed further details.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said he was not sure what Hustler might print. ``I've
heard all sorts of horrible rumors about what the Flynt stuff is,''
he said. ``I will tell you, it's mostly BS. It's mostly wrong,
stuff that never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was aware of rumors that investigators were checking
out his past in New Orleans. But only last Tuesday, he said, did he
receive confirmation, getting a call at midnight from his district
representative.
</P>
<P>
   He said he called a friend who is also a lawyer in Washington.
``He took some action which I'm not going to go into that more or
less confirmed that there was an investigation,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Wednesday and Thursday _ as he juggled the
president's confidential alert to him that the bombing in Iraq was
imminent, and as he wrangled with Democrats over the procedures for
the impeachment vote _ he and his friend discussed what he should
do about the Flynt investigation. He decided to tell his colleagues
on Thursday night. He said his wife, Bonnie, supported whatever
course of action he chose. He never offered to resign, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He read a statement to his colleagues in a closed-door meeting
and issued the same statement to reporters. It said he had ``on
occasion strayed from my marriage,'' but that he had sought
marriage and spiritual counseling and had been forgiven by his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Taking care to distinguish between his own conduct and that of
Clinton, his statement from last week said: ``I want to assure
everyone that these indiscretions were not with employees on my
staff, and I have never been asked to testify under oath about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston reiterated that on Monday. ``As I stated in my
statement, I didn't lie under oath, there was nobody in the
workplace, there was no business relationship.'' He added: ``There
was no improper activity with legislative business or
appropriations. I categorically deny that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But a handful of conservatives, including Reps. Zach Wamp of
Tennessee, Steve Largent of Oklahoma and Lindsey Graham of South
Carolina, were worried that Livingston was putting Republicans in a
precarious position and were upset that he had not revealed his
past before he ran for speaker in November.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said he did not tell his colleagues because he
thought no one would find out. ``Had I realized people would do
those kind of things,'' he said of Flynt, ``I certainly wouldn't
have held myself up in this position.'' He added that he thought
Flynt would eventually get his ``just rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   He sat in the House chamber Friday and started writing his
speech, to be delivered Saturday morning, in which he would explain
his vote to impeach Clinton, believing the president committed
perjury. He did not like his first draft, wrote a second and was
still not happy with it. ``It lacked a punch line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He went to bed that night still not certain what he would do. He
bolted awake at 2 a.m. and wrote the ending, in which he said he
would resign and that Clinton should follow his example.
</P>
<P>
   He said on Monday that in the end, he ran out of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for speaker, he said, was ``intense beyond all belief.
I didn't mind lending myself to that intensity when my heart was in
it and my spirit was up. But I knew that this was going to continue
and that as long as I was there, Larry Flynt was going to be there.
And on top of that, I knew that with a 5-vote margin and 18 guys
disconcerted about my conduct, I was facing an impossible
situation. The confluence of those conditions just made my role
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I had no defense. So I had to accept reality. Was it
better to cut my losses and set an example for a president I
thought should have followed my advice? Or was it better simply to
let events happen and be consumed by them? I chose the former.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped his resignation would prompt an outcry so that
by the time Flynt published his story about other politicians,
there would be a backlash. ``I figured it was too late to help me,
but I hoped that by calling attention to it, it might help them _
let the world see this bottom-feeder for what he is,'' he said of
Flynt.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokeswoman on Monday, Flynt rejected the
characterization of him as a bottom-feeder. ``It takes one to know
one,'' she quoted Flynt as saying. ``He got down in the mud first.
I just jumped down with him.''

PENTAGON PROPOSES LARGEST MILITARY PAY RAISE SINCE 1982 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to make a career in the military more
enticing, the Pentagon on Monday proposed raises as large as 9.9
percent for mid-career officers and noncommissioned officers as
part of a sweeping package that calls for the largest increases in
military pay and pensions since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has already announced his intention to
increase military salaries by 4.4 percent for all 1.4 million
soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, starting in January 2000.
But the Pentagon's proposal would earmark additional raises for
those officers and enlisted personnel whose experience and training
have made them highly sought after in the civilian marketplace and
who the Pentagon says have been quitting the armed services in
droves.
</P>
<P>
   The largest increases will go to majors, lieutenant colonels and
colonels in the Army, Air Force and Marines _ the equivalent of
lieutenant commanders, commanders and captains in the Navy _ who
have served six to 14 years. The Pentagon estimated that more than
1 million troops would receive anywhere from half a percent to 5.5
percent above the base increase.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen and the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, announced the increases as
part of a package that also included an increase in retirement
benefits. They described the increases as vital to recruiting
qualified officers and enlisted personnel _ and keeping them in the
armed services at a time when the economy is churning along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the best that we can attract, and we are working in an
environment in which it's very hard to compete against a robust
economy,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House immediately released a statement from Clinton
endorsing the proposed changes. Congress still must approve any of
the changes, but that is considered likely because there is broad
bipartisan support when it comes to pay and troops. Last year, for
example, the Clinton administration proposed a 3.1 percent
increase, and Congress raised it to 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the raises are the largest since a newly elected
President Reagan approved increases of 14.3 percent for officers
and 10 to 17 percent for enlisted personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The raises and changes in retirement will cost $30 billion over
six years. That is more than a quarter of the $112 billion increase
the Pentagon has asked Clinton to approve in his next budget,
including $10 billion above the Defense Department's projected $258
billion budget for the fiscal year that begins next October.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has supported the raises, Clinton and his budget
aides have objected to a $10 billion real increase. Instead,
officials said, the Defense Department will receive between $3
billion and $5 billion, significantly less but still the first real
increase in defense spending, adjusted for inflation, since 1991
when spending spiked for the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen declined to discuss the overall budget, which the White
House is expected to finish this week and unveil early next year.
But he said he had received ``a satisfactory solution'' to the
wrangling between Pentagon officials and Clinton's budget aides.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has tried for years to rewrite the pay table that
sets pay by rank and years of service, which has become skewed by
incremental changes since it was created after World War II. For
example, officers receive their single largest pay raises not for
any promotion up the ranks but rather for reaching their third year
of service _ a legacy of the Vietnam era, when the Pentagon was
trying to persuade officers not to quit after completing their
three-year commissions.
</P>
<P>
   But previous proposals never advanced, largely because they
required some ranks to take pay cuts for others to receive raises.
The new proposal would insure that no one receives a cut, although
some will receive bigger raises than others.
</P>
<P>
   Raises will also more closely mirror both years of service and
promotions. For example, a major with two years experience will
receive a 4.4 percent increase next year, but a major with six
years will receive 5.5 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   For the major with six years of experience _ just at the point
when he or she is deciding whether to make a career of military
service _ pay will rise to $3,798.60 a month, $342.30 more than
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to enable us to do a better in rewarding
performance, compensating people for their skills, their education,
their experience, and also to encourage them to continue their
military service,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The proposed changes in pensions would allow those with 20 years
of service to retire once again with 50 percent of their salary.
Those who joined since 1986, when the military pension system was
last rewritten, have faced the prospect of retiring with only 40
percent. At the time, the decrease had been intended to persuade
people to serve longer in order to retire with higher pensions, but
it had the opposite effect, convincing people to get out long
before retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Daniel DeMilio, a 13-year-veteran of the Marine Corps
who repairs helicopter radio and navigation equipment, said the
increases would ``bring things more in line with civilian pay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After doing a little math, I found that I'll be able to help
out with my daughter's college fund,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he added a fundamental fact about a career in the
military: ``You're never going to be a millionaire.''

STUDIES HINT THAT INJECTIONS CAN RELIEVE HEART AILMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two small studies have shown that over the course of just a few
weeks, one dose of experimental drugs injected directly into the
heart can greatly relieve, or even eliminate, the chest pain of
coronary artery disease by encouraging the growth of new blood
vessels to bypass clogged arteries, according to researchers in the
United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The research is at a preliminary stage, and the drugs have yet
to be tested in large groups of people. Even if the results hold
up, it may be years before any therapy is available for patients
who suffer from such chest pain, or angina.
</P>
<P>
   One of the treatments under study is gene therapy to produce a
protein called vegF, for vascular endothelial growth factor. The
other entails injection of a protein called FGF-1, for fibroblast
growth factor.
</P>
<P>
   Each drug is given in a single injection, through a surgical
incision in the chest. In effect, both treatments aim to allow
patients to grow their own heart bypasses by sprouting thin
``collateral'' blood vessels, in a strategy called therapeutic
angiogenesis.
</P>
<P>
   The same gene therapy involved in one of these treatments has
been shown to be effective in building new blood vessels in the
legs, but these reports are the first to assert that gene therapy
has produced new vessels in the heart.
</P>
<P>
   The coronary gene therapy research, led by Dr. Jeffrey Isner of
St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Brighton, Mass., and Tufts University,
is reported in Tuesday's issue of Circulation, a journal published
by the American Heart Association. The protein therapy is being
developed by Dr. Thomas-Joseph Stegmann of Fulda, Germany, a
leading figure in the field, who discussed his work in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   So far, tests of both therapies are in the first stage, where
research determines whether the treatment is safe to patients.
Ordinarily researchers do not make claims for effectiveness until
later stages, involving testing on larger groups of people, are
completed.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers said in interviews that they were struck by
the improvements reported by more than 20 participants in these
early trials, even patients whose pain could not be controlled by
other drug therapy or bypass surgery. And the editor of the journal
decided that Isner's results, though preliminary, were significant
enough to warrant publication.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the participants reported substantial pain relief,
and some who were virtually homebound before receiving the
injection have painlessly resumed swimming, working out on exercise
bicycles and pursuing other physical activities.
</P>
<P>
   Pain relief usually began about three weeks after the procedure,
which, on average, took about an hour in an operating room, with
the patient under general anesthesia. The hospital stay was about
four days.
</P>
<P>
   Pain relief, even elimination of pain, has persisted in all
participants who showed improvement, the researchers said. ``How
long that will remain effective is anybody's guess,'' said Isner,
the first of whose patients received the injection only 10 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   St. Elizabeth's Hospital, with which Isner is affiliated, has
formed a company to test his therapy in larger trials. As for
Stegmann, he is a co-founder of Cardio-Vascular Genetic Engineering
Inc. of Irvine, Calif., which aims to develop angiogenesis
treatment for coronary artery disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Valentin Fuster, head of cardiology at Mount Sinai Medical
Center in New York City, said, ``It's exciting, but you should be
cautious about what will be the impact of all of this.'' Fuster,
president of the American Heart Association, said he doubted that
it would ``become a panacea for everyone'' with angina and coronary
heart disease. He was among experts interviewed who said much more
extensive research, taking years, would be needed before these or
similar therapies found their way into standard medical practice,
if they ever did.
</P>
<P>
   One important concern was that the two studies involved a small
number of patients. Another was that none could receive a placebo,
or dummy substance, as scientific controls to allow more rigorous
comparisons. For ethical reasons, the Food and Drug Administration
and hospital committees whose function is to protect volunteers
from harmful research declined to allow researchers to subject a
control group to the rigors of sham surgery that offered them no
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another concern was uncertainty about the long-term
benefits. Many doctors remember a number of drug and surgical
therapies for angina and other conditions that appeared spectacular
initially but that failed in the longer run.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless Isner's report ``is very compelling,'' said Dr.
Jonathan Marmur, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefit reported is pretty convincing,'' Marmur said,
``and requires confirmation with control studies.''
</P>
<P>
   Marmur and some other experts expressed optimism that these or
similar treatments might one day be administered through less
invasive procedures than chest surgery. For example, they might be
administered through a tube inserted into a leg or an arm and
threaded to the heart, a procedure known as cardiac
catheterization.
</P>
<P>
   Such approaches are now being tested in small numbers of
patients in trials at major medical centers in the United States.
Additional studies are on the drawing boards, with the ultimate aim
of giving the therapies intravenously in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   Although she expressed caution about Isner's report, Dr. Judith
Swain, who heads the department of medicine at Stanford University,
said she believed that the idea of using angiogenesis treatments
for coronary artery disease was ``an absolute winner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biotechnology and device companies,'' Dr. Swain said,
``are all salivating'' over the potential of these therapies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   VegF, the protein produced in Isner's therapy, is thought to be
the body's signal to grow new blood vessels, and the therapy is the
same as the one with which Isner's team has reported success in
treating blocked arteries in the legs of 75 patients since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In part because the newly grown blood vessels are much narrower
than coronary arteries, there was no guarantee that the therapy
that worked in the leg would do so in the heart. So the FDA was
cautious when, earlier this year, it allowed Isner's team to begin
injections into the heart. It authorized testing on only 30
patients, at a rate of only about one a week, and with initially
tiny doses.
</P>
<P>
   In the report being published Tuesday, Isner's team described
dramatic success with each of the first five patients treated with
vegF in its study. In an interview, Isner described similar
benefits in 15 additional patients, who were treated after the
report had been written. Isner said his team was administering the
injections as fast as the FDA would allow and hoped to complete the
initial safety trials in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of success was that patients reported using
substantially fewer nitroglycerine pills to relieve angina: 9.8
tablets per patient per week, from a previous average of 53.9.
Special approval from the FDA would be needed if a patient required
a second injection because pain relief had waned. But such a case
has not arisen, Isner said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors also reported objective scientific evidence of
improvement from tests like heart scans, electrocardiograms and
special X-rays known as coronary angiograms. The tests were
performed shortly before the therapy and were repeated 60 days
thereafter. Doctors not involved in the study scored the tests,
without knowing when and on whom they had been performed. The
doctors said that the angiograms showed evidence of new collateral
blood vessels and that no patient had evidence of a new heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The German study grew out of one that Stegmann's team reported
earlier this year, also in Circulation. In the earlier study, which
began nearly six years ago, Stegmann injected FGF-1 into the hearts
of one group of patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery.
Another group had bypass surgery without the FGF-1 injection.
</P>
<P>
   Stegmann's report that the group treated with FGF-1 could sprout
new blood vessels sent waves of enthusiasm through the world of
cardiology. Follow-up tests showed that the improvement in the
FGF-1-treated patients had persisted, Stegmann said, and that
``FGF-1 injections did not create uncontrolled growth of blood
vessels, as some had feared.''
</P>
<P>
   Because both therapies were given at the same time, however,
Stegmann's team could not be certain about the relative
contributions of the FGF-1 and the bypass surgery to the
improvement that the participants reported.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to give FGF-1 alone. Last month Stegmann's
team began injecting FGF-1 into the first of 20 patients, in a
study due to end by spring. In the month following the injection,
angina pain was abolished in two of the first four patients who
received FGF-1, and pain was greatly relieved in the other two,
Stegmann said in providing details of the unpublished findings.
</P>
<P>
   All experts agree that extensive further research is needed to
determine which therapy is the safest and most powerful, in what
amounts it should be administered, how often the injections have to
be given, and whether there are less invasive ways of providing the
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Isner's gene therapy entails injecting naked DNA, so called
because it is not inserted into a virus or some other material. If
naked DNA is injected directly into a vein, rather than into the
heart muscle as Isner administered it, enzymes that are designed to
attack any foreign substance will destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are testing vegF coated with membranes, or
inside a virus that has been crippled so it will not cause illness.
The studies will also test the safety of such coatings.
</P>
<P>
   In one trial, involving some 100 participants at about a dozen
medical centers, researchers are testing whether FGF-4, a chemical
cousin of FGF-1, and vegF protein will be effective if injected in
a cardiac catheterization.
</P>
<P>
   Marmur, of Mount Sinai, is conducting a study testing two forms
of therapy. One is a version of vegF made by Genentech Inc., a
subsidiary of Roche Holding Ltd. The other is FGF-4 that has been
inserted into an adenovirus, a cold virus; it is made by Berlex
Laboratories of Wayne, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which includes participants who will receive a
placebo as a control, is also being conducted at William Beaumont
Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich.; Duke University in Durham, N.C.;
Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore; the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn.; the University of Michigan; the University of Minnesota in
Minneapolis; the Minnesota Heart Clinic in Edina, Minn.; the
University of Pittsburgh; the University of Vermont in Burlington;
Washington Hospital Center in the District of Columbia; the
University of Washington in Seattle, and the Veterans Affairs
Hospital in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Stegmann said his team expected to do a similar catheter study
to inject FGF-1 next year. Isner said his team hoped to gain
approval next year to inject naked DNA vegF in cardiac
catheterizations.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- If the weekend was any indication, area retailers
will finish this holiday shopping season with fuller cash registers
than they did last year, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Business was brisk at stores and malls in Southern California
throughout the weekend, the season's last big weekend before
Christmas. It was particularly so Saturday, when last-minute
shoppers rushed retailers in crushing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But just because the parking lots were full over the weekend,
don't expect any relief in the last three shopping days before
Christmas. Retailers and analysts say the days leading up to
Christmas are as busy, if not busier, historically than the last
Saturday before the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Based on anecdotal evidence, retail analyst Richard Giss on
Monday stuck with his earlier prediction that Los Angeles area
merchants will see an average 4.5 percent to 5 percent increase
compared to last year's holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense was that (this weekend) was a little busier than last
year, and I think last year people were waiting for the sales,
which hit pretty late,'' said Giss, a partner with the trade retail
services group of the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche LLP.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Millman, general manager of the Burbank Media City
Center, said foot traffic through his mall was higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday was as busy here as I've seen it in the five seasons
I've been here,'' he said. ``I'm really looking forward to this
week. (Monday was) very, very busy and ... I think it's going to be
very, very busy all the way through the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the number of bags and packages customers carried,
it appeared that shoppers were buying and not just looking. Though
Millman did not yet have weekend results, the mall's merchants have
so far reported 5 percent to 7 percent sales increases compared to
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were a lot of transactions going on,'' Millman
said. ``At this point in the season, it's no longer browsing.
People are here to make purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   Other centers also reported healthy crowds.
</P>
<P>
   The car count at the Camarillo Premium Outlets center in Ventura
County was ahead in the ``double digits'' compared with last year,
according to general manager Terri Cameron. The center has,
however, about 15 more stores than it did last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our stores were ahead of last year and the car counts
were up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An arctic storm brough chilly weather to Southern California,
where the temperatures were in the 80s just a week before, but that
didn't stem the tide. Actually, the cold added to the Christmas
feeling, retailers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather had everyone all bundled up,'' Cameron said.
</P>
<P>
   Giss, who confessed to being among the weekend's hordes of
shoppers, said parking lots were full and lines were long at the
centers he visited. The shoppers, if not exactly in the merriest of
spirits, were quietly focused on the task at hand _ buying gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles area should end the season well compared to
other parts of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very busy. I think that the numbers in our area
continue to be strong,'' he said. ``The East Coast, however, is
suffering from the warm weather. Although the sales are brisk,
they're still behind in the apparel category.''

 &HT;    Sparks challenges Texas' clemency process
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A visibly irritated U.S. District Judge Sam
Sparks admonished state officials Monday over Texas' secretive
clemency process, challenging their refusal to hold hearings or
make public any aspects of their deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the horror of a hearing, since a majority of the other
states require a hearing?'' Sparks asked several times during the
opening day of the most significant court challenge in several
years to the controversial clemency process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not understand the resistance. For God's sakes, (you)
don't want to have a hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, when Parole Board Chairman Victor Rodriguez
insisted that to make the closed system more public might invite
more lawsuits by convicts and that there was no problem with the
current process, Sparks appeared to bristle again, quizzing him at
length about the need for such total secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   And when Rodriguez seemed to repeatedly dodge questions from
him, as well as from attorneys for condemned convicts Joseph
Stanley Faulder and Danny Lee Barber, Sparks warned: ``The next
speech might cost you a little of your salary,'' hinting of a
possible fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to give a speech you can do it out in front of the
TV cameras,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony is expected to resume this morning. Sparks could rule
as early as today on whether Texas' clemency system meets
constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Faulder and Barber two weeks ago challenged the
secrecy of the clemenary process as illegal. They insisted that
they were denied their due process rights guaranteed under the U.S.
Constitution because Texas' clemency system operates under rules
that are not publicly available and board votes are conducted in
secret and without explaination.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the argument was raised in an appeal seeking to save
his life, Barber was less than an hour from being executed at a
Huntsville prison. Faulder was to be executed the next day. Sparks
halted both executions pending Monday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Babcock, Faulder's attorney, and Kurt Sauer, representing
Barber, argued that the secrecy of Texas' current system illegally
denies due process to condemned criminals. ``A decision cannot be
arbitrary . . . but how are we to know whether a decision was
arbitrary if no reason is given?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Brent Hornsby, who supervises all clemency
paperwork, both testified how convicts' petitions, supporting
documents and filings by police, prosecutors, victims' families and
other relevant officials are forwarded quickly to parole board
members.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said board members are supposed to review the filings
before making their decision. Babcock suggested they may not even
read the documents.
</P>
<P>
   In Faulder's case, she said, parole board records show that 14
of the 18 members voted before a letter from U.S. Secretary of
State Madeline Albright, who wrote on behalf of Canadian expressing
concern that an international treaty may have been violated because
Faulder, a Canadian, had never been given the opportunity to call
his country's consulate when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Sauer argued that it was impossible for parole board members to
review all the paperwork in a dozen or more execution-clemency
cases a year, 400 other general clemency cases, 59,000 parole
requests and 29,000 parole revocation cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do review each of these cases. We make the time,''
Rodriguez said. ``We take this job very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also testified that parole board members never seek to
verify the information given them. As proof, Babcock cited a
protest letter written by a Gregg County sheriff which she said
contained inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
   But underscoring the secrecy of the process, the letter was
entered in evidence Monday under seal and kept confidential by
Sparks at the insistence of state officials. So were more than a
half-dozen boxes of official files on the two cases, which were
brought to the courtroom after Sparks demanded they be surrendered,
when state officials did not produce them as requested Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorneys General Reed Lockhoof and Dewey Helmcamp
insisted that Texas' system is both legal and fair. ``The inmates
and their attorneys want one more shot to retry their case with the
board, and that's not what clemency is all about,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   But, based on his questions throughout the hearing, Sparks
appeared unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that a recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion ruled that ``due
process in clemency procedures is a constitutional right,'' Sparks
told state officials, ``if the state's procedures are not too
clear, then every single execution'' will end up for review in
federal court, like the Faulder and Barber cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine a state being dumb enough to do that (operate
with unclear procedures), but there are a lot of things I don't
understand,'' Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is an extremely politically conservative state,''
Lockhoof told Sparks, attempting to explain why lawmakers have left
the system unchanged for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to stay at the bottom of the 35 states?'' Sparks
shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his sometimes pointed questioning , Sparks also made it
clear he intends to decide only the legal issues raised in the
Faulder and Barber cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a legislator. . . I do not intent to establish Texas
law,'' he said. ``My interest is only did these two people have
full constitutional protections.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close of Monday's hearing, Sparks expressed surprise that
state officials ended their presentation without presenting any
evidence to bolster their assertions about the legality of Texas'
system.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Attorney General Dan Morales in a published
interview had questioned whether Texas' clemency system was fair. A
spokesman said Monday that Morales' personal opinion has no bearing
on the presentation of the case before Sparks.

HOUSTON OCTUPLETS REMAIN IN CRITICAL CONDITION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional trims included) 
 
By T.J. MILLING 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The first known set of surviving octuplets remained in
critical condition Monday as a team of specialists worked to help
their tiny bodies adjust to life outside the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday morning, their mother underwent surgery to stop
internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   The infants _ know as babies A through H because their parents
have not yet named them _ were being cared for by the 10 physicians
and three nurse practitioners in the neonatal intensive care unit
at Texas Children's Hospital. The babies were moved there from St.
Luke's Episcopal Hospital after seven were surgically removed from
Nkem Chukwu's womb Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth was delivered naturally Dec. 8, but the others were
kept in the womb to allow them to mature further, which increases
their chances of survival. The infants, six girls and two boys,
weighed from 11 ounces to 1 pound 11 ounces at birth, but their
weights are expected to drop slightly before rebounding in a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ```Out of the woods' will probably be two or three weeks away,''
said Dr. Leonard Weisman, chief of neonatology at Texas Children's.
``Each week the problems change a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu, who conceived after a fertility drug therapy, was
returned to surgery to stop internal bleeding about 3 a.m. CST
Monday, a St. Luke's spokeswoman said. She was in stable condition
in St. Luke's late Monday, but she was still in the intensive care
unit.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hurdle for the newborns now is lung development,
Weisman said. The 2-week-old, a girl, was breathing on her own, but
the other seven were on mechanical ventilators, though only two
were on pure oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Premature infants' lungs are deficient in a chemical called
surfactant, which is produced by cells in the alveoli, the
microscopic terminal sacs where gases diffuse into the blood.
Surfactant, a viscous fluid, keeps the sacs from collapsing,
allowing maximum gas exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Respiratory failure was a major killer of premature babies until
surfactant treatment was developed in the 1980s. An additional
steroid treatment given to the pregnant mother to stimulate
surfactant production in the fetus was also developed, and, Weisman
said, the two methods used together have greatly reduced infant
mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Another medical advance that helps the octuplets' chances is
caffeine. Used in neonatology for about 15 years, caffeine
stimulates the infants' respiratory systems and allows them to
breathe on their own sooner, Weisman said.
</P>
<P>
   A third improvement was a drug that prevents the ductus
arteriosus from staying open, Weisman said. While the fetus is in
the womb getting oxygen from its mother's blood, the duct shunts
blood around the fetal lungs. It normally closes at birth, when the
infant starts breathing but can remain open, especially in
premature infants.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman said ventilation technology and nutrition have improved
also, but the lung treatments made the biggest difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surfactant makes all the others pale by comparison,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The octuplets were also on antibiotics as a precaution, and
sedatives, Weisman said. They were being given dopamine, a
vasoconstrictor, to raise their blood pressure, and tucked under
plastic blankets and kept warm with heaters.
</P>
<P>
   Premature babies have a greater risk of developing such
abnormalities as cerebral palsy, but an ultrasound view of the
2-week-old showed no such problems, Weisman said. The others will
be scanned in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Companies have pledged to provide free groceries, free baby
formula and free diapers for a year. St. Luke's was also setting up
a bank account for the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot of calls,'' hospital Director of
Development Katy Gill said. ``We're trying to figure out what they
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Prado, a neighbor of the octuplet parents, said Chukwu and
the father, Iyke Paul Louis, 41, were ``good neighbors and good
people.'' He said Louis was a respiratory therapist and some-time
real estate agent, but neither Prado nor other neighbors knew the
couple well.
</P>
<P>
   Louis was not present at the Sunday birth, hospital officials
said, and it was not clear whether he had visited since.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu miscarried a set of triplets earlier this year before
becoming pregnant with the octuplets.
</P>
<P>
   How she came to be on fertility drugs has not been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors offered to reduce the number of fetuses in her womb in
order to improve the remaining ones' chances of survival, but
Chukwu declined.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Fertility specialists say multiple births are not a medical
miracle, but a medical mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman is in danger of losing one or more of these babies.
The babies may face a reduced quality of life,'' said Dr. Ronald
Young, director of gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine. ``I'm
praying that they all go to Harvard, that they all do well, but
there is inherent danger in patients using these drugs by
themselves or untrained physicians using them.''
</P>
<P>
   The drugs Chukwu used, according to the obstetrician who began
caring for her after the drugs were administered, were a pair of
hormones. One stimulates the development of ova on the ovary, and
the other causes them to pop off the ovary and enter the fallopian
tube where sperm can fertilize them.
</P>
<P>
   After administration of the first hormone, the doctor can use a
scope to inspect the ovary for the presence of mature follicles,
the structures that contain the ova. He may choose not to
administer the second hormone if there are many mature follicles,
which could lead to multiple fetuses. But even if the second
hormone is not administered, the woman should be ordered to abstain
from sex, said Dr. Larry Lipshultz, a Baylor professor of urology.
All the mature ova eventually will enter the fallopian tube, where
they could be fertilized.
</P>
<P>
   Lipshultz said in vitro fertilization, in which a few mature
eggs are removed from the ovary, fertilized and then replaced in
the womb, allows much better control of the number of fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are safe drugs if properly used and properly
monitored,'' he said. ``We just don't have the whole story. We
don't know if she took too much drug or what. We have to wait to
get that information before we can comment on what happened. We
just have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   The same fertility treatment has lead to numerous multiple
births. The five surviving infants from a set of sextuplets, born
Nov. 11 to Chris Collins in nearby Kingwood, are still at Texas
Children's.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in Carlisle, Iowa, Bobbi McCaughey gave birth to the
only known surviving septuplets, about nine weeks premature.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the largest
multiple birth was nine babies in Sydney, Australia, in 1971. Six
of those children survived.
</P>
<P>
   Three other octuplet births have been recorded in the last 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Rosario Clavijo, 31, of Huelva, Spain, became
pregnant with the aid of fertility drugs and gave birth Dec. 5,
1996, to six healthy babies _ four boys and two girls. Two children
died.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, a 32-year-old British woman, Mandy Allwood,
rejected medical advice to abort some of her eight fetuses. Her
pregnancy and her decision to have all the babies aroused
controversy after she hired a publicist for a tabloid newspaper,
which paid for her story based on how many live births she had.
Four months into pregnancy, she lost all the fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-year-old woman from Imzir, Turkey, gave birth to octuplets
Dec. 20, 1985, but six died within 12 hours. The five boys and
three girls were delivered by Caesarean section, 12 weeks
premature. The mother, Sevil Capan, had been taking fertility
drugs. The remaining two babies died within three days of their
birth.

   Spend wisely, Sharp warns
</P>
<P>
   By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Some state lawmakers and agency officials might
have visions of billions of dollars dancing in their heads, but
Comptroller John Sharp says someone needs to step up and be the
budget grinch next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp will leave office in January after an unsuccessful bid for
lieutenant governor. On Monday he said state lawmakers face the
tough challenge of keeping a cautious eye on the state's checkbook
even though there's likely to be more money that can legally be
spent.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, a former state representative and senator, called the
next session a dangerous time for the Legislature ``because they
are flush with money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to be thinking about paring back and storing
their nuts for the winter,'' he said. ``Somebody's got to be the
bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary estimates from Sharp's office, the
state could have $3.7 billion left over when the two-year budget
cycle ends Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in the state's economy could kick in another $2.6 billion
for the next budget cycle.
</P>
<P>
   And the state's settlement with tobacco companies over Medicare
spending will add $1.8 billion during the biennium.
</P>
<P>
   But legislative budget leaders already have warned that a
constitutional spending cap will prevent them from spending a chunk
of the money.
</P>
<P>
   The cap prevents the state budget from growing faster than the
economy even if there's money to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in schools, prisons and other state services will eat a
good share of the surplus, legislative leaders have said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said now is not the time to become complacent in the
effort to hold down state spending, especially while there are
uncertainties in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're now not your own economy,'' Sharp said of Texas.
``You're a national economy. If the national economy goes up, you
do great. If the national economy goes down, you go down with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of uncertainty out there,'' he added. ``There is
a lot of euphoria without reason and a lot of flux. Now ought to be
the time that you really watch your spending. If you don't do that,
then you pay for it.''

 &HT;    New ad campaign helping company make its strong points clearer
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ Recovering from a bumpy start, Dell Computer
Corp.'s national television advertising campaign is up and running
in the company's first major effort to strengthen the Dell brand.
</P>
<P>
   The $70 million campaign is designed to raise Dell's profile
among business executives, information-system managers, even
college students. Unlike commercials that include details about
products and prices, the TV spots are designed to prompt viewers to
add Dell to their list of potential PC suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are considered, we are one of the industry's best at
closing deals,'' said Scott Helbing, Dell's vice president of
corporate brand strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Dell executives believe that the straightforward commercials,
which were produced by the global agency BBD&AMP;O, convey the
company's direct style better than an aborted campaign by the J.
Walter Thompson agency.
</P>
<P>
   That effort ended up in court this fall, when the agency sued
Dell and Dell countersued.
</P>
<P>
   Central Texans might be surprised to learn that the world's
fastest-growing major PC company and the region's largest private
employer remains an unknown to many corporations, businesses and
consumers. Dell's blue logo with the askew ``e'' is a long way from
having the global or even national recognition of Nike's swoosh,
Apple Computer's multicolored apple and Coca-Cola's label.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's own research found that many potential customers haven't
heard of the company or, if they have, are confused about what it
does. For example, Dell executives say a surprising number of
people believe the company is a Texas mail-order business.
</P>
<P>
   The BBD&AMP;O campaign targets those weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   The spot aimed at consumers features a college music major who
says that with Dell she was able to configure the exact notebook
computer she needed, with features she couldn't find elsewhere. A
second spot features a British engineer whose responsibilities
include maintaining his large employer's computer system.
</P>
<P>
   In the third of the 30-second spots, an airline industry
executive praises Dell for delivering solutions when people all
around him are coming to him with problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's problems with J. Walter Thompson started only two months
after work began on the initial campaign last December. Dell
executives were unhappy with the quality of the work that the huge
agency was producing, according to a lawsuit Dell filed this month
in Williamson County.
</P>
<P>
   That suit followed the agency's suit in New York alleging that
Dell broke payment contracts with J. Walter Thompson. The agency
claims Dell owes it more than $6 million in fees and bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   In its countersuit, Dell says the agency failed to forward
Dell's payments for air time to at least one TV station, and that
its performance forced the delay of the campaign, which originally
was to launch in the United States in April and worldwide a short
time later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a single, acceptable broadcast spot was ever delivered,''
Dell's suit says.
</P>
<P>
   That spot starred a mouse, drawn in animation, who donned
sunglasses and bombed a maze that separated it from a large wedge
of yellow cheese. The point was that Dell's direct model eliminates
obstacles to success, such as middlemen. That was the message Dell
wanted to convey.
</P>
<P>
   But the 30-second spot had the potential to confuse viewers,
Helbing said.
</P>
<P>
   He was recruited to Dell in February after about 11 years in
advertising, including two years with Tricon Restaurants
International, the PepsiCo spinoff that owns Pizza Hut, Kentucky
Fried Chicken and Taco Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I the mouse?'' Helbing asked, imagining how a viewer might
have reacted. ``And why did he burn it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to picture someone saying, `That's a cute little
mouse. I think I'll go buy a multimillion-dollar system from those
people.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Helbing said the BBD&AMP;O campaign is more direct, which fits
Dell's style.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse commercial ran in major U.S. markets for four weeks
beginning last June, even though Dell Chairman Michael Dell and
other top executives had lingering doubts about it. In early
August, Dell told J. Walter Thompson that it had asked BBD&AMP;O to
create its version of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''It got to the point where we had to find a solution,'' Helbing
said.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for J. Walter Thompson was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a rapid turnaround for a campaign of that size, BBD&AMP;O had new
commercials ready by mid-November, including filming in Austin, San
Antonio, New York, London and Paris, Helbing said.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin shots include Metric 12, Dell's pace-setting
manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   Those ``bricks-and mortar'' glimpses convey that Dell is
substantial, much more than a mail-order house, Helbing said.
</P>
<P>
   The spots will air during select events, the relatively rare
times executives watch TV. That includes during college football
bowl games and NFL games and on cable news programs such as MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Versions of the commercials will run in Japan and Europe early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Until data is available about the effectiveness of the spots,
Dell is relying largely on gut feelings of senior executives,
especially chief executive Michael Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really close to who we are as a company, because
Michael should have a better feel for who this company is than
anybody else,'' Helbing said.

MARKET PLACE: NETWORK SOLUTIONS JOINS INTERNET HIGH-FLIERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (rl) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the Internet stocks out there right now, Network
Solutions Inc. would seem least likely to be hot. Everyone knows,
after all, that sometime next year this Herndon, Va., company will
lose its exclusive government contract for registering the popular
Internet domains of .com, .net and .org _ the monopoly that
accounts for virtually all its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in the last two weeks, Network Solutions' shares have
joined the A-list of Internet stocks already in the stratosphere.
On Friday, it closed at $121, up from $59 two weeks earlier. And
the ride continued Monday, as its shares reached $164.72 by the
close of Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   The jump comes on the heels of several strategic alliances
announced recently by Network Solutions, including marketing
agreements with Netscape Communications Corp. and Yahoo that will
give it broader name recognition with both consumers and businesses
looking to register a domain name on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals are part of the company's plans to diversify as the
government moves forward with plans to hand over administration of
the Internet addressing system to a nonprofit corporation. That
group's first charge is to open Network Solutions' lucrative
domain-name registration monopoly to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Benjamin, an Internet analyst for BancBoston Robertson
Stephens in San Francisco, cited three reasons for the market's
enthusiasm: the wild increases of Internet stocks in general; the
recent alliances announced by the company; and a better
understanding within the market of how the introduction of
competition will affect Network Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there has been a perception change, from
regulatory confusion to fears of competitive challenges, that is
evaporating quickly,'' Benjamin said. ``Two things have happened:
First, they have basically been given permission to continue to run
the database'' that tells computers on the Internet the actual
numeric addresses for every domain name a user enters. ``Second,
the political machine has been moving at a painfully slow speed,
which is good for Network Solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the nonprofit group chosen by the Department of Commerce
to introduce competition into the domain-name registration
business, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers,
or ICANN, is nearly a month behind its deadline for picking a panel
of technical experts. The delay has fueled speculation that it will
also miss the deadline for opening the system to competition by the
end of March.
</P>
<P>
   With its unique position as the exclusive global registrar for
top-level domain names, Network Solutions has benefited from the
blossoming of the Internet for personal and commercial use. The
company has registered some 3 million domain names. Its income for
the first nine months of the year grew threefold, to $7.5 million,
or 45 cents a share, compared with $2.5 million, or 20 cents a
share, for the first nine months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the transition to competition takes, the longer
Network Solutions will maintain its exclusive right to dispense _
at $70 a pop _ the 10,000 new addresses being added to the Internet
each day. It also gives the company more time to continue its
efforts to diversify its services and to enter agreements with
Internet service providers and portals that will give it a
strategic advantage over the numerous upstarts waiting for an
opportunity to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin said the partnerships with Netscape and Yahoo
effectively made Network Solutions the exclusive registrar for
those companies' customers, ``suggesting that the competitive
threat may not materialize'' from some of the bigger Internet
players. And he predicted a similar agreement between Network
Solutions and America Online, which recently announced that it was
acquiring Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Korzeniewski, Network Solutions' chief financial officer
and acting chief operating officer, said the recent announcements
had sealed the market's perception of the company as both a retail
stock and a top player like Amazon.com, eBay and American Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on CNBC twice in the last few weeks,'' he said. ``Our
stock was not a retail stock at all two weeks ago. But now what
we've seen is continued strong support from our initial
shareholders, as well as a new market that didn't even know we
existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Future competition remains a big question, however. The company
is also in a leadership transition. Gabe Battista unexpectedly
resigned as chief executive last month to run an upstart telephone
company, Tel-Save Holdings of Hope, Pa. He had been with Network
Solutions just two years, but under his direction, profits paid for
an expansion of Network Solutions' international presence and a
diversification of its products. A key focus has been in moving
into offering broader Internet services for small companies that
want to build an online presence.
</P>
<P>
   As Internet stocks continue to rally, Benjamin said, the biggest
prizes will go to those companies with a big market, ``and it's
easy to believe that domain space is a big market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Network Solutions has proven leadership,'' he added. ``We know
the market is big. We just haven't known until recently how the
competitive landscape would play out. It appears to have played out
more favorably than some have expected.''

PAPERS WENT BIG WITH IMPEACHMENT HEADLINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., La., Mo., Nev., Ore.)  (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-SENATE, IMPEACH-LIVINGSTON,
IMPEACH-MEDIA)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Headline sizes seen two or three times in a generation were on
display Sunday in the United States' major newspapers, as editors
and reporters strove to make their coverage match, in its sweep,
its depth and its manner, the gravity of the second impeachment of
a president in American history.
</P>
<P>
   And few if any renditions of the stark word ``impeached'' were
larger than the one used by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which
featured type 2 3/4 inches deep. Beyond the sheer size of its
typeface, The Post-Dispatch distinguished itself by reserving its
entire front page for a narrative essay written out of St. Louis,
prompting strong objections from all five members of the
newspaper's Washington bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, they objected to the writer's failure to
disclose that he was basing his information largely on televised
coverage of the debate and was not on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The essay, by senior staff writer Harry Levins, began, ``New
York Democrat Charles Rangel rose Saturday to utter one of the rare
sentences on which both sides of the House of Representatives could
agree: `Mr. Speaker, the whole world is watching.'''
</P>
<P>
   In studied contrast to traditional news-writing style, which
calls for the most important information to be billboarded at the
top of an article, the essay did not mention President Clinton's
name until the fifth paragraph, and the actual votes on the four
articles of impeachment were not mentioned until 31 inches into a
34-inch narrative.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Cole Campbell, The Post-Dispatch's editor, said, the
newspaper was following the path laid out by weekly news magazines
by offering interpretation, color and context to a readership
familiar with the basic facts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, newspapers have been leaning
increasingly on texture and detail in their coverage. But rarely do
they substitute texture and mood for facts in front-page coverage
of historic moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that people would know the outcome of the vote when
they picked up the paper, so we wanted to do a story that conveyed
the historicity of the moment,'' said Campbell. ``We thought a
writer who could capture the feel of the debate would be in a
position to capture something that would be of value to people the
day after'' they learned about the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essay built toward the vote,'' explained Campbell, who
said that he and three top editors, two design editors and a photo
editor held a Friday night meeting at which they decided on the
unconventional approach. One of the models for Levins' narrative,
Campbell said, was The New York Herald's coverage of the 1871
search for the explorer Dr. David Livingstone, which built toward
the journalist Henry Morton Stanley's discovery of the doctor in
Africa and his words ``Dr. Livingstone, I presume?''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's Washington bureau chief, Jon Sawyer, who covers
Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, wrote an
interpretive article about the president's ability to govern. This
was published as part of a two-page inside spread of articles,
including four from the Washington bureau.
</P>
<P>
   No other major papers took the route of The Post-Dispatch. But
many editors reached deep into the grab bag of layout strategies to
compose front pages as memorable as the ones that announced
President Kennedy's assassination in 1963, Neil Armstrong's moon
landing in 1969 or President Nixon's resignation in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Oregonian in Portland offered the single word
``Impeached'' in full capitals as a 2-inch headline, with the full
text of the first article of impeachment in smaller type above it.
A picture of Clinton more than a half-page deep dominated the page,
offset by smaller images of four other people: Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel; Monica Lewinsky; Henry Hyde, the chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, and Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald, The San Diego Union-Tribune, The Las Vegas Sun
and The Times-Picayune of New Orleans all featured 1- or
2-inch-high headlines, abutted by smaller boxes reporting the
decision on each of the four articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, traditionally reserved in the size of its
typefaces, ran the headline ``Clinton Impeached,'' roughly
three-quarters the size of its best-known large headlines, ``Nixon
Resigns'' and ``Men Walk on Moon,'' which were both more than an
inch deep.

 &HT;    President serves up holiday cheer at soup kitchen
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton demonstrated his holiday spirit
on his first day at work since being impeached.
</P>
<P>
   And he invited U.S. Rep. Tony Hall to join him.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton, Ohio Democrat joined Clinton and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton on Monday at the D.C. Central Kitchen, where they
helped the massive facility prepare more than 2,700 holiday meals
for almost 100 charity organizations around the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons worked on a pan of lasagna and Hall teamed with
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to frost a Christmas cake.
During the event Clinton offered an olive branch to the Congress
that last Saturday made him the first elected president to be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they have a merry Christmas,'' Clinton said. ``I hope
everyone in the country will take some time to think about other
people and do something in the spirit of the season _ something
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who has campaigned against hunger both at home and abroad,
said Clinton was ``trying to lead by example'' at the soup kitchen
where Hall has volunteered many times before.
</P>
<P>
   Hall spoke by telephone with Clinton on Saturday before the
impeachment vote, and then again Sunday night. He said Clinton
hopes the up-coming Senate trial ``isn't a long, drawn-out thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said of Clinton's state of mind: ``At least as far as what he
says and how he looks, he seems OK. He's been down lately, but he's
staying in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall has steadfastly advocated a compassionate and forgiving
resolution to the crisis that has dogged Clinton all year.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor during the debate, Hall argued against a clause in
the impeachment articles that would bar Clinton from ever again
holding any public office in the future. ``The House doesn't have
the moral authority to judge that the president is forever
unredeemable,'' Hall said at the time
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Hall said that the day at the D.C. Central Kitchen
was good, and that he remained impressed with Hillary Clinton's
graciousness and strength.
</P>
<P>
   As for the cake decorating, Hall reported mixed success. He
struggled to write out ``Merry Christmas'' and sign his name in
pink frosting, but did better working in straight lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing I did was the borders.''

 &HT;    Prosecutors, Fagan: Still no deal
 &HT;    By John Holland
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Stephen Fagan's daughters and his
ex-wife met separately with prosecutors Monday, each airing sharply
different views of the man charged with kidnapping his children two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and Fagan have not reached a plea deal, which
sources said has been under discussion for about two weeks. A
preliminary hearing is scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan took daughters Rachael and Lisa, then 5 and 3, in 1979
during a Massachusetts custody battle with ex-wife Barbara Kurth.
Fagan fled to South Florida with his daughters days later and
created a fictional life as Dr. William Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth has not seen her daughters since the October 1979
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, she met with Middlesex County District Attorney Tom
Reilly to discuss the case and state her opposition to a plea deal.
Less than an hour after that meeting, her daughters met with Reilly
to plead for his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, who is leaving office in two weeks to become
Massachusetts Attorney General, was joined by his successor, Martha
Coakley. Coakley gained national attention last year prosecuting
Louise Woodward, the British nanny convicted of killing a baby in
her care.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth's attorney, Jacob Atwood, said Coakley wanted to meet
Kurth and size her up as a potential witness if the case goes to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't go into what they said, but from our side it was a
positive meeting,'' Atwood said. ``They were clearly impressed by
Barbara's resilience and her demeanor, and I think they have a good
feeling now about what kind of a witness she'll be.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood, who has opposed any plea deal that keeps Fagan out of
jail, said his client won't interfere with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara doesn't want to impose her views on the judicial
system, and she doesn't want to do anything that would put a
further wedge between her and the kids,'' Atwood said. ``Any
reasonable prosecutor will look to discuss a plea, and there's
still room for that. But after the meeting Barbara doesn't have any
feeling that they are going to sell her out.''

 &HT;    No sneak-peeks into Secretary of State's digs for Florida's
Harris
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Some transitions are smoother than others.
</P>
<P>
   Before his Dec. 12 death, Gov. Lawton Chiles let successor Jeb
Bush join him in picking a Supreme Court justice. Bush, who will
name other appointments today, is expected to move into the
governor's mansion several days ahead of his Jan. 5 inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of State Sandra Mortham, who lost to Katherine
Harris in a Sept. 1 GOP primary, has refused to let Harris into her
office early even to measure the drapes or plug nail holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Katherine Harris takes office, she can do all the
decorating she wants,'' said Mortham spokesman David Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Harris aides say they got the message when they saw the
transition office they were assigned by Mortham on the Capitol's
19th floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a 12- by 9-foot room with a card table,'' one aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mortham, the first incumbent Cabinet member to lose in a primary
in nearly three decades, also refused to put any Harris transition
people on her payroll, which the aides said is often done as a
courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   Harris declined to criticize ally-turned-rival Mortham, saying
with a shrug, ``She just doesn't believe it's a good use of
taxpayer dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortham, who will take a job as a lobbyist for the Florida
Medical Association next month, is just following the rules, Bishop
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the swearing-in, Sandra Mortham is still the Secretary
of State,'' he said.

 &HT;    Bush names GOP counsel to oil panel
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, whose re-election campaign
included an unprecedented outreach to minorities, Monday named
Michael Williams the first African American on the Texas Railroad
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 45, will replace Republican Carole Keeton Rylander,
who is giving up her seat to become state comptroller next month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Williams, general counsel to the Republican Party of
Texas, is ``a smart, capable individual who brings a blend of
legal, policy and regulatory knowledge'' to the agency that
regulates the oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   Williams acknowledged that one thing he doesn't bring is
experience in the oil and gas industry. His lack of experience is
not unique for railroad commissioners, whose interest in the job is
frequently more political.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he views his new job as ``a great challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a kid who grew up in Midland, and I understand the
significance of the energy industry in the state's economy and the
culture of the state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who plans to run for the seat when it's on the ballot
in 2000, beat out a contender who has oil and gas experience and
who did Bush a political favor this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Holzheauser, R-Victoria, was a leading GOP candidate
for election to the three-member commission this year. He withdrew
when Tony Garza, a Bush appointee as secretary of state, abandoned
his race for state land commissioner and instead ran for the
Railroad Commission. Garza will succeed Barry Williamson, who ran
an unsuccessful race for attorney general instead of seeking
re-election to the Railroad Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Holzheauser, chairman of the House Energy Resources Committee,
wanted the appointment to replace Rylander. He said he was told
late Sunday that he would not get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I got a fair hearing on my abilities, and I'm
satisfied that the governor's staff was diligent in their
evaluation of the candidates,'' said Holzheauser, offering not a
hint of ill will. ``In politics, nobody owes you anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, general counsel for the Richardson-based Wilkins Group
Inc., a telecommunications firm, said Bush approached him about a
job shortly after the November election. They discussed secretary
of state and railroad commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently named Secretary of State Al Gonzales to the Texas
Supreme Court. His replacement has not been named, but Clark Kent
Ervin, an African American and No. 2 man at the secretary of
state's office, is a top contender.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Williams means the GOP probably will have an
African American on its statewide ticket in 2000. The only other
African American to win a GOP statewide nomination was Louis Sturns
of Fort Worth, who ran an unsuccessful campaign in 1990 after being
appointed to the Court of Criminal Appeals by then-Gov. Bill
Clements.
</P>
<P>
   By appointing Williams, Bush put his longtime friend on the
first rung of what has become a popular ladder to higher office.
Many commissioners have fueled those races with campaign
contributions from oil and gas interests they regulate.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said ``it would be inappropriate to suggest race played
no role'' in his appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine it did, and, in a way, I would hope that it
did. I think it is important that in this kind of arena that we
indicate a desire for participation by a wide range of people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' ties to Bush go back to their days in Midland, where
Williams was raised. They served as co-chairmen of the city's
United Way campaign in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   From 1980 to 1984, Williams was a federal prosecutor
specializing in police brutality and hate crime cases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he ran for Midland County attorney and lost in the GOP
primary. Bush was his campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, President George Bush appointed Williams assistant
secretary of education for civil rights.

CLASSICAL CDS: BRIGHTENING SOME DARK CORNERS  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

   Boulezian Pierrot
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, Pierre Boulez has been going around the world
recording for Deutsche Grammophon the music that means most to him
_ music that in some cases has been with him throughout his life as
a musician.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg's ``Pierrot Lunaire'' was one of his early loves.
What he found in its piano part _ ``a considerable density of
texture and violence of expression'' _ influenced his own writing
for the instrument in his first published works; the crucial
achievement of his late 20s, ``Le Marteau Sans Maitre,'' was partly
a homage to ``Pierrot.'' When he started conducting, Schoenberg's
score was one of the first he recorded, in the early '60s, and he
made another version in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   His new recording (on DG 457 630) accordingly reflects, in some
respects, half a century of study and performance. It is deeply
Boulezian in its justness of instrumental tuning and balance, its
clarity of detail and, more occasionally, its vividly energized
motifs, its bursts of musical lightning.
</P>
<P>
   But much has changed, too. The piano part no longer sounds so
very dense and certainly not so very violent: violence, perhaps,
happens when the score is not being very well played, and the
performance here by members of Boulez's Ensemble Intercontemporain
is consistently beautiful and secure.
</P>
<P>
   No longer an expressionist nightmare, the work has also ceased
to be the ``superior cabaret'' Boulez once called it. Christine
Schaefer, the vocalist, interprets the speech-song notation in a
very tuneful way: She does not sound very different when fully
singing one of the other Schoenberg pieces on this CD, the
miniature, spectacularly high-flying song ``Herzgewaechse.'' Humor
and acid have given way to exquisite delicacy and exactness.
</P>
<P>
   With the instrumental music so fine and appealing, one can
understand why ``Pierrot'' had such an impact on Ravel. As it
sounds here, it could almost have been written by him. Listen to
the pretty flurry that follows what one might have thought the
threatening news that Pierrot is attacking his friend Cassander
with ``a cranium driller.''
</P>
<P>
   This is altogether a magical performance, full of musical light
and worrisome only to the extent that magic and light do not seem
the work's most essential qualities. Boulez even finds charm in
Schoenberg's later piece of chamber music with recitation, the
``Ode to Napoleon,'' where David Pittman-Jennings brings brisk
effectiveness to the tricky solo part.
</P>
<P>
   A Caring Bluebeard
</P>
<P>
   In another newly released recording, of Bartok's opera
``Bluebeard's Castle'' (DG 289 447), Boulez provides a delectable
treatment of the score, again with some of his old musical
characteristics intact: he leaps at the chopped rhythm and the
xylophone-plus-wind sound of the arpeggios that depict the armory
behind the second of the castle's seven doors _ doors that Judith
has her new husband, Bluebeard, open. (Because these seven openings
are almost the only action, ``Bluebeard'' is a perfect opera for
the ears alone.)
</P>
<P>
   Jessye Norman as Judith is an unusual choice: The part suggests
a lighter voice, if one with the power to penetrate. But, a few
slips and slides apart, Ms. Norman proves the value of ripeness. As
Bluebeard, Laszlo Polgar _ who sang this role again for Boulez at
Aix this summer _ proves the value of understanding the language.
He is magnificent: careworn and caring in his responses to his
young bride, always easy in his vocal delivery and fully in touch
with what the orchestra is doing. The playing, by the Chicago
Symphony, is wonderful throughout, and here magic and light tell
much more of the story.

EVEN AS SANTA, EWING WORKS TO MEND PERCEPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Ewing's day began in a midtown hotel,
dispelling any notion of a rift within the players union. By
nightfall, he was standing on a street in Harlem signing autographs
for children.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to mend perceptions borne out of the NBA lockout, Ewing,
sitting side by side with the union's executive director, Billy
Hunter, and a dozen players from the union's negotiating team,
fielded questions from among 100 players on a conference call.
Inside the room, the committee pondered comments from Karl Malone
that appeared to indicate a break among the players.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Malone, the Utah Jazz forward, said he believed
that the owners' offer was a fair deal that needed some
adjustments. Minutes after Monday's meeting broke up, Ewing, the
union's president, made it clear that one man's opinion did not
indicate a division in the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't agree with him,'' Ewing said. ``I don't know where it
came from. This is the proposal that has been out there a long
time, and it hasn't changed. On paper, it looks OK, but not when
it's dissected. Everybody in there was disappointed because we've
been on the same page for so long. And Karl's been with us the
whole way. But there's no divide. I can tell you, we're together.''
</P>
<P>
   Unity has sustained the union through every emotional up and
down in the nearly 6-month-old lockout. Each hint of progress has
been followed by a sustained silence between the two parties. With
no new meetings scheduled, NBA Commissioner David Stern departed
for his vacation in Aspen, Col., on Saturday, and Hunter said he
intended to fly Tuesday to Oakland, Calif., for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both sides don't expect any contact between
Hunter and Stern before Christmas, leaving early next week as the
next plausible date for a bargaining session. That would give the
two sides a small cushion of time to come up with an agreement and
start a season of approximately 50 games by the first week of
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that before this thing goes completely up in smoke,
they would be inclined to have one more session,'' Hunter said.
``When and how that will occur is yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what their motive or strategy is. I've told the
guys all along that we can't be concerned with what their motives
are. We know what our position is and what our bottom line is, and
we intend to stay with it. Absent some compromise from the NBA,
there will be no deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern did not leave town with compromise on his mind. Instead,
he reportedly said the season would inevitably be canceled if the
negotiations continue on their same path.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the intent of his comment was to increase or turn up the
anxiety, it hasn't happened,'' Hunter said. ``It's just another
demonstration of where they've underestimated our guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing echoed those thoughts as he darted for a waiting car to
take him uptown to the Harlem Dowling-West Side Center. He arrived
to play Santa Claus to more than 100 children from the community
with his Knicks teammates Herb Williams, John Starks and Marcus
Camby, and Seattle's Jim McIlvaine, who tagged along from the
union's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The event was Ewing's brainchild. Over the weekend, Ewing took
up a collection from a group of players and called a toy store. He
placed an order for 150 gifts, and then, with the help of his
teammates, handed them out to kids ages 2 through 17.
</P>
<P>
   One girl screamed in excitement when Ewing cupped her head. And
another boy was giggling with the always kid-friendly Starks. For
the most part, the kids were oblivious to the lockout, although one
astute 9-year-old girl, Tiara, did say to her friend, ``They should
be playing right now, and they're not because of all the money
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   That stuff has often seemed at the root of the alienation the
public has felt toward the players during the lockout. At times,
players have appeared removed from the average person because of
comments that have left them perceived to be greedy and out of
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it means a lot to the kids for us to be here,'' Starks
said. ``Some people think the guys are selfish and only think about
themselves. But the majority of the league comes from poor
backgrounds, and so we know what it's like not to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the kids standing before the players were children being
aided by the center's family services. It was hard to find a child
who was not touched by the attention the players gave them Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even after all the presents had been handed out, Ewing, not one
to normally linger after an event, stood next to his car and signed
all autograph requests. He ended his day much like he had started
it, as a mender of perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to show that we have the Christmas spirit,''
Ewing said. ``This is all about giving.''

EDITORIAL: POLITICS AND PEACE IN ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 22: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to choose Israel's next government began Monday,
more than a year ahead of schedule. That will mean regrettable new
delays in peace talks with the Palestinians. But the elections, to
be held sometime early next year, will give Israeli voters a chance
to reinforce the wobbly Middle East peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The fractious right-wing coalition led by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu for the past two and a half years has shown
itself incapable of consistent movement toward peace. A new, more
broadly based government could prove more productive. Netanyahu's
two main opponents, Ehud Barak, the Labor party leader, or Gen.
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, an independent centrist, are obvious
candidates to lead such a government. But Netanyahu, if he can find
a way to free himself from the uncompromising right, could also do
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is more of a pragmatist than an ideologue and deserves
credit for leading his Likud party away from rejection of all
territorial compromise. But most of his term has been consumed by
narrow tactical maneuvers, and he has yet to articulate a clear
vision of what would constitute a fair and acceptable peace.
Regrettably, he has launched his re-election campaign with a threat
to suspend his part in carrying out the American-brokered Wye
accord he signed in October.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is an untested campaigner who will have to overcome voter
suspicions that his Labor party is too eager for agreement with the
Palestinians and not careful enough on security issues.
Lipkin-Shahak, a retired army chief, has no political experience
and, since he is still formally a military officer, has refrained
from publicly expressing his views. But many centrists see him as
the best hope for achieving a secure peace.
</P>
<P>
   Labor and Likud have both been losing voters, and these
elections are likely to go to the candidate who can sway the large
group of independents who want a negotiated peace but also want
Palestinian leaders to control terrorism. Israel would be well
served if these supporters of a fair peace prevail at the polls and
shape the next government. &QL;

 A PRIESTESS OF ADORNMENT ZEN   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT
photo clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by
calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)   By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You may admire Kazuko's work, but don't call her a
designer. ``I don't design,'' she said emphatically the other day.
``I make things.''
</P>
<P>
   What she makes are one-of-a-kind necklaces, pins, earrings and
bracelets of precious and semiprecious stones wrapped in gold wire;
evening belt purses of antique fabric trimmed with pearls and
crystals; hand-painted stationery, and vests made of antique laces
adorned with delicate stones.
</P>
<P>
   Her jewelry has earned her a loyal following in the 10 years it
has sold at Barneys New York stores, but the newer note cards and
fabric pieces have created the impetus for an exhibition of
Kazuko's work planned for spring at the Holly Solomon Gallery, 172
Mercer St.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuko considers herself an artist. Others may call her an
artisan. She makes everything herself, with no assistants, working
on the floor of her all-white apartment high above West 57th
Street. ``I call this a high-rise loft,'' she said, pointing to a
view of Central Park and beyond through uncurtained windows. ``I'm
obsessed with light. When I meditate, I look at the clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   She lives with almost no furniture, stacking her belongings on
the floor and covering them with white fabrics like dropcloths. ``I
grew up very modern in Japan, and now I live very Japanese,'' she
said. Her piles of books are blanketed with gauze. ``I cover them
because they talk too much,'' she said. ``They have too much energy
coming out.'' Her computer, which is also white, sits shrouded on
the floor of her bedroom, though she prefers to write everything by
hand, even invoices and faxes.
</P>
<P>
   The only color comes from spindly plants, tiny animal figurines,
framed photographs and, when she works, colored stones like coral,
tourmaline and aquamarine.
</P>
<P>
   A diminutive, birdlike woman with long black hair, Kazuko wore
nothing but black for many years, until her acupuncturist told her
that black attracts negative energy. (Tell that to the fashion
flock.) Now she wears only white, usually voluminous swaths of
fabric from designers like Issey Miyake, Fernando Sanchez and
Yeohlee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally believe in fashion,'' she said. ``Fashion is like
Zen. What we put on our body is as important as what we eat and
breathe.'' She wears a bracelet encasing three large clear crystals
on one wrist and a changing assortment of necklaces holding colored
stones and crystals around her neck. The stones she chooses
carefully each day, not for color but for symbolism. She believes
in the power of crystals, attributing special properties to each
stone and calling her jewelry ``healing sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel a healing energy when you stitch each bead,'' she
maintained. ``Your heart has to be in the right place. If I'm
angry, I can't make these things. The needles cut and the wires
bruise my skin.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that when someone first suggested rubbing a stone for
15 minutes a day to release its healing power, she was skeptical.
``I tried it for two weeks and began to feel better,'' she said.
``I began to study crystals. This belief in crystals didn't start
in the '60s. It has been throughout history. I envisioned the
caveman seeing a crystal in his cave and rubbing it until it
shined.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the women who wear her jewelry believe, like Kazuko,
that it has talismanic properties. Kitty D'Alessio, a former
president of Chanel and of Josie Natori, wears Kazuko's clear
crystal bracelets all the time since a bout with cancer five years
ago. Holly Solomon says she never leaves the house without a Kazuko
crystal heart. ``I wear her pieces because I have luck with them,''
Ms. Solomon said. ``Every time I wear them, I make a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Vanderbilt, Anne Slater and the chef-restaurateur Daniel
Boulud also collect Kazuko's jewelry. (Men tend to wear small
stones pinned inside their jackets.)
</P>
<P>
   In New Age-speak, clear quartz crystal can balance the emotions,
stimulate the brain and dispel negative energy. But it's a good bet
that most women who wear Kazuko's jewelry aren't interested in
magical qualities. They just admire it for its beauty, which is
both primitive and sophisticated _ and because it is instantly
recognizable and rarely fails to elicit admiring comments.
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly why fashion magazines photograph the jewelry,
and why it has retained a prominent spot in every Barneys store. It
fills two showcases inside the main entrance to the Madison Avenue
store and is displayed in the tallest fixture on the main floor of
the Beverly Hills branch. No one who enters a Barneys could avoid
seeing it and usually stopping to look, if not to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kazuko, who uses just one name (``like Cher and
Madonna,'' she said), studied painting as a child in Tokyo, she
dabbled in many arts after arriving in New York in 1968 on a
scholarship. ``I studied theoretical drama at NYU and went to La
Mama and worked there for a year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She then became interested in photography and exhibited her
hand-painted photographs in a SoHo photo gallery in 1972. When she
developed an allergy to the chemicals, she looked for a new outlet
for her creativity. ``I became a technojunkie and started making
videos,'' she said. ``I was making avant-garde videos, trying to
express everything poetically. I wanted to make technology my
slave, but it didn't work out. Technology was not making me
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Robert Frank, the photographer, told her to do
something simple, ``something that makes you happy.'' Since she had
been collecting antique fabrics and beads, she started to make
scarves and adorned them with beads. ``I wanted to do something one
of a kind that comes out of my hand and my heart,'' she said. ``I
used to wrap the stones with silk threads, but I had no idea silk
wouldn't hold the stone.'' That's when she discovered gold wire and
developed the cagelike wrapping that became the Kazuko signature.

HENDERSON LEADS OFF WITH OPTIMISM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Friday, he will turn 40, an age when most baseball
players have long ago said goodbye to the game and when the few
remaining old-timers are icing their aching muscles more, playing
less and trying to hang on to fat salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Not Rickey Henderson, soon to start his 21st major league
season, this one as the New York Mets' new left fielder and leadoff
man. He is, as General Manager Steve Phillips said, ``Arguably the
best leadoff hitter in the history of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday at Shea Stadium, the Mets introduced
Henderson, casually elegant in a plum-colored wool suit, a gray,
figured shirt (no tie) with R.H. embroidered on the cuffs, beige
leather-and-snake loafers and a standard-issue Mets cap. Henderson
said he was dedicated to pulling the Mets out of the shadow of the
champion Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping I'll change the Mets' image,'' Henderson said. ``I
can create runs. I steal bases. I make things happen. We have guys
like Mike Piazza who want to be with a winning team, so I'm hopeful
we can get good.''
</P>
<P>
   Having added Piazza in a late-season blockbuster deal, then
picking up Bobby Bonilla and Robin Ventura during the off season in
addition to Henderson, the Mets are hopeful that they can improve
on their 88 victories last season.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's achievements with his hometown Oakland Athletics,
the Yankees, the Toronto Blue Jays, the San Diego Padres and the
Anaheim Angels have him on course for the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He is the career leader in stolen bases (1,297). He ranks third
in walks (1,890), sixth in runs (2,014), 29th in games played
(2,612), 30th in at-bats (9,473) and 52nd in hits (2,678). If he
stays healthy, the next two years could send him past Babe Ruth
(2,056) and Ted Williams (2,019) in walks and Ruth and Henry Aaron
(both 2,174), Pete Rose (2,165) and Willie Mays (2,062) in runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what keeps you going,'' Henderson said. But
even he is amazed at his longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 20, 24,'' he said, ``I just wanted to last five
years. I've always said age doesn't make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   After last season, when he batted a career-low .236 for the A's,
he became a free agent. He said three or four clubs wanted him, but
he picked the Mets because he felt they were on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   He signed a one-year contract for $1.8 million. The Mets hold an
option that will guarantee him $2 million for the year 2000 if he
makes 500 plate appearances in 1999. If not, there is a $500,000
buyout.
</P>
<P>
   He made 670 plate appearances this year and will have the same
opportunity because he will be the Mets' starting left fielder.
And, he warned, do not write this off as his final contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago,'' he said, ``I said I might play to 50.
I don't have any idea how long I can play. If I still love the game
and if I stay healthy, there is no limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he bemoaned that baseball has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's more business than family,'' he said. ``We used to
care about one another and could stay with one club longer. Now you
don't know where you're going to be. You do whatever you can do for
your club, and the next day you may be gone.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So Henderson is gone from Oakland, where he spent most of his
career. The Mets were concerned that they stole only 62 bases last
season (Henderson alone stole 66). Their leadoff batters combined
for only 15 stolen bases last year, with an on-base percentage of
.321. So they started looking for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw some who could steal but not get on base,'' Phillips
said, ``some who could get on base but couldn't steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Henderson. ``He might have lost a step,'' Manager
Bobby Valentine said, ``but he has the ability to make havoc.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that havoc was obvious last season, when Henderson, a
right-handed batter, led the major leagues in walks (118) and
stolen bases. Some was hidden in esoteric statistics that showed he
also led the majors in pitches per at-bat (4.43) and pitches seen
(2,903). In other words, he made pitchers work hard, he got on base
often, he stole his way into scoring position and he scored often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look for walks,'' he said. ``I like to go deep in the
count so the other guys can see what the pitcher is doing. When I
played in San Diego, the National League pitchers were new and I
took more pitches. But then you get in a rut and you've got to be
more aggressive. If my team needs me to be on base more, I'll take
pitches. If the team is hitting, I won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Desire, he said, is a key to base-stealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to want to steal a base,'' he said. ``Some guys get
caught and won't run the next 50 times. I can get caught nine times
in a row, but I keep trying and I can make the 10th.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no mystery to his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never lost my desire,'' he said. ``I still love the game.
I don't think anything is left now in this game for me but to be a
winner. The best thing is to be a winner. The worst thing is
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   To maximize Henderson's effectiveness, the Mets must find an
ideal No. 2 batter. Valentine said that Edgardo Alfonzo was the
probable choice, with occasional switches to John Olerud, Ventura
and Brian McRae. To Henderson, it's all the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby hasn't told me who's going to bat second,'' Henderson
said, ``but he's going to have a great year, whoever it is.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the decade previous to this one, New York's most
celebrated baseball leadoff hitter was not the one referred to by
Mets general manager Steve Phillips as ``arguably the best leadoff
hitter in the history of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not Rickey Henderson, who scored 146 runs for the Yankees
in 1985 and 130 in 1986. Surprisingly, it was a Met, Len Dykstra,
who in many ways was the tobacco-spitting image of the 1986 World
Series champs.
</P>
<P>
   Dykstra, whose nickname was Nails, played wall-hammerin' hard,
on the field and off. Not coincidentally, his career, like those
Mets, burned out long before its time. Over in the Bronx, in the
years when George Steinbrenner's Yankees sorely needed pitching far
more than parking, Henderson occasionally loafed after a ball hit
in the gap and protected his ``hammy'' like his wallet, but year
in, year out, produced statistical documentation for future
admission to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good team, a good chemistry,'' Henderson said Monday
at Shea Stadium, where he was introduced as the left fielder for
the 1999 Mets. ``What we lacked was a little more pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson played for the Yankees from 1985 to 1989, an era when
Steinbrenner called his manager, Lou Piniella, during one All-Star
Game break to triumphantly announce, ``I just won you the
pennant.'' The owner had traded for pitcher Steve Trout, whose
subsequent southpaw offerings had the navigational dexterity of a
wind-blown balloon.
</P>
<P>
   While Dykstra was usually deified for every run generated by his
bat and grit, runs not often wasted by a brilliant Mets pitching
staff, Henderson's routinely breathtaking performance was typically
lost in the monotony of a pitching and managerial revolving door.
</P>
<P>
   Those Yankees lineups contained three pillar superstars _
Henderson, Dave Winfield and Don Mattingly _ in the prime of their
careers. In a shocking development, Henderson and Winfield, both
African-American, absorbed the bulk of the criticism when the
season invariably turned sour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had controversy because of my hamstring,'' Henderson said,
referring to 1987, when he played in just 95 games. ``I kept saying
I was hurt, but because I have thick legs, they couldn't feel it,
and they kept saying it was just tight. I had never had an injury
before. I kept saying, `What's wrong?' People didn't understand,
but I found out later the hamstring was torn.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not meant to rewrite a personal history. As anyone who
was around those Yankee teams will admit, Henderson, whether
talking about himself in the first person or third, was not the
easiest player to listen to. Nor was he above showing up to work
without having taken his happy pill (an offense his most strident
critics were surely never guilty of). But before Henderson begins
his second go-round in New York, two points of retrospection can be
made about his first.
</P>
<P>
   First, had Steinbrenner given the same weight to pitching in the
1980s as he has in the 1990s, Henderson and Winfield could very
well have been ushered, like Mattingly, into Monument Park, instead
of being run out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Second, that the 39-year-old Henderson has been brought back to
New York after posting an on-base percentage of .375 in 152 games
last season for the Oakland Athletics, makes him an authority not
only on his ``hammy,'' but also on the nurturing of a ballplayer's
body to produce the maximum long-term results.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson had a major-league-leading 66 stolen bases last
season. The Mets had 62. Remarkably, with 20 major-league seasons
in the books, he is still playing the speed game, albeit somewhat
slower afoot and at bat. Baseball's career stolen base leader,
holder of two World Series rings, turns 40 on Friday, and here are
the names of the only players who have scored more runs: Ty Cobb,
Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth, Pete Rose, Willie Mays. Here are the names
of those who have drawn more walks: Ruth, Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his longevity says everything about his commitment to
his career,'' Phillips said. ``That's his message, and that's the
one I hope rubs off on the other players.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he asked the A's about Henderson's eagerness to
play every day, and was told they had to fight to give him a day
off. With the Yankees, he undoubtedly had himself removed from a
few lineups when his muscles ached but he might have played. For
this he was assailed by those who have never had to dive back into
first base a half-dozen times, then get up and steal second an
average of 81 times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Who would now claim that Henderson was off base to sit himself
down every now and then?
</P>
<P>
   And where have you gone, Len Dykstra?

HOUSE MEMBERS' LETTER ON SHIFT TO CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: With IMPEACH)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the letter from four Republican
representatives, Sherwood Boehlert of New York, Michael Castle of
Delaware, Benjamin Gilman of New York and James Greenwood of
Pennsylvania, sent to Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader. The
letter was made public by the authors.
</P>
<P>
   We write as Republicans who voted to impeach President Clinton.
We cast that solemn vote because we believe that the president lied
under oath and that such conduct is serious enough to merit
impeachment and consideration of the case by the Senate. However,
as this most serious and difficult matter moves to the Senate, we
urge you to allow the Senate to consider strong censure as a
remedy.
</P>
<P>
   We are not convinced, and do not want our votes interpreted to
mean that we view removal from office as the only reasonable
conclusion of this case. While some have questioned whether the
House has the constitutional authority to consider alternatives to
impeachment, it seems clear to us that the Senate does have the
authority and the precedents to consider a range of options. Those
options should include a tough censure proposal, which would impose
a fine and block any pardon.
</P>
<P>
   In considering this matter, the Senate should take into account
the subject of the president's false testimony, the degree to which
his conduct threatens the integrity and functioning of the
government of the United States, and the will of the American
voter. We believe those factors may lead the Senate to conclude
that a remedy short of removal is in order.
</P>
<P>
   We urge you to allow the Senate to consider this matter in a
fashion that will allow a full debate and consideration of any
appropriate action.

KAZAKHSTAN GIRDS FOR ECONOMIC SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE LeVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ With the certainty of the snows now
enveloping this tree-lined city, Tatyana Gofman predicts that
Kazakhstan will soon sink into the economic crisis that has long
affected so much of the world. She even knows when.
</P>
<P>
   ``After January 10,'' says Ms. Gofman, a clothing merchant who
is discounting everything in her shop by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the million people in this city are nervous as Jan. 10
draws near, because, as people explain patiently, that is Election
Day, when President Nursultan Nazarbayev seems almost assured of
winning a new seven-year term. After that, voters say, he is
expected to discard the artifices with which, seeking votes, he has
kept the local currency stable, homes heated and state pensions
paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there is going to be a crisis here,'' said Ms.
Gofman, an ethnic Russian who sells jeans and shirts. ``How can
there not be if there is one in Russia? Everyone is having these
sales. They want to sell as much as possible now because, after
Jan. 10, no one will buy anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign analysts in Kazakhstan agree that trouble is on the way,
but they lay the blame not on government policies but on a drop in
world commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, this republic of 16 million people has
benefited from an enormous oil rush. Since the Soviet collapse,
Almaty, a financial center in the foothills of a ski resort, has
sprung to life with bars, restaurants and boutiques like Ms.
Gofman's. And the republic's global profile has risen as the
Clinton administration has embraced the entire Caspian Sea region
as a key strategic and commercial interest.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, local and Western economists suggest that a
pause is under way in the Caspian oil rush. In its place are signs
of an economic slump across the region.
</P>
<P>
   To the south and east, the currencies of Kyrgyzstan,
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Georgia have plunged in recent months.
Even Azerbaijan, which has attracted much foreign investment,
recently had its largest oil consortium, led by British Petroleum
and Amoco, suspend scheduled work on a 4-billion-barrel field that
is already producing oil.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign analysts say the government's sensible monetary
policies will cushion the blow, already being felt by neighbors
like Russia, when trouble arrives.
</P>
<P>
   They do not fix a date for the onset of economic problems, nor
blame electoral politics or Russia's financial collapse. Rather,
analysts chiefly cite the brutal impact of low world commodity
prices on poor nations that, pinning recovery hopes on oil, metal
and agricultural sales, hesitated too long to diversify into
private manufacturing and build a steady tax base.
</P>
<P>
   ``These countries are in for some difficult times because they
made some unrealistic assumptions, and now they are haunting
them,'' said Hartmut Fischer, an economist here from San Francisco
University who specializes in the region.
</P>
<P>
   After this year's 40 percent drop in world oil prices, Caspian
region leaders are already discussing their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbayev is concentrating much of his re-election campaign not
on promises calculated to please the electorate but on preparing
his people for worse times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely clear that the threat of economic catastrophe
is appearing slowly,'' Nazarbayev said in a recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview, he said: ``I think that 1999 and 2000 will
be tough. It is a phase. We need to outlast it.''

 Giving Stock to Kids or Charity  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I have owned some shares in a stock for five years, with
an original cost of about $1,000. The current market value is about
$9,000. What are the tax consequences if I give the stock to my
son? What are the tax consequences if I give the stock to charity
instead?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  First of all, congratulations on your investment
acumen. A ninefold price increase in five years? You can manage my
money anytime.
</P>
<P>
   Because the stock is worth less than $10,000, you can give it to
your son without paying gift taxes if he is at least 18 years old.
If he is younger than 18, you can avoid the gift tax only if you
deposit the money for his benefit in a Uniform Trust to Minors
account, which you can open at almost any financial institution.
</P>
<P>
   You won't have to pay a capital-gains tax on your $8,000
investment gain. However, your son will have to pay the tax after
he sells.
</P>
<P>
   If he does sell, he must use your $1,000 cost basis in
determining the size of the gain. He also will use your purchase
date in determining whether it is a long-term gain _ which it is in
this case because you have held the stock for five years. (One year
would have been enough to qualify.)
</P>
<P>
   Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller suggests that
you dig up the confirmation slip you received from your broker when
you bought the stock and give it to your son so that he can
document the cost and purchase date if the IRS audits him after he
sells.
</P>
<P>
   If you give the stock to charity, you can claim the full current
market value of the stock on your income tax as a charitable
deduction. Again, you don't have to pay the capital-gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   You are allowed to deduct whatever the stock was worth on the
day the company entered the transfer of ownership on its books.
This might not happen until days or even weeks after you tell your
broker to deliver the stock to the charity.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your broker or the company's transfer agent when the change
of ownership became official. Also ask for the stock's high and low
trading prices on that day. Take the midpoint, multiply it by the
number of shares, and that is how much you can deduct.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Treasuries
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am interested in T-bill investing, which seems much safer
than the stock market. How do I go about it?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: If you have access to the Internet, go to the U.S.
Treasury Department Web site at  &LR; www.treasurydirect.gov. &LR;  It tells
you how to open an investment account directly with the government,
and explains the rules governing purchases and sales of Treasury
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can call the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at
(415) 974-2330 and order a free investor kit.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy Treasuries in person, by telephone or on the Web
site after you have established an account. All purchases are
commission-free. However, if you sell before the issue matures, you
must pay a $34 transaction fee.
</P>
<P>
   The government will keep track of your assets, collect your
interest income and maintain your account free of charge if the
assets total no more than $100,000. Above that, you pay a $25
annual fee.
</P>
<P>
   You also can buy and sell Treasuries through your broker, who
will charge you commissions.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy Treasury bills (which expire in 13 to 52 weeks),
notes (two to 10 years) or bonds (30 years) for only $1,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Although Treasuries certainly are safer than stocks, they return
less than stocks over the long term. The current annual interest
rates range from about 4.3 percent for shorter-term issues to 5
percent for 30-year bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The interest you earn on Treasuries is exempt from state and
local income taxes. However, you will have to pay the federal tax.
</P>
<P>
   Young Investor
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am 22 years old and recently took a full-time job with
Oracle Corp. My company offers a 401(k) and a stock-purchase plan.
What disturbs me is all the recent negative financial news. Do you
have any investment suggestions for people my age?
</P>
<P>
   A: An investor your age should worry far less about current
financial conditions than someone who is middle-aged or approaching
retirement. One way or another, the U.S. economy always manages to
prevail in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, most experts advise young people to invest
almost entirely in a diversified portfolio of stocks or equity
mutual funds, which have a superior long-term growth record.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have returned an average of about 10 percent annually
(including reinvestment of dividends) during the past several
decades. At that rate, every $1,000 you invest today would be worth
$60,000 when you are ready to collect Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   You probably can piece together a sound portfolio by investing
whatever you can afford in your company's 401(k) plan and also
putting up to $2,000 per year in a Roth Individual Retirement
Account, where your investments grow tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   Investing in Oracle through its stock-purchase plan certainly
would have been a great idea in the past. The stock is selling for
more than 25 times what it cost 10 years ago. On the other hand,
the price is still below the highs reached in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that staking the bulk of your funds on one stock
is extremely risky _ even though it has paid off so far for your
boss of bosses, billionaire Larry Ellison.  &QL;

 Network Associates Says Killer Virus Hit MCI WorldCom  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
A new, highly sophisticated computer virus that installs itself in
network servers surfaced last week in MCI WorldCom Inc.'s corporate
system.
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates Inc., the world's leading maker of anti-virus
software, publicized the existence of the new Remote Explorer virus
yesterday, calling it the ``most destructive virus ever seen.''
However, the Santa Clara company added that so far, the damage was
limited and a cure already is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does represent an entirely new kind of virus, but at this
point, there's no reason to panic,'' said Peter Watkins, general
manager for Network Associates' security division.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said Remote Explorer was programmed to install itself
primarily into Microsoft Windows NT network computer servers and
workstations though it also can reside on, but not infect, Unix
systems. The virus systematically encrypts documents and other
files with a code that has to be unlocked before the files can be
accessed again.
</P>
<P>
   He said the virus appears to be the work of a technologically
savvy programmer and ``is the first one that is really targeted at
attacking a network environment.''
</P>
<P>
   It was far more sophisticated than other viruses like the new MS
Word Macro 97 Class Virus, which also recently appeared, that
normally are activated by a computer user opening a file or
document.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not (the work of) a weekend hacker; this is a pro,''
Watkins said. ``It's scary. This is a completely new strain that is
self-propagating.''
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates would only say Remote Explorer was discovered
last Thursday in one of its Fortune 100 clients, but it declined to
name the company. However, MCI WorldCom spokesman Jim Monroe
confirmed that MCI is so far the only known victim of the Remote
Explorer virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We detected it very quickly, and it had no impact on our
customers,'' Monroe said. The company is investigating how the
virus entered the system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said the virus was only programmed to encrypt files and
that it also was programmed to move more rapidly between 3 p.m. and
6 a.m. weekdays and all day Saturday and Sunday, when program
administrators normally are not at work.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, however, could have been programmed for greater
destruction, such as deleting files, Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates has a Remote Explorer detection program
available to its customers and is working on a program to clean up
files infected by the virus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bradshaw, spokesman for Network Associates' chief rival,
Symantec Corp., said his company has not encountered another
instance of the virus and was awaiting a sample from Network
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of VIRUS22 (84030 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Analyst Peter Rogers of Volpe Brown Whelan said it was too soon
to tell whether Remote Explorer will erupt into an epidemic, but he
said technology has always found a cure for viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of sophistication and complexity of viruses has
increased pretty dramatically,'' Rogers said. ``Each level has been
overcome by technology, and I suspect that will be the case here.''
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates stock rose 12 percent to close at $60.38, up
$6.38. Rogers said news of the virus had an effect but that Network
Associates also benefited from a strong market for technology
stocks.

 Bidder Beware, Say eBay Critics  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett and Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
In just three years, online auctioneer eBay has gone from a seller
of Pez dispensers to one of the hottest spots on the Internet. Its
stock has soared, giving the company a market value yesterday of
nearly $12 billion and climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a growing number of critics _ who derisively call the
company ``eBad'' and ``ePay'' _ say what's keeping eBay aloft is
hot air and charge that fraud is rampant on the popular online
auction site. They accuse the San Jose company of turning a blind
eye to those who put in false bids, sell fake items or fail to
deliver paid-for merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, critics claim that eBay auctions sometimes offer
illegal items. During the past week, sellers were offering Cuban
cigars, which cannot legally be imported in the United States, and
an AK-47 assault rifle, which is illegal to sell in California and
several other states. One particularly brazen seller advertised a
``Banned Covert Auto-knife'' _ a type of switchblade _ bragging
that ``the Feds have decided that it's in your best interest not to
let anymore of these knives into our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaints to eBay often go unheeded, critics say, and violators
are able to easily slip back in using a new identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen them suspend someone and let them back on the same
night,'' said Sandra List, a Washington, D.C.-area user. ``They
don't have a central file of suspensions, so the thieves are on an
honor system.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at eBay emphasize that problems have arisen in only a
small percentage of the 36 million auctions it has hosted. When an
eBay user complains about an impropriety, the company is quick to
investigate and act, said Brad Handler, director of public policy.
In addition, the auction site offers a number of protections that
include 24-hour customer support, a feedback forum where bidders
and sellers are rated by users, and access to an escrow service to
secure transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay is a community that is working hard to create an
environment of open, honest trade,'' said Handler. ``It's
incredibly difficult in the online and offline world to catch the
dedicated criminal, but it doesn't mean we aren't trying.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Handler also said that eBay cannot proactively monitor
the site for illegal activity and that it relies on users to bring
problems to its attention.
</P>
<P>
   But many users say the system isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of EBAY22 (32382 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Earlier this month, eBay executives got to see for themselves. As
a publicity stunt, eBay asked ``Today Show'' host Katie Couric and
her co-workers to autograph a show jacket to auction off for
chartity. Bids zoomed to $200,000. But, a chagrined eBay learned,
most of the bids were pranks. After checking on bidders, eBay found
the real high bid to be a paltry $11,400.
</P>
<P>
   In a more serious case, an Oklahoma City man pocketed at least
$30,000 and up to $100,000 for baseball cards he didn't deliver,
according to postal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Dean Stemple, 27, allegedly bilked eBay customers by
enticing them into sending money orders for auction items he
claimed he had but never delivered. There is no warrant or
indictment yet for Stemple, who is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the transactions were made over the Internet, they
are being investigated as mail fraud, said postal inspector Linda
Kirksey of Fort Worth, Texas. ``The people who bid on the products
sent their money through the postal mail,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at eBay have refused to reimburse buyers who were
duped by Stemple. Handler said the company policy is to urge those
who believe they've been bilked to report problems to eBay and to
local law enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask law enforcement authorities to contact us, so we can
make sure we give them all the information we have about this bad
actor,'' Handler said.
</P>
<P>
   These incidents illustrate the pitfalls of performing anonymous
transactions on the wild and wooly Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lines are blurred,'' said List, the Washington-area user.
``You never know who you're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassment over the ``Today Show'' jacket and the alleged
fraud by Stemple came at the same time eBay was experiencing a
series of outages that angered users. Yet in many ways, eBay is a
lot like President Clinton. The worse things get, the higher its
stock rises.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, eBay's shares rocketed to another new high, climbing
$44.13 to $296.38. Its nearly $12 billion market value is more than
that of consumer-products giant Clorox and nearly triple that of
Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that, whatever its problems, eBay remains the
hottest auction site, with traffic that far outpaces competitors.
So despite their complaints, users keep coming back.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of EBAY22 (32382 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  One practice that riles List and others is ``shill bidding'' _
when sellers use a different identity to bid on their own items, or
have friends bid on the item. The purpose: to drive up the price or
to reach the 30-bid level, which puts the auction into eBay's
``hot'' category and earns it a special promotion on the site.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  She and others say eBay is slow to take action on complaints
because the higher the price an item fetches, the more commission
the company collects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't do checks on people who register, so the same
person can sign up under different names and bid an item up. It
hurts everyone,'' said one heavy eBay seller who said he grossed
tens of thousands of dollars on eBay last year. The seller, who
lives in Canada, pointed out several auctions in which bidders
appeared to be the same person registered under different names. In
another case, he pointed out a seller who appeared to have faked
his own feedback to ensure a high rating.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at eBay say they suspend anyone they catch who
registers multiple times under different user IDs.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian seller and many other eBay users say earnings from
eBay auctions have become a significant portion of their incomes.
That's why they say they are so passionate about the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``People care about this. It's their livelihood,'' said List.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us just want to sell $10 items and not make trouble,''
said one Bay Area user. ``We are troubled by the amount of
fraudulent goods sold on the service. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Don Brister of the San Jose Police Department's High
Technology Crimes Detail said it has received a handful of
complaints about eBay but that the company ``has done everything it
can to protect the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there are problems,'' he said. ``But the consumer has to
take some personal responsibility to ensure their own money is
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Schwartz, president and general manager of eBay
competitor Auction Universe, said protecting users from fraud is
actually quite simple. Auction Universe, for example, offers a
service known as Bid Safe, which for $19.95 a year provides $3,000
in insurance for buyers and sellers against fraud, shipping damage
or other losses. More important, Bid Safe includes an escrow
service in which Auction Universe handles credit-card payments for
buyers and sellers and holds payments until it is assured the item
is delivered in satisfactory condition.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of EBAY22 (32382 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``If we want this thing to grow, we have to make people feel
safe,'' Schwartz said. ``Right now it's getting the perception that
it can't be trusted.''

 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALPINE, Ariz. _ Last spring, Bobby Fite peered down the sight of
his .22 magnum rifle at what he thought was a coyote stalking two
newborn calves near his house here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw that scope on her, then I saw that box on her, and I
thought, man, that's one of them wolves,'' Fite, a rancher, said,
recalling how he lowered his rifle after he realized that the
predator in his pasture was a Mexican gray wolf, or lobo.
</P>
<P>
   Newly reintroduced after ranchers exterminated them half a
century ago from the high timberlands of eastern Arizona, today's
lobos wear radio collars that allow them to be tracked by
biologists.
</P>
<P>
   But the wolves have had a rocky return to Arizona's forests this
year. Of the first batch of 11 released in March, five were shot,
two are missing and presumed dead, and the rest had to be
recaptured for their safety while biologists reworked the program.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, scientists released two pairs into the wilderness.
This time, the hindquarters of each wolf were spray-painted orange.
The radio collars were also painted, orange for males, pink for
females.
</P>
<P>
   The paint should not interfere with the wolves' mating habits,
because the animals are color blind. But some environmentalists
grumble that, even though the intent is to protect the wolves,
marking them this way is the equivalent of painting fluorescent
targets on their backsides.
</P>
<P>
   The paint is to help hunters distinguish Mexican wolves, one of
the smallest wolf subspecies in North America, from coyotes, the
garden-variety predators of the West. In much of the rural West,
coyotes can be legally shot year round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyotes are varmints,'' said Sam Luce, another rancher near
here. ``They are in our chicken houses, killing our chickens,
killing our barn cats. A lot of the sportsmen consider them a
target. That puts the wolf in a bad situation, because he looks
just like a coyote.''
</P>
<P>
   After the rash of wolf shootings in the fall, wildlife officials
angrily called the killings ``sabotage.'' But now they say it
appears that errors by hunters may account for most of the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that many local ranchers were hostile to the release of
the wolves, biologists worked early this year to monitor the
animals and remove them from areas with sheep and cows. They also
educated ranchers about the penalty for intentionally killing a
Mexican wolf, an endangered animal, on public land: a fine of up to
$100,000 and a jail term of up to one year.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts appeared at first to be successful. Until the
hunting season began in August, only one wolf was shot and killed _
by a camper.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ranchers wanted to shoot wolves, they would have shot
them in April, May, and June, when the wolves were in town, in
calving pastures, among sheep, among horses,'' said Diane
Boyd-Heger, a wolf biologist for the Arizona Game and Fish
Department, who has directed the introduction program. ``The local
people had plenty of opportunities to shoot these wolves. I really
don't think it was the ranchers.''
</P>
<P>
   But things took a turn for the worse with the annual fall
invasion by hunters of the Apache National Forest, which surrounds
this tiny village. Before the season began, wildlife officials had
mailed brochures explaining the wolf-recovery program to the 6,000
hunters who had permits to hunt dear, elk, bear and mountain lions
in the wolf area.
</P>
<P>
   But from August through November, four wolves were shot dead
over an area the size of Connecticut. According to the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service, which is leading the
investigation into the killings, at least three guns were used.
Rewards totaling $45,000 have been posted for information leading
to an arrest and conviction in a wolf killing case.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by losing half of the wolves in the first year,
biologists plan to release in the National Forest here next March
two more packs, totaling nine wolves. The goal is to have a
population of 100 Mexican wolves roaming the National Forest by the
year 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Babbitt, the secretary of the interior and a former
governor of Arizona, has stressed his support for the program in
two visits this year to this mountain town, a five-hour drive from
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   A poll in October of 720 Arizona residents by the Behavior
Research Center, a Phoenix company, found that 61 percent of
respondents said they had become more supportive in recent years of
efforts to protect endangered wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   But in this economically depressed corner of the state, many
people see the wolves as another blow imposed by outsiders to a
rural economy already hurt by dramatic reductions in timber
harvests from public lands and in the number of cows that ranchers
can have graze on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got plenty of predators around here already _ mountain
lions, coyotes, lots of bears,'' said Luce, a retired doctor whose
cattle grazes on his own land along the Blue River. He said that
every fall when his neighbors rounded up cattle from grazing on
National Forest lands, they regularly discovered that they had lost
about 10 percent of their calves to predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This competition just throws these wolves into the cattle,''
said Luce, who added that, in May, a wolf killed his 8-year-old
trained cow dog, which he valued at $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Anderson, a big-game hunting guide, said over lunch at the
Bear Wallow Cafe here that he had no problems with a few wolves in
the woods. ``But if they get 100 up here, I don't know what will
happen,'' Anderson said, as his blue tick hunting hounds barked
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Worried by articles in hunting magazines about wolves killing
hunting dogs in Minnesota, he said: ``I have hounds that I have
turned down $4,000 for. I guess, I'll just keep my fingers
crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   The wolf release program was opposed by the ranching
associations of New Mexico and Arizona, the governors of both
states and by votes of county commissioners in 11 counties.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the polarization caused by the wolf release, on Dec.
6 someone fired a shotgun into the offices of a Santa Fe, N.M.,
animal rights group. The group had received an anonymous letter
threatening ``to kill any wolf reintroduced.'' Four days later,
someone spray-painted in large letters, ``Wolves'' and ``N.M. Needs
Wolves'' on the building that houses the New Mexico Cattle Growers'
Association.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Cattle Growers' Association sent out a press
release urging hunters to boycott a Fish and Wildlife Service
questionnaire about the wolf killings. Slipping into the kind of
harsh language that often has surrounded the wolf program, the
association called the query ``Gestapo tactics by an out-of-control
federal agency embarrassed by the total failure of its all-advised
reintroduction program.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with sharp criticism by three of New Mexico's congressmen,
the Service retracted the questionnaire last Friday. &QL;

TV FAILS TO REFLECT SOCIETY, ACTORS UNION STUDY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Television continues to present a distorted
picture of real life with significant underrepresentation of women,
seniors, the poor and most minorities, a report released Monday
showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of television seems to be frozen in a time warp of
obsolete and damaging representations,'' asserted George Gerbner, a
Temple University professor of telecommunications and author of the
study, which was commissioned by the Screen Actors Guild. ``Through
changes in ownership, management, stars and styles, the cast of the
world of television is much as it was in 1993 or, for that matter,
in 1969.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerbner, who reviewed 9,000 characters in 645 episodes between
1994 and 1997, found that women consistently played one out of
every three roles in prime time and only 48 &UR;  &LR; percent of all
characters on daytime shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They age faster than men and as they age they are more likely
to be portrayed as sexless and evil,'' he noted. ``Mature women
seem especially hard to cast _ and hard to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Seniors have nearly vanished, the study found, with old men in
0.4 &UR;  &LR; percent of roles and women in 0.2 &UR;  &LR; percent in prime time. By
ignoring seniors, television is saying that ``as characters age,
they lose importance, value and effectiveness,'' Gerbner said.
</P>
<P>
   In the study's single positive note, Gerbner found
African-American characters represented 12.3 &UR;  &LR; percent of all TV
characters, a figure generally equivalent to their percentage in
the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   But Latinos, representing more than 10 &UR;  &LR; percent of the actual
population, are cast in 2.6 &UR;  &LR; percent of prime time roles and
3.7 &UR;  &LR; percent of daytime; Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders,
representing 3.4 &UR;  &LR; percent of the populace, are much less visible in
prime time at 1.4 &UR;  &LR; percent and 0.4 &UR;  &LR; percent in daytime. &QL;

EDITORIAL: CAN `THE COACH' CHANGE TACTICS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Dec. 22: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Battered by the resignations under fire of House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and Speaker-to-be Robert Livingston in just two months,
House Republicans have picked a little-known, untested Midwesterner
to serve as their next speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hastert, a former high school wrestling coach, has a
reputation as a conciliator and technocrat who can work with
members of both parties. Such qualities could do much to help the
next Congress rise above the partisan rancor of the last year _ but
only if Hastert shows his independence from the mean-spirited
tactics of his chief backers, especially Tom DeLay, the Republican
whip.
</P>
<P>
   In his 12 years in Congress, Hastert has been a shrewd and
popular backbencher with strong positions on only a handful of
issues. Few say he has a clear philosophy like that of Gingrich or
knowledge of government like that of Livingston, who served as
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee before his
designation as speaker a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of an oversight committee on national security,
Hastert devoted himself almost exclusively to combating drugs. In
the last budget, he unapologetically won a $250,000 subsidy for the
maker of a caffeine-laden chewing gum in his district. He has also
championed some patient rights in health care reform.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for the country to have someone with such a limited
background vaulted into the position of third in line of succession
to the presidency. Even so, Hastert's potential as a successful
speaker should not be dismissed. He is getting this chance because
House Republicans were rocked by public reaction to their
insistence on impeaching Clinton instead of censuring him. The
Republicans are at least showing some sensitivity by reaching
beyond the Southern hard-liners for this leadership position.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with Hastert's sudden emergence is that his most
recent service has been as deputy whip under DeLay, whose
scorched-earth tactics forced Livingston to abandon an initial
promise to let the House vote on the censure option. If Hastert
hopes for reconciliation, he needs to renounce such partisan
tactics, especially since Republicans have only a six-vote majority
in the next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The other challenge facing Hastert is to restore a measure of
maturity and stability to his party. He can set an example for his
House and the White House in avoiding what Dick Gephardt, the
Democratic leader, called the politics of personal destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The important business of the next Congress, including rescue of
Social Security and steps to insulate the United States from the

EMBASSY BOMB SUSPECT ORDERED HELD WITHOUT BAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden
appeared in federal court Monday after his extradition from Germany
and continued to deny any connection to terrorism, his lawyer said
after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, was ordered held without bond
by a judge after the prosecutor said the government was concerned
about ``the danger to the community and the risk of flight.'' A
lawyer for Salim, while not conceding the government's points, said
that he would not oppose the request for now. He reserved the right
to ask the court for Salim's release on bond at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Salim was handed over by German authorities on Sunday. He waged
a three-month battle to avoid extradition in the investigation of
bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected of organizing the bombings of
two U.S. embassies in Africa last August and of other acts of
terrorism against Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal to secure his custody, the United States
promised Germany that U.S. prosecutors would not seek the death
penalty against Salim, who was arrested near Munich in September.
German law bars extradition of suspects to countries where they may
face execution.
</P>
<P>
   Salim, a Sudanese native who is believed to be of Iraqi descent,
has been charged with four conspiracy counts, including conspiracy
to murder, to use weapons of mass destruction, to transport
explosives and to attack American military installations abroad. He
is suspected of having played a central role in the organization
led by bin Laden, which is called Al Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that Salim managed bin Laden's finances,
conducted his international business deals, and sought to obtain
nuclear weapons components for Al Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
   Salim, 40, a gaunt man with closely cropped black hair and a
short beard, stood quietly by his lawyer in court Monday, saying
only a few words to acknowledge that he understood his legal
rights.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, his lawyer, Paul McAllister, said that his
client continued to assert his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charges are really vague,'' McAllister added, saying that
one of the counts in the federal complaint against Salim charges
that he ``conspired to kill nationals of the United States'' but
names no victims. ``You can't get any vaguer than that,''
McAllister said.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, McAllister also complained to Magistrate
Judge Ronald Ellis that federal authorities had confiscated some of
Salim's possessions, including a copy of the Koran that his client
has had for 22 years and that is ``of great sentimental value,''
some legal papers and a wristwatch.
</P>
<P>
   McAllister said Salim needed the watch so that he could
determine when it was time to say his prayers.
</P>
<P>
   A federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, confirmed that the
materials were in government custody and ``have not disappeared,''
but said that for security reasons, the Bureau of Prisons would
have the final say on whether they should be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Salim's arrival means that the government now has custody of
five suspects _ a sixth is awaiting extradition in Britain _ who
have been charged in connection with the embassy attacks in Kenya
and Tanzania or other terrorism attributed to bin Laden by the
authorities.

UCLA'S FARRIS WEIGHS NFL OPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The day Kris Farris came home with a D in freshman
English at Santa Margarita High, his father, Marty, went wild.
``We're not paying $5,000 to send you to school to get D's,'' Marty
screamed.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-9 Farris is as bright as he is big, but his study
habits were needing. So each night, his mother, Debbie, sat at the
kitchen table and reviewed his assignments. She taught him how to
make an outline and how to allocate his time. She taught him to
identify themes and weed out extraneous material. They even watched
a video: Where there's a will, there's an A.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those nights at the kitchen table taught him the process of
how to study,'' Debbie said. ``It turned his life around.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris made straight A's as a senior and is applying those
skills to his latest project: whether or not to leave UCLA a year
early and apply for the NFL Draft. A left tackle _ one of the most
valued positions in football _ Farris recently won the Outland
Trophy as the nation's top lineman. The deadline for juniors to
apply is Jan. 8, and he plans to spend every hour researching his
option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people to think this is on a whim,'' he said.
``I'm at the point I could go either way. It's not going to be 100
percent right or wrong. There are pluses and minuses for both.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris has a two-pronged plan to determine his value. Following
standard procedure, he has asked the NFL's draft advisory board for
its recommendation and expects a response this week. Most likely,
it will identify Farris as a first- or second-round selection _ the
highest grade available.
</P>
<P>
   But the board is little more than an educated guess by a handful
of teams, and some may not need left tackles. So to reduce his
margin for error, Farris is doing his own research: He and coach
Bob Toledo are calling teams and speaking directly to general
managers and personnel directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know New Orleans and Arizona are on the advisory board, and
I wouldn't take their word for it,'' said one personnel director
who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farris is a left tackle, he's smart and he'd probably go in
the first round, but he'd scare me to death. We'd have trouble
taking him very high. Based on everything I've heard from scouts
and coaches, he's not real tough. He's no Jonathan Ogden or Tony
Boselli.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to mature and get stronger. He needs to stay in
school. I know he didn't allow a sack, but there are no draftable
defensive ends in the Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA offensive line coach Mark Weber also believes Farris needs
another year, although Weber admits his bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he's ahead of all the juniors, but there are some
things I think he needs to do to better prepare himself for the
next level,'' Weber said. ``He needs one more year in (strength
coach Kevin) Yoxall's program to get bigger and become a more
physical player and a more punishing run-blocker.''
</P>
<P>
   If he returns, Farris could join Nebraska's Greg Rimington as
the only players in NCAA history to win the Outland Trophy twice.
He could become the first UCLA player to win the coveted Lombardi
Award, given to the nation's best lineman/linebacker. (Ogden won
the Outland in 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   He'd be the leader and most recognized player on what could be a
top-10 team, and he'd have one more year in a college environment _
one more year to pal around with housemates Brad Melsby and Pete
Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Money isn't an issue, but timing is. A fourth-year junior,
Farris may decide he's tired of the 6 a.m. weight workouts and
bored with the Pac-10's second-rate defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   There's no guarantee a senior season will increase his value.
What if UCLA struggles with an untested quarterback? What about
injuries? Ex-Bruins J.J. Stokes, Kevin Jordan, Karim Abdul-Jabbar
and Donnie Edwards all returned for their senior seasons _ and all
got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he's in Toledo's office or sitting at the kitchen table,
it's all the same for Farris. He's compiling volumes of information
and must identify the pertinent material before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It haunts me,'' he said. ``Everyone has an opinion. At the
(team) banquet it was, `Stay, stay, stay.' Others say, `Are you
kidding? It's the opportunity of a lifetime.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so naive in August. I thought it would be black and
white. I thought the decision would be made for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After Farris weeds through the pros and cons, determines his
value and his desire, he'll have a final consideration: his
allegiance to UCLA _ and its faith in him.
</P>
<P>
   On a crisp late-November afternoon four years ago at Santa
Margarita, Farris was denied a first-team spot to the All-Sea View
League. Stunned, then devastated, he went home and feared the
omission would affect his recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, USC called with bad news. The Trojans recommended a
year at a local junior college. Farris would study and get
stronger, then transfer to USC and redshirt. In other words, the
Trojans wanted him to sit for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst day of my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was sobbing in his bedroom when the phone rang one more time.
It was UCLA assistant coach Bob Field.
</P>
<P>
   Farris trembled as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, I made second-team all-league,'' he said, ``and a lot
of schools have stopped recruiting me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' Field responded, ``because we really want you.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, an Outland Trophy in hand and the NFL within
reach, Farris mulls his future with a full plate and a heavy
conscience.

 IRATE RAPPERS GIVE JOURNALISTS A COMBAT BEAT  (jw) 
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a new music video, a black editor of a hip-hop
magazine tears through a dusty animal range, stalked by Ice Cube, a
titan of gangsta rap. The rapper, wearing a scowl, eventually slays
the journalist, then mounts his taxidermic head on a wall with that
of so-called playa hataz (player haters), people who begrudge the
success of others.
</P>
<P>
   The video, of course, is pure fiction. But black journalists who
cover hip-hop culture say the theme, though certainly exaggerated,
is chillingly real. They say threats and assaults by rappers and
others in the industry are becoming increasingly common, leaving
some journalists operating in an atmosphere of intimidation and
self-censorship.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent case, the editor in chief of Blaze, a new spinoff of
Vibe, says he was stomped in the face and struck with chairs by
four men, two of whom he recognized as rap producers.
</P>
<P>
   The police say the assault, which took place last month in a
conference room in the magazine's Manhattan office, left the
29-year-old editor, Jesse Washington, with cuts in the head and
facial fractures. Washington, who said the beating was over a
photograph of one artist/producer, has pressed charges against two
of the men, who have denied beating Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``When four guys have you on the ground kicking you in the head,
it's for real,'' said Washington, who is considering plastic
surgery. ``My face got pretty wrecked. The fact that I didn't want
my mom to see me for a while tells you how serious it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers and editors say other rappers have lashed out because
they didn't make the cover of publications, didn't like what was
printed about them or didn't like the photos that appeared in
magazines. As a result, some journalists say they are careful not
to be acerbic _ or to do anything that would set off an artist _
when they profile rappers or critique new CDs. Some journalists,
speaking on the condition of anonymity, say rappers are sometimes
allowed to see stories and layouts before they go to press.
</P>
<P>
   VIBE/SPIN Ventures, the owner of Vibe, Spin and Blaze magazines,
is hiring security guards and putting in place a system that lets
employees call for help in case of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Scott, a former member of the disbanded Almighty RSO, said
the ire between the news media and hip-hop artists has its roots in
envy. ``Some journalists try to decimate the character of
rappers,'' Scott explained. ``We're pretty much all young black
guys getting money, and they're jealous, so they try to embarrass
us. As young black guys, why should we get trampled on by our own?
They can criticize us without disrespecting us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rap has long been denounced for its violent lyrics _ lyrics that
rappers say reflect the raw energy of the streets from which they
emerge. Some of the violence has crossed over into real fatalities,
like the shooting deaths of the rappers Tupac Shakur and the
Notorious B.I.G.
</P>
<P>
   Less apparent, though, is the atmosphere of violence that is
creeping into the hip-hop magazine world, which has grown over the
last three years with the expanding industry. Black reporters and
editors see their close relationship with artists as part of the
problem, saying that performers and producers see black journalists
as their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to the same clubs, concerts and live in the same
neighborhoods,'' said Kierna Mayo, a former editor of The Source, a
hip-hop glossy. So when someone writes a less than flattering
profile of a performer or pans a CD, the artist feels a sense of
betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Reginald Dennis, former music editor of The Source and former
editor in chief of XXL, a hip-hop magazine, sees other reasons.
``It's black pathology at its worst,'' Dennis said. ``As a
journalist, you think twice about asking hard and probing
questions. You have to run your office like it's an armed camp. I
maintain that a writer is going to get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Several black journalists said that artists assume they can get
away with assaulting black writers but not white ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys would never attack a white journalist,'' said Cheo
Hodari Coker, a freelance writer who says he was assaulted a few
years back by a member of the Wu-Tang Clan. ``Rappers are many
things. They're ignorant but they're not stupid. They know they
would go to jail, straight to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheena Lester, the editor in chief of XXL, agreed. ``They don't
respond to us the same way they do to mainstream media,'' she said.
``They would never do what they did to Jesse to Joe Levy, the music
editor at Rolling Stone. What happened with Jesse was so
horrifying, I couldn't sleep. I mean, beat up in his office!''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Washington said Deric ``D-Dot'' Angelettie, a producer who works
with the rap impresario Sean ``Puff Daddy'' Combs, attacked him
because he had unmasked Angelettie in the current issue of Blaze as
the Madd Rapper, a comical performer whose identity, Washington
insists, was already known among many rap followers. Ian Niles, a
lawyer for Angelettie and Anthony Hubbard, the other man named by
Washington as an assailant, said his clients were not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Washington says he has had a run-in
with someone involved in hip-hop. In August, he said Wyclef Jean, a
musician with the chart-topping Fugees, brandished a gun as he
tried to stop Washington from publishing a bad review of a CD he
had produced. Washington did not file charges, and Jean told an MTV
interviewer that the incident never happened, labeling the
accusation a publicity stunt. Jean would not comment for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   While cases like Washington's have been publicized, many of the
threats are not even reported to the police. ``There's a dilemma,''
Dennis said. ``If you're black and go to the police, you've
violated the code of the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say journalists have retaliated by banning the artists from
their publications.
</P>
<P>
   White critics and editors say such incidents are extremely rare
in rock music. Recently, however, a white rocker, Marilyn Manson,
watched as his bodyguards assaulted Craig Marks, the white
executive editor of Spin, a sister publication of Blaze and Vibe,
because Manson didn't make the cover of the January issue of the
magazine, Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   He has filed charges against Manson and the bodyguards. Paul
Cambria, a lawyer for Manson, said, ``I can tell you that Manson
vehemently, categorically denies that there was ever an assault on
this man.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Coker, a writer on assignment for Mouth 2
Mouth, a defunct Time Inc. publication, traveled to Staten Island
to interview the Wu-Tang Clan, a gangsta group he had written about
before. He said he was socked in his left eye by Masta Killa, one
of the group's members, who didn't like a caricature of Wu-Tang
that had accompanied Coker's earlier profile of the group in Rap
Pages. In Masta Killa's obscenity-laced diatribe, ``He said, `We're
not cartoon characters,' '' Coker recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Another Wu-Tang member asked him why they didn't get on the
cover of the magazine. ``I told them I had nothing to do with the
cartoon or the cover,'' Coker said. ``I thought, `I just got
punched in the eye for nothing.' I didn't press charges then, but
today the first call I'd make is to the law offices of Johnnie
Cochran.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Masta Killa said the rapper had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said he was threatened dozens of times when he was music
editor at The Source. ``Every time I was threatened I wrote about
it just in case I turned up missing somewhere,'' he said. ``It
should not be open season on writers.''
</P>
<P>
   While at The Source, Dennis and another editor were involved in
a brawl with the four members of the Almighty RSO, who were
dissatisfied with its coverage and threatened to bring them ``out
in body bags,'' Dennis recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been threatening to do bodily harm to the editors, so
we presented them with a writ of mediation in which a
court-appointed officer would mediate,'' Dennis said. ``We went to
the police, and in hip-hop that's not the thing you want to do. So
when we presented them with the writ, they decided they wanted to
fight, so we fought.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, then a member of the Almighty RSO, denied that anyone was
told he would be killed, but admitted there was a fracas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lester said she was threatened by Tupac Shakur when she was
editor of Rap Pages because he didn't like an article about him.
``We said Tupac had a revolutionary spirit, and if he wasn't
careful, he would end up like real revolutionaries: in jail,'' Ms.
Lester recalled. Shakur, she said, left an obscene message on an
answering machine threatening her. ``He said, `I have a big crew,'
'' she recalled. `` `Keep your head up.' It was a terrifying
feeling. He was this respected creative talent with friends and
fans willing to do whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lester said her fears were allayed somewhat when another
rapper, the late Notorious B.I.G., then a friend of Shakur, told
her not to worry. She never reported the threat to the police.
Instead she banned Shakur from the magazine until he was killed in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   One editor, Selwyn Seyfu Hinds, says he thinks that a lack of
sophistication in dealing with volatile situations is the problem.
Hinds, the editor of The Source, says there have been no incidents
of violence at the magazine since he took the helm two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've dealt with situations that were very tense,'' he said.
``But in our case, diplomacy, conversation and mediation have
always prevailed.''

   NEW YORK _ Nicole Kidman, who bares all in the David Hare play
``The Blue Room'' at the Cort Theater, is not the only Hollywood
star who likes the idea of making her way across a New York stage.
Uma Thurman _ whose most recent off-camera role was new mother _
will appear in Martin Crimp's adaptation of Moliere's
``Misanthrope'' next month at the Classic Stage Company in the East
Village.
</P>
<P>
   Acting in front of an audience rather than a camera may pose a
challenge, but the role itself should not: Ms. Thurman will portray
a young American actress in a play that has been modernized from
top to bottom.
</P>

   Christmas Angell
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New Yorker magazine is Tina-less but not
Angell-less this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Brown resigned as editor in July to start a magazine
venture with Miramax. But Roger Angell, who usually contributes a
full-page rhyme built around well-known names for the year-end
issue, was back in his accustomed place on the last page,
mentioning Sen. John Glenn (``the senior flyer'') in almost the
same breath as Danny Meyer, owner of the Union Square Cafe. Angell
skipped last year's issue after the deaths of his former wife and
his brother. (``I wasn't feeling very Yule-y,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   This time around, for an issue that went to the printer the day
before the House voted to impeach President Clinton, Angell used
the word ``unimpeachable'' in the fourth line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rarely as timely as this,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And no, he did not insert the word at the last minute. He said
he decided to allude to the constitutional drama in Washington
about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured it would be in the air, and I wanted to get the
whole thing over with at the beginning of the poem so people
wouldn't be looking for sly references to Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewel Song Sans Faust
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Never mind how the three singers sound at the New
York Philharmonic on New Year's Eve. The advice from one of them,
the soprano Deborah Voigt, is ``Be sure to check out the jewelry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A singer friend said to me, `Get yourself some fancy
jewelry,''' she said. ``So I had Breslin's office call up Van Cleef
&AMP; Arpels, and they said they'd be happy to send some over.''
(``Breslin's office'' refers to her press representative, Herbert
Breslin.)
</P>
<P>
   What happened next sounded like a real-life version of the Ethel
Merman standard ``Anything you can do, I can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the other sopranos got wind of it,'' Miss Voigt said,
``and she's trying to get some too.'' She said she did not know
which of the two others _ Angelica Kirchschlager, a mezzo-soprano,
or Noemi Nadelmann, a coloratura _ had also asked for jewelry. But
someone familiar with the onstage and offstage preparations (and
who spoke on the condition of anonymity) said it was Miss
Kirchschlager.
</P>
<P>
   Butler Available
</P>
<P>
   In London on Monday, Paul Burrell was described as having been
``made redundant.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Burrell _ the former butler to Diana, princess
of Wales, and the man she once called ``my rock'' _ had been let go
by the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, a charity set up
after her death in a car crash last year. Burrell, 40, had
coordinated fund-raising events for the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph said he had been given a month's notice and
would leave his $59,000-a-year post on Jan. 18, having ``accepted
redundancy'' because his job was being phased out. There was no
answer at his home in Wrexham on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will contemplate my future in the new year,'' Burrell told
The Telegraph.

   Janet Brewster Murrow, a radio broadcaster and relief worker
during World War II in London, where her husband, Edward R. Murrow,
was CBS' star war correspondent, died on Friday at the North Hill
retirement community in Needham, Mass., where she lived. She was
88.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murrow was born in Middletown, Conn., and graduated in 1933
from Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass. As a student
leader she met Murrow, who was president of the National Student
Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   They married in 1934. Beginning in 1937, and through World War
II, they lived in London, and Murrow went on to direct CBS' World
War II reporting team and to win fame for his reporting about the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the war began in September 1939, Mrs. Murrow made her
first radio broadcast, for CBS, about family life in wartime, and
she became an occasional broadcaster for CBS and BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Her relief work included arranging for British recipients to get
medicine and other supplies from American donors and helping
evacuate British children to the United States. She also served on
a British-American crisis team that worked to enhance relations
between British civilians and American military personnel stationed
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 she received the King's Medal from Britain, and the
Murrows returned to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She became a Mount Holyoke trustee for 21 years and also served
on the boards of National Public Radio and the Henry Street
Settlement House in New York. Murrow became a CBS vice president
and television broadcaster and then the U.S. Information Agency's
director from 1961 to 1964. He died in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murrow is survived by a son, Casey, of Putney, Vt., and two
grandsons.

LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEFENDS CAR-POOL LANES AS NECESSARY TOOL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Calling car-pool lanes key to traffic relief, the
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Monday to
oppose legislation that would open the diamond lanes to all
motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good tool. The whole point of the lanes is to get
people to share instead of having single-occupancy vehicles,'' said
Supervisor Don Knabe. The car-pool lane ``is a very integral part
of this whole integrated transportation system we're trying to
create'' countywide, Knabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Tom McClintock, a Republican who represents Greater
Los Angeles' northern suburbs, predicted the supervisors'
opposition won't matter in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are thinking like bureaucrats,'' he said. ``We've had 25
years of experience with these diamond lanes. Every scrap of
information we have shows they cause congestion.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate comes as the California Department of Transportation
plans to double the number of car-pool lanes from 305 miles to 680
miles by 2015 in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and
Ventura counties.
</P>
<P>
   On an amendment by Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, the board
unanimously agreed not to oppose Caltrans studying the opening up
the diamond lanes to all traffic on Saturdays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock contends the state effectively stopped building
freeways 30 years ago, ``while politicians like Don Knabe poured
billions of dollars down these transportation rat holes like
diamond lanes.''
</P>
<P>
   McClintock said only 7 percent of traffic uses car-pool lanes,
but Caltrans senior engineer Dawn Helou said that amount represents
15 percent of people on the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock said he bases his conclusions on the experience of
New Jersey, which in November reopened its car-pool lanes to all
traffic on two interstate highways. The car-pool lanes covered only
about 30 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went from bumper-to-bumper congestion to free flow in all
lanes,'' McClintock said.
</P>
<P>
   In an extensive study, New Jersey officials found the diamond
lanes did not boost car pooling but instead worsened traffic
congestion, were plagued with cheaters who endangered others by
darting in and out of the car-pool lanes, and didn't improve air
quality as expected.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The job this week for the National Basketball Players
Association is sealing the cracks in its vaunted unity.
</P>
<P>
   Cracks? Try exposed fault lines. Karl Malone's statement that
the owners' most recent collective-bargaining proposal, mailed to
each NBA player last week by commissioner David Stern, was ``fair''
and that a deal is ``almost done'' measured on seismographs on both
sides of the labor war.
</P>
<P>
   So the union spent Monday, Day 174 of the lockout, in an
``informal'' meeting with its negotiating committee, coming to the
conclusion that the offer was not substantive enough to warrant a
vote of the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Avery Johnson, a member of that rank and file, felt otherwise.
When asked if he believed the owners' latest proposal would go
before the union membership for a vote, Johnson said, ``Yes. Billy
(Hunter, the union executive director) has been doing a good job of
gauging how we feel about everything that's on the table, so I
sense something is going to happen in the next couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Not if you listen to the union's negotiating committee, which
discussed the issue with approximately 100 members on a conference
call Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just caught up and talked over some things,'' said Danny
Schayes. ``Out of the conference call from last week, we had talked
over the viability of voting on their (the owners') proposal. We
voted unanimously in our group not to vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then the players on our weekly conference call (Monday)
voted unanimously not to as well. The response was that they liked
the job we were doing. They're desirous of a fair deal, and they
won't even consider voting on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not right now, but the day may be fast approaching when
the players call for a vote. The season will be canceled if a deal
isn't reached soon, and Stern, who is vacationing in Colorado, has
refused to specify the exact date when the league will be shut
down. It has been 10 days since the negotiating committees from
both sides sat down to bargain, and no new talks are on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Stern mailed a copy of the owners' latest collective-bargaining
proposal to every player in the league, perhaps hoping for a few
players to speak in favor of accepting the deal. It was a move no
doubt prompted by Hunter's assertion that he would not put an
``unacceptable'' offer up for a vote of the union rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone thought the deal was only in need of tweaking before
he considered it acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, that deal (the owners' offer) is fair,''
Malone said at Saturday's charity all-star game in Atlantic City,
N.J. ``It just needs some minor changes. I think the deal is
decent. To me, I feel the deal is almost done.''
</P>
<P>
   Union president Patrick Ewing disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That deal is the same deal we've been going over for the last
two or three weeks _ maybe even longer,'' he said. ``They haven't
changed their position one iota. All they did was make the numbers
look great, but it's not a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Schayes cited non-economic issues like cap restrictions that are
the biggest stumbling blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Schayes pointed out the owners' new definition of the cap hold
as one. In previous years, the salary for a Larry Bird-exception
free agent counted 150 percent against the team's salary cap.
Whatever space remained under the cap when signed players and
unsigned Bird-exception free agents were totaled was how much a
team could offer another's free agent.
</P>
<P>
   But under the new proposal, the cap hold would rise from 150
percent to perhaps 400 percent, meaning teams would have
significantly less room under the cap to go out and sign another
team's free agent _ which translates into less freedom of movement
for players.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the economic issues, we are fairly close,'' Schayes said.
``On the percentage (of basketball-related income to be divided),
we're at 57 (percent) and they're at 52. That's pretty close. On
the escrow number (on how much of their salaries the players should
contribute to protect against salary overspending), they're at 15
(percent); we're at 10. On the (maximum salary) increase, they're
at 12.5 and 7.5 (percent); we're at 13 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then they have a laundry list of 20 other things, other
issues that relate to freedom of movement _ things like trying to
slip in an increased cap hold. There are a lot of those things that
chip away at the value of the Larry Bird exception and free agency.
We may be farther apart on those things than on the economic
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping we can meet between Christmas and New Year's and
hopefully get some action. Let's make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' Eddie Johnson thinks something will happen within
the next week to 10 days _ but it won't be a vote on the owners'
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he (Stern) will come up with a proposal that will
pique our interest,'' Johnson said. ``I think that right after
Christmas he will lay out a proposal that he's had in his pocket
all along, a last, best offer. I think it'll be one that doesn't
really divide the union, but it's going to be where half think it's
good and half doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll give us a short period of time to make a decision on it,
maybe five days or so, so the players will be antsy and anxious to
get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery Johnson said that as doomsday approaches, the union should
consider the fact that the owners have all the leverage and that
after fighting the good fight, it may be time to consider accepting
an offer from the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thinking has always been that when it gets to the point
where it's the last possible date that we can make a deal or this
thing is over (the season is canceled), (that the union leadership
must be) really be mindful of the middle-class guys,'' Johnson
said. ``The big guys are always going to get their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they don't make it on the court, they'll make it off
the court (in endorsements). So just really be mindful of the 300
or so middle-class guys that we have in the league and make your
decision based on those guys.''

 &HT;    Miami Valley's weather gift: a cold, White Christmas
 &HT;    By Brandon Peterson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Brisk winds, a downpour of rain and a steep drop
in the temperature marked the first day of winter Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The weather probably won't get any better today. The high will
be just 18 degrees, according to Jeffrey Sites, meteorologist for
the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   While snow is forecast this week, meteorologists predict a
fast-moving system will dump about an inch on the Miami Valley _
probably on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sites said Christmas Eve skies will be partly sunny with highs
in the 20s.
</P>
<P>
   And for the third year in a row, meteorologists predict no white
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Although a trace of snow graced the ground last Christmas, the
last time the Miami Valley had a white Christmas was the 1 inches
that fell in 1995, said meteorologist Mark Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   With icy rain and snow headed for the Miami Valley, motorists
are advised to allow plenty of time to reach their destinations.
</P>
<P>
   As a steady rain fell Monday evening, police were dispatched to
dozens of accidents. None resulted in serious injuries. Police
expected more serious crashes when freezing weather caused wet
roads to ice over.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the hazardous conditions, the Ohio Highway Patrol
plans to dispatch additional patrol crews, said Lt. John Born. He
also said motorists should prepare for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be equipped with emergency equipment in their
cars like flares, blankets, flashlights, batteries, cell phones or
CBs, jumper cables, candles and matches,'' Born said.
</P>
<P>
   He also urged motorists to wear seat belts and drive cautiously.

FLIGHTS OF FANCY FROM A FLORAL DESIGNER TO THE STARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are some important pronouncements from Robert
Isabell, the Manhattan florist who did Caroline Kennedy's wedding,
Jacqueline Onassis' funeral, last year's Versace tribute at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and, this year, the White House.
</P>
<P>
   White lights on Christmas trees have become so tiresome that he
has switched to the mixed colors considered so hideously downmarket
in the 1980s. Pointsettias are overdone, but they last. Carnations
can actually be chic, like the burgundy ones he used at the opening
of the New York Public Library's Reading Room. (``Oscar de la Renta
called and asked, `What were those beautiful flowers?''')
</P>
<P>
   Sunflowers are an unfortunate trend, but marigolds, like those
he used for the opening of the Jackson Pollock exhibition at the
Museum of Modern Art, are marvelous. Magnolia leaves on Christmas
mantels have become very big in the North. But never, ever use a
vanilla-scented candle at dinner, unless you're in Bali.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York City,'' he said, ``it's just all wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   So went a conversation last week with Isabell, which started on
his daily morning prowl through the 28th Street flower district,
continued in his black Cadillac en route to his 13th Street office
(where his staff was making snowmen out of, yes, carnations, for a
``winter wonderland'' party), and ended up at his West Village town
house, a modernist villa with an interior atrium of cascading walls
of philodendron, where he talked about his Christmas decorations
for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great honor,'' he said, ``maybe even more this year
than other years. I hope we brought some happiness to the
Clintons.''
</P>
<P>
   Isabell worked with Nancy Clarke, chief White House florist, who
has been there since the Carter administration. He made 18
gold-leafed conical trees for the East Room, a lot of crystallized
fruit for the State Dining Room and an enormous outdoor wreath of
noble fir and blue lights for the South Portico. This he considers
his masterpiece. He and his staff hand-dipped 1,500 bulbs into a
blue gel used for theater lighting to get just the right hue _
``presidential blue,'' as he calls it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Royal blue is not the color of the presidency,'' he said.
``That's too dark. It has no life. And Navy blue is very blackish.
This is a very intense, memorable blue. You'll always remember
seeing a wreath of blue lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Isabell has been the premier florist and party producer for New
York society and people with enormous amounts of money for more
than a decade, but this is his first foray into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew about him, of course,'' said Capricia Penavic
Marshall, the White House social secretary. ``And Mrs. Clinton had
seen his work before, and noted it.'' In June, Isabell was invited
to a White House dinner, and by September, Mrs. Clinton had her
office give him a call. ``She gave me the directions,
specifically,'' Ms. Marshall said. ``She said, `I would like to
bring in Robert Isabell to work with Nancy Clarke.'' Isabell made
several trips south, and got along famously with the first lady,
Ms. Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a wonderful time,'' she added. ``They walked from
room to room, deciding where they were going to place things.''
</P>
<P>
   Isabell, who says he is in his ``late 30s,'' said he came to
Manhattan from Duluth, Minn., 20 years ago, which means he arrived
in his late teens. This is entirely possible, since he didn't go to
college. (Although in 1995, Vanity Fair said he was 41.)
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Isabell is murky and sensitive about his past. His
mother was a homemaker; Vanity Fair described his father as a
power-plant operator. ``I don't want to talk about my father,''
Isabell said last week. ``I just don't want to even get into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Isabell, who is tall, dark and handsome, with a soft Minnesota
accent, did say he worked in a Duluth greenhouse from a very young
age, then for the society florist Renny when he first arrived in
New York. Soon he had started his own business _ and was planning
events for Studio 54. In August 1989 he created the 50th-birthday
party for Saul Steinberg at which two children dressed as cherubs
wheeled out a five-tier cake covered in gold and silver leaf.
</P>
<P>
   But his biggest party to date was the three-day celebration in
1995 of the wedding of Marie-Chantal Miller, the second daughter of
a billionaire, and Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece. For the
pre-ceremony ball, Isabell created a Greek temple at an estate
outside London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party went on until six in the morning,'' he said. ``I've
never seen so many young girls wearing couture.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, friends describe Isabell as shy, a little
mysterious, and private. ``You run into him at these places, and
there's Robert in the corner, in a little denim jacket, watching
everything,'' said Wendy Wasserstein, the playwright.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Isabell does 300 to 400 events a year, from the 50-foot
moss-covered Eiffel Tower he once built for Bendel's to Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy's lily-of-the-valley wedding bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   Why flowers? ``I don't even know,'' he said. ``It always brings
joy to people. People use them at the important moments of their
lives.''

MITCHELL TO INVESTIGATE USOC'S BRIBE SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Sen. George Mitchell will be named Tuesday to head an
investigation by the U.S. Olympic Committee into allegations that
Salt Lake City bribed its way into becoming host of the 2002 Winter
Games, according to an Olympic official familiar with the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, the former Democratic senator from Maine who brokered
the Irish peace talks earlier this year and who has been mentioned
as a possible mediator in President Clinton's attempt to avoid
removal from office, is chairman of the USOC's ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC has grown concerned over public and corporate
confidence in the 2002 Winter Games following allegations of
vote-buying made by Marc Hodler, a senior IOC member from
Switzerland. The USOC is also looking ahead, and wants to make
certain that the American cities intending to bid on the 2012
Summer Games comply with IOC bidding rules.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC and a Salt Lake ethics panel are also investigating the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic
Committee, told a Swiss newspaper Monday that IOC members would be
banned from visiting cities bidding to be hosts of the Olympics.
The visits involve lavish wining and dining and gift-giving and
have long been rumored to be vulnerable to corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that the trips of IOC members to candidate
cities, these are terminated,'' Samaranch told the Swiss newspaper
Le Matin.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Samaranch meant that visits would be
stopped only while the Salt Lake mess is sorted out, or whether
they would be stopped permanently. In February, IOC members are
scheduled for visits to cities bidding to be host for the 2006
Winter Games. A vote will take place next year.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the Salt Lake scandal, there is a move in the IOC to
limit either visits or voting on host cities to a smaller group of
members, perhaps the executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Helmick, who resigned as an IOC member and as president
of the USOC over conflict-of-interest charges in 1991, said Monday
that a small group of IOC members was willing to sell votes for
extravagant gifts and favors, such as fur coats, shopping sprees
and $5,000 to $10,000 in free first-class air fare that members and
spouses receive to visit bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake officials have acknowledged spending $400,000 on a
program of scholarships and athletic training for 13 people,
including six relatives of IOC members, most from Africa. However,
the officials have characterized the spending as humanitarian aid,
not bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Welch, who headed the Salt Lake bid committee and later
became president of its Olympic organizing committee, acknowledged
in an interview last week that such lavish gifts as shotguns and
skis had been given to visiting IOC members.

LOS ANGELES MAYOR BACKS SLATE FOR SCHOOL BOARD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Making his bid to reshape a school system he has
called ``evil'' and inept, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan
announced a slate of candidates he will back in April's Board of
Education elections.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes one incumbent _ David Tokofsky _ and three
challengers to unseat current board members. If elected, they would
form a new majority on the seven-member panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who want to revolutionize the school
district,'' Riordan said Monday. ``They will each run their own
campaigns, but I will help them with whatever it takes to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he would be willing to contribute money to their
campaigns if needed.
</P>
<P>
   The challengers represent a mix of public- and private-sector
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Genethia Hayes, executive director of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference's Los Angeles chapter, has been tapped to run
against Barbara Boudreaux, a choice Riordan made &UR;  &LR; in September.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lansing, a former private-school teacher who runs the San
Pedro Boys &AMP; Girls Club, will challenge incumbent George Kiriyama.
</P>
<P>
   Caprice Young, a former assistant deputy mayor for Riordan who
now works for IBM, will challenge Jeff Horton.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's announcement, coming after months of verbal battles
with the board, drew condemnation from the board members he hopes
to remove. Barbara Boudreaux, who represents south Los Angeles,
said the mayor should stick to running the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``He targets anyone who disagrees with him,'' she said. ``We
need someone who's supportive of us, not someone's who's going to
be a bully to the Board of Education.''
</P>
<P>
   She also predicted that Riordan's attempt to influence the
election, possibly with financial support, would backfire. ``My
constituents don't like people trying to buy campaigns,'' Boudreaux
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the challengers said they are their own candidates, pursuing
their own campaigns. Riordan did not try to impose upon them any
unified platform, several said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My decision to run for the board was not some new thing _ it
happened well before the mayor endorsed me,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Each has his or her own notions of what is wrong with the
immense Los Angeles Unified School District. Hayes said she wants
the district to do a better job showing the public where its money
goes. She also wants the district to help cultivate experienced
teachers who want to move into administration and said the district
needs to emphasize reading by the end of third grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curriculum is only open to youngsters who can read,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who served on Riordan's budget team, said the district
needs better strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no financial planning as far as I can see,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, wanted a tighter focus on reading skills as well as
teaching children to use new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing said he was caught off-guard by Monday's announcement
and declined to discuss his proposals for reform until he
officially declares his candidacy in early January. He said,
however, he believes his 17 years of teaching private school could
lend a new perspective to the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``My involvement on the private side brings a whole different
attitude on how to fix something that needs fixing, whereas someone
mired in the same system for years might not,'' Lansing said.
</P>
<P>
   The challengers echoed some of Riordan's complaints about the
board. Its members, several candidates said, are embroiled in
personal politics and interfere with Superintendent Ruben Zacarias'
job.
</P>
<P>
   That puzzled board member Jeff Horton, whom Riordan hopes to
oust. He said he shares Riordan's concern about micromanaging
Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fighting against it,'' Horton said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Board president Victoria Castro, who is not up for re-election
in April, raised a similar complaint Monday about Riordan's slate.
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky, she said, has not been supportive of Zacarias. Castro
is backing county Board of Education member Yolie Flores Aguilar to
unseat Tokofsky &UR;  &LR; and has sent mailers soliciting $99 donations to
Aguilar's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was (Riordan's) intention to have a board that
would support and work with Dr. Zacarias and not micromanage, and I
think this selection demonstrates just the opposite,'' Castro said.
``It's just another back-room deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky said he shared a common approach with Zacarias and
Riordan, calling them education traditionalists in a system gone
haywire.

EDITORIAL: POLITICS AND PEACE IN ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 4th graf, Barak is ..., to CORRECT reference to
Lipkin-Shahak as former army chief of staff, sted retired.) 
 (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 22: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to choose Israel's next government began Monday,
more than a year ahead of schedule. That will mean regrettable new
delays in peace talks with the Palestinians. But the elections, to
be held sometime early next year, will give Israeli voters a chance
to reinforce the wobbly Middle East peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The fractious right-wing coalition led by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu for the past two and a half years has shown
itself incapable of consistent movement toward peace. A new, more
broadly based government could prove more productive. Netanyahu's
two main opponents, Ehud Barak, the Labor party leader, or Gen.
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, an independent centrist, are obvious
candidates to lead such a government. But Netanyahu, if he can find
a way to free himself from the uncompromising right, could also do
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is more of a pragmatist than an ideologue and deserves
credit for leading his Likud party away from rejection of all
territorial compromise. But most of his term has been consumed by
narrow tactical maneuvers, and he has yet to articulate a clear
vision of what would constitute a fair and acceptable peace.
Regrettably, he has launched his re-election campaign with a threat
to suspend his part in carrying out the American-brokered Wye
accord he signed in October.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is an untested campaigner who will have to overcome voter
suspicions that his Labor party is too eager for agreement with the
Palestinians and not careful enough on security issues.
Lipkin-Shahak, a former army chief of staff, has no political
experience and, since he is still formally a military officer, has
refrained from publicly expressing his views. But many centrists
see him as the best hope for achieving a secure peace.
</P>
<P>
   Labor and Likud have both been losing voters, and these
elections are likely to go to the candidate who can sway the large
group of independents who want a negotiated peace but also want
Palestinian leaders to control terrorism. Israel would be well
served if these supporters of a fair peace prevail at the polls and
shape the next government. &QL;

THEFT PROMPT POLICE TO ISSUE FIRST FURBY ALERT
</HEADLINE>

(Also moving in the ``n'' California news file) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTROSE, Calif. _ Thieves broke a hobby store window and
snatched two Furbys, leaving behind other valuable collectibles,
police and the store owner said.
</P>
<P>
   The theft prompted police Monday to warn store owners to move
their Furbys out of view from store windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something that's popular and a novelty should probably be put
somewhere else,'' said Sgt. Matt Wojnarowski of the Glendale Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest desperate measure in the rush to own one of the
6 1/2-inch-tall interactive _ and apparently irresistible _ toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that people kind of lose perspective about what
the holidays are all about,'' said Lana Simon, spokeswoman for
Furby maker Tiger Electronics Ltd., based in Vernon Hills, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Simon and Wojnarowski said this was the first Furby burglary
they had heard of since the toys became the Christmas rage.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon said she has heard of some people even dyeing the fur
on the microchip-minded toys in an effort to dress them up as rare
Furbys. The stolen ones from Crescenta Valley Hobby and Craft, in
the suburbs north of Los Angeles, included a white-haired,
blue-eyed one with a $500 price tag and a gray-haired Furby with
brown eyes priced at $200.
</P>
<P>
   As for the store owner, Fred Farias, he won't miss the pair of
Furbys that have sent teen-agers into temper tantrums because they
so desperately wanted their parents to buy this season's hot toy
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is I'm Furby-free,'' Farias said Monday as he
continued cleaning up broken glass from his store. ``We don't have
to worry. ... I don't have to be held up (at gunpoint) for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Farias was trying to sell the two toys on consignment as a favor
for two loyal customers who purchased the popular items at retail
prices after waiting in line for three hours at a toy store in a
mall.
</P>
<P>
   Farias already purchased two replacement Furbys from a friend _
at the going rate of $100 apiece, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have never put them in the window,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Farias is thankful the thieves didn't get away with other
items _ like a $400 model train engine and a Hot Wheels set for
$180.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what a Furby was until yesterday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just aggravating,'' another store employee said. ``It
seems like most people are buying them to resell them. It's like
scalping tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   The furry animals with bulging eyes and an O-shape mouth retail
for $30-$35 but are going as high as several hundred dollars in
underground trade in classified ads, online auction sites and even
from people's garages and car trunks. Police valued the two toys at
$100 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves stole the Furbys sometime between 10:30 p.m.
Saturday, after the owner closed shop, and 6 a.m. Sunday when a
passer-by noticed the broken glass, Farias said.
</P>
<P>
   If you're willing to wait until after the holiday rush, there's
no need to purchase Furbys underground, Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be plenty into 1999,'' she said.

CSUN ALUMNI STRIVE FOR BIG TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Sidebar to CSUN baseball story) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Adam Kennedy, Eric Gillespie and Robert Fick were
the core of Cal State Northridge's best baseball team, the 1996
squad that won 52 games and came within a win of the College World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three of us were the best,'' said Fick, a catcher and the
fifth-rated prospect in the Detroit Tigers organization. ``It
didn't matter we were Cal State Northridge. We were the best.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gillespie has battled injury in the Angels organization,
Kennedy and Fick have parlayed their CSUN experience to the
precipice of the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Both are expected to contend for major-league jobs when spring
training begins, and right-hander Rob Crabtree, the most dependable
pitcher on that '96 CSUN team, could begin the season as a set-up
man for the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, Crabtree, Fick and Kennedy, a second baseman in St.
Louis' organization, should begin the season at Triple-A. But the
chance of a promotion by summer is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Fick's hitting has impressed the Tigers. He batted .420 his last
season with the Matadors and last season hit .318 with Double-A
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's despair to find a catcher, coupled with Fick's season,
earned him a September call-up to the Tigers, where he hit .364
with three homers in 22 at-bats. It pushed him into contention for
a major-league roster spot _ along with Paul Bako, Joe Siddal and
journeyman catcher Bill Hasselman, who signed with the team last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert is ready to hit at the major-league level, but the
thing to consider is what's best in continuing his development,''
Tigers general manager Randy Smith said. ``It's probably catching
at the Triple-A level. The biggest thing with him is his throwing.
For him to be a front-line major-league catcher, he's got to
improve his throwing. It's a combination of footwork and arm
strength. He does a great job blocking the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kennedy's presented with a different challenge. The
St. Louis Cardinals switched Kennedy from shortstop to second base,
a move that should benefit the 22-year-old since the Cardinals
recently acquired Edgar Renteria from the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kennedy's offseason work program was altered in October
when he separated his left shoulder diving back to first in the
Arizona Fall League. He's hoping to return to the batting cage this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the minor leagues (changing positions) is hard to swallow,
but when you stop and think they're doing it for a reason, then
you're excited about it,'' said Kennedy, who batted .398 with CSUN
in '96. ``I know they think I can play in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second base, it's not simple, but if you can play shortstop
you're not going to have too much of a problem at another
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree, 26, has uncanny control and deception, which makes up
for his average major-league fastball. It was at the urging of
Giants director of player personnel Dick Tidrow that Crabtree was
added to the 40-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   In the Arizona Fall League, the top winter league for prospects,
Crabtree struck out 41 and walked four in 28 innings of relief.
It's why the Giants view Crabtree as a perfect middle-relief guy
who could find himself setting up for closer Rob Nen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see him pitching in the big leagues at some point,''
Tidrow said. ``He can hold runners, field his position, hit spots
and control his pitches. The five pitches he throws, he has control
of each one, and he has guts.''

THREE FIREMEN, THREE HEROES, THREE FUNERALS 
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 NYT By JIM YARDLEY and BARBARA STEWART  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With thousands of their comrades bearing grim
witness, two young New York City firefighters were eulogized and
buried Monday, each hailed as a hero, each mourned by a grieving
family only days before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The gray skies never lifted on a day that began in Queens, with
the funeral of James F. Bohan, and ended in Brooklyn, with the
funeral of Christopher M. Bopp. For the blue-coated firefighters
who rode chartered buses from Queens in the morning to Brooklyn in
the afternoon, there is one more funeral to come: Lt. Joseph P.
Cavalieri is to be buried Tuesday in Malverne, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The three members of Ladder Company 170 in Brooklyn died Friday,
engulfed by a fireball as they tried to save a 67-year-old woman
who had dropped a cigarette and sparked a three-alarm fire on the
top floor of her Brooklyn apartment building. The deaths prompted a
swift investigation after fire officials found that the sprinkler
system in the building had been turned off and the fireproof door
to the woman's apartment had been tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation and its unanswered questions were muted as
families and friends, grieving at the loss of men young enough to
be called ``kids'' by firehouse veterans, groped for different
kinds of answers.
</P>
<P>
   John Bopp stood inside Our Lady Help of Christians Roman
Catholic Church, his voice trembling, as he remembered his
27-year-old ``little brother'' as someone who had graduated from
high school, then college, married his grade-school sweetheart and
joined the Fire Department that he loved.
</P>
<P>
   Bopp told a congregation that included Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen and other city
officials how he and Christopher had discussed how they would
eventually care for their parents as they grew older. Now, Bopp
pledged to help care for his dead brother's unborn child;
Christopher Bopp's widow, Cori, is expecting the couple's first
child in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise him today that I will,'' Bopp told the congregation
as his tearful sister-in-law looked on from the first pew.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day in Middle Village, firefighters converged by
the thousands, stretching for nearly a mile in the middle-class
Queens neighborhood for Bohan's funeral service at St. Margaret's
Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Bohan, 25, was the youngest of the three men who died. He had
lived with his parents, John and Margaret Bohan, who work as a
telephone company technician and a school board secretary,
respectively. He had started almost three years ago in Engine
Company 262 in Queens, but had been temporarily assigned to Ladder
Company 170 in Brooklyn when he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Bohan, sunny and mellow, loved to go
snowboarding upstate and watch New York Jets games and just talk
with neighborhood friends he had known most of his life. The other
firefighters called him Curly, because of his buzz haircut.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Bopp a four-year veteran of the Fire Department and
a former city police officer, never needed a nickname. Tony
Lombardo, 37, laughed with tears in his eyes as he described how
``bop,'' coincidentally, is what veterans call rookie firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, calling the deaths a ``terrible loss for the city,''
beseeched the Bopp family to find some solace during the holidays
in the brave actions of their son. ``There are people alive today
because of Chris' courage and the other two brave firefighters who
died,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as Bohan's was a few hours earlier, Bopp's coffin was
carried out of the church on the shoulders of firefighters to the
slow wail of bagpipes. The lines of firefighters snapped to
attention, the bugler played taps and four helicopters, in
formation, droned overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Then the fire truck carrying the coffin began the slow trip to
the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   A woman, walking by with a bag of groceries, said to no one in
particular, ``It's the saddest thing I've ever seen.''

SMALL GROUP OF MODERATE REPUBLICANS ASKS SENATE TO CONSIDER

 By JAMES BENNET and ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A handful of moderate Republicans who voted to
impeach President Clinton appealed to the Senate on Monday to
consider censuring the president instead of convicting him, as many
lawmakers scrambled to find a way to avoid a lengthy, embarrassing
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Because most senators, used to deciding things in clubby
caucuses, are away and the only precedents for a presidential trial
are 130 years old, there was no evidence that a consensus existed,
nor any clear idea if Senate rules would hamper or assist one if it
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, through Vice President Al Gore, continued to
demand that the Senate quickly ``forge a fair bipartisan
compromise.'' For his part, the president publicly ignored the
issue and turned to the symbolic duties of his office in a holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   But the day's most striking development was the letter from
Reps. Sherwood Boehlert and Benjamin Gilman of New York, Mike
Castle of Delaware and Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania, which they
prepared to send to Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader. They
released its text on Monday night, and plan to send it on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not convinced, and do not want our votes interpreted to
mean, that we view removal from office as the only reasonable
conclusion of this case,'' they wrote, although the articles of
impeachment for which they voted each concluded: ``Wherefore,
William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, warrants impeachment
and trial and removal from office.''
</P>
<P>
   They argued in their letter that while it was ``questionable''
whether the House had authority to deal with censure, the Senate
clearly ``does have the authority and the precedents to consider a
range of options. Those options should include a tough censure
proposal, which would impose a fine and block any pardon.'' The
congressmen all voted Saturday against allowing the consideration
of a Democratic move to allow a House vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   Another House Republican who voted for impeachment, W. J. Tauzin
of Louisiana, was consulting with colleagues on Monday about asking
the Senate to avert a trial. His spokesman, Ken Johnson, said,
``The feeling is the president paid a terrible price for his
actions. The Clinton presidency has been indelibly stained by
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said House Republicans could vote only up or down on
impeachment. ``That was a lousy choice, but the only one allowed
under the Constitution,'' he said. ``Our hands were tied. Too much
blood has been spilled already and there's a time to begin the
healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite a rising clamor among past and present politicians
for censure, the alternatives put forward so far face two
formidable obstacles, at least today.
</P>
<P>
   Most such proposals, including the one offered on Monday by
former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, require that
Clinton concede he lied under oath, a step his aides insist he will
not take. With that in mind, or perhaps merely as a bargaining
tactic, some WHite House aides say censure may be unworkable,
</P>
<P>
   ``It just may be there's no acceptable form of censure, so why
go through that?'' said one Clinton adviser. A trial, he said,
would provide the country with a ``definitive end to this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to fault us for mounting a defense,'' he said.
``And believe me, we're going to mount one. Believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, several senior Republican senators have said that they
have a constitutional duty to at least begin a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is likely to play a prominent
role in any trial, said that he would like to see the Senate vote
on the two articles of impeachment approved on Saturday before
considering any alternatives. But he said he believed it could be
done quickly.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview there was ``a lot of discussion about at
what point is censure an appropriate discussion. My view is we need
to commence the trial. Otherwise it just completely makes short
shrift of the action of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have said that they expect Sen. Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., the Senate's leading expert on rules and procedures, to
support their contention that the Senate is obliged to open a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Byrd kept his options open. ``Whether there is a
trial or whether there is some other solution, that decision must
be made by senators,'' he said, ``and it must be bipartisan or it
will have absolutely no credibility with the public.''
</P>
<P>
   He made a similar argument for the primacy of the Senate. He
warned that the White House should not expect to control the terms
of a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the good of our nation, there must be no 'deal' involving
the White House or any entity beyond the current membership of the
U.S. Senate,'' he said in a written statement that signaled that at
least some Senate Democrats would maintain some distance from the
president.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who suggested on Sunday that
senators return to Washington and work things out immediately, said
on Monday in an interview that it was hard for senators to sound
each other out and seek agreement. He said, ``One of the
difficulties here _ it also may be a blessing from the leaderships'
standpoint _ is we're not in session.''
</P>
<P>
   The four congressmen behind Monday's letter said that the Senate
should take into account such issues as the connection between
Clinton's conduct and his official duties and ``the will of the
American voter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe those factors may lead the Senate to conclude that
a remedy short of removal is in order,'' they wrote, and urged Lott
to make sure the Senate could have a full debate on censure.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the president's press secretary, Joseph
Lockhart, continued to urge a quick compromise. ``The overwhelming
majority of Americans want this over with and they'd like it over
with soon,'' he said. ``I don't see any advantage _ nor does anyone
that works here see an advantage _ in not finding some way to
quickly dispatch this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Clinton advisers are not convinced that censure will prove
to be in the president's interest. They argue that the charges
against Clinton are flimsy, and would not withstand the robust
examination that the White House could make during a Senate trial.
A trial that resulted in acquittal, these advisers believe, would
bolster Clinton and do lasting damage to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But generally, White House officials are concerned about
Clinton's ability to govern in the interim. Some sort of quick
compromise, they say, is in the country's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made that appeal on Monday, speaking at the White House as
he presented an award for the use of plain language by federal
employees. He called the impeachment vote by the House on Saturday
``wrong for our Constitution and wrong for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks suggested that he intends to serve in a
high-profile defense role before the Senate, where he served for
eight years before becoming vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do hope that the United States Senate will rise to this
moment, as it so often does, to be the voice of reason,
deliberation, and healing that America needs,'' he continued. He
urged the Senate to ``end this matter promptly'' and to end it ``in
a way that will respect the will and the wisdom of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that he and the president would ``continue to focus
all of our energies on the business of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried to do so by example on Monday, stopping by the
D.C. Central Kitchen, a non-profit organization, and putting on a
white apron to spend about a half-hour helping make lasagna for the
hungry with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When cameras and reporters were admitted to the kitchen _ for
the image the White House wanted to project and the questions it
could not avoid _ Clinton was asked what the Senate could expect
from him and his defense team.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few days to celebrate the season,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had a message for Congress, Clinton said, ``I hope
everyone in the country will take some time to think about other
people and do something in the spirit of the season like this.''

NEGOTIATIONS UNDER WAY FOR GOTTI JR. PLEA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors and lawyers for John A. Gotti,
accused of being a Mafia leader, are engaged in intense
negotiations over a plea bargain that could avert a racketeering
trial scheduled for February and would mean a certain prison
sentence for Gotti, according to law enforcement officials and
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said one of the stumbling blocks is a demand by
prosecutors for a global settlement in which Gotti and seven other
defendants agree to plead guilty to reduced charges in return for
more lenient sentences. Law enforcement officials said prosecutors
were reluctant to accept individual plea deals because the case
against Gotti would be stronger if testimony and secretly recorded
tapes concerning all of the defendants were presented at a mass
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and lawyers who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said Gotti, 34, who they say is the acting boss of the Gambino
crime family, and Salvatore Locascio, 39, who investigators say is
the captain of a Gambino crew, are the main holdouts on the defense
side. They appear willing to make deals, but on better terms than
prosecutors are offering, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, investigators and lawyers said, has
offered Gotti a sentence of about six years; he would also be
required to forfeit about $1 million in assets. In January, a broad
racketeering indictment accused Gotti of being the acting boss of
the Gambino family on behalf of his father, John J. Gotti, 58, who
is serving a life term in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   If Gotti, who is known as Junior, goes to trial and is convicted
of the main charge _ being the head of a racketeering enterprise _
he could face about 20 years in prison and possible confiscation of
more than $10 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal sought by the defense team, none of the
defendants would have to admit that they were members of the
Gambino crime family, the nation's second most powerful Mafia
faction. The elder Gotti, investigators say, has banned Gambino
members from acknowledging as part of guilty pleas the existence of
the Mafia group.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's two main lawyers, Bruce Cutler and Gerald Shargel,
denied Monday that their client was ready to plead guilty. ``My
directives from my client are to get ready for trial,'' Cutler
said. ``He wants to clear his name.''
</P>
<P>
   If the government made an offer, Cutler said, the defense would
consider it. ``But I'm not near that point,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White declined to comment.
But other lawyers who are working for the defense team said they
expected that agreements with Gotti and the other defendants could
be completed soon.
</P>
<P>
   Another defense lawyer said most of the defendants reluctantly
agreed to deals after reviewing the evidence implicating them,
including 7,000 court-authorized, electronically intercepted
conversations. Prosecutors say the evidence against Gotti includes
testimony by one Mafia defector and taped conversations in which
his co-defendants talked about his alleged role in extorting more
than $1 million from Scores, a topless club in Manhattan, and of
turning over to him $50,000 in protection payoffs from a
construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials emphasized that prosecutors normally prefer a
plea bargain over a trial as a cheaper and more effective way of
resolving complicated charges. The prosecutors in Gotti's case are
also concerned that one of their original principal witnesses,
Michael Blutrich, a former owner of Scores, would be discredited
because he has admitted to being involved in multimillion-dollar
frauds and to obtaining pornographic materials on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Locascio, who is accused of running a gambling and loan-sharking
ring, has been offered a lighter sentence than Gotti's but has
balked at accepting it, lawyers said.

COMMENTARY: HERE'S A BOOK GOVERNOR PATAKI SHOULD READ
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If George Pataki is on your Christmas list, but you haven't
decided what to get him, here is a suggestion. What he needs
desperately to read is ``Plunkitt of Tammany Hall,'' a classic book
on New York politics first published 93 years ago and still in
print in no fewer than four editions. It has some advice he can
use.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington Plunkitt, who wrote the book with the
assistance of a journalist, was a state legislator and Democratic
Party boss on the West Side of Manhattan during the heyday of
Tammany Hall, New York's powerful Democratic machine. He was also a
millionaire, having gotten rich both as a building contractor with
political pull and as a real estate investor who seemed to know
just where a city project would boost property values.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of this short book _ New York's governor could
easily read it in one evening _ is Plunkitt's explanation of the
difference between ``honest graft and dishonest graft.'' He had, he
said, gotten rich from the honest kind, including such things as
being the only bidder when the city was selling excess property
such as paving stones.
</P>
<P>
   Plunkitt took great pride in civic improvements, such as the
establishment of the Museum of Natural History, in which he played
a role. He thought that so long as the government was doing its job
adequately, no one should be concerned if the politicians made some
money.
</P>
<P>
   What was dishonest graft? He cited a scandal in Philadelphia.
``A Republican superintendent of the Philadelphia almshouse stole
the roof off the buildin' and sold it for junk,'' said Plunkitt.
``That was carryin' things to excess.''
</P>
<P>
   No Tammany Hall boss would ever have done such a thing, said
Plunkitt. Of course, ``if the roof was much worn, he might get the
city authorities to put on a new one and get the contract for it
himself, and buy the old roof at a bargain. But that's honest
graft. It's goin' about the thing like a gentleman.'' What was
important was that the almshouse got a good roof.
</P>
<P>
   What, one wonders, would Plunkitt say if he were here today and
pondering the scandal at New York City's School Construction
Authority? He would shrug when told that Paul Atanasio, a Pataki
patronage appointee to the authority, appeared to have arranged a
job as construction superintendent for Gary Marrone, the husband of
Atanasio's secretary. Plunkitt, who despised civil service laws,
would have sneered when told that violated an anti-nepotism rule.
</P>
<P>
   But he would have turned pale when he learned of the fate of Yan
Zhen Zhao, a 16-year-old student who died in January when a brick
fell on her head at a construction site that Marrone was doing a
horrendous job of supervising. A new report by the city's
Department of Investigation lays out a host of violations of laws,
rules and common sense at that construction site that made it
possible for that brick to hit her.
</P>
<P>
   To Plunkitt, that would have sounded like dishonest graft. The
politicians were enriching themselves, which was fine, but they
were not filling the public need. As in Philadelphia, the public
was worse off, not better, as a result of the politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki now is willing to give up that particular patronage
appointment at the School Construction Authority. But he has many
more jobs to hand out. It is to be hoped that in his second term he
will do a better job of giving them to people who are competent as
well as well connected.

INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES ELECTED TO SECURITIES DEALERS BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two of the four members of an independent slate
representing small broker-dealer firms have been elected to the
National Association of Securities Dealers' 35-member board in the
first contested election in NASD history, the association said at
its annual meeting in Washington Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD is the parent of the Nasdaq-Amex Market Group and NASD
Regulation Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The two newly elected board members are Alan Davidson, president
and founder of Zeus Securities in Jericho, N.Y., and LaRae
Bakerink, vice president and director of compliance of SK
International Securities in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The membership has spoken,'' Davidson said. ``The days of
uncontested elections at the NASD are over.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Davidson has argued that small brokerage firms are
overregulated and underrepresented by the association. There are
roughly 5,500 NASD member firms, each of which has one vote;
approximately 3,500 members voted in the election.
</P>
<P>
   The election was held to fill 12 vacancies on the association's
board. Three open seats were designated for members representing
the brokerage industry; four for candidates outside the industry,
and five for so-called public members. Two of the three vacant
industry seats went to the independent candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson and Ms. Bakerink defeated two NASD nominees, E. David
Coolidge III, chief executive of William Blair &AMP; Co. and a member
of the NASD board since 1996, and James Dimon, who recently
resigned from his position as president of Citigroup. The only
winning NASD industry nominee was Richard Romano, president of
Romano Brothers &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Two independent candidates lost Monday. They were Bill Singer,
an industry candidate who is a partner at the law firm of Singer
Frumento in New York, and a nonindustry candidate, Dan Jamieson,
editor in chief of Registered Representative magazine, a brokerage
industry trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that the NASD serve the balanced
interest of the membership, the issuers and investors, and
ultimately not forget that members pay the bills,'' Davidson said.
``We have to work together to create one membership, not
constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zarb, the association's chairman, said, ``Our board has a
unique governance structure that assures representation to diverse
industry, nonindustry and public members. We welcome diversity and
inclusiveness as a strength in serving the investor and our many
constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Board members elected to represent the public were:
</P>
<P>
   Former President Gerald Ford, for a term of one year.
</P>
<P>
   For three-year terms:
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Chao, distinguished fellow, the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Duberstein, chairman and chief executive, Duberstein
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kirk, executive-in-residence, Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   John Markese, president, American Association of Individual
Investors.
</P>
<P>
   New nonindustry board members who will serve three-year terms
are:
</P>
<P>
   H. Furlong Baldwin, chairman of the Mercantile Bankshares Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Isenberg, chairman and chief executive of Nabors
Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Rock, principal, Arthur Rock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   James Rothenberg, president, Capital Research and Management Co.

PROMINENT CHINESE DISSIDENTS SENTENCED TO LONG PRISON TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to incorporate late-breaking sentencing of third dissident;
light rewrite; note usage of ``Tuesday'' in 5th graf.) (Eds: See also CHINA-U.S., CHINA-LIU)

 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ By sentencing three of the country's most prominent
democracy campaigners to long prison terms, China has taken its
harshest step yet in its current crackdown on organized political
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, after a trial that lasted just three and a half
hours, Xu Wenli _ at 55 the dean of the dissident movement, and a
man who has already spent 12 years in prison for advocating
democracy _ was sentenced to 13 years for ``subversion of state
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu's alleged crimes included helping to organize a new political
party, calling for an end to Communist rule in interviews with
foreign journalists, calling for independent labor unions and,
prosecutors said, accepting $500 from a dissident abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Also sentenced on Monday, to 11 years in prison, was Wang
Youcai, 32, the founder of the China Democracy Party, which has now
been suppressed. Wang was tried on subversion charges on Thursday
in the eastern city of Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   A third veteran democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, whose
trial began in the central city of Wuhan on Thursday, was sentenced
Tuesday to 12 years, also for subversion, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   This week's sentences came just six months after President
Clinton's visit to Beijing, where he publicly challenged China's
leaders to move quickly toward political reform. The Chinese
government was harshly criticized by the State Department, which in
turn came under fire by human rights groups for its policy of
engagement with China.
</P>
<P>
   The severe punishments appeared to spell the effective end here
of the China Democracy Party, which these three men along with
hundreds of lesser-known individuals tried to organize in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   The sentences also crushed the hopes of many liberal
intellectuals in China that Beijing's warming relations with
Washington in recent years and its signing of global treaties on
human rights might bring a significant easing of political
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Xu was tried on Monday morning in the Beijing Intermediate
Court. When after a brief recess the three-judge panel announced
his 13-year sentence, Xu stood up and shouted, ``I protest!'' said
his wife of 28 years, He Xintong.
</P>
<P>
   Then, said Ms. He and lawyers who were present, he shouted that
the judges were unfair and that he would not appeal his case
because the proceedings were illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   With the sentencing of Xu, China's Communist government has
silenced one of its most energetic and persistent critics, one who
has given over his adult life to the cause of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Xu first came to prominence during the Democracy Wall movement
of the late 1970s, then served 12 years in prison, much of it in
solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Qin, too, first became politically active in the late 1970s. He
has served 10 years in prison or labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, sensing a new opportunity to speak
out and making constant use of fax machines and e-mail, Xu and Qin
tried to draw attention to China's obligations under two
international covenants it had signed _ one on economic and
cultural rights, and one on civil and political rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of several temporary detentions and stiff warnings,
they continued their activities.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, in contrast, first became involved in dissident activities
in 1989, while a graduate student in physics in Beijing, when he
became a leader of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. After the
student movement was smashed by the army, he was placed on the
most-wanted list, then was arrested and spent two years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   During President Clinton's visit to China in June, Wang
announced the formation of the China Democracy Party. Hundreds
around the country, including Xu and Qin, began promoting the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But while the government has allowed somewhat freer discussion
of political topics in universities and obscure journals in the
last year, it has not allowed any challenges _ in print or in the
form of organized groups _ to the principle of Communist Party
rule.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on Friday celebrating 20 years of economic reforms,
the president and Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, emphasized
the primacy of the party, saying, ``The Western mode of political
systems must never be adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   After learning of the sentences on Monday, the American Embassy
here, which has spent the last two years building improved
relations between China and the United States, issued a strong
condemnation of what it termed the ``deplorable decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply disappointed with both the guilty verdicts and
the extremely harsh sentences,'' the statement said. ``No
individual should be arrested, tried and sentenced for exercising
internationally recognized freedoms, including those guaranteed in
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which
China has committed itself.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like the trials on Thursday, both of which proceeded with no
defense attorneys because prospective lawyers had been warned off
by police or detained, the proceeding on Monday for Xu showed that
in cases involving security issues, police and courts can write
their own rules.
</P>
<P>
   According to the criminal procedure law, defendants are to be
notified at least 10 days before a trial, but Xu was told only four
days ago that his trial would be on Monday. His wife, who until
Monday had not been allowed to contact him since his arrest on Nov.
30, was told three days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, defendants also have the right to a lawyer of
their choice, but Xu was assigned a lawyer by the court late last
week. Before the trial on Monday, the lawyer, Mo Shaoping, saw his
client only for one brief meeting, an associate of Mo's said.
</P>
<P>
   Xu's wife refused to meet the lawyer before the trial. ``Meeting
him would be tantamount to cooperating with the whole charade,''
she said in a telephone interview this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the accusations during the Monday trial, Xu's
lawyer argued that Xu had engaged in the peaceful expression of his
own views and that this could not amount to subversive activities
against the state, an associate of the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a decision that was clearly preordained, the court
declared Xu guilty and sentenced him to spend what may be much of
the rest of his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1943 in the southeastern province of Jiangxi, Xu was
interested in politics even as a teen-ager, his wife said. In the
1960s, as an idealistic Marxist, he decided to get his learning in
society rather than attend a university.
</P>
<P>
   He served in the Navy for five years, then became an electrician
with the Beijing railroad before becoming involved with the
democracy movement and going to prison.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, in a police station hours after the trial
finished, Xu was allowed a half-hour with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he'd be able to handle the pain,'' she later
recounted in a telephone interview. ``He said that this would give
him time to think things over and calmly reflect on what has
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. He, who has been married to Xu since 1971, said she expected
to see him in monthly visits to prison. The couple has a daughter,
Xu Jin, who is a graduate student in fine arts at Boston
University.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier interview, soon after her husband was arrested on
Nov. 30, Ms. He said Xu had told her, ``I can't change the way I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   If he received a long sentence, he told his wife, she should go
on and enjoy her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I die,'' Xu said as they parted that day, ``please
plant a tree for me.''

SIR ALAN LLOYD HODGKIN, 84, NOBEL-WINNING BIOPHYSICIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, an English biophysicist who shared the
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963 for helping to
explain how nerve cells transmit impulses between the skin to the
brain, died Sunday at the age of 84.
</P>
<P>
   London newspaper reports, quoting his family, said he died after
a long illness at home in Cambridge, where he was long associated
with Trinity College as a Royal Society research professor.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgkin came from a family prominent in British medicine. He
shared the prize in 1963 with Andrew Fielding Huxley, a fellow
Briton, and John Carew Eccles, an Australian.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgkin and Huxley, working together with the giant nerve fibers
of squids, succeeded in devising a system of mathematical equations
describing the nerve impulse. Based on their results, Eccles showed
what happened when the nerve impulse arrived at the synapse, or
contact point, of the next cell.
</P>
<P>
   Their work carried forward the discoveries of the Italian
anatomist Luigi Galvani (1737-98), investigator of what he termed
animal electricity. He demonstrated that a dead frog's muscles
could be made to twitch by an electric current passing through its
body.
</P>
<P>
   The three 1963 laureates explained that such currents are the
means by which the nerves pass information and sensation to the
brain. In turn, the currents transmit the brain's orders for action
to every part of the body.
</P>
<P>
   A human being's every act, experience and sensation in life
depends on the pulse of signals through the nerve cells, yet until
this discovery, the fine details of how those signals are generated
were unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgkin was born in Danbury, near Oxford, and was educated at
Cambridge, where he met Andrew Huxley. During World War II both men
worked as government researchers on radar development.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgkin then resumed his investigation of the ionic theory of
how nerve cells send messages via an ``electric cable'' in the
spinal cord. In an intricate series of experiments on the nerve
fibers of squids and frogs, he and his colleagues showed how the
human brain responded to nerve messages.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgkin served as master of Trinity College from 1978 until
1985. He was knighted in 1972 and was appointed to the prestigious
Order of Merit a year later. He was a past president of the Royal
Society.
</P>
<P>
   One of his ancestors was Thomas Hodgkin (1798-1866), who
diagnosed the disease named after him. In 1944, Alan Hodgkin
married American-born Marion de Kay Rous, whose father, the late
Frederick Rous, analyzed Rous' sarcoma and shared the Nobel Prize
in Medicine in 1966 for discovering that some forms of leukemia are
caused by a virus.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Marion, Hodgkin's survivors include a son and
three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgkin's book, ``Chance and Design: Reminiscences of Science in
Peace and War,'' remains in print in its American edition
(Cambridge University Press, 1992).

UNDERFUNDED NORTHRIDGE BASEBALL PROGRAM REMAINS A HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the administration cut baseball, along with
three other sports, in the spring of 1997, it could have crippled
the program.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cal State Northridge decided to bring the sports back a
month later, the stability of the programs were tested.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the fiasco, CSUN's baseball program is doing
more than surviving. Despite inadequate facilities, limited
funding, no conference affiliation and a lingering public relations
nightmare, baseball is flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Batesole, whose team begins practice Jan. 4, signed
seven recruits during last month's early period. He's projecting
the 1999 recruiting class to be monstrous in impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who's played there really cares about the program,''
said Harvard-Westlake High coach Josh Smaler, who played at CSUN in
1994 and 1995. ``No matter who you play for, Mike Batesole or
(Bill) Kernen, or when you played, everyone has been through the
same thing, the same type of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three years Batesole's coached the Matadors, 10 players
went from being baseball refugees to draft picks and three players
from the '96 team are on the verge of making the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the strength of CSUN's baseball team lies, inside
the alumni fraternity. The annual alumni game brings so many former
players back that Batesole had to call for more seats for the
dugout last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That alumni game is great, just awesome,'' said catcher Robert
Fick, a member of the '96 Matadors who could win a big-league job
with the Detroit Tigers. ``Everybody keeps in touch. That's why the
program remains successful.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent workout, nearly a dozen former players, each
keeping in shape for spring training, returned to CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Those players not only speak to the current players about the
importance of CSUN, baseball, academics and what-have-you, but also
to the future, be it baseball-related or not.
</P>
<P>
   And they also drag friends from other organizations with them. A
few weeks ago Fick brought outfielder Gabe Kapler, a Taft High and
Moorpark Junior College product and the top prospect in the Tigers
organization, to a workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll be able to get a solid day of work in here,''
Kapler said. ``You look around, and this program produced Rob Fick.
He's the best hitter I've ever seen. It's sick the way he can hit.
Growing up here you know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Fernando Valley, loaded with baseball talent, is what
allows the Matadors to remain successful despite enormous financial
restrictions. Eleven of the Matadors played their high school
baseball in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising how successful they've been with all the
talent in the Valley,'' Chatsworth High coach Tom Meusborn said.
``You still need good coaches and you have to get the kids there,
and Batesole's done an outstanding job with that. You would be very
competitive even if you took just the local kids.''
</P>
<P>
   After the program was re-instated last year, Batesole went
through the area's junior college ranks to find players. The
Matadors went 37-19, earning Batesole national coach of the year
honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dropping the program should decimate it. They had a lot of
players that were shopping around,'' Pepperdine coach Frank Sanchez
said. ``But they're very well skilled, very well coached. Coach
Batesole deserves a lot of credit. Through the whole ordeal he
stayed level-headed. He's been able to identify talent that wasn't
recruited and he's been able to identify transfers and get guys in
on partial scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are nuances associated with CSUN that few nationally
respected programs must overcome.
</P>
<P>
   In other college programs it's customary for players to manicure
the infield before and after games, but budgetary dilemmas forced
the Matadors to do a little more.
</P>
<P>
   Until last season, CSUN's players also had to line the field.
While umpires were discussing grounds rules with the coaches,
players were weaving between them to finish painting the batter's
box.
</P>
<P>
   It's also not uncommon to see some of the Matadors mowing the
outfield grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``With minimal support this program can explode,'' Batesole
said. ``They give me 11.7 scholarships and build a stadium, and my
first recruiting class will play in the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the baseball program operates with eight scholarships
(the NCAA maximum is 11.7). The administration projects to reach 10
in a few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium issue remains unclear, though its status should
change quickly. Batesole said he's been told this would be the last
season the Matadors play at their current location.
</P>
<P>
   A specially appointed site committee, which has focused
primarily on the location of a new football stadium, has suggested
a new baseball complex be constructed near the existing field.
Batesole's hope is to be playing there next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having 11.7 scholarships and a stadium in place, now it's a
level playing field,'' Batesole said. ``It's who's going to work
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is one issue that could have a catastrophic
effect if it isn't resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
   Batesole, who is 131-57-1 in three seasons, is in the final six
months of his contract. He was negotiating a long-term extension
before Paul Bubb resigned as athletic director in early November,
but the topic hasn't been broached since.
</P>
<P>
   Some CSUN baseball supporters believe Batesole should be signed
to a five-year deal, which would speak enormously toward an
administrative commitment for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never not finished a contract, and six months from now
it's up,'' Batesole said. ``There's a lot of great things going on
here, and if they're committed, there's no reason it can't be as
good a job as Fullerton or Long Beach.''

EDITORIAL: BANANA WARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Dec. 22:
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the European Union are headed toward an
avoidable collision over bananas. Monday, in retaliation for
European restrictions on banana imports, the United States
announced a list of European imports that will be subject to 100
percent tariffs _ ranging from cashmere sweaters to plastic purses.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans are flouting a ruling by the World Trade
Organization that their banana restrictions, which discriminate in
favor of European companies in importing the fruit, are illegal.
Such defiance is discouraging when protectionist pressures are
growing in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   The principal beneficiary of an American victory would be
Chiquita Brands, whose chairman, Carl Lindner, has been a generous
contributor to both Democrats and Republicans. That has allowed
Europeans to claim, inaccurately, that this is about politics, and
that they are simply favoring poor Latin American banana exporters.
In fact, central American countries, also poor, are joint
plaintiffs with the United States in this dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than negotiate a settlement after the WTO decision, the
Europeans announced new banana rules. But those rules made no
significant changes, and appear to be an effort to delay
compliance. Europe resisted efforts to get a rapid WTO opinion on
those rules.
</P>
<P>
   Compromise is needed. If Europe shows a willingness to abide by
the WTO ruling, the United States should be open to delays in
Europe's coming into full compliance. But it is essential for
Europe to accede to the WTO ruling even if it does not like it. To
do otherwise would invite international anarchy on trade rules when
protectionism is a greater threat than at any time in the past
decade.

STATE ORDERS WATER SYSTEMS TO REDUCE RADIUM LEVELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ State officials Monday ordered nine public water
systems to take steps to remove radium from the water supply after
new testing methods found radium levels that exceeded federal
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the elevated levels of naturally occurring radium
did not pose an immediate health threat, but that long-term,
chronic exposure could increase the risk of certain types of
cancer, particularly bone cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the water systems serve about 60,000 people in Atlantic
and Cumberland Counties in southern New Jersey. The two other
systems are in Sussex County and provide service to about 128
people in a mobile home park and an apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   The elevated levels were found by a new way of testing for
radium 224. Because New Jersey is the first state to use the new
testing method, state and federal officials said that they do not
know how the radium levels here compared with those in other
states. Federal officials are now using the same method on public
water systems in 27 other states. After reviewing the results,
federal officials may consider imposing new regulations requiring
such tests for all public water systems.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey began testing all of it 615 public community water
systems in 1997 after scientists noticed discrepancies in test
results of water sampled from the Toms River section of Dover
Township. Officials were testing the water for contaminants that
may have contributed to a higher incidence of some childhood
cancers in the area. (Researchers have not yet determined the cause
of the unusual cancer rate.)
</P>
<P>
   Because radium 224 has a very short half-life, 3.7 days,
officials determined that they needed to test water samples within
48 hours of being collected. Federal guidelines do not require
testing within a particular time frame, so this radioactive element
decayed before it could normally be detected.
</P>
<P>
   Barker Hamill, chief of the state's Safe Water Division, said
the state has completed sampling at 70 percent of the 615 systems.
Of those systems tested, 413 comply with safe drinking water
radiological standards, and 29 are being closely monitored, in
addition to the nine systems that have been ordered to take action
to remove radium. He said that testing at the remaining 164 systems
will be completed by July.
</P>
<P>
   Hamill said corrective steps include closing contaminated wells
and drilling new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The state's testing did not include private wells. Officials
have previously urged homeowners with private wells to test for
radioactivity and consider adding a water softener or take other
measures to remove the radium.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Evenson, district chief of the U.S. Geological Survey, said
that there were several factors contributing to the elevated levels
in the aquifer in southern New Jersey. Those factors include high
acidity, which strips metals, like radium, and releases it into the
water.
