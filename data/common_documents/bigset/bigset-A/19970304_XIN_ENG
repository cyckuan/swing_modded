<P>
TIRANA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Albania's President Sali Berisha
today won a second five-year term as president of the country in
the presidential election in the People's Assembly (parliament).
</P>
<P>
In the 140-seat assembly, Berisha, the only candidate for the
post, won 113 votes out of 118 legislators who participated in the
poll. He was nominated by the governing Democratic Party which
holds 122 seats in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under Albania's law, the president is elected by the assembly

April 1992 after the nation's first opposition party, the
Democratic Party, won elections for the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Berisha, who was born in Tropoja, north Albania, in October
1944, graduated from the Medical Department of Tirana University
in 1967.

<P>
He was co-founder of the nation's first opposition party, the
Democratic Party, at the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the assembly declared a state of emergency
throughout the country, responding to two months of protests
sparked by the collapse of popular pyramid investment schemes.

<HEADLINE> Qiao on Breakthroughs in Reforming State Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Major breakthroughs must be made
in reforming its loss-making state sector in 1997, said Qiao Shi,
China's top legislator, here today.
</P>
<P>
He sset forth this request at a group discussion of the Fifth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) together
with the Hebei delegation, when reviewing the government work
report delivered by Premier Li Peng on March 1.
</P>
<P>
"Greater strides must be taken to set up a modern corporate
system with government department to be separated from business
operations and focusing on macro economic control," said Qiao, who
is also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the
Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Progress has been scored over recent years, but many difficult
and pressing tasks are still ahead in reforming the state-owned
enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
One year has passed since the Ninth Five-Year Plan for Economic
and Social development was launched, and this year will be crucial
for the realization of the blueprint, according to Qiao.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises should pool their investments and funds
in upgrading their techniques, equipments and quality of products,
Qiao urged.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way, can our enterprises stand the fierce
competition in both domestic and international markets, and
survive and grow," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"All relevant parties should help create favorable conditions
for the reform of the state-owned enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the macro economic situation in China, Qiao said, China has
finally achieved an economic "soft landing" after years of
enhanced efforts in macro-economic control and in-depth reforms in
the fields of taxation and finance.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the entire national economy maintained a sustained,
rapid growth, but the prices dropped steadily.
</P>
<P>
"This was not easy, especially for a populous developing
country like China, to score such a success," Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
However, China should be aware of a host of problems to cope
with in the course of its progress, and have to deepen its reform
and improve its economic work, Qiao said.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Egypt Tries to Discourage Israeli Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today Egypt is doing its utmost to dissuade Israel from
following through the new Jewish settlement project in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
When inspecting the construction sites of Toshki Canal in
Southern Egypt, Mubarak told reporters that Jerusalem and the
latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli track would top the
agenda of his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu during the latter's visit to Cairo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's visit here comes exactly a week after Israel
approved the building of 6,500 housing units for the Jewish
settlers in Har Homa (Gabal Abu Ghoneim), a tree-covered hill in
East Jerusalem taken by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War.
</P>
<P>
Calling on Netanyahu to shun any step regarding Jerusalem
before reaching a relevant agreement with Palestine, Mubarak said
that the Israeli government should realize the complications of
its settlement plans that have outraged Palestinians and sparked
criticism from the Arabs, the United States and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of this new settlement before starting the
final status negotiations regarding Jerusalem would complicate
the peace march," he warned.
</P>
<P>
But the president said he hopes to convince Netanyahu of the
risks involved in the settlement-construction process and its
adverse effect on the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak continued to say that there are no problems between
Egypt and Israel whatsoever, but his country is concerned about
realizing peace and stability and it has exerted strenuous
efforts to let the peace drive move in its right direction.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a key mediator in the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations,
is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel but ties
remain cool between them.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister paid the first visit to Egypt last
June shortly after he took office.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Begins Agitation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) today launched a month-long countrywide
agitation program against the eight-month-old government of Sheikh
Hasina.
</P>
<P>
BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia, who was defeated in the
parliamentary elections last June, announced the program on
February 26.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the BNP today launched protest meetings and
processions at district headquarters throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Dhaka, the BNP held a meeting in front
of the National Press Club this afternoon, which was followed by a
procession. No severe violence was reported.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party pressed home some demands including the
release of detained partymen and withdrawal of the cases against
them, resignation of Chief Election Commissioner Abu Hena and
introduction of the voter identity card.
</P>
<P>
The BNP's month-long programs include countrywide mass contact
from today to March 29 and meetings and processions at county
headquarters on March 30.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also threatens to declare "tougher" programs if
the government fails to improve the present political and economic
situation and meet its demands by March 30.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Israeli Housing Plan Torpedos Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat has accused Israel of trying to torpedo peace process in
the Middle East by its decision to build a new Jewish settlement
in Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of the Israeli government to build a settlement
... is very dangerous and is aimed at torpedoing the peace
process," Arafat said on Sunday at a dinner sponsored by the
Palestinian-American Congress after he arrived in Washington that
evening.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader is scheduled to meet with President Bill
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during his
four-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
He is certain to express his grave concern over the new housing
project approved by the Israeli government last Wednesday to build
6,500 homes in Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want to establish an independent state in the
occupied territories with east Jerusalem as its capital, while
Israel is obviously intended to integrate the east Jerusalem,
captured in the 1967 Middle East war, into the west part of the
city and declare it as its capital in spite of opposition of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government decision (of building the new
settlement in east Jerusalem) is a flagrant violation of United
Nations resolutions and of our agreements with Israel," Arafat
told members of the Palestinian-American Congress.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian minister of higher education,
said Arafat would stress to Clinton that peace moves were
threatened by the Israeli decision on the settlement when they
meet on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear the Palestinian people are not going to sit
back and accept the implication of the Israeli decision," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has criticized Israel for its housing
project, saying it complicated an already complex situation and
was not a step to "build confidence and trust" between the
Israelis and Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen on Taiwan Issue after Return of Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen said today in Beijing that the return of Hong Kong
this year will exert a major influence on relations across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
During a discussion here today with Taiwan deputies to the
National People's Congress, which is currently in session, Qian
said that the issue of Taiwan's peaceful reunification with the
motherland will become more prominent after Hong Kong, and then
Macao, return to the embrace of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will unswervingly adhere to the
principles of "one country, two systems" and peaceful
reunification in pushing ahead with the cause of reunification of
the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong and Taiwan have close ties in exchange
of visits, economic cooperation and trade, and cultural exchanges,
and many Taiwan compatriots come back to the mainland of the
motherland for tourism, visit of relatives, investment, and trade
via Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the return of Hong Kong to the motherland will
surely exert a great influence on the relations between two sides
of the Strait," he said.
</P>
<P>
After China resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong
Kong, he added, the central government will stick to the
principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong," giving Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"Following its return, Hong Kong will retain its social system
and lifestyle, and maintain its role as an international center of
finance, trade and transportation, thus ensuring a long-term
prosperity and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the past ten years, he said, great changes have taken
place in relations across the Strait, with a total of more than 10
million people from Taiwan visiting the mainland.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 alone, 1.72 million Taiwan compatriots visited the
mainland, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Since the past decade has witnessed such magnificent changes,
we have every reason to believe that the next decade will bear
witness to even greater progress," Qian predicted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the issue of "international living space," he said
that Taiwan enjoys a vast space for non-governmental exchanges in
economy, trade, and culture, since it has joined in many
non-governmental international organizations, and scored a fairly
large non-governmental trade volume.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "it won't be permitted if Taiwan attempts to
separate from the motherland as an independent sovereign state by
seeking diplomatic living space."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that with China's ever growing
economic strength, rising international status, and with expanding
exchanges between the Strait, the great cause of peaceful
reunification of the motherland will surely be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
Qian also listened carefully to discussions and suggestions of
the Taiwan deputies by origin, which covered a wide range of
topics.

<HEADLINE> Government to Allocate Special Funds for Displaced Workers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua)-- The State Council, China's cabinet,
has decided to set aside 30 billion yuan this year as reserve fund
for mergers and bankruptcies of state-owned enterprises and for
reemployment programs that will provide jobs for workers to be
displaced by such mergers and bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed today by Zhu Rongji, vice premier of the
State Council and a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, in a group discussion with deputies to the National
People's Congress that has been in session since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the central government will increase the amount of
such reserves on a year-to-year basis, while local governments
should also support reemployment programs by raising money from
different sources.
</P>
<P>
Provincial governments and relevant cities must waste no time
in working out re-employment programs for displaced workers so
that state-owned enterprises can become profitable in about three
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice premier, there are about 10 million
redundant workers in China's debt-ridden enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Providing conditions for a good settlement of these workers
is an important way to help money-losing state enterprises out
of their difficulties," he said. "And this can be done only by
carrying out reemployment programs."
</P>
<P>
He said reemployment programs are a uniquely Chinese insurance
measure that is meant to protect the interests of the working
class at a time when China does not yet have a well-functioning
social security system.
</P>
<P>
"We should persist, resolutely and unswervingly, in carrying
out reemployment programs," he said.

<P>
Zhu said the most important thing on this year's economic
agenda is to work for a marked progress in reform of the
state-owned sector. The fundamental way out, he said, is "to
unswervingly implement a series of important instructions by Jiang
Zemin to 'reform, reorganize and upgrade' state-owned enterprises."
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier emphasized the importance of economic
restructuring and the need to allow money-losing enterprises to
merge or go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
"Since the majority of industrial products are in over-supply,
state-owned enterprises should work hard to restructure instead of
building new plants," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of bankruptcy and the merging of state-owned
enterprises, he said, "Bankruptcies should be standardized;
mergers should be encouraged."
</P>
<P>
He called for preventing what he termed "fake" bankruptcies
that are meant to evade debt repayment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of economic development in central and western areas,
he said the central government has given 90 percent of the fiscal
transfer payment to these areas since 1995 and poured large
amounts of investment money there for capital construction
projects.
</P>
<P>
He said the central government has given priority to
exploitation of natural resources and infrastructure construction
in these areas and encouraged coastal areas to invest in these
areas, in railway construction in particular.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-premier, the Lanzhou-Urumqi Railway
opened to traffic two years ahead of schedule and the
Nanning-Kunming Railway will be completed soon. Other railways
such as Xi'an-Ankang and South Xinjiang are under construction.
All these railways are in underdeveloped central and western
regions.

<HEADLINE> Non-Communist Parties, Figures on CPC's Political Consultation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Non-Communist figures here
attending the Fifth Session of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), today
praised the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at the core for its contributions to the building of
socialist democracy in China.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee had held a total of 100 consultative
meetings with non-communist figures over the past seven or more
years to the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Such consultations and close cooperations between the CPC and
other parties and organizations have contributed positively to
China's economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The CPC conferred and consulted with other non-communist
parties and organizations before it made any major decision in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
As the party in power, the CPC often notify the non-communist
parties and organizations of major international and domestic
events, issues concerning national economic and social development
and the anti-corruption campaign, and the diplomatic work.
</P>
<P>
Every year, Jiang Zemin and other leaders of the CPC Central
Committee, would invite leaders of the non-communist parties and
organizations and figures without party affiliations to air their
views about united front, multi-party cooperation and major social
issues.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siwei, new chairman of the Central Committee of the China
Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA), said that
the third generation of the central collective leadership with
Jiang Zemin at the core are always ready to hear the opinions of
non-communists.
</P>
<P>
Sun Qimeng, a founder of CDNCA, said that the political system
of multi-party cooperation and political consultation led by the
CPC reflects China's characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qixing, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the
Jiusan (September 3) Society, said: "Multi-party cooperation is
not empty talk but has profound and concrete contents."
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress, earlier extended
invitations to the non-communist parties and organizations for
brotherly supervision over the CPC.

Union." He believed relations would develop dynamically in the
future.

British Airways has promised to invest 440 million francs (86
million dollars) in Air Liberte on top of the purchasing cost.
</P>
<P>
Privately-owned Air Liberte, which operates mainly in the
French domestic market, has been under judicial receivership
since September 1996 after defaulting on debt payments.
</P>
<P>
British Airways made its bid last November in the hope of
increasing its share of the French domestic airline market. BA
operated in France mainly through its subsidiary TAT European
Airlines which it took over in 1996.
</P>
<P>
After the acquisition, BA will merge Air Liberte with TAT and
install TAT chairman Marc Rochet as chairman and managing director
of Air Liberte.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Spending Up 0.7 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer spending
increased by 0.7 in January, outpacing the 0.3 percent gain in
personal incomes, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that consumer spending totaled 5.3 trillion
dollars at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from 5.26
trillion in December.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest increase since last October when the
spending gained by 0.9 percent. The increase followed a 3.4
percent gain in last three month of 1996 which helped boost the
U.S. economic growth by a strong 3.9 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of the economic
activity in the country.
</P>
<P>
The report said that spending on durable goods rose by 1.7
percent in January after dropping 0.7 percent the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Spending on nondurable goods such as food and fuel increased by
0.3 percent following a slower 0.1 percent gain in December.
</P>
<P>
Spending on services advanced by 0.7 percent, faster than the
0.5 percent increase a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The department said U.S. personal incomes totaled an annual
rate of 6.65 trillion dollars, up from 6.63 trillion in December.
</P>
<P>
The increase was the smallest since it edged up at a 0.1
percent in October.
</P>
<P>
Still, much of the increase was attributed to cost-of-living
increases in federal programs such as Social Security, changes in
the earned income credit program and pay raises for federal
civilian and military personnel.
</P>
<P>
In fact, private wages and salaries, the most closely watched
component of income, fell by 9.5 billion dollars after jumping by
41.6 billion in December.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income -- income after taxes -- rose 0.6 percent,
slower than the 0.7 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The combination of incomes and spending meant that Americans'
saving rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income --
remained unchanged at 5.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kongs's Economic Prosperity Guaranteed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government advisors from
Hong Kong said today that the Basic Law and the principle of "one
country, two systems" will provide a strong guarantee for Hong
Kong's prosperity and progress after its return to the motherland
in July.
</P>
<P>
"The economic prospect of Hong Kong will be very bright," said
Hu Fa-Kuang, a respected Hong Kong entrepreneur and a member of
the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, which is in session here.
</P>
<P>
Like Hu, many other CPPCC National Committee members from Hong
Kong said that they are very optimistic about the region's future.
</P>
<P>
The real estate and stock markets are bullish as economic
growth picks up speed, they said, adding that 45 percent of the
overseas companies in Hong Kong made their way into the region in
the last five years.
</P>
<P>
They quoted a survey as showing that the index tracking the
confidence of Hong Kong residents is rising steadily and more Hong
Kong people residing overseas have returned.
</P>
<P>
All these show that people are full of confidence in Hong Kong,
they said, explaining that such confidence is derived partly from
the fact that Hong Kong will enjoy independence in economic,
fiscal and financial affairs and with regard to tariff policies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, experience in the past years has shown that Hong
Kong's economic development has been supported by the inland.
</P>
<P>
With Hong Kong's return to the embrace of the motherland, such
support will become more direct, they said.
</P>
<P>
The confidence of Hong Kong and international investors is not
based merely on Hong Kong's 1,000-odd sq km land, but mainly
because Hong Kong has backing from the motherland, they said.
</P>
<P>
Tsui Tsin-tong, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC
National Committee, said that bright prospects of the motherland's
economy, which is expected to grow by an average eight percent a
year during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), will be
the most powerful guarantee for Hong Kong's economic prosperity
and stability in the future.
</P>
<P>
The two economies of the inland and Hong Kong will get closer
after July 1 and the inland's Ninth Five-Year Plan, its Long-term
objectives for the year 2010 and its effort to accelerate economic
development in its central and western parts will offer broader
areas of cooperation between them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Safeguarding and promoting economic prosperity in Hong Kong is
in the interests of both Hong Kong and the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that cooperation between the inland and Hong Kong under
the principle of "one country, two systems" will enable China to
score greater economic achievements in the next century.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's black
business empowerment has gained a new momentum today with the
establishment of a new oil company, aimed at empowering a broad
spectrum of business interests of the country, said a source

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Falls Below 20 Dollars a Barrel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The average price of a basket of
OPEC crude oil fell below 20 U.S. dollars per barrel last week for
the first time since last September, the OPEC Secretariat said
today.
</P>
<P>
The average price for OPEC's basket of seven crudes dived 1.03
dollars last week to 19.19 U.S. dollars per barrel, below OPEC's
benchmark price of 21 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Analysts blamed the decline on the advent of warmer weather in
Europe and North America, as well as adequate supplies in the
market because both OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries are
fully utilizing their capacity.
</P>
<P>
The temporary return of Iraq to the oil export market under the
United Nations oil-for-food deal has had little impact on the
overall market.
</P>
<P>
The oil price has fallen steadily from a monthly average
five-year high of 23.51 last December to 23.19 dollars a barrel in
January. The average price for February hasn't been announced yet
but is expected to be lower still.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Clinton Start Talks on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat started his talks on Monday with U.S. President Bill
Clinton at the White House, and they will focus their discussions
on Israel's recent approval of establishing a new settlement in
Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters before opening his talks with Arafat at
the White House that Israel's decision to build Jewish homes in
the captured east Jerusalem could only breed "mistrust" between
the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"I would have preferred the decision not have been made because
I don't think it builds confidence, I think it builds mistrust,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat accused Israel of trying to torpedo peace process in the
Middle East by its decision after he arrived in Washington on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of the Israeli government to build a settlement
... is very dangerous and is aimed at torpedoing the peace.
process," he told members of the Palestinian-American Congress
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want to establish an independent state in the
occupied territories with east Jerusalem as its capital, while
Israel is obviously intended to integrate the east Jerusalem,
captured in the 1967 Middle East war, into the west part of the
city and declare the whole holy city as its capital even though no
one of the international community recognize its claim.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government decision (of building the new
settlement in east Jerusalem) is a flagrant violation of United
Nations resolutions and of our agreements with Israel," Arafat
said.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian minister of higher education,
said Arafat would stress to Clinton that peace moves were
threatened by the Israeli decision on the settlement when they
meet on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear the Palestinian people are not going to sit
back and accept the implication of the Israeli decision," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has criticized Israel for its housing
project, saying it complicated an already complex situation and
was not a step to "build confidence and trust" between the
Israelis and Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> State Councillor Shows Satisfaction with Ethnic Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Unity among different ethnic
groups represents an important matter which must be given great
attention at all time, said State Councillor Ismail Amat here
today.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Amat, who is also Minister in Charge of the State
Nationalities Affairs Commission, said in a group discussion with
Xinjiang deputies to the National People's Congress, that China
scored new progress with regard to ethnic affairs, along with
expansion of relations between different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The year 1996 was marked by equality, unity and harmonious
relations between different ethnic groups who are working together
towards economic development, common prosperity and the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics in general.
</P>
<P>
Based on the socialist market economic system, economic
cooperation between the different ethnic groups, the eastern and
western parts, and the inland and border areas of the country, was
boosted noticeably, he said.
</P>
<P>
For example, the minister said, about 20,000 township
enterprises in eastern areas have developed cooperation with their
counterparts in the west, with the transfer of over 30 billion
yuan in investment.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Amat said that China's different ethnic groups are
confident in safeguarding the unity of the motherland, which they
believe constitutes the foundation for the existence, development
and prosperity of all ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The state councillor attributed the achievements to enhanced
conscientiousness of governments and departments at different
levels, in addition to people's improved living standard which
resulted from reforms, opening- up and economic construction.

<HEADLINE> Li Ruihuan on Literary, Art Creation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Senior Party Official Li Ruihuan
said here today that literary and art workers should take Deng
Xiaoping's concepts on literary and art as guideline, and make
concerted efforts to promote the prosperity of arts and
literature.
</P>
<P>
Li, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, and
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the remark during
a meeting with members of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee,
which is currently in its fifth session here.
</P>
<P>
After listening to a dozen members's speeches covering a wide
range of topics, Li said it is key to the prosperity of arts and
literature that Deng Xiaoping's literary and art concepts be
closely studied, understood, and carried out in a down-to-earth
manner.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Deng Xiaoping's series of expositions on art and
literature are an integral part of his theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and should become the
guideline for art and literary work," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said special attention should be paid to Deng's speech at
the Fourth National Congress of Chinese literary and art workers,
which summarized historical lessons and experience, and defined
the direction for development of arts and literature in line with
the Party's general task and characteristics of art and literary
work in the new historical period.
</P>
<P>
"This speech led to the spring of arts and literature in the
new historical period, and put forth a series of important
concepts, which is still realistically significant today," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we keep on doing things according to Comrade Deng
Xiaoping's theories, arts and literature will become prosperous
and retain the spring forever," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that literary and artistic creation now have
favorable conditions, as China's longstanding and brilliant
history, and the bustling life of reform, opening up and
modernization drive provide literary and performing artists with
ample, varied raw materials for creation.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the people crave for a richer cultural
life and are thirsty for more entertainment, while modernization
of various media have facilitated spreading of artistic and
literary works.
</P>
<P>
"Having gone through vicissitudes and accumulated precious
experience, all people of the art and literary circle cherish the
current situation of hard-earned unity and stability. With joint
efforts, we will surely write more works to the welcome of general
public and to meet the people's growing ethical and cultural
needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the time for everyone is limited, and writers and
artists should produce more and better works that can withstand
criticism by the coming generations.
</P>
<P>
He finally expressed the hope that artistic and literary
workers will increase unity, pluck up their enthusiasm, go deep
amidst the life of the masses and dedicate themselves to artistic
creation and contribute still more in prospering the cultural
garden.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Enjoys Ethnic Harmony: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's autonomy system for ethnic
regions has benefited residents of all ethnic groups in
northwestern China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said the
region's top legislator.
</P>
<P>
Amudun Niyaz, chairman of the Standing Committee of the the
people's congress of the region, said local residents are
satisfied with the government's ethnic policies. Amudun is in
Beijing attending the current session of the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Since ethnic regional autonomy was established in Xinjiang 41
years ago, all the ethnic groups there enjoy harmonious relations,
said Amudun.
</P>
<P>
"Maintenance of stability and acceleration of economic growth
represent the common aspiration of people of all ethnic groups,
and are in their basic interests" he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Ethnic minority are never discriminated against in the region,
enjoying all the political rights granted by the Constitution," he
said.
</P>
<P>
All the main leading posts of governments and the people's
congresses at various levels in the region are taken by ethnic
minority people, he said, and all the ethnic groups have their own
representatives in government bodies.
</P>
<P>
He took the example of the Uygur people, the main ethnic group
in Xinjiang. Forty-two percent of the deputies to the region's
people's congress are Uygur people, who account for 41 percent of
the region's total population.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region has paid much attention on developing
education, said Amudun. Apart from Chinese and Uygur languages,
which are in common use in the region, local ethnic languages are
used in different autonomous prefectures, counties and ethnic
townships.
</P>
<P>
He added all the ethnic groups enjoy freedom in religious
belief as granted by the Constitution, and normal religious
activities are protected.

<HEADLINE> Train Accident Kills 125 People in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A train derailed this morning in
central Pakistan, leaving as many as 125 people killed and about
450 others injured.
</P>
<P>
Five cars of the train, which was heading for the southern port
city of Karachi, skidded off the tracks early today outside the
rural station of Mirshah near Khanewal, northeast of Multan in
Punjab Province.
</P>
<P>
Doctors, paramedical staff, engineers and other specialized
personnel of the Army have been called out to provide relief to
the victims.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters of the Army were also rushed to the accident site
to evacuate the seriously injured persons.
</P>
<P>
Special information cells have been set up at several major
railway stations to provide first-hand information to relatives of
the passengers of the train.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani President Farooq Leghari expressed today his deep
grief and sorrow over the loss of lives in the accident.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the bereaved families, Leghari assured the
injured that the government would provide all possible help for
their recovery.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif earlier visited the site of the
accident and asked the local government to hold immediate inquiry
into the mishap.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered local hospital authorities and health
departments to ensure provision of the best possible medical
treatment to the injured.
</P>
<P>
Punjab Governor Tariq Rahim and Chief Minister Muhammad Shahbaz
Sharif expressed deep grief and sorrow over the accident.
</P>
<P>
Sharif directed the local health departments to provide best
possible treatment to the injured when he visited Khanewal today.
</P>
<P>
As the rescue operations are still going on, the death toll is
likely to further rise as some parts of the cars are still buried
in sand.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the tragedy has not been found so far, but some
reports suggested that some problem in the brake system of the
train may have directly led to the derailment.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated train reportedly developed some problem in the
brake system just before approaching the Mirshah station, which
made the driver unable to stop the train, sources at the Khanewal
station were quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister: No Deal With PNA Over Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai today denied that Israel had made a deal with
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) over a controversial
building plan in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, Mordechai rebuffed the claims that Israel had
promised further troop withdrawals from the West Bank to allay
PNA's anger over Israel's decision to build a settlement in the
Har Homa neighborhood in southeastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"I don't find any engagement between the Har Homa decision and
any other decision," he told the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Israel has delayed the first phase of further pullouts, which
should be completed within this week under the Hebron agreement
signed last month. Local media reports said that Israel might
consider widening the scope of further pullouts in order to mute
the Palestinian anger over Har Homa issue.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, at the same time, called on Palestinians to refrain
from violence in reaction to the Har Homa project. "We are asking
the PNA and the Palestinian people to continue to build peace
between Palestinians and Israelis, and not to use any violence in
this situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the committee that until now the PNA had
been trying hard to prevent violent response to the Har Homa
project. But he went on to say that no one could predict what
would happen after PNA leader Yasser Arafat returns from his
ongoing visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai did not rule out the possibility of local violences
launched by some radical Palestinians, which could lead to a
situation that is out of PNA control.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Israel would halt the further pullouts if
violence broke out when Israeli bulldozers were sent to the
construction site, Mordechai said that Israel would do anything
necessary to ensure its security. But he again urged the
Palestinians to "continue to negotiate, and to find a nice track"
for pushing forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in South Lebanon, Mordechai said he had
checked with the U.S., France and Britain whether they were ready
to send peace-keeping troops to replace the Israeli troops there,
but had been rejected by the three countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister again rejected the idea of unilaterally
withdrawing troops from South Lebanon, saying the Hezbollah
forces would keep pushing on to the Israeli border and
threatening security of its northern region.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The capital of Pakistan's
Baluchistan Province, Quetta, was jolted by another tremor this
morning but there were no reports of damage to property or loss of
life.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, which measured 4.5 on the open-ended Richter
scale, rocked the city at 7:25 a.m., the Associated Press of
Pakistan reported today.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the
Koh-e-Suleman about 140 kilometers northeast of Quetta.
</P>
<P>
It was the second earthquake after the Friday tremors which
killed about 60 persons in the province. Hernai Tehsil of Sibi
Division bore the brunt of the quake with 39 casualties.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian State Will Be Established: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Defying Israel's warning
against declaring independence, a Palestinian spokesman today
claimed the Palestinian state will be created anyway.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Abdel Rahman, secretary of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), told reporters in Gaza that "Palestinian state
will be established whether (Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin)
Netanyahu accepts that or not."
</P>
<P>
Rahman was commenting on the warning issued by Netanyahu
Sunday night when he made a tough speech at the gathering of Likud
Central Committee held in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu warned PNA President Yasser Arafat that declaring
independence in reaction to Israel's building plan in eastern
Jerusalem would be a grave mistake that could end the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Attending the urgent meeting of the Arab League in Cairo
earlier Sunday, Arafat said that he might declare a Palestinian
state in reaction to Israel's decision to build a settlement in
the Har Homa neighborhood in southeastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told 2,000 enthusiastic party supporters: "We will
know how to react and we have a very good answer." But he did not
elaborate what actions he would take.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Israeli President Ezer Weizman also cautioned
Arafat against declaring a Palestinian state now, saying it would
be "a terrible mistake" that could destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Jerusalem has been at the center of the
Israeli-Palestinian disputes. While Israel has declared whole
Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital, the PNA hopes to
create a Palestinian state with the eastern Jerusalem, occupied by
Israel in the 1967 War, as its capital.
</P>
<P>
On the Har Homa project, Rahman said that the plan is doomed to
failure. "The destiny of what they call Har Homa will not be
better than the fate of Yamit Settlement," he said, referring to
the settlement built in the Sinai Peninsula which Israel captured
from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Yamit Settlement was later destroyed by Israel itself
before turning Sinai back to Egypt after the two countries
signed a peace treaty in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Improvement of Investment Climate Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe should further improve
the investment climate to attract more foreign capital, British
High Commissioner to Zimbabwe Martin Williams said here today.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the Confederation of British Industry-organized
investment and trade conference on Zimbabwe in London, Williams
said while the Zimbabwe government has made tremendous progress
in creating an environment conducive to foreign investment, more
needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the major steps that have been taken to
improve the Zimbabwean investment climate are the signing of
investment protection agreements with investing countries, the
setting up of the Zimbabwe Investment Center, which he described
as a "dynamic organization", and the introduction of the export
processing zones.
</P>
<P>
"All these are very positive developments but there are
certain elements that can be made better," he said, citing the
huge budget deficit as one of the problem areas.
</P>
<P>
He added investors need to be confident and certain about
their investments, hence the need for clear investment policies.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who arrived in London
today, will deliver a keynote address at the one-day conference,
to be held on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> HSBC's Positive Outlook on Hongkong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Hongkong's economic fortunes are
closely aligned to China's. HSBC has a "very positive" outlook on
the transition of Hongkong to a Special Administrative Region,
HSBC Chief Executive said here today.
</P>
<P>
John Bond, Group Chief Executive, made the remarks while he was
announcing the Group's operating profit in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said: "China is forecasting impressive growth of around 9
percent over the next few years. Inflation has been successfully
contained and a range of reforms initiated which will contribute
to greater economic efficiency and higher standard of living for
the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
Expressing his confidence on HSBC's business in Hongkong, Bond
said: "The HSBC Group's strategy is to remain focused on our
customers in Hongkong and China, to invest in our businesses there
and to continue to offer high-quality products at competitive
prices."
</P>
<P>
The Group made a profit before tax of 4,524 million pounds
(7,238 million US dollars) in 1996, an increase of 852 million
pounds (1363 million US dollars), or 23 percent, over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The total capital ratio for the Group strengthened during the
first half of 1996 and remained strong at the year-end at 15.3
percent; the tier 1 capital ratio increased during the year to 9.9
percent from 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Group's total assets at 31 December 1996 were 237 billion
pounds (379 billion US dollars), an increase of 10 billion pounds
(16 billion US dollars), or 4 percent, since year-end 1995. At
constant exchange rates, assets grew by 25 billion pounds (40
billion US dollars), or 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
While HSBC Holding plc is satisfied with its performance, Group
Chairman Sir William Purves said: "1997 will be a year filled, for
us, with challenges and oportunities, marked, most importantly, by
the transition of Hongkong to Special Administrative Region of
the People's Republic of China."

<HEADLINE> US Construction Spending Increases in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Construction spending in the
U.S. increased by 0.4 percent in January after a decline of 0.9
percent in December, U.S. Commerce Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The department reported that residential, nonresidential and
government spending totaled 589.8 billion dollars at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate in the month, up from 587.4 billion in last
December.
</P>
<P>
The spending in January was 5.5 percent higher than that of the
same month last year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. construction spending in December dropped because of bad
weather in the Western areas. It was the first decline since the
spending fell 0.7 percent last July.
</P>
<P>
The report said that spending on apartments and condominiums
rose 1.5 percent following a 4.8 percent decline in December.
</P>
<P>
Nonresidential spending advanced 2.9 percent, regaining most of
the 3 percent loss a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Government spending edge up by a small 0.1 percent after
falling 2.6 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
Residential spending, including home improvements, increased
0.4 percent, the third straight increase.
</P>
<P>
But spending on single-family homes -- more than 25 percent of
total outlays -- was unchanged from December when outlays inched
up 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
After the strongest year in nearly a decade, U.S. analysts
expect housing activity to flatten in 1997 but continue at a
robust pace.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Foreign Currency Likely Drop in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's demand for foreign
currency could drop as it becomes more expensive to import
finished goods which now attract punitive tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Stanbic Bank's money treasury manager Andy Hodges said
although in general, the tariffs would have no impact on the
foreign exchange market, demand for foreign currency might drop
in the long-run.
</P>
<P>
"People might reduce the importation of some goods, but the
fast moving consumer goods will continue coming in, and these on
their own are not of much significance in influencing foreign
currency demand on the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the country's foreign currency reserves are
more than sufficient besides the unprecedented demand experienced
during the last two months of last year.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign currency situation is healthy with about
five-and-half months import cover.

<HEADLINE> Money Supply on Rise in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Broad money supply (M3) in
Zimbabwe grew by 31 percent in 1996, far exceeding the original
target of 22 percent set by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ).
</P>
<P>
The RBZ today blamed the expansion in money supply on
increased private sector and government borrowing, with credit to
the former rising by 4.688 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (426 million
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
M3 is defined by the central bank as currency in circulation
plus demand, savings and term deposits with banks.
</P>
<P>
"Broad money supply (M3) grew by 31 percent over the 12-month
period to December 1996. This was a reversal of developments in
October and November when M3 growth fell sharply from 33.8
percent in September to 11.8 percent and 10.5 percent,
respectively, following the tightening of accommodation
conditions to discount houses by the bank," the RBZ said.
</P>
<P>
The RBZ last year set a money supply growth target of 22
percent, which it said then was sufficient to support private
sector credit expansion of at least 20 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's transitional legislature,
le Conseil National de Transition (CNT), Sunday adopted an
electoral law on the establishment of a two-chamber parliament
with a total of 524 seats, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The lower house of parliament will have 380 seats, each
representing a constituency of 80,000 people, while those
departments (provinces) with a population of more than 350,000
will have at least four seats, said the law.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian capital Algiers will have at least 24 seats
because of its large population representation.
</P>
<P>
The upper house of parliament will have 144 seats, with each of
the country's 48 departments having two seats, while one third of
its seats will be designated by the president of the republic.
</P>
<P>
During an extraordinary session on January 25, the CNT adopted
a new law on political parties and a text on election regulations,
which installed a proportionate system to replace one based on a
two-round majority votes.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Salvation Front won the legislative elections in
1991 after obtaining a majority of votes in two rounds of
pollings.
</P>
<P>
The results of the elections were canceled by the Algerian

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blast Rocks Karachi Newspaper Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A powerful time-bomb ripped a
newspaper office in Pakistan's southern city of Karachi early
today, causing minor casualties but major damage.
</P>
<P>
Two employees of the Urdu language daily newspaper Qaumi Akhbar
were slightly injured by flying glass when the bomb went off at
5:53 a.m. today in the newspaper's building in Karachi, Pakistan's
biggest city and capital city of Sindh Province.
</P>
<P>
Bomb disposal experts discovered that the bomb was a home-made
device of a 400-gram TNT flake with a timer, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, reportedly wrapped in a packet, was placed on the
first floor of the four-story building and its impact made a hole
with a diameter of 14 inches, the bomb experts were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, no staff were in the office at the time of the
explosion because they usually go to work at around 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The damage caused by the blast was estimated by the executive
editor of the newspaper, Mukhtar Aqil, at 10 million rupees
(250,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The explosion shattered windows, badly damaged computers,
scanner, air conditioners and other equipment in the office, Aqil
was quoted as saying. Nearby offices were also damaged in the
blast.
</P>
<P>
No group or people have claimed responsibility so far for the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Chief Minister of Sindh Province, Liaquat Ali Jatoi, rushed to
the scene of the blast and ordered that an inquiry be conducted
into the incident and a committee formed in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The government will take necessary measures to enforce law and
order in Karachi, he said.
</P>
<P>
Karachi police have described the blast as an act of terrorism
and set up teams to investigate it.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif expressed deep concern
later in the day over the bomb blast, which he said amounts to an
assault on the freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister asked Sindh provincial authorities to probe
into the incident and net the culprits as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Today's bomb blast is the fourth terrorist attack in Pakistan
this year.
</P>
<P>
Twelve people including a religious party leader were killed
and about 30 others injured on January 18 when a bomb exploded in
the eastern Pakistan city of Lahore.
</P>
<P>
At least seven people including the director of the Iranian
Cultural Center were killed on February 20 by unidentified gunmen
in Multan in the eastern province of Punjab.
</P>
<P>
Eight days later, in another bombing in Lahore, at least three
people were killed and about a dozen others injured.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's new government has vowed to curb the rising violence
and crime and ensure a stable and safe living environment for the
people. And this is widely seen as a major challenge to the Sharif
government besides the economic crisis, because, as observers here
pointed out, if their safety of life and property cannot be
protected, the Pakistanis will lose confidence in the government.

<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Health and Child
Welfare of Zimbabwe is running a malaria workshop for medical
practitioners countrywide in the wake of a malaria epidemic which
has already killed twice as many people this year compared to the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The five-day workshop which started in Kariba Town of north
Zimbabwe today is being attended by medical practitioners from
the government, city councils and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the workshop, malaria has already killed over 200
people so far this year compared to over 100 last year and the
epidemic is expected to get worse because of the excessive rains.
</P>
<P>
Over 6,000 estimated deaths occurred last year due to malaria
although the figure could have been higher as some of the cases
went unreported in remote areas, the workshop said.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Health Ministry said delegates at the
ongoing workshop will discuss ways of reducing mortality and
morbidity due to malaria by better management of complicated and
severe cases.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Vows to Build Har Homa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Rebuffing international
criticism of the Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim) project in
Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu today vowed
that the Jewish neighborhood will be built.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio today quoted Netanyahu as reaffirming Israel's
decision to go ahead with the construction of 6,500 housing units
in the Har Homa neighborhood in the southern outskirts of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Jerusalem's Abu Tur neighborhood today,
where work to improve the infrastructure got under way, Netanyahu
also stressed Israel's commitment to construct housing units for
Palestinians in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely committed to the idea that Jerusalem is
the city of all its residents, not just Jewish residents,
but also Arab residents," Netanyahu said. "All the Jerusalem
residents are entitled to equal development."
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, who accompanied Netanyahu during
the tour, was quoted as saying that construction projects in other
Palestinian neighborhoods are expected to begin within the next
few days.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Israeli government approved the plan to build
6,500 Jewish homes in Har Homa, of which 2,450 will be completed
in the first three years.
</P>
<P>
In parallel, the government said it would start to build
3,015 units for Palestinians in 10 existing neighborhoods within
the city limits, though it would boost that number to 9,000
units over an unspecified time.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials reacted angrily to the building plan,
saying the Israeli government's decision is a violation of law
and its agreements with the Palestinians, and has put the
peace process in danger.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat has
called on the UN Security Council and the Arab League to help
stop the construction in Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
The Har Homa issue is surely to be a highlight at today's
meeting between United States President Bill Clinton and Arafat,
who is currently paying a visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had expressed its "disappointment" last week over the
Israeli government's decision to go ahead with the construction of
the new Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Israel Plans to "Squeeze and Isolate Jerusalem" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat said on Monday that Israel's plan to build Jewish homes in
Arab east Jerusalem was designed to "squeeze and to isolate
Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived in Washington for a four-day visit, was
speaking before his talks with President Bill Clinton at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
"Their target is to squeeze and to isolate Jerusalem, but at
the same time to build settlements at the entrance of Bethlehem,"
the Palestinian leader told reporters at a photo session with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also expressed his regret over the Israeli government's
decision to construct the new settlement in east Jerusalem, saying
it could only build "mistrust".
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is on both sides to be building confidence
and working together," he said. "And so I would have preferred the
decision not have been made because I don't think it builds
confidence. It builds mistrust."
</P>
<P>
the Israeli decision to build the Jewish homes in east
Jerusalem was seen by the Palestinians as an attempt to cement
Israel's hold over the entire city.
</P>
<P>
Arafat accused Israel of trying to torpedo peace process in the
Middle East by its housing project.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of the Israeli government to build a settlement
</P>
<P>
... is very dangerous and is aimed at torpedoing the peace
process," he told members of the Palestinian-American Congress at
a dinner meeting on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"Not one single house should be added" in east Jerusalem. He
said that part of the city "was Arab, is Arab, will remain Arab
and eventually would become capital of Palestine."
</P>
<P>
Tensions are high in the West Bank over the housing project.
the Palestinian legislature called a general strike to protest
with shops and schools shut down.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Israeli troops fired on Palestinian workers
at a roadblock and four tombstones were smashed at a Jewish
cemetery in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Arafat came to Washington on Sunday from Cairo, where he
attended an emergency meeting of the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
He told the 22-member Arab League that the settlement issue was
an attempt by Israel to blast the peace process to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
"We say that there can be no peace without Jerusalem and no
peace with settlements. Steelements and peace do not go together,
and there will be no peace as long as Israel violates our rights
in Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also suggested that he could declare a Palestinian state
in response to Israel's housing project.
</P>
<P>
"We are supposed to declare the setting up of a Palestinian
state in five years, but what would happen if I declare it right
here? What would he (Benjamin Netanyahu) do then? It's
tit-for-tat, and we have our weapons, too," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Applies Stringent Measures to Curb Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus applies stringent
measures to curb money laundering and is ready to implement
additional rules and regulations to combat money laundering more
effectively, a government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a U.S. State Department report on international
narcotics control, which ranks Cyprus among the "high risk areas
for money laundering", government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides said "Cyprus wishes to be a robust center of
offshore companies only within the bounds of international law."
</P>
<P>
"There is political will to combat money laundering and this
has been proven by an array of legislative bills adopted in
accordance with international conventions," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The present legislation, he explained, is "fully concluded"
and the Central Bank intends to issue more strict directives to
commercial banks to help them combat this type of crime.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department report shifts Cyprus from a
medium-high to a high priority country in the money laundering
section, and the island is placed in the same category as the
United States, Britain and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides noted that "had Cyprus been assisted by countries
with specialized units in such matters, for example the U.S.,
then we would succeed in our objective."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Cyprus' Central Bank Governor Afxentis Afxentiou
rejected the findings of the U.S. report and called on anyone
with concrete information to come forward and submit it to the
authorities for investigation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has signed two international conventions on combatting
money laundering, the U.N. Convention on Illicit Traffic of
Narcotices in 1988 and the Council of Europe Convention on
Combatting Organized Crime in 1990. Both were ratified by the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in April last year, new legislation was enacted for
the confiscation of funds from illegal and serious offenses, such
as organized crime, terrorism and prostitution. The Central Bank
has instructed commercial banks to report to the authorities any
cash deposit over 10,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nike to Sponsor Olympics-Style Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Nike, the sneaker giant of the
world, is planning to co-sponsor an Olympics of its own: The Nike
World Masters Games.
</P>
<P>
The company is lending its name to what could develop into a
massive promotional sporting event co-hosted by the city of
Portland, Oregon, and to be staged in August 1998, the USA Today
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 14-day multisport event, designed for athletes aged 30 and
older, is expected to attract as many as 25,000 amateur athletes
from the U.S.A. and other countries, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Previously, World Masters Games have been played outside the
U.S. with limited corporate support. "It's a global event and
the number of participants are attractive to us," said Nike
spokeswoman Erin Kendrigan.
</P>
<P>
Nike's title sponsorship cost 3.5 million U.S. dollars. But
marketing support and other costs could ultimately run Nike five
times that, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts estimated that the two-week event in Oregon
could pump 113 million U.S. dollars into the economy. "If all
these assumptions play out, this will be the largest event, in
terms of dollar impact on the local area, that Oregon has ever
seen," the paper said.

<HEADLINE> British Health Ministry Confirms 16 CJD Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The British Health Ministry
announced here today that there are altogether 16 cases of
confirmed or suspected human version BSE or mad cow disease in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
In its regular briefing on cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
(CJD), the Health Ministry said in a statement issued earlier
today that there were 13 confirmed cases of the new variant of CJD
and another three suspected cases.
</P>
<P>
"In definite cases the diagnosis will have been pathologically
confirmed, in most cases by postmortem examination of brain
tissue," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that probable cases have not been
confirmed pathologically and some cases are never confirmed
pathologically because the relatives of patients usually refuse to
grant a postmortem examination.
</P>
<P>
British government scientists said that a likely source of the
new variant was eating beef products infected with mad cow
disease.

<HEADLINE> OAU Calls for Speedy Resolution of Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for African
Unity (OAU) has urged the Security Council of the United Nations
to facilitate the speedy and definite resolution of the Lockerbie
bombing issue.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said in Pretoria
today that an OAU-appointed five-country committee has put three
alternatives before the UN Security Council to help the
resolution of the issue.
</P>
<P>
The committee proposed that the trial of the two suspects be
held in a neutral country to be determined by the Security
Council, and that the suspects be tried at the International
Court of Justice in Hague in the Netherlands in accordance with
Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the committee also proposed to set up a special
criminal tribunal at the International Court of Justice
Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Council of Ministers called on the UN Security Council
to accept one of the proposed options, thereby facilitating the
speedy and definite resolution of the dispute, Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU also appealed to the Security Council to abandon
sanctions imposed on Libya after the explosion.
</P>
<P>
A time-bomb exploded on an American Pan-AM 747 aircraft as it
flied over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing more than 200
passengers and crew, and 11 people on the ground. It was
allegedly planted by two Libyan agents.

<HEADLINE> Several U.S. States Battle Floods After Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 18 people were killed
in flooding and tornadoes in Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky and
Ohio, in addition to the 24 killed by tornadoes in Arkansas in the
last couple of days.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people were injured and hundreds of houses were
destroyed in the worst storms in recent years in Arkansas, where
President Bill Clinton has declared disaster area of nine
counties.
</P>
<P>
The states are battling flood in the wake of the storms and
continued heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the mid-southern states, flooding also
devastated hundreds of homes in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
West Virginia Gov. Cecil Underwood declared a state of
emergency Sunday in 14 counties, allowing the National Guard to
assist.
</P>
<P>
Many streams were still rising toward flood crests today, and
flash flood watches remained in effect for many counties.
</P>
<P>
In Kentucky, officials in north-central Louisville and
Jefferson counties said that 40,000 homes and businesses had been
flooded.
</P>

Ohio Gov. George Voinovich had declared a state of emergency
for a total of 14 counties.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Tennessee remained under a flash-flood watch and

<P>
ATHENS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Today has been a "black Monday" for
the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) as share prices took their biggest
dive ever in the ASE's history.
</P>
<P>
The general price index fell 7.4 percent, closing at 1,206.54
points, with turnover totaling just 16.7 billion drachmas (about
66.8 million U.S. dollars), compared with 1,303.63 points last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
ASE sources attribute the drop, which they say was exaggerated,
to statements by President of the Capital Market Commission
Stavros Thomadakis, who expressed concern about the creation of a
climate of "unfair games and speculation" on ASE following recent
surges in trading last Wednesday.They say the statements had a
negative effect on the mood of the market.
</P>
<P>
During a three-day boom early last week, the general index broke
the 1,400 mark barrier and recorded record turnover of over 40
million drachmas (160 million U.S. dollars) before the dive on
Thursday.

CAIRO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait inaugurated an international data and
technology exhibition "Info 97" today to have a wide variety of
computers, sophisticated and applied softwares and office systems
on display.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Minister of Communication Jasem Mohammad Al-Oun told
reporters after the inauguration ceremony at Kuwait International
Fair ground that "such exhibitions reflect Kuwait's bright image
and its keenness on keeping up with modern technology."
</P>
<P>
He said that Kuwait was among the leading states in
establishing such exhibitions in order to provide various age
segment of the society with their interests.
</P>
<P>
The "Info 97" exhibition which will last until March 13, displays
products of 48 Kuwaiti, the United Arab Emirates and Iranian
companies specialized in assembling and marketing computers and
its accessories.
</P>
<P>
It provides a comprehensive coverage of modern technology
regarding personal computers, programs, training, consultary,
office systems and security systems.
</P>
<P>
The computer market in Kuwait started to significantly
flourishing since 1992, especially in 1996 after the internet
was introduced to the country.
</P>
<P>
One of the organizers said they expected to receive around
30,000 domestic and foreign visitors who would "take advantage
of the exhibition's facilities."
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, the state-owned
company in charge of oil products marketing, said in a statement
today that it would change the prices of its liquid petroleum gas,
propane and butane this month.
</P>
<P>
It said propane gas price would be reduced to 270 U.S. dollars
per tonne from 320 dollars, while butane gas price would stand at
277 dollars per tonne compared with 305 dollars per tonne in
February.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in liquid petroleum gas prices was due to a
decrease in demand in the international market, especially from
the Far East, Europe and Japan, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in demand was because of the end of winter
in most of these countries.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- A two-day seminar on cooperation in the oil
field between the oil-rich Kuwait and oil-importing country Japan
ended here today with a series of recommendations for the
promotion of the bilateral cooperation relations.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Petroleum Corporation's international relations director
Abdel Majeed Al-Shatti said that during the seminar, both sides
focused on the need to promote relations between Kuwait and Japan
in all oil-related fields.
</P>
<P>
He said the seminar covered the issue of new Japanese
specifications for oil products, such as unleaded fuel, which
will be produced in Kuwait early 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese center, which is considered one of the most
important centers in Japan in the field of research,
proposed a joint project on means of dealing with oil lakes.
</P>
<P>
Japan imports 60 percent of its purchased oil from
Gulf countries and it is expected to climb to 80 percent
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
A series of seminars between the two sides to exchange points
of view and information in the field of oil industries would be
followed, Al-Shatti said.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The number of housing starts in Israel dropped
16.7 percent to 52,870 last year from 63,470 in 1995, the Central
Bureau of Statistics in Israel announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the decline was in the public sector, where there
were 19.040 starts, down 31 percent from 1995. But housing
constructions completions increased 28 percent last year to
48,880, the largest rise being in the public sector which
doubled to 15,670.
</P>
<P>
The housing market was expected to suffer from a continued
slowdown this year, reflecting the decline in new housing
starts in 1996. Bank Tefahot forcasts new housing starts would

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkey Agree to Get Rid of Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Ankara and Tehran agreed here today
that necessary measures will be taken to get rid of the diplomatic
crisis from the expulsion of ambassadors by both sides.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed in a statement by Ali Tuygan, special envoy
of Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, shortly after his meeting
with Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish envoy delivered a message from the Turkish
president to Rafsanjani during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure to Ankara, Tuygan said "We discussed
recent problems in our relations and we have agreed that
necessary measures should be taken."
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to see such problems again in the future," the
envoy was quoted by a Turkish diplomat as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tuygan described the meeting with the Iranian president and
other officials as "fruitful," but he declined to give the content
of the message from his president or the reply from Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Tuygan, who arrived here Sunday morning in a bid to remove the
trouble in the Ankara-Tehran relations, left here tonight for
home.
</P>
<P>
However, an informed source said that the message is in
connection with Iran's retaliatory move in expelling Turkish
ambassador and consul general.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry demanded Saturday that Turkish
Ambassador Osman Koruturk and Consul General Ufuk Ozsancak leave
Iran in a tit-for-tat move against the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish consul general in Iran's northwestern city of
Orumieh was declared by the Iranian government as "persona
non-grata" for his involvement in activities inconsistent with
diplomatic norms.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Turkish government expelled the Iranian
Ambassador and two other diplomats because of their statements
about Islam and fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Iran's parliament Sunday reviewed the latest development in
Iran-Turkey relations. Alaeddin Boroujerdi, Deputy Foreign
Minister for Asia-Pacific Affairs, and Iranian Ambassador to
Turkey Mohammad Reza Baqeri presented reports on the latest
developments on the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Rowhani, secretary of Supreme National Security Council,
said that the problems arising in Tehran-Ankara relations have
been caused by U.S.-engineered plots.
</P>
<P>
Rowhani, also vice-speaker of the Parliament, expressed his
hope that the two friendly and brotherly countries would
continue their relations in a cordial and desirable manner.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zairean government and
rebel movement will hopefully have reached a formal agreement on
resolving the on-going conflict in eastern Zaire by March 19,
South African Foreign Affairs Minister Aflred Nzo said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria, Nzo said some formal
agreement will have been reached between Zairean President Mobutu
Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila before the
proposed regional summit, scheduled on March 19 in Nairobi,
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Civil fighting between Mobutu's government force and rebel
fighters in eastern Zaire since last October has caused an exodus
of million of refugees in the region.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Mobutu's special envoy Honore Ngbanda and Kabila
arrived in South Africa and held separate talks with senior
government officials, including President Nelson Mandela and Nzo,
in a bid to seek a lasting solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nzo said a report on peace talks in South Africa
last week will be made available at the Nairobi summit, where the
tense situation in Zaire will be discussed with the expected
attendance of Mobutu and Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Nzo also confirmed that the Organization of African Unity had
decided at its recent Council of Ministers meeting to hold an
extraordinary summit in Lome, Togo on March 25 and 26 to discuss
further steps to broker a peace settlement in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He further stressed there is no alternative to people in
dispute than to sit down and discuss their problems.

<P>
BONN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A survey released here today found
that most of the Germans are pessimistic about the planned single
European currency -- the Euro, saying that it would pose a risk
for the German economy as well as for their personal well-beings.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted jointly by the Institute for Marketing of
the Muenster University and the Bielefelder Market Research
Institute showed that only 20 percent of the over 2,000

<HEADLINE> Gulf Countries Denounce Israel's Housing Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The six Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states today called on the Israeli government to
"immediately stop implementing its dangerous decision to establish
Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
GCC Secretary General Jamil Hujailan said in a statement in
Saudi capital city of Riyadh that the decision posed an extreme
threat to the peace process in the Middle East, saying it was a
warning that violence and atmosphere of tension would return to
the area.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision was a violation of international laws and
Oslo agreements and would abort the Israeli commitment to solving
the issue of Jerusalem in the final stage of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government last week ratified a decision to
construct 6,500 new housing units in the Har Homa (Jabal Abu
Ghneim) settlement in Jerusalem which was occupied by Israel
following the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
The decision drew the resentment of Palestinians and Arab
Islamic world and it was also opposed by the United States and
European states.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians staged protests and appealed to the world to
block the project they said threatened the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The pine-covered Jabal Abu Ghneim, known by Israelis as Har
Homa, is located next to the Arab village of Um Tuba. Israel
confiscated their portion of the mountain in 1991 to build 6,500
homes for Jews.
</P>
<P>
The official called on the Israeli government to halt all
decisions and resolutions aimed at changing the political,
geographic, historic, demographic and legal status of East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The statement also recalled the GCC firm stances supporting
the accomplishment of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
GCC is composed of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> Israel Continues Bombardment in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces continued today
bombardment at guerrilla targets in south Lebanon when a
five-nation committee is holding a meeting at Lebanon's border
town of Naqoura to consider an Israeli complaint against
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said that the Israeli
occupation forces in the so-called "security zone" fired
artilleries at a number of targets in Iglim Al-Toffah,
a mountain area some 60 kilometers southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery shelled the hill of Jabel Al-Rafih and
vicinities of Sujoud and Rihan in the heights, which is often
used by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas as a springboard to launch
attacks at the Israeli self-carved buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were caused in the bombardment, the anonymous
security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
announced that they attacked a foot patrol of the South Lebanon
Army (SLA) militia backed by Israel this afternoon, killing and
wounding several militiamen.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of
Hezbollah, said that its fighters detonated a bomb targeting the
SLA patrol in the Jezzine area.
</P>
<P>
Sawt Jenoub Radio, organ of the SLA militia, confirmed that a
vehicle of the militia was destroyed in the bombing attack on
the Saidoun road this afternoon, and two militiamen inside were
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Israeli jet fighters rocketed Jabel Safi in Iglim
Al-Toffah without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
The raiding warplanes drew anti-aircraft fire from Hezbollah
and Lebanese army gunners stationed in the area, but no direct
hits were reported.
</P>
<P>
The daily trade of fire in south Lebanon continued as the
cease-fire monitoring committee comprising representatives of
France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the United States is holding
a meeting in the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping forces.
</P>
<P>
The committee started the meeting at 11:00 a.m. (0900 GMT) to
look into a complaint filed by Israel claiming that Lebanese
guerrillas fired from a civilian area at an Israeli patrol last
Friday, thus violating the cease-fire understanding Lebanon and
Israel reached in April, 1996.
</P>
<P>
One Israeli soldier was killed and three others were wounded
in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "April understanding," under which the monitoring
committee was set up, demands civilians on both sides of the
border be kept apart from military operations.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth meeting of the five-state committee since
this year, and the 14th since its first meeting in August,
1996.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Lebanese National News Agency said today that
until today, the committee has received 14 complaints,
including six lodged by Israel and eight by Lebanon, in which
the two sides accused each other of breaching the cease-fire
understanding.
</P>
<P>
Since the truce was reached last April, seven Lebanese
civilians have been killed in Israeli retaliatory operations in
revenge for guerrilla attacks in the border strip.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by the U.S. and France, the cease-fire understanding
ended a 17-day Israeli blitz against Hezbollah militants in
south Lebanon, in which some 200 Lebanese, mainly civilians,
were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state established the 1,100 "security zone" in
1985 to protect northern Israel from cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Former CIA Agent Pleads Guilty to Selling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Harold J. Nicholson, the
highest-ranking official of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) ever charged with espionage, pleaded guilty today to selling
U.S. secrets to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports quoted Nicholson as telling a U.S. district
judge in Alexandria, Virginia, that "I plead guilty, your honor."
He admitted to a single charge of conspiracy to commit espionage.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, 46, was the second national security official to
plead guilty to spying for Russia in the past few days. Last week,
Earl Edwin Pitts, a former FBI counter-intelligence agent, pleaded
guilty to selling classified information.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, who was arrested last November, admitted that he
sold Russian spies documents, photo negatives and information
relating to the national defense of the United States to the
Russians for some 180,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.S. District Court Judge James Cacheris accepted
Nicholson's plea and set sentencing for June. Nicholson could
receive up to a life sentence and a 250,000 dollar fine.
</P>
<P>
However, under a plea agreement, the sentence could be reduced
to a range of 21 years and 10 months to 27 years and three months.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials and attorneys said that Nicholson, like
Pitts, sought to avoid a life sentence by agreeing to plead guilty
and cooperate with authorities for further investigation of the
case.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, a 16-year veteran CIA agent, served as the agency's
operations officer at several foreign posts. Before he returned to
to the U.S. to train recruits, he was station chief in Romania and
deputy chief in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
His latest assignment was a branch chief in the Middle East
division of CIA's counterterrorism center.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of providing Russia names and planned
assignments abroad of the new recruits he had been working with
from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson was the second CIA agent in two years to plead on to
the Soviets and got a life sentence.

<HEADLINE> Protest over Nuclear Storage in Northern Germany, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- People in northern Germany set a
barricade on fire today in protest over the storage of nuclear
waste in their area, said reports from the town of Dannenberg,
Lower Saxony.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of protesters gathered in and around Dannenberg with
several thousand police standing by. People clogged with tractors
and barricades the road linking the town with Gorleben, 15
kilometers away, which is the final destination of the trainload
of nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
Protesters also dug a trench in the middle of the road, which
was 10 meters wide and two meters deep.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 16 people were detained in a clash with
police at the village of Quickborn, where a road was blocked by
several hundred people.
</P>
<P>
The train carrying six containers of highly-radioactive spent
nuclear fuel rods arrived at Lower Saxony this afternoon across
from Baden-Wuerttemberg state after several delays.
</P>
<P>
Police had to remove protesters, iron bars and other obstacles
from railway tracks.
</P>
<P>
There were also bomb threats. A police spokesman voiced concern
over the potential for violence from extremists among the about
10,000 peaceful protesters.
</P>
<P>
The containers of nuclear waste from southern Germany and
France will be reloaded on heavy lorries at Dannenberg on Tuesday
for Wednesday transportation to an underground storage depot at
Gorleben.
</P>
<P>
Security cost for the nuclear transport is estimated around 100
million marks (60 million U.S. dollars), with 30,000 police
officers mobilized to shield the shipment -- the biggest police
operation in postwar Germany.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Envoys to UN United for Common Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- West African ambassadors to the
United Nations have formed an organization aimed at protecting
the collective interests of the sub-region at the world body, the
News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The organization, called the ECOWAS Group of Ambassadors to
the UN, was established at a meeting of the representatives of
all the 16 members of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) in New York over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the group, which may eventually seek an
observer status at the UN, is an idea "whose time has come" and
received enthusiastic response of ECOWAS ambassadors, the report
said, quoting the Nigerian ambassador to the UN Ibrahim Gambari.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a goodwill message to the group by
Nigeria's Head of State General Sani Abacha, in his capacity as
the ECOWAS chairman, was highlighted at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the message, the ECOWAS chairman expressed the hope that
the meeting will lead to the establishment of an effective and
permanent pressure group at the UN to complement "our efforts to
achieve the purposes of our community."
</P>
<P>
He listed a number of areas in which the group could assert
its influence, including taking the lead in obtaining urgent
financial, material and political support of the international
community to supplement ECOWAS' efforts in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
As a sub-regional organization, ECOWAS has been working
towards an end of the seven-year-old civil war in Liberia, which
is also a member country.
</P>
<P>
A peace accord was signed by former rival warring factions of
Liberia last August. According to the agreement, general
elections is scheduled to be held in May this year in war-ravaged
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Abacha also charged the group to rally support for
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, an ECOWAS citizen, and to seize the
opportunity of his tenure to ensure that the interests of the
sub-region, especially in the socio-economic activities of the
UN, are well protected, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian ambassador to the UN, who convened
and hosted the meeting, Nigeria and Benin will work out the
modalities for the organization and submit them to the next
meeting of the group.
</P>
<P>
The time and date of the group's second meeting is not
disclosed. But Gambari said the West African envoys will work
to implment the "guidance" provided in Abacha's message.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece is watching developments in
neighboring Albania with great concern and has appealed to all
sides to act with restraint, Undersecretary of the Greek Foreign
Ministry Yiannos Kranidiotis said today.
</P>
<P>
There is a large ethnic Greek monority in the south of the
neighboring country. At the same time, Greece fears that tens of
thousands of Albanians might try to flee over its border, making
Athens especially conscious of the explosive situation in Albania.
</P>
<P>
"We are watching, with attention and concern, the situation and
we want a return to stability and normalcy in the neighboring
country which is our friend," Kranidiotis told an emergency news
conference. "We are ready to deal with whatever irregular
developments may arise. We are in constant contact with the
Defense Ministry and with the Ministry of Public Order. There is
constant readiness on the part of the military and the police at
the border."
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry team is monitoring Albania continuously and
is in contact with the Greek embassy in Tirana and the consulate
in the town of Gjirokaster, Kranidiotis said.
</P>
<P>
Athens also urged the European Union to hold an emergency
meeting to deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday we made a proposal for the foreign ministers of
southeastern Europe to meet, with the aim of adopting a plan of
action for Albania," Alternate Foreign Minister George Papandreou
told reporters. He also said that last week Greece had called on
representatives of the EU, the United States, Russia and Balkan
countries to meet in Athens to work out how they could help
Albania and Bulgaria.

Mwiru urged the private businessmen to participate in
management and development of the utility sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the participants to the workshop to address
themselves to the question of ownership, adding that they should
explore all types of ownership or operational arrangements that
are likely to deliver the required results.
</P>
<P>
"The important objective we want to achieve is consistent and
adequate availability of infrastructure services at an acceptable
quality level and at affordable prices," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mwiru further called upon the participants to clearly
elaborate on the regulation of firms in the utility and
infrastructure sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister for state reiterated the government's
commitment to bringing about increased efficiency of the former
public enterprises through increased participation of the private
capital and management in the development process in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the thrust of reforms in the country and the policy
changes go beyond merely providing for corrective measures on the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The government's reform policies under implementation are
aimed at distancing the government day-to-day operational issues
in the productive and service delivery sectors and leaving itself
with major role of overall economic policy formulation and
creation of a conducive environment for investment.

A press release issued here today by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs said that the ministerial conference will be preceded by
a meeting of senior officials.
</P>

DAR ES SALAAM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa today commended the Japanese government for having
all along positively supported his country's efforts towards
self-reliance since independence.
</P>
<P>
In a discussion with visiting special assistant to the
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan Michio Mizoguchi here this

in the country will be eliminated by the people through their own
initiatives and efforts.

The president insisted that it is being made clear that the
objective of his government is to maximize Tanzania's natural and
human resources in order to achieve a self-sustaining economy,
while external assistance should only be considered as supportive
to the home-grown efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese official, who is in the country for high level
discussions with the Tanzanian government on economic
co-operation, assured the president that his country will always
be Tanzania's reliable partner.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Clinton Discuss Mideast Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
held an hour of talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the
Oval Office discussing a wide range of issues concerning the
Middle East peace process, the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on the situation after the Israeli government
decided to build a new Jewish settlement in Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"They talked at great length... on the Israeli decision to
build in Har Homa (Arab east Jerusalem). The chairman was clearly
very concerned and emotional on the subject," White House
spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters at a briefing. "The
president certainly understood the basis of that emotion."
</P>
<P>
Before his talks with Clinton, Arafat told reporters at the
White House that the Israeli move to build Jewish homes in east
Jerusalem, snatched by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war, was
designed "to squeeze and to isolate Jerusalem" and build
settlements at the entrance of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
"The target is to squeeze and to isolate Jerusalem, but at the
same time to build settlements at the entrance of Bethlehem," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Siding with Arafat, Clinton criticized Israel's decision for
the housing project in east Jerusalem, saying the move could only
"build mistrust" between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"I would have preferred the decision not have been made because
I don't think it builds confidence. It builds mistrust," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli move to establish Jewish neighborhood in Arab east
Jerusalem was seen by the Palestinians as an attempt to cement
Israel's hold over the entire city.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis have declared an undivided Jerusalem would become
its capital in spite of oppositions from the Arab world as well as
the international community.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want to establish an independent state with
Arab east Jerusalem as their capital. And the Israeli move
certainly provoked strong oppositions from their Palestinian
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Tensions are high in the West Bank with Palestinians shutting
down their shops and schools in a general strike to protest the
Israeli housing project.
</P>
<P>
Public transportation came to a halt and workers stayed home
from their jobs throughout the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he was "sure" that Clinton "will push forward to
prevent" the Israeli move to build Jewish housing.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton sidestepped questions on Jerusalem's status,
reiterating instead the long-standing U.S. position that the issue
needed to be worked out in final talks between the Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe, now that the parties have reached the
agreement they reached in 1993, and they have made this the final
status issue, that the United States can serve any useful purpose
by saying, or especially by doing, anything which seems to
prejudge what should be a final status issue between the parties,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides are at "a difficult moment" in the peace
process, "but I think we can work through it and go forward."

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Minister for
Industries and Trade of Tanzania, Shamim Khan today called on
local manufacturers to do some efforts for diversification from
agriculture to set up food processing industries for export.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day workshop on future development of
Tanzanian agro-processing industry here, Khan said Tanzania
should also have emphasis on quality and cost effectiveness to
acquire a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy minister, local manufacturers are at
present facing strong competition from foreign manufactured
products.
</P>
<P>
"They not only face stern competition on export markets in
Europe and the US, but also in neighboring countries of Kenya,
Uganda, Zimbabwe and South Africa," the deputy minister said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop organized by the Small Industries Development
Organization (SIDO) of Tanzania in collaboration with the
Commonwealth Secretariat, is aimed at enhancing agro-food
processing in the country.
</P>
<P>
Topics to be discussed at the workshop include the
introduction of quality systems into the food chain, investment
needs of modern manufacturing infrastructure, the increase of the
workforce and women participation in the food processing industry
in the country.

LUANDA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Angola's socio-economic
development will benefit all countries in the world, said former
US representative to the United Nations Andrew Yong today here.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a luncheon attended by many members of
parliament and government officials of Angola, adding that the
socio-economic development can only be achieved on basis of peace
and national reconciliation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he urged Angolans to reach understanding for their
country's real development.
</P>
<P>
Angola's resources are richer than any other country in
southern Africa, hence its future will be linked with southern
Africa and even the United States and Europe, Yong noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that Angola needs assistance from international
community, particularly the US, to realize its economic
development goal.
</P>
<P>
Yong arrived here on February 27 to start his working visit to

<HEADLINE> BMW Signals Interest in Rolls-Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Bernd Pischetsrieder, boss of German
carmaker BMW, made the so far clearest signal today in a press
interview to indicate interest in Britain's luxury carmaker
Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper Die Welt quoted him as saying that "the
brand name Rolls-Royce would fit very well into our product
lineup." The BMW boss was however quick to note that Rolls-Royce
was not currently up for sale.
</P>
<P>
Pischetsrieder's remarks were so far the clearest signals that
showed BMW's interest in the British carmaker.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1994, BMW agreed with the British company
Vickers, to which Rolls-Royce is subordinate, to build engines for
Rolls-Royce and to cooperate in engin research and development.
</P>
<P>
BMW is already involved in the British auto industry with its
purchase of Rover. Pischetsrieder told Die Welt that Rover would
be profitable again in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the BMW-Rover share of the world market will
rise to 2.0 percent from the 1.8 percent at present.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges Peacekeeping Force to Leave Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain said today that the
troops sent into Bosnia by the Western allies should leave
together, indicating differences with the U.S. on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"I regard the operation that we're undertaking as being a NATO
operation," British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo told
reporters before meeting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen at
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
Cohen had repeatedly affirmed that the U.S. troops in Bosnia
will surely leave by mid-1998 when the mandate of the peacekeeping
force expires. He insists the Europeans continue the job of
peacekeeping if needed.
</P>
<P>
However, Portillo said, "we went in together, we are working
together, and we shall leave together."
</P>
<P>
The United States contributes some 8,000 troops to the
so-called Stabilization Force in Bosnia. Britain, France and other
European countries are also major contributors.
</P>
<P>
Besides the peacekeeping issues in Bosnia, the two defense
secretaries are expected to focus on the enlargement of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Portillo said that Russia, which is strongly opposed to the
enlargement, now had to face the reality.
</P>
<P>
"I think Russia now recognizes that there will be new members
of NATO, and Russia is now engaged constructively in creating with
us a new NATO-Russia charter," Portillo said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that can be a very important part of the new security
architecture of Europe," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Complains of Bogging Down of Oil-for-food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today complained of a delay
by the U.N. in granting the oil-for-food contracts, saying only
nine out of the 222 deals submitted have been approved.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here, Commerce Minister Mohammed Mehdi
Saleh attributed the bogging down of the oil-for-food program to
power politics.
</P>
<P>
He said that the volume of the 222 contracts Iraq signed with
foreign companies and submitted to the U.N. Iraqi Sanctions
Committee for approval total about 673.9 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil every six months starting from last December to buy food,
medicine and other daily necessities badly needed in Iraq during
the on-going six-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The nine approved contracts, which are valued at 253 million
dollars, include three for wheat, another three for baby milk and
the other three separately for rice, medicine and tea.
</P>
<P>
The first shipment of wheat by a French company will hopefully
arrive in Iraq by the end of March, said the minister, adding that
the distribution will begin as soon as the shipment comes.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official accused the United States and Britain of
deliberately delaying the approval of the contracts, saying the
two countries are responsible for the deaths of Iraqi people
during the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq after its August 1990
invasion of Kuwait. It is reported that in the past several years
more than one million Iraqis died of diseases and malnutrition,
most of whom are women, children and the aged.
</P>
<P>
But the United States and Britain, both permanent Security
Council members, remain deeply suspicious of Iraq. They insist
that the U.N. imposes tight controls to make sure the supplies
are distributed fairly and not used for military purpose,
observers here noted.
</P>
<P>
Contracts to sell food and medicine must be approved
unanimously by the Iraqi Sanctions committee, consisting of
representatives of all the 15 Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
Saleh also criticized Japan for following the U.S. "inhumane
policy" in the implementation of the "oil-for-food" deal.

<HEADLINE> Belgian PM Asks Renault to Seek Alternative to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene today called on the French auto producer Renault to find an
"alternative" to its plan to close a plant in Vilvoorde, Belgium,
which will result in the mass lay-off of 3,100 workers.
</P>
<P>
Renault's plan to close its Vilvoorde plant triggered an angry
protest from all walks of life in Belgium, and 4,000 workers of the
Vilvoorde plant demonstrated today in Brussels to protest the plan.
</P>
<P>
Asked by an interviewer of the French television channel two
whether Belgium is considering retaliatory measures against France,
Dehaene said, "We have not gone that far."
</P>
<P>
"What we want for the moment is that there should be the
concertation, that we look for alternatives and that one does not
make the closure point-blank, which we don't understand," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he understands the anger expressed by Belgian
workers who, he said, could ask themselves: "We have accepted the
measures of flexibility, to what good does not make to work in
concertation with Renault for arriving at this result?"
</P>
<P>
Dehaene also warned that among the Belgian workers and in the
public opinion of Belgium, "there is a reaction which risks to take
the form" of a retaliation against France.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the debate of depth could take place, that this
decision could be reviewed and that one could return Renault
Vilvoorde in the entire Renault," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene has written a letter to the European Commission asking
the latter to verify if Renault's decision conforms with European
social legislations.
</P>
<P>
The decision to close Vilvoorde plant has also been condemned by
French unionists, who are afraid that Renault's restructuring plan
would result in a mass lay-off of 3,000 workers in France.
</P>
<P>
Renault has decided to cut its present 12 assembly lines in
Europe to eight by 1998, because of a 5 billion franc (1 billion
U.S. dollar) loss in 1996 and fierce competition in the European
auto market.
</P>
<P>
Several unions of France, Belgium and Spain have called for a
one-hour strike by Renault workers in these countries Friday to
protest the restructuring plan.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian PM: Giant Projects Ensure Better Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri said today his country's giant canal construction
projects will bring better life for the Egyptian people.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting the construction site of the Toshki Canal in
the South Valley, Ganzouri said that to have a better life, 62
million Egyptians have to move out of the narrow, old Nile valley,
which accounts for only 4 percent of Egypt's total area.
</P>
<P>
The two giant projects, Al-Salam canal in the northeast and
Toshki canal in the south will be vital in providing water for the
cultivation of vast land in Sinai and Western Desert and building
new communities in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The various projects will add about 25 percent to the 3.2
million hectares of existing cultivated land in the country in the
next 20 years, he was quoted by Egypt's Middle East news agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The development of the south, which represents 48 percent of
Egypt's area, costs 33.4 billion U.S. dollars in annual
investments.
</P>
<P>
He said several contracts were signed for the establishment
of cement factories, a plastic pipes factory and a hotel in the
new valley area.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of problems in the old valley will be resolved once
people start to move to the south," he said.
</P>
<P>
In January Egypt inaugurated the Toshki project designed to
draw water from the Nile to create millions of hectares of
agricultural land in the parched Western Desert.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy PM Criticizes UN Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD,March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz criticized here today chief of United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on Iraq Rolf Ekeus for his recent
contradictory remarks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Iraqi News Agency (INA), Aziz said
that Rolf Ekeus, chairman of UNSCOM on dismantling Iraqi mass
destruction weapons, made some contradictory statements, adding
that in his capacity as a U.N. official, Ekeus should have
carried out his mission on the basis of "objectivity and
neutrality."
</P>
<P>
While in Baghdad, Ekeus aired multi-colored statements
suggestive of positivity, whereas in Kuwait his statements are in
favor of Kuwaiti rulers, said the deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that during his last visit to Moscow, which
came prior to his regular bi-monthly visit to Baghdad, Ekeus
spoke in such a balanced tone harmonious with the Russian
discreet stance and yet his London statements were virtually in
line with the British anti-Iraqi climate.
</P>
<P>
"To deal with such contradictory views, we have often put
them forth for discussion with the Security Council
member-states," Aziz stressed.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the position of the Security Council member-states
in this respect, Aziz said some members like the U.S. and Britain
are pleased with and support what Ekeus said. However, he said,
others "are seeking objectivity, and it is to those members we
intend to convey the facts."
</P>
<P>
Aziz appealed to the UNSCOM to submit a fair report to the
Security Council without hesitation, which would consequently
usher in implementing U.N. resolution 687 which calls for lifting
the embargo on Iraq so that it can purchase essential supplies
on condition that all dangerous weapons are removed from the
country.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM has refused to lift crippling economic sanctions on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until it is satisfied with
Iraqi compliance.
</P>
<P>
Aziz left for Moscow today, where he will discuss with Russian
leaders the work of the UNSCOM and the necessity for the
U.N. committee to wrap up its work as soon as possible, according
to the INA.

<HEADLINE> Medical Team Finds US Embargo Hurts Cubans' Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. medical team returning
from Cuba found that the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba has had a
devastating impact on the health of ordinary people in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Our medical delegation found the tightening of the embargo has
had unintended consequences on the health of the Cuban people,
including unnecessary suffering and deaths," Dr. Peter Bourne,
board chairman of the American Association for World Health, told
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The association in a report said that the tightening of the
embargo in 1992 had blocked Cuba's access to drugs and medical
technology made by U.S. companies or their European subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
It said that the embargo, imposed in the early 1960s to isolate
the Cuban government and tightened in 1992, made it virtually
impossible for Cuba to get spare parts for medical equipment and
denied it access to important drugs.
</P>
<P>
The report found that in 1991, Cuban doctors had regular access
to about 1,300 medicines, but that has now dropped to fewer than
900.
</P>
<P>
The medical team also found that the water supply in Cuba is
made with U.S.-made pipes and equipment. Because of the shortage
of equipment supply, water cleanliness has deteriorated,
contributing to a rise in diarrheal diseases, typhoid and other
water-borne diseases.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed up Housing Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build 1.2 billion
sq m of urban housing between 1996 and 2000 in a bid to turn the
industry into a new economic growth point, Minister of
Construction Hou Jie said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) period is an important
one for China's urban development and housing construction," Hou
said at a press conference in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
"China will use the macro control means to achieve coordinated
urban economic and social development and to accelerate the
construction of housing to make it a new hot consumption spot and
a new economic growth point," he said.
</P>
<P>
To that end, China will build an average annual 240 million sq
m of housing in the urban areas in the years before the end of the
century, raising the per capita living space of urban Chinese to
nine sq m.
</P>
<P>
The minister revealed that fixed-asset investment in urban
public engineering facilities will total 480 billion to 600
billion yuan in the five years to 2000.
</P>
<P>
China will also build 2.79 billion sq m of housing in the
countryside and in rural towns to speed up urbanization, Hou told
journalists.
</P>
<P>
He said that China scored great achievements in housing
construction since its founding in 1949, especially since the
launching of the economic refrom and opening-up drive in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Between 1979 and 1996, China invested 1137.9 billion yuan in
urban housing construction. The rural areas registered an average
annual housing construction of 500 to 700 million sq m during the
period.
</P>
<P>
During the period, a total of 13.8 billion sq m of housing was
built, 2.8 billion sq m in the urban area and 11 billion sq m in
the rural area. As a result, 150 million Chinese families moved
into new houses.
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, the minister pointed out, a housing shortage
still exists, seriously in some areas.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is yet to be improved fundamentally," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that currently China has three million families with a
per head living space of less than four sq m while the per capita
living space of 19 provinces and autonomous regions is below the
national average.
</P>
<P>
In Chinese cities, about 40 percent of the houses are not
adequately equipped and another 30 million sq m of housing is in
dangerous conditions, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
"China's immense population of 1.2 billion and an annual net
increase of 14 million have resulted in a great pressure of demand
for housing," he said.
</P>
<P>
For reasons such as irrational pricing, China now has more than
50 million sq m of completed building space that are left vacant,
including 30 million sq m of housing space, he said, adding that
the government will take proper measures to make it easier and
cheaper for individuals to buy or rent houses.
</P>
<P>
"The central government will make some concessions on taxes.
Local governments will make some concessions on charges for the
use of the land. The banks will make some concessions on
interests. And the developers will make some concessions on
profits," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
Other measures Hou mentioned include the provision of more
mortgage loans and the introduction of payment by instalments.
</P>
<P>
Hou's deputy Tan Qingliang said that China is paying greater
attention to housing quality while increasing the construction
area.
</P>
<P>
Another deputy Li Zhendong said that China currently has a
common public fund of 38 billion yuan for housing.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Press Urged to Safeguard Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese press was urged today
to work for stability and promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In a panel discussion with members of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
today, Ding Guangen, a member of the Political Bureau of the
Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee, called on the
Chinese press to do a good job this year, focusing on two major
events -- Hong Kong's return to China and the convocation of the
Party's 15th national congress.
</P>
<P>
Ding also called on the country's press and publishing circles
to work hard to promote the country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Ding, also head of the CPC Central Committee's Propaganda
Department, said the country's press and publishing circles should
adhere to the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics put forward by Deng Xiaoping and the party's basic
line and work to provide an ideological guarantee for reform,
opening up and the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Ding said Deng Xiaoping, who passed away on 19th of last month,
paid great attention to reporting and publishing work and gave a
series of instructions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized that the press and the
publishing industry must serve reform, opening-up and the
modernization drive and that newspapers, radio stations and TV
stations should regard the promotion of social stability and
enhancing young people's socialist consciousness as their
regular, basic task," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged people in the press and publishing circles to turn
grief into strength to make further progress under the leadership
of the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core.

<HEADLINE> Legislators on Protection, Development of Marine Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature,
have submitted a dozen bills concerning the protection and
development of the country's marine resources.
</P>
<P>
The legislators suggested that a system of maritime laws be
perfected and special administrative bodies be established as soon
as possible to improve the current situation in the management of
the country's exploration of marine resources.
</P>
<P>
In May of 1996, China joined the UN Convention on Maritime Law,
according to which the sea area under China's jurisdiction
increased to about 3 million sq km from 380,000 sq km.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Du Bilan, a noted oceanographer, said that with the
development of science and technology, the mankind is attaching
more attention to seas and oceans, which cover 71 percent of the
global surface.
</P>
<P>
"The one who owns the sea owns more wealth," she noted. "For a
country like China, which has a population of 1.2 billion, to
speed up orderly development of marine resources is an important
way to achieve a sustainable growth."
</P>
<P>
However, marine and environment experts attending the current
NPC session noted that in China's coastal areas there exist
problems such as explorations of sea areas in violation of the law
of nature, which are detrimental to marine resources and
environment.
</P>
<P>
Each year, they said, the country lost several billion yuan as
a result of deterioration of marine resources caused by pollutant
discharges alone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, irregular development of marine cultivation caused
negative effects on sea embankments and navigation courses, and
rampant fishing depleted aquatic resources, which resulted in
problems, they said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Du Bilan said: "It has become imperative to strengthen
the comprehensive maritime control."
</P>
<P>
She and other legislators suggested that the country take
prompt steps to complete its maritime legal system, so as to
define the state ownership of the sea, and put an end to
activities for wilful use of sea areas and beaches by some
departments and individuals in the coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Apart from eight laws concerning maritime affairs already
adopted or being discussed by the NPC, they said, it is also
necessary to formulate other laws, such as the law on paid use of
sea areas, and the law on the management of marine resources
development.
</P>
<P>
The legislators also set forth a series of advices, which
include the setting up of a "national maritime committee" headed
by senior leaders of the State Council, and a "state bureau of
maritime management" jointed run by the National Bureau of
Oceanography and the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the National Bureau of Oceanography showed that
between 1980 and 1995, China's maritime economic output rose at an
average annual rate of 28 percent, and reached 220 billion yuan in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that by the year 2000, the total value of
maritime economic output is expected to account for more than five
percent of China's gross national product.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Issues New ID Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today gave the kickstart for emitting the new identity cards which
are issued according to the state-of-the-art techniques, carrying
the national serial numbers of all citizens.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection to the Civilian Affairs Department where
the new system is installed, Mubarak filled in the application
form and obtained his new ID, according to the Egyptian MENA news
agency.
</P>
<P>
In a few days, more Egyptians could get their ID cards, which
reportedly would be hard to forge but easy to distinguish the
namesakes.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 45 million Egyptians are expected to obtain their ID
cards from a number of mobile electronic registration offices
massed all over the country within three years.
</P>
<P>
The new national code system applys a unique number that the
person will have from his birth to his death.
</P>
<P>
It provides an easy approach to identify people with similar
names by including 14 figures for their birthdays, governorate
codes, insurance codes made by the computer.
</P>
<P>
The new ID machines can issue the code in less than one minute
according to the latest international specifications which
guarantee protection against forgery.
</P>
<P>
The pattern of the Egyptian ID, which employed the latest
German technology, is so very desirable that even the European
Union member states are eager to obtain for issuing similar ones
to the EU nations, according to local press.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt has purchased about 75 electronically-equipped
vehicles which will tour various districts to collect IDs and
issue documents for citizens.
</P>
<P>
This project will enable Egypt for the first time to make an
accurate mapping of its demographic data and distribution and thus
to facilitate the government's decision-making process.

<HEADLINE> HK Reaffirms Fair Charges for New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Airport Authority
(AA) today rejected claims made by the International Air Transport
 Association (IATA) that the airport charge levels at the Chek Lop
 Kok New Airport would harm Hong Kong's role as an aviation
center.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the recent figures quoted by IATA, such as an alleged
loss of one million visitors a year to Hong Kong, are highly
speculative," AA Corporate Development Director Clinton Leeks said
 today.
</P>
<P>
The AA is responsible for developing and managing the new
airport.
</P>
<P>
"Consultations with IATA and other groups over fees at the new
airport at Chek Lap Kok are still in progress," he said. "As the
level of fees has not yet been decided upon, such suggestions are
alarmist rather than helpful to the common aim, which is to
continue to develop Hong Kong's role as a center of aviation in
the region."
</P>
<P>
Leeks said the new airport's charges would be fair and
reasonable and would be based on the "user pays" principle, with
no subsidies being paid out of the public purse.
</P>
<P>
The AA would continue consultations with IATA in the fifth
round of talks on the issue, according to Leeks.
</P>
<P>
Being built on a reclaimed island in the west of Hong Kong, the
 Chek Lap Kok airport is expected to be completed in April 1998,
to replace the existing Kai Tak International Airport, whose
capacity is almost saturated.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, French Presidents to Discuss Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian and French presidents
will discuss the latest Mideast peace development in Paris,
France, French ambassador to Cairo said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian MENA news agency, Ambassador
Jean Marc Rochereau de la Sabliere hailed efforts exerted by
President Hosni Mubarak to promote the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will stop over Paris Friday en route to his March 10
visit to the U.S. capital of Washington.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day visit, Mubarak will "follow up his
consultations with French President Jacques Chirac regarding
different crucial issues," said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss the current situation in the Middle East as
well as the latest developments on the Syrian and Lebanese peace
tracks, de la Sabliere said.
</P>
<P>
"France is greatly interested in the views expressed by
President Mubarak," he added, saying that France believes that
Egypt is a major and essential partner in reinforcing peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU), especially France, played a major role
in realizing a United States-sponsored cease-fire understanding
last April which ended a 17-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ambassador criticized Israel's plan to set
up new Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and said France
considers it an obstacle hindering the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the desire expressed by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to give France a greater role in the peace
process, the French diplomat said that there is a continued dialog
between Washington and Paris in spite of some differences in
viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is playing a crucial role in the peace process, he
noted, noting that the French role is a complementary not a
competitive one.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israel are reported to have gradually retreated
from excluding Europe from the peace process in the region where
it has been the major financier.
</P>
<P>
Assuring that Europe's role would not collide with
Washington's, he urged coordinated efforts to remove all obstacles
hindering the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Europe in general and France in particular have an" effective
positive role" and such a role can "not contradict with the
American one," he added.

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi on Education, Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Senior Party official Qiao Shi
said here today China will further strengthen education and deepen
educational reform in line with the education law and the strategy
of invigorating the country with science and education.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
and chairman of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National
People's Congress (NPC), made this remark during a panel with NPC
deputies from east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
After listening to speeches by a number of deputies, Qiao
affirmed the achievements Anhui had scored in recent years, and
stressed the importance of developing China's education.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Deng Xiaoping placed much emphasis on education. As
early as two decades ago, he cited scientific and technological
progress as the key to modernization, which cannot be attained
without education," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Since the reform and opening up started in the 1970s, he said,
China's education has scored marked achievements and made great
contributions to the country's development.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, there are still many problems yet to be solved and
a lot of work to be done," he noted, adding that the new situation
has posed new challenges to education, and the further growth of
national economy and various social undertakings needs more
talents in modern science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, education should be further strengthened
in line with the strategy of invigorating China with science and
education and the education law," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Concrete measures should be adopted to increase educational
input, and both working and living conditions for teachers
improved.
</P>
<P>
"If we keep on increasing the education budget a bit every
year, it is not beyond our ability to achieve the objective set by
the State Council for educational input at the end of the
century," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that various reforms of the educational
system should be deepened, saying that to meet the demand of the
market economic structure and the modernization drive, schools
should pay more attention to the improving the students' practical
capability and general standards.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of family planning, Qiao said it is the basic national
policy of China, which cannot be further developed without an
effective birth control.
</P>
<P>
"The past years witnessed a decline in population growth, but
the task of birth control remains arduous," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would make unremitting efforts to carry
out the policy of family planning, so as to control the size of
population and improve the quality of the people.
</P>
<P>
"This will greatly benefit our country and greatly contribute
to the future generations," Qiao said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Armed Intervention in Zaire may be Necessary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said that U.N. armed intervention in eastern Zaire will
be necessary, if the warring factions in Zaire refuse to reach a
cease-fire to allow humanitarian aid to reach tens of thousands of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the weekly ``Jeune Afrique'' published
today, Annan said that armed intervention would allow the
evacuation of and save the lives of tens of thousands of Rwandan
Hutu refugees caught in the fighting between Tutsi rebels and
Zairean government troops.
</P>
<P>
``If the member states (of the United Nations Security Council)
succeeded very rapidly... in imposing a lasting ceasefire which
allows the creation of a human corridor, we don't need armed
intervention. If not, we should resort to this solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 160,000 Hutu refugees Sunday fled the refugee camp of
Tingi-Tingi, 250 kilometers southeast of the strategically key
city of Kisangani, to escape the advancing rebels led by
Laurent-Desire Kabila.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Paris last week, Annan relaunched a
U.N. appeal for the dispatch of a multi-national force to eastern
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
``Three months ago, while the question of an intervention force
was posed for the first time, these member states (of the United
Nations Security Council) told us that they did not see refugees
in eastern Zaire. Today, the reappearance of tens of thousands of
people in distress is evidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Canada scrapped a plan to send a
multi-national force to Zaire after some 600,000 Hutu refugees
suddenly returned to Rwanda from Zaire in early December.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Calls for More Attention to Agriculture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
urged governments at all levels to attach still more importance to
the agriculture development at the time of a good harvest.
</P>
<P>
"The better yields we have just harvested, the more attention
we should pay to the agriculture," said Zhu, who is also a
Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
At a panel discussion of Jilin delegation of the Fifth Session
of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), to deliberate
Premier Li Peng's government work report delivered on March 1, Zhu
said China set another record farm yield last year after a good
harvest in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the farmers'income was the biggest ever in
history, thanks to the correct policies of the Party Central
Committee and the State Council on agriculture and hard work of
relevant departments and localities, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
"However," he noted, "we should be aware of the country's weak
agricultural infrastructure and that dependence on the natural
conditions has not entirely been altered."
</P>
<P>
"We still do not dare to say that stable farm yields cannot be
maintained, for the situation differ from year to year," Zhu
noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the good harvests were not reaped nationwide in an
all-round way, he said, noting that the production of cotton and
edible oil decreased to varying extent.
</P>
<P>
"From a long-term point of view, the problem of adequate grain
production has not been resolved in China, so that we should never
be over-optimistic," Zhu warned.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should neither transfer their energy
nor slacken their efforts, he said. Zhu called for their attention
to the piling of agricultural materials, slow sales of
fertilizers, grain seeds and farming tools.
</P>
<P>
"Since the founding of New China, there were several major
downturns in agriculture. They were all directly related to the
slackened efforts by the government after good harvests, in
addition to other reasons," Zhu quoted President Jiang Zemin as
saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu cited protecting and encouraging farmers' initiatives as
the basis of all agricultural work.
</P>
<P>
Because of insufficient storage capacities in many parts of the
country, the good harvest last year has brought some difficulties
to major grain producers, especially China's northeastern region,
including the Jilin province.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, the central government has just
allocated a large sum of special funds to build temporary storages
and dispatch trains to transport surplus grain to other areas, Zhu
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
And the central government has spent a great deal to purchase
the abundant grain from farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to guarantee that farmers earn more as they produce
more, and stabilize the grain purchase price at the reasonable
level set by the central government," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the most direct, effective and practical call to
stabilize grain prices at the reasonable level and purchase all
grains in the hands of farmers, which is aimed to pool efforts for
agricultural development this year," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that agriculture should be given the top priority
in the government's economic work, so as to keep up the steady
growth of agriculture and rural economy.
</P>
<P>
He urged all localities and departments to ensure adequate
input into agriculture, and the implementation of all preferential
policies aimed at supporting agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the sown acreage of cereals, cotton and other main
crops, should be ensured and increased burdens for farmers after a
good harvest be prohibited.
</P>
<P>
The relevant department should vigorously enforce rules,
regulations and disciplines, funds for grain purchase should not
be misused and no IOUs be issued in this regard, the vice-premier
said.

NEW DELHI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Bill Gates, chairman and chief
executive of Microsoft, today urged the Indian government to take
the lead on the information superhighway and invest in fiber optic
networks as well as in computerization.
</P>
<P>

that India could benefit immensely by providing access to
international information through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
India can build on its competitive advantage which derives from
high-quality software engineering manpower by linking all
universities and scientific establishments with the high-quality
computer communication network, he said, adding that this
networking could later be extended to all the schools.
</P>
<P>
According to an official release here today, Prime Minister
Gowda informed Gates of the proposals being considered by the
Indian government, which include laying of fiber optic networks in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Renault to Cut 2,764 Jobs in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- French auto group Renault will cut
2,764 jobs in France this year and carry out re-structure 1,032
jobs within the group, the media quoted union sources as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
Although it wouldn't confirm the figures, the Renault
management said it would present an employment plan to the central
staff committee on March 13.
</P>
<P>
The news comes on top of last week's announcement by the
company that it would close its assembly plant in Vilvoorde,
Belgium, in July with the loss of 3,100 jobs. Renault has a total
workforce of 140,000.
</P>
<P>
The French lay-off plan is aimed at "continuing the reduction
of the workforce while maintaining the recruitment of young
people," Agence France-Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
The cuts would be the biggest by the partially-privatized
company since it fired some 3,700 workers in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Renault also plans a progressive early retirement program for
300 workers, who will be replaced by 150 younger workers, AFP
quoted the union sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
A French union group, the Federation-CFE-CGC of Renault
metallurgy centers, today called on "French and Belgian public
powers to take exceptional measures to avoid this human waste."
</P>
<P>
It called for "the injection of emergency funds to save French
automobiles," as the French government has done for the country's
iron and steel industry, textile industry and banks.
</P>
<P>
Renault unions have called a one-hour strike on Friday in all
plants in France, Belgium and Spain to protest against the
shutdown of the Belgian factory.
</P>
<P>
Renault was privatized in stages in 1994 and 1996. The French
state still holds a 46 percent stake of the company.
</P>
<P>
Renault reported a loss of 5 billion francs (1 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1996, which it blamed on the globalization of the auto
market and strong competition from other European automakers.

<HEADLINE> Syria Vows Adherence to Peace Despite Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Syria has reiterated its
adherence to the peace process despite an Israeli government
decision on building a Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The official media said that Syria has not lost faith in the
peace quest despite all forms of extremism and provocation
demonstrated by the Israeli government headed by Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, the official Damascus daily "Al Thawra" said
that the Netanyahu cabinet's determination to implement the
settlement project in occupied East Jerusalem is a flagrant
challenge to international legitimacy and relevant
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also charged that the Israeli move constitutes an
aggression against Arabs, against peace and against all values and
principles of justice in the world.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper added that the Netanyahu government does not
attach any weight to peace, and it is not prepared to return the
occupied lands and rights to their legitimate owners, and will not
relinquish its settlement and expansionist plans even if it has to
antagonize the whole world.
</P>
<P>
"Al Thawra" stressed that Syria is still endeavoring, seriously
and sincerely, to revive the hopes of peace and guard against its
collapse. Therefore, Syria is waging a diplomatic drive throughout
Europe to brief European leaders about the realities of the
situation in the region, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem agreed last
Wednesday on the establishment of the new Jewish settlement in
East Jerusalem, the first stage of which consists of 2,500 housing
units out of the total 6,500.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Plans to Liquidate "Ailing" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
preparing a regulation which would increase the competitiveness of
banks and liquidate "ailing" banks, a senior official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"It is like a car which slows down. It should be pulled over,
otherwise it will disturb the traffic," Minister of Finance Mar'ie
Mohammad said when explaining the results of last week's ASEAN
finance ministers' meeting in Phuket, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said such competitiveness should be increased in the face of
trade liberalization in the service sector, particularly in the
financial sector, such as banking, insurance and pension fund.
</P>
<P>
He thus called on "ailing" banks to merge with "healthy" ones
to improve their performance.
</P>
<P>
The government has arranged mergers and even given tax
facilities to ease the process, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Bank Indonesia (central bank) governor J. Soedradjad
Djiwandono also called on banks to tighten their internal controls
to ensure all divisions, especially credit and treasury divisions,
do business prudentially.
</P>
<P>
Bad loans at Indonesia's 239 commercial banks reached 10.4
trillion rupiah (4.34 billion US dollars) as of the end of
November 1996. This was 3.26 percent of their total credits in the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie said ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
finance ministers last week agreed to hold joint training in the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN finance ministers last Saturday (March 1) signed two
agreements related to trade and monetary system liberalization in
the region.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister Refutes False Media Reports about Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen today refuted recent untruthful coverage of the Hong Kong
question by some foreign media.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also a vice premier of the State Council, said
that, according to some Western media reports, it seemed as if
China were "lawless" in Hong Kong: disbanding Hong Kong's
Legislative Council and repealing its laws.
</P>
<P>
"I can safely say that the authors of these sensational reports
know nothing about the real situation in Hong Kong, nor do they
have the wish to do so," Qian said at a group discussion attended
by Guangdong deputies to the National People's Congress, which has
been in session here since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Annex Three to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) clearly stipulates that only six
national laws shall apply in the HKSAR, he pointed out, adding that with
Hong Kong and the inland area implementing their own laws
respectively, there is no question whatsoever of applying inland
laws in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has
decided to retain all of Hong Kong's existing laws, ordinances and
regulations except a dozen or so laws and several clauses, he
said.
</P>
<P>
And China has not abolished a few unsuitable clauses in some
laws, leaving them to the future government of the HKSAR for
decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian affirmed the Chinese government's stand of adhering to the
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how complicated and changeable the international
situation is, China will strictly follow the principles of `one
country, two systems', `Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong' and
`a high degree of autonomy', to accomplish a smooth transition of
Hong Kong and its smooth return," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the election and appointment of the chief executive of the
HKSAR and the appointment of 23 principal officials for the future
SAR government, and with the establishment of the Provisional
Legislative Council of the HKSAR that includes 33 members from the
British Hong Kong Legislative Council, a smooth transition is
assured, he said.
</P>
<P>
"At a time like this, no one would believe reports saying that
China has `disbanded the Legislative Council' and 'repealed
laws'," he said. "Hong Kong people's confidence is on the rise."
</P>
<P>
Despite drastic changes in the international arena
over the past few years, he pointed out, China's development is
"unstoppable."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that China wants to focus on reform, opening-up
and modernization and that a stable and prosperous China will
become an important force in safeguarding world peace.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen, Hong Kong To Have Closer Cooperation: City Party Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation between Shenzhen and
Hong Kong will be closer and the scope for their cooperation will
be broader after the latter's return to China, said the Party
chief of Shenzhen, the south China city adjacent to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Li Youwei, secretary of the Shenzhen Municipal Party Committee,
said there exist four major differences between the two cities, in
social system, policies and operational mechanism, laws in force,
and the degree of market development.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Strict differentiation should be made of the
differences, and there must not be any ambiguity and confusion."
</P>
<P>
Li, who is here attending the ongoing session of the National
People's Congress, China's top legislature, pointed out, "The
first difference between Shenzhen and Hong Kong is one in social
and political systems. According to the principle of `one country,
two systems', Hong Kong will continue to practise capitalism while
socialism is practised in Shenzhen. This should by no means be
obscured."
</P>
<P>
Li added laws and regulations applying in Shenzhen comply with
the demands of the socialist system and a socialist market
economy, while Hong Kong's laws cater to the demands of capitalism
and a free port.
</P>
<P>
"However, we may use those in Hong Kong that are suitable for
SEZs as reference," said he.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a developed market economy, Li said, while
Shenzhen is still at an initial stage.
</P>
<P>
To help Shenzhen develop its market economy, he explained, more
cooperation and exchanges between Shenzhen and Hong Kong are
needed.
</P>
<P>
He cited four fields that have the greatest potential for
cooperation: city infrastructure such as water supply, land, air
and water transportation, the two ports of entry, and large
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
As the only inland city to border Hong Kong, Li pointed out,
Shenzhen is the hub and passage connecting the whole inland area
with Hong Kong, and successful cooperation between the two cities
will help promote that between Hong Kong and entire inland areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Changchun, the capital of
northeast China's Jilin Province, intends to take advantage of its
abundant grain and livestock to become a major food-processing
base in China.
</P>
<P>
An important grain producer, Changchun produced a record 7.5
million tons of grain last year, providing a firm foundation for
the local animal husbandry. Its corn production, which contributes
a large amount to local grain output, is expected to give an
impetus as well to development of such local industries as
pharmaceuticals, textiles, and paper.
</P>
<P>
A big corn development company with annual processing capacity
of 300,000 tons is expected to be built by the end of the year,
and the city plans to increase its annual corn processing capacity
to 1.8 million tons by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Changchun has jurisdiction over more than 145 towns and
townships, providing a total of 650,000 tons of meat a
year. Experts predict that by the year 2000 Changchun will be able
to process more than 400,000 head of cattle, one million pigs, and
100 million chickens a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUJIAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China's Fujian Province, where
there is an average of only 3.3 cm of railway for each person,
compared with the national average of five cm, is planning to
build six major railways to link it with neighboring provinces.
</P>
<P>
The six proposed lines, which will take the form of
Sino-foreign joint ventures, include one running along the coast
between Fuzhou, the provincial capital, and Xiamen, a special
economic zone.
</P>
<P>
The schemes are expected to extend the total length of local
rails to 2,500 km and will be connected to national trunk lines.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, the lack of railroads in Fujian has hampered
development of the local economy and the province's efforts to
improve its investment environment.

In 1993, the Local Railroad Construction Corporation of Fujian
Province was set up by the provincial government, with a
registered capital of 180 million yuan, to deal with this. It

<HEADLINE> Japan Says 5 "Red Army" Members Detained in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan has notified Lebanon that
eight Japanese citizens, including five members of the Japanese
"Red Army," were detained by the Lebanese authorities, Adnan
Addoum, Lebanon's state prosecutor, announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Addoum held a meeting in his office this morning with a
Japanese security delegation, which was sent to Beirut on the
second day after the detention was first exposed on February
17.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, the state prosecutor told a
press conference that the Japanese security delegation told
him that five Japanese belonging to the "Red Army" were detained
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Japanese delegation also said that there
are three other Japanese citizens detained by the Lebanese
authorities and they are not members of the radical Japanese
group.
</P>
<P>
Addoum declined to disclose names of those Japanese citizens
who the Japanese delegation claimed were detained in Lebanon,
noting that the information needed to be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese officials had denied earlier that the Lebanese
security forces had taken into custody any members of the "Red
Army" in an search-and-arrest campaign on February 15.
</P>
<P>
However, the state prosecutor clarified today that the security
forces launched the campaign against Asians after obtaining
information on a clandestine group falsifying tourist documents
and entry visas.
</P>
<P>
Alluding that the detainees could not be immediately handed
over to Japan, Addoum underlined that if it is proved that
they have committed crimes on the Lebanese land, they will
be tried in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
An envoy of Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had a
series of meetings in Beirut Monday separately with Lebanese prime
Minister Rafik Hariri, Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz and
President Elias Hrawi in an addition to Addoum.
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources said that Hiroshi Hirabayashi, chief foreign
policy advisor to the Japanese premier, and the Lebanese state
prosecutor exchanged pictures and fingerprints of the detainees.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement earlier
today, saying that among the Asian detainees in Beirut are
five members of the "Red Army," including Kozo Okamoto.
</P>
<P>
Okamoto was sentenced to life imprisonment in Israel for
an involvement in the shootout in Tel Aviv's Lodd Airport in
1972 in which 24 people were killed and some 100 others
wounded, but he was released in a Palestinian-Israeli prisoner
swap in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The Radical Japanese "Red Army" was accused of being
responsible for a series of terrorist attacks in the Middle East
and elsewhere in the 1970s and 1980s.

MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today urged the country's bicameral congress to speed up its
deliberation of a reform program on income taxation, the
Presidential Press Office said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who is now in India on a three-day visit, made the call
in a handwritten memorandum faxed to Executive Secretary Ruben
Torres.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he expects the income tax reform plan to move from
the House of Representatives to the Senate by March 13 when the
next meeting of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory
Council opens.
</P>
<P>
Ramos wrote the memorandum in response to a statement made
Monday by Senate President Ernesto Maceda, who said the bills
restructuring income taxes will not go through the congress by May
1 because the lower house has dragged its feet on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The income tax reform bill is the last part of the country's
Comprehensive Tax Reform Program to be approved by the congress.
The congressional passage of the bill is among the requirements
for the Philippines' exit program from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, whose economic development has been under the
supervision of the IMF for 35 years, is expected to graduate from
the world financial body by June this year.

<P>
In a secret vote today by 256 of the 299 legislators in the

MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Health Secretary
Carmencita Reodica said today that measles cases declined by 30
percent in the country's capital region during the last week of
February.
</P>
<P>
There were 97 cases admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital, the
main state-run infectious disease hospital in Manila, with no
deaths last week as compared with the 133 cases recorded in the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
A significant decrease was also noted in the cases coming from
the region's Valenzuela and Quezon City, the Philippine News
Agency quoted Reodica as saying.
</P>
<P>
There were 11 cases in Valenzuela and 15 cases in Quezon City
in the third week of February, while the following week registered
only five and four cases respectively.
</P>
<P>
Reodica noted that the successive decreases in the number of
cases demonstrated the positive response of the public to the
efforts of the Health Department in controlling the disease.
</P>
<P>
"Health programs are vital instruments for healthy and
productive individuals," Reodica said. "But the cooperation of the
public as proven by the voluntary submission of their children for
measles vaccination is the true mechanism by which this health
goal is achieved."
</P>
<P>
However, she added, efforts like immunization, information and
education campaigns need to be sustained in order to reduce the
number of children susceptible to measles.
</P>
<P>
The total number of measles cases admitted to San Lazaro
Hospital since January 1 stands at 1,889 including 74 deaths.
</P>
<P>
Most of the said cases were found to be in the age group of one
to four years, Reodica said.

<HEADLINE> German Nuclear Waste Train Reaches Dannenberg, 8 Hours Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The train carrying nuclear waste
reached Dannenberg early today, eight hours behind schedule, where
its cargo would be loaded on heavy trucks for Wednesday
transportation to an underground storage depot at Gorleben, about
20 kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated in this town
of northern state of Lower Saxony, about 1,000 of them involved in
violent clashes with the police, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
It was not yet available how many people were injured or
arrested in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
A total of 30,000 police were mobilized to shield the train --
the biggest police operation in postwar Germany, with the security
cost being estimated around 100 million marks (60 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The train carried six containers of highly-radioactive spent
nuclear fuel rods, with four from two power plants in southern
Germany and two from a French nuclear reprocessing plant.
</P>
<P>
It was put together in the town of Walheim in southern state of
Baden-Wuerttemberg and started on its 20-hour trek across Germany
on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Late Monday, several hundred protesters lied on the railway
tracks linking Lueneberg with Dannenberg to block the train, two
of these people chained themselves to the rails.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the train stranded for 13 minutes near the town of
Goettingen as protesters entered a railway tunnel and hurled
stones at police.
</P>
<P>
Anti-nuclear protesters in Dannenberg earlier Monday clogged
the road heading for Gorleben with tractors and barricades, who
also dug a 10-metre-wide and 2-metre-deep trench in the middle of
road and set a barricade on fire.
</P>
<P>
On the way to Dannenberg, police had to remove protesters, iron
bars and other obstacles from tracks. There were also bomb threats
and a police spokesman voiced concern over the potential for
violence from extremists among demonstrators.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Har Homa Construction Delayed Only for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu announced today that the controversial Har Homa
building in East Jerusalem would be delayed for a few days for
technical reasons.
</P>
<P>
The first stages of the controversial building project, which
will build 2,500 of the total 6,500 housing units in three
years, was originally expected to start today with Housing
Ministry surveyors coming to work at the construction site.
But Netanyahu ordered the delay Monday night until "certain
technical and legal factors" were resolved.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the state-run Israel Radio,
Netanyahu reiterated the delay was only due to technical
reasons. He also denied that it was connected to his
scheduled visit to Egypt Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is expected to hold discussions with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and other officials on the current
situation following Israel's decision last week to build the
settlement in Har Homa. The Egyptian government has strongly
criticized the Har Homa settlement decision, saying it was
unacceptable and harmful to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the criticism by U.S. President Bill Clinton
on the Har Homa decision, Netanyahu said that there was
nothing new in the U.S. opposition to any Israel's building
plan in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters Monday before holding talks with
visiting Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, Clinton
said he preferred the Har Homa decision, which he called
would build mistrust, had not been made.
</P>
<P>
Clinton added that when the Israeli government made the
decision on the Har Homa project, it had taken into account all
possible reactions.
</P>
<P>
Israel has come under strong international criticism over the
Har Homa issue, as Arafat was striving to solicit all pressures on
Israel to reverse the decision.
</P>
<P>
On the further Israeli troop pullout from the rural areas of
the West Bank which has been also delayed, Netanyahu reaffirmed
his commitments to carrying out the withdrawals after the cabinet
makes a decision Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli right-wing politicians criticized Netanyahu
for delaying the Har Homa project. Uzi Landau, Chairman of
the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee,
said today that Netanyahu's hesitancy had opened the way for
outside pressure.
</P>
<P>
Landau also blasted Netanyahu for not presenting to the U.S.
government a list of Palestinian violations of the peace
accords during his visit to Washington last month. He claimed
that this allowed Arafat to win points by attacking the Har
Homa project.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to press reports that the government might
agree to widen the scope of further troop withdrawals to
appease the Palestinian anger over the Har Homa decision, a
group of rightist lawmakers are meeting this afternoon to
formulate their pressure on the government not to hand over
more land to the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Michael Kleiner, head of the Front for Land of Israel
that comprises 17 Knesset members, said that the group would
oppose hand-over of any land in Area C, which is now under
total Israeli control.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meet US Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) --An American delegation, led by
Barber Conable Jr., chairman of the National Committee on US-China
Relations, and Robert McNamara, former US secretary of defense,
who are visiting China, say there are broad prospects for US-China
relations, during talks with Premier Li Peng this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is here for activities commemorating the 25th
anniversary of the Sino-US Shanghai joint communique, as guests of
the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the communique had great significance in Sino-US
relations and influenced the whole world, and that its provisions
still guide Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Deng Xiaoping made historic contributions to the
normalization of Sino-US relations, and his proposals on the
development of relations are still important principles in
handling Sino-US relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
China is pleased to see that there has been momentum in Sino-US
relations since the second half of last year, he said, and that
high-level exchanges of visits will help the development of
Sino-US relations, especially the state visit by President Jiang
Zemin to the US later this year and the state visit by President
Clinton to China next year.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hope that both sides will work together to
ensure smooth and successful exchanges of state visits of the top
leaders, and answered questions about the situation in China, its
entry into the World Trade Organization, and the Asia-Pacific
regional situation.
</P>
<P>
Conable said that the members of the delegation are dedicated
to developing US-Chinese relations. They came to China and worked
with Chinese friends to explore channels for further development
of the relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
After extensive talks with Chinese officials and experts, all
of them said they saw broad prospects for US-Chinese relations,
Conable said.
</P>
<P>
He told li that they saw great changes take place in China and
deeply felt the great significance of Deng's policy of reform and
opening-up. China has remarkably raised the people's standard of
living in such a short time, he said, something that could not
occur in any other country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the National Committee on US-China Relations will
continue to contribute to improving the bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> China on Move To Build New Chemicals City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a huge 1.4-
billion-yuan chemicals complex has begun in the city of Cangzhou
in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The project, expected to produce 20,000 tons of TDI annually,
marks a new step in the country's effort to build its third
chemical industrial city in Cangzhou, about 200 kilometers south
of Beijing, officials from the municipal government told Xinhua
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
TDI is a kind of raw material used to make various chemical
products. Cangzhou is known for its abundance of natural gas and
gasoline, and it also can produce 1.5 million tons of raw salt
each year. These factors combined have laid a sound foundation for
the city to develop its chemical industry, they said.
</P>
<P>
As construction of the complex forges ahead, officials said,
building of 10 large-scale projects revolving around the Cangzhou
Oil Refinery and a gigantic chemical base of chlorine soda have
entered a "substantial" stage. The refinery-related projects and
the chemical base are estimated to cost over three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Cangzhou has more than 600 chemical enterprises. Its fertilizer
plant, oil refinery and chemicals complex, well known both at home
and abroad, have become pillar industries of the burgeoning city.
</P>
<P>
So far, a project capable of producing 10,000 tons of resin has
gone into operation and an 80-million-yuan caustic soda plant has
started production.

<HEADLINE> 500 People in Nanjing Become Organ Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Many Chinese have decided to make
a final contribution to society - by donating organs for medical
research.
</P>
<P>
In Nanjing, the capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, more
than 500 people have joined the Friends of Organs Donors group, an
unofficial organization that solicits people to donate organs to
hospitals and medical institutes when they die.
</P>
<P>
Many people decided to become donors after they heard that
Deng, who died at the age 93 on February 19, had told his family
to donate his corneas to an eye bank and offer his organs to
medical research after his death.
</P>
<P>
"We're deeply touched by Deng's philosophical view of life and
death. We think we should follow him to make contributions to
medical research," said Professor Yuan Shenglin of Nanjing
Agricultural University, and his wife.
</P>
<P>
And, added Lin Ye, a donor from the Nanjing Meteorological
Institute, "Deng devoted his entire life to the country and the
people. He has set a very good example for us."
</P>
<P>
The number of people who applied for membership in the Friends
of Organs Donors, the first of its kind in China, went from 440 at
the end of February to over 500 at present, according to a report
in Shanghai's "Wenhui Daily". Of them the oldest is 87 years old
and the youngest only 20. About 80 couples have joined the
organization.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to donate organs was made by a dozen retired
government officials and teachers two years ago. The recent
establishment of the organ donors' organization was also
encouraged by local government officials and the Nanjing Red Cross
Society.
</P>
<P>
Although cremation has become popular among Chinese urbanities
because of several decades of reforms, most Chinese still feel a
bit strange about donating parts of their bodies for medical
research, or even organs for living patients.
</P>
<P>
"We'll make a great effort to encourage more people to join us
in this," Lin Ye noted.

BANGKOK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will create about 1,500
playgrounds nationwide to attract people from drug addiction in a
bid to ease drug abuses in the country, a senior Thai drug
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The program is designed as one of the country's measures to
prevent drug abuses, said Prija Champaratna, secretary general of
the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The authorities will use open places near governmental
buildings or parking lots to create the playgrounds to attract
more people, especially children, to do exercises or take up
sports activities instead of using drugs, Prija told a press
conference at the U.N. Conference Center in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Prija also said that the Thai government has achieved some
progress eradicating drug abuses over the past years, especially
early this year after Chavalit Yongchaiyudh took office as the
country's new prime minister.
</P>

state- level agreement," Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia, whose population is only 2.5 million, has about 30
million head of livestock.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Adherence to Party's Basic Line (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang went on to say: "Over the past seven decades, our army
has marched from victory to victory, grown stronger and stronger
and withstood the test of complex environments and severe
struggles. The most fundamental reason for these has been the fact
that it has the powerful leadership of the Party."
</P>
<P>
"Our army has always followed what the Party says and is
utterly worthy of the trust of the Party and the people."
</P>
<P>
Given the important position of our army, the historical
mission it shoulders, and the nature and objectives of the
people's army, Jiang said, new circumstances require that we
enhance our understanding of the importance of Party leadership,
unswervingly persist in the absolute leadership of the Party and
follow the command of the CPC Central Committee and the Central
Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that unity can only be realized
through having ideals and disciplines, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Without disciplines as solid as iron, success cannot be
achieved either in revolution or in construction," he said.
</P>
<P>
With disciplines enhanced, revolution is ever victorious, and
this is true all the time, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In reform, opening-up and the modernization drive, we will
meet various complex situations and need to handle contradictions
and problems of one sort or another," Jiang said. "Therefore, it
is imperative to emphasize that the individual should submit to
the organization, the minority to the majority, subordinates to
their superiors, and the whole Party to its Central Committee, and
to further enhance the consciousness of observing disciplines. Our
army has always observed disciplines and regarded them as being as
important as life."
</P>
<P>
Observance to disciplines is a basic requirement of viewing
things from a political height and is an important guarantee for
keeping the army both centralized and united, he said.
</P>
<P>
Every comrade, all leading officials at various levels in
particular, should, under all circumstances, resolutely carry out
the decisions, directives, regulations and requirements of the CPC
Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, in order to
ensure a smooth implementation of political and military orders, and
no haggling is permitted, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"We should do everything at all time in accordance with the
directives of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military
Commission and in accordance with organizational principles," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Experts Reach Consensus on HK Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Experts on the Sino-British
Joint Liaison Group (JLG) reached consensus on Hong Kong's 1997-98
budget at their 19th meeting here today, thus completing their
work on the matter, a Chinese representative on the JLG said.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing held here today, Chen Zuo'er, head of the
Chinese experts team for the budget, said the consensus will
ensure a smooth transition and normal operation for Hong Kong's
public finance and social services around the handover of Hong
Kong's political power.
</P>
<P>
The budget covers 12 months from April 1, 1997, to March 31,
1998. Since March 1995, the Chinese and British experts on the JLG
had held 19 rounds of talks on the drafting of the budget.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the budget had been drafted in line with the three
principles raised by the Chinese side at the end of January
1996: taking the related stipulations in the Basic Law as the
guideline, taking into account the interests of all sectors in
Hong Kong and systematically drafting the budget on the basis of
cooperation between the Chinese and British sides.
</P>
<P>
During the budget-drafting process, the Chinese side listened
to the opinions and suggestions from various sectors in Hong Kong,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that after Tung Chee Hwa was elected as the first chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),
the Chinese side of the JLG timely informed him of the progress
in the budget drafting process.
</P>
<P>
He said the drafting of the budget had taken into consideration
Tung's views and received his support.
</P>
<P>
Chen added that the budget has laid a sound foundation for the
budget of the HKSAR government in the next fiscal year and it will
play an important and positive role in the economic development
and the improvement of people's life in Hong Kong in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that so long as the Chinese and British sides act in
accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the
Question of Hong Kong and adopt a positive and pragmatic
attitude, Chen stressed, they will remove obstacles in their
talks and contribute to Hong Kong's smooth transition and smooth
transfer of government.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that as the 1997-98 financial budget strides over
June 30, 1997, some special arrangements have been made for its
drafting, enacting and enforcing processes.
</P>
<P>
He said that before the chief executive of the HKSAR was
elected, the budget had to be discussed between and drafted by the
representatives of China's central government and the British
side.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the 1997-98 budget has now been worked out and
the drafting of the 1998-99 budget for Hong Kong will be totally
the responsibility of the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's central government will not participate
in working out the next budget and it is confident of the ability
of the HKSAR government to manage public finance well.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and British experts on the JLG held a dinner here
tonight to mark the completion of the budget and Chief Executive
Tung was present at the dinner.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Adherence to Party's Basic Line  (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that this year will be a crucial one for the
the history of the country's development, when the Chinese
government will resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong
Kong and the Party will convene its 15th National Congress.
</P>
<P>
The first event will be of important and far-reaching
significance to the accomplishment of China's reunification cause
and boost the national morale, he said.
</P>
<P>
And the 15th National Party Congress will be an historic event,
which will unite and lead the entire Chinese people in advancing
in an all-round way the great cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics into the next century, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Both events will be focuses of world attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China's economy is progressing along
with political stability, national unity and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's passing plunged all the Party, the army
and people of all ethnic groups into deep grief, but the entire
funeral activities proceeded in an orderly way, he said.
</P>
<P>
This shows Deng Xiaoping's immense prestige in the Party and
the army and among people of all ethnic groups, and that the basic
theories, the basic line and policies have been deep-rooted in the
people's minds, and that the Central Party Committee enjoys the
deep trust of the people, who are fully confident of the prospects
of the reform, opening-up and modernization drive, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
This also demonstrates that maintaining stability of the whole
country and society has a firm political and popular base, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
The People's Liberation Army, a strong pillar of the people's
democratic dictatorship in China, shoulders the important
responsibilities for safeguarding the state security and
maintaining social stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Leading cadres at various levels, especially those high-ranking
officials, must be good at observing and analyzing problems from
political and overall angles and with the overall situation in
mind and do a still better job in maintaining stability, he said.

<HEADLINE> Macao Textile Industry Expects 20 Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Macao's textile and garment-making
industry is expected to grow by 20 percent this year, and will
remain the dominant products for exports, a Macao industry expert
says.
</P>
<P>
Lionel Vai Tac Leong, chairman of the Textile and Garment
Committee of the Macao Productivity and Technology Transfer
Center, said that he estimated the textile and garment-making
industry will receive an extra 20 percent orders this year.
</P>
<P>
Macao's export of textile and garments to the United States,
Macao's leading market of such items, declined slightly after the
US customs imposed special restrictions on imports from Macao. The
export is expected to pick up this year after a consensus was
reached between the US customs and the Macao Government last year.
</P>
<P>
"Macao businessmen are quick to learn new things and have wide
contacts with the rest of world," Leong was quoted by the "Tai
Chung Pou" as saying. "Those advantages will make Macao survive in
the fierce competition from neighboring regions."
</P>
<P>
He said 85 percent of Macao's exports will be textile and
garment products this year as the proportion of toys exports
dropped sharply last year.
</P>
<P>
Textile and garment products and toys are the two leading goods
of exports of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Many Macao toy factories have moved to neighboring Guangdong
Province in China's mainland because the labor cost there is much
cheaper. Some garment factories have also started to move to the
inland because of a shortage of labor in Macao.

Since the launching of the reform and opening up, Jiang noted,
profound changes in society have greatly promoted army building in
China, and the army has made marked achievements in studying and
solving the major issues on how to run the armed forces under
the new circumstances, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Especially in recent years, the army has made new progress in
its development, thanks to several rounds of in-depth education,
implementation of rigorous administration over the army,
intensification of its routine and regular management, and
improvement of material and cultural conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the army have stood tests of the development of
the socialist market economy and opening to the outside world, and
carried out various tasks, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the army building is confronted with new
circumstance and a host of new problems, and cadres at various
levels must run the army with strict disciplines and according to
law, and do their routine ideological and managerial work in a
meticulous way and from the height of keeping to the character,
purpose of the army and its foundmental functions, he said.
</P>

They also have to forge still closer ties between officers and

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Warlord Taylor Accused of Hiding Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian peace process which is
currently progressing towards general elections received a jolt
following allegations of a former warring faction led by Charles
Taylor on concealing weapons.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here today revealed allegations that members of
the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) led by Taylor have
been hiding their arms instead of handing them over to the
western African peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
A former captain with the defunct NPFL was quoted as saying in
Cote d'Ivoire over the weekend that he knew where all the arms
are hidden and could direct ECOMOG to the sites.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament and demobilization of Liberia's rival factions
were concluded in early February this year.
</P>
<P>
During the exercise, more than 30,000, or 91 percent of the
factional fighters, were disarmed by ECOMOG, while some 14,156
pieces of arms, 1.65 million rounds of ammunitions and 4,369
bombs were recovered.
</P>
<P>
However, Taylor denied the charge, saying that it was a
propaganda meant to set ECOMOG against him.
</P>
<P>
"There may be bigger hands behind this one but those hands are
going to fail. ECOMOG must win this war," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
He also alleged that there are some external forces whose aim
is to destabilize the forthcoming election scheduled for May this
year and probably delay it for two to three years.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG announced that it has uncovered a large amount of
weapons buried at a diamond depository. The cache includes
assorted riffles and rocket propelled grenades discovered during
a raid following information received from the public.
</P>
<P>
The weapons were found at Lofa bridge, about 60 kilometers
west of Monrovia, capital of Liberia. The area was contested by
the former United Liberation Movement (ULIMO) factions before the
disarmament exercise.

products last month, with its imports from the country reaching a
total of 582 million dollars that month.

<HEADLINE> China Growing into Leading Corn Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China is becoming one of the
world's leading corn producers and processors, following years of
bumper harvests and the successful diversification of the staple
agro-produce.
</P>
<P>
Total acreage of maize now tops 20 million ha. In 1996, China
harvested more than 100 million tons of corn, a record high output
that accounted for one-fifth of the world's total, sources from
the Ministry of Agriculture said.
</P>
<P>
Corn, rice and wheat are three major crops in the world. And
production of corn is considered a yardstick for measuring a
nation's grain producing capacity and its level of husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Maize is planted throughout China, but three major producing
areas -- the North, the Huanghuai Plains, and the Southwest --
account for four-fifths of the country's total output, while using
only one-fourth of its total acreage.
</P>
<P>
The northern maize area envelops Jilin, Heilongjiang, Liaoning
and Hebei provinces, while Huanghuai Plains cover Shandong, Henan
and Jiangsu provinces and the Southwest involves Yunnan, Guizhou
and Sichuan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the dramatic rise of corn output to the use
of science and technology in growing the crops and the remarkable
expansion of its acreage. Over the past several decades, China has
nurtured a few generations of high-yield maize seeds, which have
helped boost per-hectare yield five times over with the aid of
fertilizer. In the 1950s, the country's total corn output was 16
million tons.
</P>
<P>
By adopting diversified development and processing techniques,
China has turned corn into feed, industrial raw materials and
export commodities.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria needs to create one million jobs
annually in order to catch up with growth in its population, the
"Vanguard" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Issac Aluko-Olokun, a member of the Vision 2010 Committee was
quoted as saying this at a workshop on Nigeria's Vision 2010 in Lagos
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The former Chairman of the National Planning Commission under
the interrim national government said that Nigeria's population
of 102 million will double in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that 34 percent of the population now live below the
poverty line, with only 10 percent above the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate announced by the government is less than two
percent, but the true situation might be far worse than that. A report
in 1996 said more than half of the country's youths are jobless.
</P>
<P>
To make it worse, Aluko-Ololun said, it is not easy to tell where
the jobs will come from, since Nigeria is a consumer nation rather
than a producer nation.
</P>
<P>
He called for massive investment in human capital development
through adequate funding of the educational sector, saying that
education is critical to the success of the economy.
</P>
<P>
He also called for reforming of the country's civil service system,
continued privatization, better infrastructure and improved investment
environment.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Warns Black Business Against Parasitic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
has warned black business consortiums to decrease their reliance
on pyramid structures as a vehicle for black economic
empowerment, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of National Empowerment Corporation
(NEC) here Monday, Mbeki said black business should not project
itself as a "parasitic class" that could only thrive on pillaging
state resources.
</P>
<P>
He was reportedly referring to some black empowerment deals
which were limited only to existing economic activities and
created no new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The government would like to see the emergence of more black
consortiums, he said, adding that their investment should focus
on sustainable growth and job creation in sectors such as
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NEC chairman Mashudu Ramano said his company would
focus on growing businesses in the industrial, financial
services, printing and retail sectors within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Ramano said the NEC's major long-term objectives are to
"obtain financial empowerment by acquiring meaningful stakes in
growth sectors, and economic empowerment by participating at an
operational level."
</P>
<P>
The NEC, with a total investment capital of 275 million Rand
(about 60 million US Dollars), would be listed on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange within three years, added Ramano.

<HEADLINE> Food Structure Changes Likely to Ease China's Grain Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, MARCH 4 (Xinhua) -- The availability of more
processed food items and diversified means of producing them
will help to alleviate China's grain shortage, a team of experts
say.
</P>
<P>
The team, under the Hangzhou-based China Rice Research
Institute, said that the modern concept of nutrition focuses on
the human body's intake of balanced nutrients rather than how many
kilograms of grain a person consumes.
</P>
<P>
The experts are taking steps to persuade people to abandon the
traditional belief that their predominant source of food should be
grain.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yuming, a research fellow heading the team, said that
grain is rich in carbohydrates but contains relatively small amounts
of amino acids and vitamins which are needed by the human
body. Additionally, he said, it is not economical to feed animals
with grain.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of China's 480 billion kilograms of grain output is
used as animal feed. This practice must be changed, and production
of grain rations for human consumption should be separated from
that of feed, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Experiments show that the same tract of land used for green
feed or non-grain food instead of grain production yields three
times more protein, fat, carbohydrate and other nutrients.
</P>
<P>
Those plant nutrients can be translated into non-grain food
when they are eaten by animals, poultry and fish. A greater share
of non-grain food in Chinese people's dietary pattern will not
only improve food quality, but will also save a significant amount
of staple grain for more people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the direct consumption of grain is not the best way
to support the world's largest population.
</P>
<P>
The agronomist said production of green nutrients will also
promote China's environmental protection and ensure a sustained
agricultural development.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Kill 791 Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government army has
killed 791 rebels of the Christian Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)
which aims to topple the government, since February 1996,
reported the local daily The Monitor today.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Amama Mbabazi was quoted as saying that the
remnants of LRA group led by Otti Lagony had to escape to Sudan
to avoid to the hot pursuit by the government army.
</P>
<P>
"We deployed around the border to prevent them from returning
to Sudan but they made it through before we finished the
deployment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbabazi charged that Sudan was likely to reorganize the LRA
rebels and unleash them on Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"We are also preparing for them," he said.
</P>
<P>
IRA was founded in April, 1987 by Joseph Kony, a 33-year-old
former Catechist in a Catholic parish.
</P>
<P>
The rebels fled northern Uganda in Sudan in October 1994 after
the government army intensified attacks on them.
</P>
<P>
In October 1995, LRA rebels fled deeper into Sudan because of
attacks from Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) led by John
Garang.
</P>
<P>
Between October 1995 and early February 1996, there were no
attacks taken by LRA rebels on northern Uganda.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A 250 kilometer "green corridor"
is being built along the Jinhua-Wenzhou Railway Line, which is
being seriously eroded by wind and rain.
</P>
<P>
One million young people, from factories, schools, army units
and villages, with various tools, have gathered on both sides of
the railway line to plant a million trees, reported officals in east

</P>
<P>
The project also marks a tribute to late Deng Xiaoping,
the chief architect of China's reforms and opening-up who advocated
tree planting movements in China 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The project has also enhanced the awareness of environmental
protection among the public, with local residents of all ages
voluntarily participating in the activity.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Provincial Governor Liu Xirong recently led a group of local
government official in planting trees with young people. Meanwhile, some
primary school students donated 8,000 yuan of their savings for
the greening project, according to provincial reports.

<P>
"We should conscientiously safeguard the great unity of the
whole Party, the whole army and people of all ethnic groups and
push forward our cause with one heart and one mind," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Historical experience has proven that unity is of overriding
importance, unity is power and unity is victory, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So long as the whole Party and the whole army are strong and
united and people of all ethnic groups are strong and united, we
can stand up to the test of any storms and our cause will be
invincible," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Among unity of the whole Party, the whole army and people of
all ethnic groups, unity among leading officials of the Party, the
government and the army always plays a spurring and exemplary
role, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the 14th Party Congress, the whole army has earnestly
followed Deng Xiaoping's directive about carrying forward the fine
traditions and maintaining the true qualities of the Red Army, and
unity in and outside the army has further consolidated, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
"We must cherish and safeguard, to the fullest extent, the
hard-won overall good situation and continue to do a good job of
enhancing unity," he urged.
</P>
<P>
The crux of strengthening unity lies in safeguarding the
authority of the CPC Central Committee and conscientiously keeping
in unison with the CPC Central Committee, ideologically,
politically and in action, he noted.
</P>
<P>
For a big party with more than 50 million members like ours and
a huge country with a vast territory, a population of 1.2 billion,
and 56 nationalities like China, which is undertaking the great
but arduous cause of reform, opening-up and modernization, if
there were not the united leadership of the CPC Central Committee,
there could not be a united will and united actions throughout the
country, China would become a pan of loose sand, and nothing would
be accomplished, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"To safeguard the authority of the CPC Central Committee is the
political behest of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and is where the
fundamental interests of the Party, the State and the nation lie,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Persisting in the Party's absolute leadership over the army is
a fundamental political system of our army," he said.

"In carrying forward at the behest of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and
living up to his long-cherished wishes, we must get down to
actions and concentrate all our mind and energy on the Party's
cause as well as army building," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
By now, China has mapped out a trans-century blueprint for its
reform and construction and major principles and policies in
different fields of work in army building has been ascertained, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Whether these goals can be carried out and the principles and
policies be implemented hinges largely on the political quality
and ideological state of the senior army officers as well as well
their style of work and practice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged the army officers to be aware of the arduous task,
tremendous responsibility and the need to set high criteria and
strict requirements in study, work and ideological work. Army
officers must also have it in mind to maintain close ties with the
masses and serve the people heart and soul.
</P>
<P>
All theories and practices of Deng Xiaoping, he said, are
centered on one basic purpose, and that is to work for the
interests of the people. And Deng's starting point in considering
all issues is precisely to see whether the people are happy,
contented and agree or not, he said.
</P>
<P>
The letter to the Party Central Committee by Comrade Deng
Xiaoping's family members eloquently shows the noble character and
sterling integrity. "What is a thorough materialist, what is meant
by giving his all till his heart stops beating, and what can be
called selfless sacrifice? --- Comrade Deng Xiaoping has provided
the most convincing answer with his own brilliant life," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should not only study Deng's thinking and theories, but
earnestly learn from his revolutionary spirit and noble ideals,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on all comrades to, following Deng Xiaoping's
example, foster correct world outlook, and the outlook on life and
values, and seek no fame, status and promotion, give priority to
the Party and people's interests, so as to perform feats in
revolutionizing and modernizing the army and make it a still more
regular armed force.

A draft proposal for an agreement between ILO and Kenya was
made to enable selected developing countries in Africa to
duplicate K-MAP model.
</P>
<P>
The countries which have been identified for duplication of
the K-MAP include Uganda, Eritrea, Namibia, South Africa,
Tanzania and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
K-MAP which runs business counseling programs has succeeded
in solving problems hindering the growth of the small and medium
scale business sector.
</P>
<P>
Through the counseling programs, the private sector can aptly
meet such challenges as poor skills, concentration of the
businesses in the trading sector and poor marketing facilities.
</P>
<P>
The ILO/K-MAP cooperation will be focused on organization of
familiarization workshops for representatives of the selected
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations will also arrange for joint regional and
country counselor training programs to facilitate networking
among management assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
The proposal noted that with many countries undergoing reforms
in the public sectors, the private sector would play a leading
role in economic development in these countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, duplication of this model should be
taken in countries where private sector development has been
identified as a priority and where governments have created
conducive environment for the private sector to take a leading
role in the economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A group of 11 outstanding women
from eight Chinese provinces told their tales of success in
Beijing today in their first of a series of public lectures.
</P>
<P>
The women's stories represent the fine qualities of
self-respect, self-confidence, self-support and self-improvement
that have contributed to their achievements, said Huang Qizao,
vice-chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, which
co-sponsored the series with central government organizations.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guangping, a street sweeper in Xuzhou City, east China's
Jiangsu Province, heads a team of nine female colleagues who work
in the city.
</P>
<P>
Although her work is strenuous, she said: "I would sacrifice
my own hope of the chance for clean work, so that others will have
a clean environment."
</P>
<P>
Pei Lijing, 22, opened a modern pig farm with 4,000 pigs in her
native village in east China's Shandong Province, after her
graduation from the Shandong University of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the country gave me my college education just to
enable me to find a comfortable job in the city," she said. "What
I want to do is to contribute more to my village."
</P>
<P>
Last year, her farm turned over more than 400,000 yuan (48,000
US dollars) in profit and she has invested 20,000 yuan to support
200 pig-raising farmers in neighboring areas.

"and I will try to achieve this goal in my homeland."
</P>

As a student in France, Chen turned down the invitation from
the French science community for various high-salary positions,
and returned to China as soon as her studies were complete.
</P>

Huang Qizao called on the women all over the country to follow
the examples of the speakers, who have improved themselves and
made great accomplishments as a result of hard work.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 people attended today's lecture.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Adherence to Party's Basic Line (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that officers and soldiers of the whole army
should be organized to study Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and be armed with this
scientific theory.
</P>
<P>
"This is a strategic task that must be unremittingly stressed
and carried out in a down-to-earth manner for a long period of
time," he said, adding that the fond memories of the late Comrade
Deng Xiaoping should be turned into a powerful impetus to study,
research, publicize and apply Deng's scientific theory.
</P>
<P>
"We must make painstaking efforts in study and research to
acquire a profound understanding of the fundamental tenets and
ideological essence of this theory, try hard to learn and grasp
Comrade Xiaoping's stand, viewpoints, and methods for observing,
analyzing and solving problems, and continuously enhance our
conscientiousness and firmness in adhering to the Party's basic
line," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is very important for the military to fully
understand Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building in the new
historical period, which is a major integral part of the theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and a scientific
guideline for the building of the PLA under new historical
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We should persistently take Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army
building in the new historical period as the guideline, and
actively explore characteristics and laws of army building at a
time when profound changes have taken place in the global
strategic structure, in a social environment of developing a
socialist market economy and opening to the outside world, and
against a background of significant changes in the military field
worldwide caused by a rapid progress of science and technology,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the army to make every effort to strengthen itself
comprehensively, acquire the ability to win local wars fought with
modern technologies, especially with high technologies, and
improve its combat effectiveness, so as to fulfill all tasks given
by the Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that senior officers must take a leading role in
studying and applying the Party's basic theories and line to live
up to the trust and expectations of the Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Xiaoping always placed great hopes on senior officers
of the army. Now that the historical responsibility of army
building has fallen onto our shoulders, it is up to us to preserve
the nature of the people's army, forever ensure its loyalty to the
Party, the country, the people and socialism, and accomplish our
mission in accordance with Comrade Xiaoping's wishes," he said.

of the rivers of Licungo and Lugela have flooded Alta Zambezia
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged residents living along the rivers to leave these
lowlands for dry upcountry for safety.
</P>
<P>
The rainy season will stop in Alta Zambezia and the two North
Provinces in late March, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Jordanians to Recover Their Properties in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Amid fresh revelations regarding the
existence of several hundred microfilms documenting arab
properties in Israel, a group of prominent Jordanians has vowed to
help those owners get their properties back.
</P>
<P>
A group of prominent public figures has announced the formation
of an association to lobby for the recovery of such properties by
their legitimate owners, Jordan's news agency PETRA reported today.
</P>
<P>
The legal ownership of lands and buildings in areas, now
within Israeli soil, by Jordanians would be documented in
1,340 microfilms kept at the United Nations headquarters in
New York.
</P>
<P>
The 16 and 35 millimeter microfilms reproduce original
registers, dating back to the Ottoman Empire and British
mandate periods, a retired official said.
</P>
<P>
The owners' names and numbers of the blocs on which the
properties were located as well as the size of the plots and the
number of rooms in the houses are specified in the microfilms,
the former director of Jordan's Department of Lands and Survey
Kamal Nasrawi said.
</P>
<P>
"The Jordanian government is in possession of the same data in
full as it bought copies of the microfilms for 30,000 U.S. dollars
from the U.N. in 1974,"said Nasrawi.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli law, Jordanians' properties in the
Jewish state fall under the 1950 Absentee's Property Law.
</P>
<P>
In its acceptance of the 1994 Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty,
the state of Israel specifically rejected any amendment to
the Absentee's Property Law and maintained that the status of
Jordanians' properties "shall not change".
</P>
<P>
To "apply pressure on the Jordanian government to negotiate the
restoration of Jordanians' rights to dispose over their properties
in Israel", 30 influential Jordanians from different professional
backgrounds and public offices, have announced their intention of
registering officially as a society.
</P>
<P>
"we invite any interested person who thinks he or she
can contribute information, assistance or support to our
cause to contact and join us," said Mohammad Atiyeh,
the initiator of the project.
</P>
<P>
According to Atiyeh, prominent lawyers, former
Minister of Interior Raja'i Dajani, well-known
journalists, historians and intellectuals including
Director of the Center for Strategic Studies at the
University of Jordan Mustafa Hamarneh, have expressed their
intention of joining the association which is still in
its preparatory stage.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Warns of Consequence of King's Abdication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh said here today that the abdication of King
Norodom Sihanouk will bring serious consequences to the country
and plunge the King himself into a predicament.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh, the King's son, said that if the King
abdicates, Cambodia will fall into trouble and people will accuse
the King of preparing to enter into political arena.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the King has no intention to get involved in
politics.
</P>
<P>
King Sihanouk made his intention of abdication known in a
bulletin released by the royal palace on February 26, saying he is
"seriously envisaging abdicating without intending to go to live
in another country."
</P>
<P>
But the king was worried that his people may blame him for
possible turmoil in the country caused by his abdication and
accuse him of wanting to resume a political role.
</P>
<P>
"I will never present myself for the 1998 legislative elections
and it will never be a question for me to resuscitate (my old
party) or found a new political party," the 74-year-old king
said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Adherence to Party's Basic Line (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- To modernize China and revitalize
the Chinese nation, the most important and fundamental thing to do
is to hold high the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics and firmly adhere to the
Party's basic line, President Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
"On this vital political issue that concerns the future
and destiny of the Party, the state and the nation, there must not
be the slightest ambiguity or vacillation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also the General Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chairman of
the Central Military Commission, made the remark at a meeting
attended by all deputies to the National People's Congress
(NPC) from the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
The deputies are here attending the ongoing session of the
Eighth NPC.
</P>
<P>
The great achievements China has made in its economy and social
development since the Third Plenary Meeting of the 11th CPC
Central Committee in 1978, the quick recovery and revitalization
of its socialist cause from the catastrophe caused by the
decade-long Cultural Revolution, and China's invincible position
in a turbulent international arena, all these, in the final
analysis, have been due to the fact that China has Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and that
the CPC has a basic line that has taken shape under the direction
of this theory, he said.
</P>
<P>
The overall situation in China is good, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We will face some new trials on the road of progress, which
requires that we keep a clear head. We should firmly persist in
taking economic development as our central task and unify, in a
dialectical way, the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and
opening-up, to ensure that our modernization drive always progress
successfully on a correct path."
</P>
<P>
He urged the PLA, as an armed force to carry out revolutionary
political tasks, to keep firmly in mind Deng Xiaoping's
entrustment, carry out the Party's line and policies in an
exemplary way, and make greater contributions to safeguarding
national security and promoting national development.

BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Describing popular feelings on the
future of Hong Kong, a Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong
affairs said, "When one is tired of Hong Kong, one is tired of
prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council and a member of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
improvised the dictum, imitating Charles Dickens' famous comment
about London that if one was tired of the city, one was tired of
life, at a group discussion attended by CPPCC members from Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
His remark was greeted by enthusiastic applause.
</P>
<P>
"Under the guidance of the great principle of `one country, two
systems' initiated by Deng Xiaoping, under the leadership of the
central authorities with Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin at
the core, with the backing of inland areas, and under the
direction of the chief executive elected by the Hong Kong people,
a smooth transfer of Hong Kong's political power and its
successful return to the motherland are assured," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
At the Global Panel held last November in the Netherlands and
the World Economic Forum held last January in Switzerland, Chen
said, international political figures, scholars and entrepreneurs
all expressed their confidence in the future of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The chief executives of many international financial houses and
multinational corporations expressed their intention to increase
their investment and establish new representative offices in Hong
Kong at the forums, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out, "The international community in the main
expects Hong Kong to fair even better in the future."

<HEADLINE> Butterfly Museum Popular in Guilin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Strings of colorful artificial
butterflies hang from a large tree in Guilin, a scenic city in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, serving as a sign
of welcome to those visiting the museum for butterflies.
</P>
<P>
The Diecai Butterfly Museum has received tens of thousands of
visitors from both at home and abroad since it opened in August of
1995. It is being run jointly by Liu Yaping, a self-employed
businessman and the Binjiang Park in Guilin, best known for its
picturesque mountains and rivers.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 300 sq m, the museum displays some 5,000
butterflies in over 300 categories.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits include teinopalpus aureus, bhutanits thaidina,
and the Chinese agehana elwesi, which are rare Chinese butterflies
under state protection, and precious butterflies from South
America, Indonesia, and Japan, such as the M. Didus tingo masia.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for Effective, Rational Use of Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Leading economists in China said
effective and rational use of overseas funds is crucial to the
country's future opening-up efforts.
</P>
<P>
The economists, who are here attending the Fifth Session of
the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, expressed their approval of the part
concerning overseas investment in Premier Li Peng's government
work report.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Li said China should continue to effectively use
overseas funds, channel more funds into agricultural development,
infrastructure, comprehensive utilization of natural resources,
and high and new technology industries, and toward central and
western regions of China.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the State Statistics Bureau shows that
China used about 51 billion US dollars in overseas funds last
year, including 11 billion in loans and 40 billion in direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
Although meeting the pre-set target, experts said, there do
exist problems "which merit concern."
</P>
<P>
Among the problems they enumerate: some local authorities pay
more attention to the amount of overseas investment attracted than
to investment quality, neglecting assessment of state-owned assets
and the credit of investors; there has been a lack of effective
policy guidance on fund flow with the result that funds did not go
to basic, hi-tech industries that need investment fund most; and
that the growth of foreign investment in interior China is still
lower than in the eastern part.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang Chuanlun from the People's University of China,
a CPPCC National Committee member, suggested strengthening
guidance over and management of overseas capital utilization.
</P>
<P>
"If we intend to acquire new technology and managerial
expertise, then we should attract direct investment from foreign
businesses, especially from ransnationals" he said.
</P>
<P>
Member Wang Linsheng, a professor of Beijing University of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said, "When we open
China's market in a planned way and try to attract more foreign
investment, we need to formulate policies to standardize
competition and prevent monopoly."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government started major policy adjustments on
attracting foreign investment last year.
</P>
<P>
The overall import tariff level was reduced from 35 percent to
23 percent on April 1, 1996; on July 1, overseas-funded businesses
were given access to the country's foreign exchange buying and
selling system; and from December 1, the Chinese yuan became
convertible on the current account.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the central government gave provincial governments
the authority to approve of foreign-funded projects worth a
maximum of 30 million US dollars, from 10 million as had been the
case previously.

<HEADLINE> Dalai's Visit to Taiwan To Harm Ties Across the Straits: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang today warned that the Dalai Lama's upcoming visit to
Taiwan will undermine China's reunification and the relations
across the straits.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama is not an ordinary religious figure, but a
political exile who has long been engaged in activities abroad
aimed at splitting the motherland, Tang said at a press conference
in response to a question on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The political motive for the Dalai's visit to Taiwan is
obvious, and the Taiwan authorities are also clear about it, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"No matter in whatever name the Taiwan authorities invite the
Dalai Lama," Tang said, "his visit will be harmful to the nation's
reunification and the healthy development of relation across the
Taiwan straits."

<HEADLINE> Uganda Distribute Relief in East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Authorities distributed
their first batch of relief in eastern Kumi district last Friday,
a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Almost each of over 5,600 residents in Aakum and Aakide in the
district received one kilogram of maize meal and one kilogram of
beans.
</P>
<P>
This was the first aid relief by the government to help more
than 37,000 people in the drought-hit district.
</P>
<P>
Joab Mutanga, the outgoing resident district commissioner of
Kumi, said, ''Aakide and Aakum were given the priority because
they were the worst hit areas.''
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said eastern Uganda is the most affected by
the dry spells in the country, and Kumi is one of the district
suffering the drought.
</P>
<P>
Valdo Odeke, the district agriculture officer of Kumi, said
people of eight of sixteen counties in his district are already
starving. Many people eat one meal while others eat once in two
or three days.
</P>
<P>
Rainy season is expected to be delayed for a month, and that
will deteriorate the food situation in the country, the
meteorology department warned yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Huge Fire Guts Pretoria City Council Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the
Pretoria City Council's administration complex, the Munitoria
Building, was destroyed by a huge fire on Monday night, said a
source here today.
</P>
<P>
The fire, first detected at about 6.15 p.m. on Monday, was
finally brought under control this morning, nearly 12 hours after
it broke out in the building.
</P>
<P>
About 250 fire-fighters, with the help of troops from an air
force base near Pretoria, struggled into the early hours today to
contain the fire.
</P>
<P>
Five firemen were injured and admitted to hospital, where
their condition was described as being stable.
</P>
<P>
According to Pretoria fire brigade spokesman Johan Pieterse,
the fire broke out in the four-storey west wing of the building
and rapidly spread to the adjacent eight-storey north wing.
</P>
<P>
The fire completely destroyed the entire west wing, which is
housing the tax, licensing, and water and electricity
departments, most of the northern block and left the southern
block with severe smoke and water damage.
</P>
<P>
Pieterse said this was the worst fire in Pretoria since the
top 10 floors of the South African Agricultural Union building
were gutted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria town clerk Henry Enslin said earlier that the
Council's 5,000 office workers would have to stay at home today,
but he called on residents to pay their municipal accounts at
other pay stations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, City Council spokesman Tommy Thomson said although
most council administration records were stored elsewhere, data
captured since August last year, including vehicle registrations
and electricity payments, might have been lost.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the cause of the fire was under
investigation.

<HEADLINE> China Hosts International Symposium on Wetlands Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Workshop on
Wetlands and Water-Bird Conservation opened today in Beidaihe, a
sea-side resort in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Over 120 experts and government officials from Japan, Russia,
the Republic of Korea, Australia, the US and China will hold
academic discussions on the protection of wetlands and water-birds
in the world, and also conduct some on-the-spot investigations.
</P>
<P>
The four-day symposium will also determine the level and mode
of international cooperation for the protection of wetlands and
water-birds in northeast Asia, and will approve a "Beidaihe
Declaration" on the protection work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, participants will discuss the establishment of a
protection network for cranes in northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands, a kind of important natural ecological system and
known as the earth's "kidney," play an invaluable role in
adjusting climate, conserving water, preventing soil-erosion and
resolving pollutants in addition to serving as habitats for a
variety of the world's rare water fowl.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands include all kinds of natural and artificial areas such
as marshlands, lakes, rivers, pools, reservoirs and rice fields.
</P>
<P>
China has 63 million hectares of wetlands, accounting for 11.9
percent of the world's total, which stands at 573 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
The country also has high and cold wetlands on west China's
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is a rarity.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is sponsored by China's Ministry of Forestry,
Japan's Environmental Agency and the Asia-Pacific Branch of the
Wetlands International.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Plans to Buy Ships From Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Navy is preparing to
purchase four tug boats, three fire-fighting boats and four
high-speed landing craft from Russia worth about 50 million
U.S. dollars, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The need for such vessels has emerged as a matter of urgency
for the Turkish Navy because of its lack of adequate vessels in
Turkey," the paper quoted Turkish military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The recent oil tanker disaster in the Tuzla district of
Istanbul where two fire-fighters died has forced the Turkish Navy
to take serious measures to prepare for a fire on board a ship in
the future.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the Turkish Navy also needs to renew
its fleet of vessels with landing ability, stressing that they
must catch up with new technology to "meet the demands of the
21st century."
</P>
<P>
A Turkish delegation will go to Russia to inspect vessels in
a bid to prepare a report for Turkey's plan.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Russia are expected to reach an agreement on the
purchase of the Russian vessels soon, said the sources.

<P>
''foreign investors will not operate in an unhealthy
environment such as that prevailing on the Copperbelta because of

<HEADLINE> Canada Unveils New Auto Emission Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
unveiled new standards for auto emissions and gasoline content in
a bid to reduce pollutants from motor vehicles and fuels.
</P>
<P>
New emission standards for cars, which starts with 1998 models,
will reduce hydrocarbons by 30 percent and nitrogen oxide by 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
"One way to deal with the problems caused by automobile
pollution is to reduce the levels, amounts and toxicity of the
emissions coming out of the tail pipe," Environment Minister
Sergio Marchi was quoted as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Canada will also limit the benzene content of gasoline to one
percent, about half of current levels.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, annual emission of benzene will be reduced by about
3,000 tons, Marchi told an environmental workshop in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced improvements to the Canadian
Environment Protection Act, which would provide wider jurisdiction
to regulate the quality of fuel used by cars.
</P>
<P>
Though the new emission standards were greeted as "admirable,"
some environmentalists insist that they will barely make a dent in
the reduction target for greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
The government has vowed to cap greenhouse gas emissions at
1990 levels, but Canadian cars, factories and buildings are
pumping out ever-increasing amounts of pollution.
</P>
<P>
It's estimated that emissions of greenhouse gases have risen by
at least six percent since 1990. This makes it almost impossible
for Canada to fulfill the commitment it made at the Rio summit on
environment, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Exports Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Africa's share of global exports
reduced from 3.1 percent in the 1950s to only 1.2 percent in the
early 1990s, representing a foreign exchange loss of about 65
billion U.S. Dollars in 1990 prices.
</P>
<P>
The latest Standard Chartered Bank Africa quarterly review
attributed the decline in African exports to the continent's
heavy dependence on primary products with raw material accounting
for over 80 percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
Overvaluation of African currencies has created loss of market
share even for the products in which sub-Saharan Africa has a
clear-cut comparative advantage, according to the review.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a World Bank research also said that african
freight rates are often considerably higher than those on
similar goods from other regions making freight costs a much more
serious barrier to African exports than protectionism.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth Tops Priority for Ethnic Regions: CPPCC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Members of various ethnic groups
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee cited it as an urgent task of national minority
regions to develop economy and catch up with the affluent coastal
area at an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
China's 55 minor ethnic groups distribute mainly in outlying
mountainous, desert and grassland regions, and some of them still
in primitive society decades ago, and their economy is in a
relatively backward stage because of geographical, historical and
other factors.
</P>
<P>
Members of the CPPCC National Committee from various ethnic
minority regions, who are attending the top advisory body's fifth
annual session in Beijing, noted that local governments have made
poverty alleviation and education the first priorities on their
medium and long-term work agenda.
</P>
<P>
Qabe Cedan Puncog, an expert of Tibetan history, said it is the
Tibetan people's wish to develop economy, shake off poverty, and
become well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
"Most Tibetans hope to lead a modern life and enjoy modern
civilization," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Professor Mahsut Akbar of the Uzbek ethnic group in
northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region said that people of
national minorities, too, want to live a new life and have enough
to eat and wear, send their children to new-type schools and
improve the quality of their religious life.
</P>
<P>
All the members believed that their people have benefited from
the country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a hydroelectric station built by the government in
the late 1980s, people of the Blang ethnic group in southwest
China's Yunnan Province have since had access to television.
</P>
<P>
"Television is very popular with our people, especially with
the young people, as it has acquainted us with what's happening
outside and taught us how to use new fertilizers," said Lu
Shixian, a middle school headmaster of Blang ethnic origin.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's Tibet Autonomous Region had its first listed
company, first solar power station, and first modern library, and
1.2 million Tibetan people participated in elections of township
people's congresses. A survey released in the year indicated that
the vast mority of Tibetan people felt contented with the economic
development over the past dozen years.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the central government, along with provinces
and municipalities in the interior and coastal areas, has offered
much aid and investment to ethnic minority regions in the fields
of economy, science and technology, and culture.
</P>
<P>
However, Pan Lizhen, a biologist of the Mulam ethnic group in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, reminded other
members that ethnic regions should not rely on outside assistance
alone for development.
</P>
<P>
"What is more important is to have our own talents in science
and technology," said Pan, who is striving to introduce a new
animal fodder locally for the development of animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
While seeking economic development, Mahsut said, the people of
ethnic minorities should be mindful against a handful of people
with ulterior motive to create confusion, turmoil and even go in
for separatism.
</P>
<P>
"What these sinister people fear are the modernization and a
happy life we are working for," he noted.

<HEADLINE> China Drafts Action Program on Wetlands Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Conserving China's wetlands is a
national priority, said Zhen Rende, director of the wildlife and
forestry department of the Ministry of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Headed by the ministry, 17 ministries and commissions are
formulating the systematic action program to guide the country's
conservation and use of wetlands, Zhen said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the International Workshop on Wetlands which opened
today in this sea-side resort in north China's Hebei Province, he
announced that the program includes the establishment of wetlands
nature reserves, protection of species, spreading of scientific
findings and training of personnel.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands, an important natural ecological system known as the
earth's "kidney" include marshland, lakes, rivers and other
shallow water land.
</P>
<P>
The wetlands are necessary for water conservation, flood
prevention, adjusting weather and maintaining the varieties of
organisms.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 China joined the Convention on Wetlands that was
established in Ramsar, Iran in 1971.
</P>
<P>
To collect the comprehensive information on China's wetlands
resources, China has organized several large-scale investigations
in the past few years and ran several training classes in Jiangxi,
Shandong provinces and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions for the
administration of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, China has more than 63
million hectares of wetlands, accounting for 11.9 percent of the
world's total.
</P>
<P>
Zhen said, for quite a long time, many people believed that the
wetlands were useless mud. Now more and more people have
recognized wetlands' great ecological and economic potential and
the conservation and utilization of wetlands has become an urgent
task.
</P>
<P>
The four-day International Workshop on Wetland, sponsored by
China's Ministry of Forestry, Japan's Environment Agency and
Wetlands International will also arrange investigation of wetlands
 and water birds in Beidaihe.

<HEADLINE> Book on Zhou Enlai's Chronicles to Be Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- "The Chronicle of Zhou Enlai's
Life," covering the years of the late Chinese Premier's life
from 1949 to 1976, will be published soon by the Central
Literature Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
The three-volume book, which contains 1.56 million Chinese
characters, was compiled by the Party Literature Research Center
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Based on the plentiful supply of archives and other materials,
the book will give a detailed account of Zhou's major accomplishments,
contributions and ideas when he served as a vice-chairman of the
CPC Central Committee and the premier of the State Council after
the founding of the People Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
As a key member of the first-generation leadership of the CPC,
he undertook the complicated search for a socialist path that
would be best suited to specific conditions in China, while
exerting his wholehearted devotion to the interests of the Party,
the state and the people, according to the book.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the book will recall Zhou's diligence and competence
in dealing with a myriad of state affairs in order to revitalize
the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the achievements and setbacks that occurred in the
course of socialist construction, carried out by the Chinese
people under the CPC leadership, readers will be able to
understand Zhou's significant work in making and implementing some
policy decisions in such areas as politics, military affairs,
economic construction, foreign affairs, science and technology,
the united work front and culture.
</P>
<P>
Most of the materials used in the book came from the Central
Archives, documents collected by Party and state departments, and
Zhou's diary, most of which will be published for the first time in
this collection.
</P>
<P>
Also included in the book will be articles, diary entries and
interviews with people who had worked with Zhou or had contacts
with him.
</P>
<P>
Compilers said the book provides abundant, detailed and
accurate material for studying Zhou's life and ideas, as well as
the history of the CPC and the country after the founding of New
China.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 4 (Xinhua) --The customs office of the Economic
and Technological Development Zone of Hangzhou has just started
formal operation, announced Zhang Caiyue, head of the customs
office.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, preparations began to establish the customs office
around Hangzhou, the capital city of east China's Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
Since June of 1995 when it started to handle customs on a trial
basis, Zhang's office helped to levy 10 million yuan in tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Zhang believes that the formal operation of the customs office
will improve the investment environment in the development zone
and attract more overseas funds to the area.
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone has
become a base for light industrial, food, electro-mechanical,
textile, pharmaceutical and chemical industrial production and is
listed among one of China's best economic and technological
development zones.
</P>
<P>
The zone attracted 1.2 billion U.S. dollars and generated two
billion yuan (one U.S. dollars equals to 8.3 Chinese currency) of
industrial output value last year.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Eye on Northeast China Economic Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A succession of prestigious
trans-national companies have come to the Changchun Economic
Development Zone in recent years, making it a vital economic
center in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Changchun, approved by the State Council as an export-oriented
state development zone in 1993, absorbed 220 million US dollars of
overseas funds in 1996, making up 70 percent of the city's total
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
To provide a better investment environment, the zone has raised
800 million yuan by issuing bonds and shares and selling land-use
rights to build 14 roads, lay water mains and gas pipelines and
hook up local companies with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
To date, over 180 overseas-funded enterprises have settled in
the zone, bringing in a total contractual volume of 530 million US
dollars. Eleven projects each involved an investment of more than
10 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Owens Corning Company, a leading fiber-glass manufacturer
in the United States, Pepsi Co Inc., also in the US, and the Lion
Group in Malaysia have invested in electronics, auto, grain
processing and refined chemical projects in Changchun.
</P>
<P>
With more overseas investors flowing into the region, the zone
will encourage joint development by several large companies in a
bid to expand production scale. Projects on the government's lists
include an "electronic city," which covers 50 ha of land, and the
Industrial Park of Taiwan region.

<HEADLINE> New Pig-Breeding Technique Fatten A Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A new breeding technique to rapidly
fatten pigs has helped increase profit by two billion yuan for
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Designed to fatten pigs in low temperature, the technique marks
a "revolution" in pig-breeding in the cold areas in northern China.
</P>
<P>
Experts select suitable varieties of pigs and provide a warm
pigsty and mixed feed for them, thus enhancing the continual
growth of the stock through the winter.
</P>
<P>
In this way, mature pigs can be supplied to the market twice in
one year in cold areas, rather than previously once a year.
</P>
<P>
So far, 17 million pigs in Heilongjiang Province have been
raised using this technique.
</P>
<P>
The technique, created in 1990 in Heilongjiang, has been spread
to its neighboring Jilin Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region.

<HEADLINE> ROK Becoming Weihai's Biggest Investment, Trade Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WEIHAI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Business interests from the
Republic of Korea (ROK) will invest more than 100 million
U.S. dollars this year in the coastal city of Weihai, Shandong
Province, according to local officals.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Weihai City, which is separated from the ROC by the

imports and exports with the ROK, which has become the city's
largest investment and trade partner.
</P>
<P>
One of the earliest inland areas to have initiated cooperative
trade agreements with ROK businesses, Weihai City is now home to 566
ROK-financed businesses, according to a local government official.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the city approved 113 ROK directly funded ventures,
with contracts equivalent to 300 million U.S. dollars of ROK
investment.
</P>
<P>
The port city also traded 1.23 billion U.S. dollars worth of

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth is expected to move
moderately faster in the city of Haikou, capital of China's Hainan
Province and the country's largest special economic zone,
according to the city's Mayor Zeng Haorong.
</P>
<P>
Zeng told Xinhua News Agency in a recent interview that the
economy in Haikou started gaining strength in 1996 after a steady
two-year decline.
</P>
<P>
Haikou's economy registered a 1.6 percent rise in 1996 over
that of 1995, with a GDP of 9.88 billion yuan. Output of
agriculture rose 8.2 percent, while that of industry grew 6.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Zeng attributed the upswing of the economy to massive
restructuring of its economic development focus -- from real
estate to sectors like industries, transport, tourism, commerce,
trade, banking, science and technology, and information.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Haikou became one of the 50 cities in China slated for
experiments in optimizing capital structures. Cashing in on the
opportunity, the city extensively revamped its industrial
enterprises, bankrupting three firms, merging three others, and
reorganizing a dozen.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the city used 490 million US dollars of overseas
investment, most of which was channelled into infrastructure and
major industries.
</P>
<P>
This year, experts have a bright outlook for Haikou's
economy. GDP output is expected to grow five percent to hit 11
billion yuan, while investment in fixed assets is estimated at 6.5
billion yuan, an 8.3 percent rise over last year.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Economy on Track of Sound Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The economy in east China's
Zhejiang Province, which has witnessed one of the country's
highest growth rates in recent years, is now firmly on a sound
track of development.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of years of work to transform the economic
growth mode from extensive operation to intensive operation, said
Provincial Governor Wan Xueyuan.
</P>
<P>
The economy in the coastal province grew 13 percent in 1996 to
register a GDP (gross domestic product) of 415 billion yuan, more
than three percent higher than the national average, while the
index of retail prices rose only 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's financial revenues totalled 29.2 billion yuan last
year, up 17 percent. The per-capita income of urban and rural
residents averaged 6,345 yuan and 3,463 yuan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The sound economic growth is also attributable to efforts to
boost the agricultural sector and optimize the industrial
structure, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, chemicals, electronics,
telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and building materials have
grown into new pillar industries and economic growth areas of
Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing industry increased its output value by 195
billion yuan in 1996, up 16 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Continued improvement in infrastructures, particularly
transport facilities, has also stimulated the growth of the
province's economy, Wan added.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that this year, Zhejiang will continue to deepen
economic reforms and promote the transformation of the economic
growth mode, while quickening the pace of restructuring of
state-owned firms.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Has 6,004 Overseas-Backed Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- This coastal city of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, home to 6,004 overseas-financed
businesses, has so far used 4.17 billion U.S. dollars of foreign
funds.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, overseas investment has poured
into Dalian, also a port city, over the past four years, with the
annual contractual sum increasing by two billion U.S. dollars. The
number of projects involving large amounts of overseas funds or
hi-tech or new technology has also been growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
World-renowned companies or transnational corporations have
started more than 40 joint ventures with state-owned enterprises
and conglomerates in Dalian.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the speedy inflow of overseas funds
into the city to Dalian's geographic advantages, good investment
environment and timely investment return.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, 2,850 overseas-backed ventures have
opened, demonstrating good economic efficiency. Last year, they
generated 28.1 billion yuan of output value, up 27 percent over
the previous year. More than 600 joint ventures have increased
investment, with the increased funds amounting to 2.1 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The vast inflow of overseas funds has encouraged the growth of
Dalian's exports; the city is now exporting 18,000 kinds of
commodities, among which electro-mechanical goods hold the lion's
share of the city's total export volume. Export of technology has
also been increasing year by year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city has been more actively seeking out
international economic and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Dalian has conducted such cooperation with overseas companies
in the fields of architecture, fishery, shipping, foreign trade
and manufacturing. Business volume of the contracts signed by the
city for contracting projects overseas or for labor export
totalled 100 million U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Dalian's vibrant economy has advanced the city's
exchanges with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city received 210,000 overseas visitors,
including many foreign government officials and influential
celebrities. The city has also signed letters of intent for
friendly ties with Honolulu of the United States and Toronto of
Canada, and granted the title of "honorary citizen of Dalian" to
17 foreign citizens.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Northwestern Uganda' town of
Koboko was hit by bombs allegedly from southern Sudan last
Saturday, according to a report from today's New Vision paper.
</P>
<P>
Two grass thatched houses in the town were hit and set blazed,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the report failed to tell if there were any
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Military sources in Koboko claimed that the bombs came from
areas west of the border town of Kaya in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Travelers from Koboko which is located one kilometer east from
Zaire and 12 kilometers south from Kaya, said 10 bombs landed
around the town.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan army did not counter attack with shelling, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Francis Ayume, the Ugandan Minister for Lands, Housing and
Urban Development, visited the town after the shelling.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Wamala Katumba, the operation commander of Uganda
People's Defense Forces in West Nile, said the situation there
was under control.
</P>
<P>
No official response from the Ugandan authorities so far has
been available.
</P>
<P>
There was mounted tension in southern Sudan and rumors from
there said rebels from the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)
were preparing their offensive against Sudanese government
troops. The Christian SPLA took up arms in 1983 to fight the
Moslem North in Hhartoum for autonomy and other rights in the
south.

<HEADLINE> Fujian to Eliminate Absolute Poverty This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province has
decided to eliminate absolute poverty this year, three years
earlier than the country's scheduled target.
</P>
<P>
Fujian's 270,000 poor people, or one percent of the province's
total population, are mainly living in 113 remote towns in 11
counties. With a harsh natural environment and poor transportation
services, poverty-relief efforts in these areas are difficult.
</P>
<P>
The local government plans to send 200 provincial officials to
the poor towns to directly head the relief work this year. To
provide additional assistance, provincial government departments
will continue to set up sister-relationships with poor towns.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 22,700 poor residents living in areas with no basic
living conditions will be moved to more prosperous areas.
</P>
<P>
The province has made substantial progress in the past several
years in pulling itself out of its circumstances. In 1996 alone,
Fujian raised 427,000 people out of poverty. But natural disasters
last year sent some 190,000 residents back into near-destitute
situations.
</P>
<P>
China set the poverty line at the annual per capita income
level of 530 yuan. Based on this calculation, the country now has
65 million people living in poverty.

Greater efforts should be made to develop basic tourist

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics show that 44
large and medium-sized state-owned firms in Shanghai, the largest
city in China, went bankrupt last year.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the municipal courts dealt with 52 bankruptcy
cases involving state enterprises, recording total property valued
at three billion yuan and debt of 5.1 billion yuan. The
enterprises had a total work force of 60,000.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has allowed more companies to file bankruptcy
applications over the past two years in a move to quicken its pace
of reform of the state-owned firms, according to the local
government.
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy cases of large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises have been on the rise across the country during this
period, especially in the old industrial bases such as Shanghai
and Liaoning Province in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Officials attribute this mainly to the firms' outdated
technology and equipment, an irrational product mix and
mismanagement.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Philippines' "Jollibee" Bites Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Working hard often means a success.
A Philippine "bee" has been busy working for two decades, and has
now defeated all its Western rivals in its own country.
</P>
<P>
"Jollibee"-- a "busy and happy bee," has become the largest
fast-food company in the Philippines after years of fierce
competition with Western companies.
</P>
<P>
Since it was incorporated in 1978 after starting modestly three
years earlier as a two-branch ice cream parlor, Jollibee Foods
Corp has been busy improving its aggressive marketing and
expansion strategy against its rivals in the Philippines, mainly
Mcdonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and other Western
fast-food heavyweights. And now the strategy has put the company
at the top of the nation's fast-food industry.
</P>
<P>
Jollibee now has a total of 210 stores in the Philippines, and
25 in Asian and Mideast nations and regions, including Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Guam, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, said Achie Sy, marketing
manager of Jollibee, in an interview today.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to open six stores in California, the United
States, in the near future," she said.
</P>
<P>
Jollibee says it has 75 percent of the hamburger chain market
share and 55 percent of the fast-food sector in the country. In
the first nine months of 1996, the company posted 4.56 billion
pesos (174.17 million U.S. dollars) in revenues, a 32 percent
increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, the company will continue to aggressively pursue its
expansion program this year to bolster its stronghold in the local
fast-food industry and increase its presence in markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
In a recent statement, Jollibee said that it is slated to open
40 more branches nationwide this year. This will bring to 250 its
total number of fast-food outlets throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it said, the company is scheduled to open 20
more chains in the United States, Spain, Papua New Guinea and
other countries as part of its expansion program for 1997.
</P>
<P>
What is the secret of Jollibee's success? Just look at the
massive stripped orange-and-yellow bee which stands at the gate of
every Jollibee store and lures lots of kids away from Western
fast-food chains, says Jay Visco, marketing director of Jollibee
International.
</P>
<P>
That's the company's "secret weapon" against its rivals, Visco
said.
</P>
<P>
But obviously, there are other secrets behind Jollibee's
success. According to its executives, Jollibee's menu gives it the
edge over its Western rivals.
</P>
<P>
By offering a mixture of Western and localized fast-food, such
as hamburger, fried chicken and noodles, in the Philippines,
Jollibee has tried to make its taste more suited to Filipinos.
Jollibee's hamburger meat is blended with garlic and soya sauce
before cooking begins. That is different from the American food,
as Americans just grind the beef and cook it.
</P>
<P>
"Most Filipinos do not like the American food, which is hot and
has no taste. Our taste is more suited to local people," said
Achie Sy.
</P>
<P>
Jollibee also seasons fried chicken and spaghetti with sweet
sauce, the taste Filipinos like.
</P>
<P>
Abroad, Jollibee has studied the different taste of local
people and adjusted its manu accordingly, though overseas Jollibee
stores cater mainly for Filipinos working there.
</P>
<P>
Another secret for Jollibee's success is its good service for
customers. In any Jollibee store, one can get his food in one
minute after he places his order, and If one needs delivery, the
nearby Jollibee store would deliver its food to his doorsteps in
less than 30 minutes, the fast-food company claims.
</P>
<P>
Jollibee's success has stimulated its development at home and
abroad. In March 1996, the company earned master franchise rights
to Donut Magic, opening four outlets by the end of the year, and
in July 1996 it opened its first Mary's chicken restaurant.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the company bought 40 Greenwich pizza outlets and has
since opened another 30.
</P>
<P>
Jollibee's success is amazing. Analysts here said that When
Western fast-food chains are holding larger and larger shares of
the Asian markets, the "busy and happy bee" (Jollibee) is biting
back.

The United States also has the largest number of sexual
assaults of any country in the world. In 1993, 118 in every
100,000 women between the ages of five and 59 were raped. Sexual
harassment of women has reached epidemic proportions in
U.S. society.
</P>
<P>
A 1995 survey reported that 76 percent of women polled said
that sexual harassment happened at their places of work and 62
percent of them complained that they had encountered such
misconduct. Sexual harassment is also rampant on American
campuses. The American Association of University Women reported in
a 1993 study that 80 percent of female students had been the
victims of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
The state of American children is worsening. America has the
highest rate of violence against children in the industrialized
world and the highest child fatality rate in the world arising
from shooting, homicide and suicide.
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials reported in February this year that
among the 26 industrialized countries surveyed, America's child
homicide rate was five times as high as the combined rate of
the 25 other nations.
</P>
<P>
Its child suicide rate was twice as high as their aggregate
rate and the number of children shot dead was almost 12 times that
of the other 25 countries combined. Homicide has become the fourth
biggest killer of American children between the ages of one and
four.
</P>
<P>
USA Today reported in 1995 that the number of U.S. children who
died because of violence that year was five times as high as 10
years before. Every day, 15 children were killed by gunfire. In
1994, one in every 14 school children across the country was
threatened or hurt by gunfire.
</P>
<P>
Poverty is the number one cause of child death in America.
According to a study issued by a Maryland foundation on June 3,
1996, 15 million American children live in poverty, accounting for
26 percent of all children and 40 percent of the impoverished
population overall.

In 1994, 12 million children in the United States, or 20
percent of the country's child population, were underfed,
accounting for 40 percent of all people across the country without
enough food. In 1995, 301 in every 1,000 American children under
12 were starving. Information published by the Children's Defense
Fund indicated that in America, 2,660 children were born into
poverty each day, of whom 27 died of poverty.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 10,000 children die directly of
poverty each year and 100,000 homeless children are forced to
sleep in the streets.
</P>
<P>
Poverty and despair has turned many juveniles into
criminals. The U.S. Justice Department said in a March 7, 1996
report that more than 150,000 young people were arrested in 1994
for violent crimes such as murder, rape and robbery. The figure
was a record high in American history. Over the previous decade,
the number of juvenile murderers showed a two-fold increase and
the number of juveniles arrested for violence jumped 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Child abuse is serious in America. Investigations indicate
that three million children were abused or maltreated. A national
center for missing children estimated that 1.5 million children
disappeared each year, of whom 1 million escaped from home or were
thrown out by their parents.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported on August 19, 1996 that America
had more than 200,000 child victims of sexual abuse. The
Children's Defense Fund said in 1996 that every day, 8,493
American children were abused or maltreated and three died as a
result of abuse. Nationwide, more than 1,800 children under four
died of abuse or maltreatment. The figure increased to more than
2,000 if children between four and 17 who died of the same causes
were added.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 130,000 poor people were lifted
out of poverty last year in northwest China's Yan'an, the city
known as the cradle of the Chinese revolution.
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, Yan'an was the headquarters of the Chinese
Communist Party, and its political reputation was later spread
overseas by Edgar Snow, an American reporter who visited the area
and wrote the book, "The Red Star Over China."
</P>
<P>
Yan'an has been involved in a poverty-relief campaign since
1986, and the number of poor people has dropped from 670,000
in that year to the current 250,000.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since 1990, the city has spent over 50
million yuan (about 6.3 million US dollars) on more than 70
projects to develop its industry, infrastructural facilities and
technology. Some 1,000 villagers were organized by the government
to visit prosperous regions in other provinces to learn advanced
agricultural techniques.
</P>
<P>
The city has set up six major regional production bases,
covering a total area of 600,000-plus mu (over 40,000 hectares),
with two mu per capita.
</P>
<P>
Technical personnel have been dispatched to poor villages to
provide services and training for farmers, benefiting some 100,000
local residents. Eighty-two percent of the farmers have set up
their own business and have a stable income.

7. Human Rights Violations Against Other Nations
</P>
<P>
The U.S. human rights record outside its territorial boundaries
is not that glorious either. Since its founding over 200 years
ago, the U.S. has launched more than 70 wars and acts of
aggression against other countries, killing countless foreign
civilians with its troops and weapons.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the only country in the world which has
actually used nuclear weapons. It has conducted more nuclear
tests than any other country and possesses the largest nuclear
arsenal. A 1995 report said that America had 25,000 nuclear
weapons. Since the explosion of its first atomic bomb in 1945,
America has conducted 1,030 nuclear tests, accounting for more
than half of the world's total of 2,037 tests.
</P>
<P>
Its military spending is also the largest in the world. In
1994, it amounted to 274.3 billion dollars, more than twice as
much as the combined spending of eight other countries including
Russia, China and India. Currently, its average daily spending on
nuclear weapons is 80 million dollars. From 1940 to 1995,
America's total nuclear weapons spending was four trillion
dollars. Its nuclear weapons spending in 1995 alone was 27 billion
dollars. If this money was used to solve the poverty problem in
third world countries, it would relieve hundreds of millions of
people from poverty.
</P>
<P>
The United States has long maintained many military bases in
various places outside its territorial boundaries and deployed
hundreds of thousands of troops there. Its overseas troops have
committed numerous human rights violations against local citizens.

The rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl in Okinawa, Japan, in 1995
by three American servicemen and the beating to death of a South
Korean woman in 1996 by a U.S. soldier, are just two of the latest
examples. Statistics indicate that since 1967, a total of 34,900
cases of rape, beating and murder of local people by South
Korea-based American servicemen have been reported, on average
three cases a day. Since 1972, U.S. troops in Japan have committed
4,716 crimes, or 205 cases a year, against local people, 106 of
which were targeted against women.
</P>
<P>
According to reports in the February 10, 1997, edition of the
Washington Post, in late 1995 and early 1996 amid Okinawans'
furious protests against American soldiers' rape of the
schoolgirl, American troops there "accidentally" fired 1,520
uranium-tipped bullets on an island near Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
America is the world's largest arms dealer. Its overseas arms
sales since 1989, according to a December 12, 1994 Time magazine
article, hit 82.4 billion dollars, more than the combined total
(66.8 billion dollars) of all other countries in the world, and
now its share of the world's arms sales market has reached 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
The German pictorial Der Stern reported in 1995 that America
had captured three quarters of the post-Cold War world weapons
market, reaching 146 countries and regions. More and more American
weapons have been used to trigger wars and unrest, said the
pictorial. USA Today also reported in 1994 that warring parties in
39 of the 48 ethnic conflicts around the world in the previous
year obtained weapons from the United States. No wonder the
U.S. has been dubbed "the world's largest exporter of death."
</P>
<P>
America is also the world's leading waste exporter. To evade
the responsibility of harnessing pollution within U.S.
territory, the authorities and capitalists have been trying all
means, fair or foul, to export waste overseas, especially to
developing countries. Such toxic garbage is seriously damaging
the environment of these countries and jeopardizing the health of
their people.

The United States reportedly produces 275 million tons of toxic
waste a year, with over 10 million tons exported to the third
world. In 1995 alone, a May 4, 1996 article in Thailand's New
Chinese Daily News reported, the United States exported 200
million pounds (90,800 tons) of plastic waste to about 30
countries and regions including China. U.S. businessman William
Ping Chen smuggled 238 tons of garbage to China in just six months
from July to December 1995.
</P>
<P>
While U.S. human rights reports rattle on about human rights
violations in other countries, it has been refusing to join the
major international conventions on human rights adopted by the
United Nations. They include the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the International Convention
on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid; the
Covenant on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women; and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
As for the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, the United States reluctantly ratified it only in 1992, 26
years after it was adopted by the United Nations. And it
restricted the covenant's implementation strictly within the
framework of its constitution by adding a string of reservations,
understandings, statements and agreements so that the document
would apply only to the federation, not to the states, and could
not come into force automatically. These preconditions make the
document not worth the paper it is written on.
</P>
<P>
The United States' hegemonic acts of refusing to accept
international norms and frequently infringing upon other
countries' sovereignty and human rights have earned it the
notoriety of being the most condemned country in the world at the
end of this century.
</P>
<P>
As a popular saying goes, one should first correct oneself
before trying to correct others. It is bizarre indeed that the
United States, with such a poor human rights record of its own,
should act as the world's human rights judge and concoct human
rights reports year after year, mounting "crusades" against other
countries.
</P>
<P>
If the United States insists on having its own way, it will
inevitably provoke more counterattacks from other countries. In
the end, it will only hurt itself with the very stick it has been
brandishing against others. We strongly advise the U.S. government
to put its own house in order before pointing its finger at other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Official on Peace Talks, Fighting with KNU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Myanmar military
official said here today that the government's current mopping-up
operation against the Kayin National Union (KNU), the largest
anti-government ethnic armed group in the country, had inflicted
heavy losses to the KNU.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Kyaw Thein, head of the Office of Strategic Studies of
Myanmar Defense Services, disclosed at a news briefing that
government troops started the operation in areas of Kayin state
and Tanintharyi division on February 10 against the KNU, which has
been active along the Myanmar-Thai border for nearly 50 years.
</P>
<P>
He said the operation is still going.
</P>
<P>
"The situation of peace talks between the government and the
KNU right now depends on the KNU, whether they genuinely wish for
peace," he said. "If they wish for peace, the door is open."
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government and the KNU started their first round of
peace talks in December 1995 after the government unilaterally
suspended all operations against the KNU in April 1992.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth round of talks in November last year, Kyaw Thein
said, the KNU backed down from all agreements reached previously
with the government and ignored calls to "re-enter the legal
fold."
</P>
<P>
He denounced the KNU for sponsoring meetings with some other
underground political organizations after the failure of the peace
talks and issuing statements against the government.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the KNU of allowing their camps based at the
Myanmar-Thai border to be used as staging points to "commit acts
of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The KNU is the only remaining one of Myanmar's 16
anti-government ethnic armed groups which has yet to make peace
with the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A bomb went off outside the
offices of another major Urdu newspaper early today in Pakistan's
largest city of Karachi, but caused no casualties, sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was another bomb blast in the capital of the southern Sindh
province within just 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which occurred outside a seven-storey building of
the Jang Group of newspapers, brought about a huge panic among the
staffs inside the offices, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
No group or people have claimed responsibility for the blast.
</P>
<P>
A time-bomb ripped through the office of the Urdu language
daily newspaper Qaumi Akhbar early Monday, slightly injuring two
employees and causing major property damage.
</P>
<P>
The damage caused by Monday's explosion is estimated by the
executive editor of the Qaumi Akhbar at 250,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Monday that the incident
amounts to an attack on the freedom of the press and he ordered
Sindh provincial authorities to net the culprits as soon as
possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States State Department
released its "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1996"
on January 30, 1997, once again distorting and attacking at length
the state of human rights in China and more than 190 other
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, posing as "the human rights judge of the
world," turned a blind eye yet again to the serious human rights
problems in its own country and did not utter a single word about
them in the report.
</P>
<P>
In fact, it is the United States itself, the self-declared
"human rights authority," that has a very poor human rights record
in the world today.
</P>
<P>
1. Constitutional Protection Below International Standards
</P>
<P>
The United States is a country whose constitution does not
provide adequate protection for human rights and basic
freedom. Firstly, the U.S. Constitution does not have a general
stipulation on the right to equality. As everyone knows, equality
is the core of human rights and a major theme in the human rights
documents and practices of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
While the right to equality is generally stipulated as a basic
content and principle of human rights in the constitutions of
various countries, the U.S. Constitution adopted in 1787 and its
amendment, the Bill of Rights, adopted in 1789, do not contain
provisions concerning the right to equality. The word "equality"
is not even found in them.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the U.S. Constitution of that time contains
articles explicity referring to maintaining the system of slavery
and racial discrimination, excluding blacks, Indians, women and
the poor from the protection of human rights.

<HEADLINE> Solar Eclipse-Comet Meeting in Mohe to attract Thousands of Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- With the simultaneous occurrence of
a total solar eclipse and the close encounter of the Hale-Bopp
comet on March 9, thousands of would-be star-gazers have applied
for seats on a specially arranged "observation tour" train.
</P>
<P>
The total eclipse will be observable about 9 a.m. in Mohe County,
coinciding with the arrival of the Hale-Bopp comet, which occurs
once every 3000 years. Mohe County is located at the northernmost
end of China's border, in the Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The more than 1,000 seats of the special train for star-gazers
have already been sold out, prompting the Harbin Railway Travel
Service to plan to run another special train to that region.
</P>
<P>
The train will provide food and accommodations since Mohe
County does not have many hotel beds and can provide only limited
services.
</P>
<P>
Among the honored guests of the first "star-observing train"
are nearly 100 experts from Beijing Observatory, Nanjing-based
Purple Mountain Observatory and Xi'an Observatory, including seven
professors.
</P>
<P>
The amateur astronomers on the train include teachers, workers,
staff members and self-employed personnel. Many parents will bring
their children to observe the unique scene that will not reoccur for
thousands of years to come.

<P>
After abolishing slavery, the United States adopted the 14th
Constitutional Amendment in 1868, which stipulates that "no State
shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws." But the second section of the amendment
specified the "person" as "male citizens 21 years of age,"
"excluding Indians not taxed." Racial and sexual discrimination is
explicit.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Amendment requires only the "State," not the
"federal government," to provide equal protection under the
law. In 1870 and 1920, the United States adopted the 15th and 19th
Amendment respectively to abandon racial and sexual discrimination
in respect of the franchise, but it did not go on to establish
equality among ethnic groups and between men and women.
</P>
<P>
A constitutional amendment was made in 1923 to ensure equality
between men and women only to become a dead bill in 1982 after
almost 60 years because it failed to be ratified by the required
number of state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the U.S. Constitution does not recognize people's
economic, social and cultural rights as part of human
rights. Human rights as defined by the U.S. Constitution's Bill of
Rights and other amendments do not go beyond the scope of civil
and political rights.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a few rights, including the right to join trade
unions or choose jobs, most of the economic, social and cultural
rights specified in the World Human Rights Declaration and the
International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
are not recognized as human rights and therefore not protected by
the U.S. Constitution.

<P>
Under the U.S. Constitution, the right to food, clothing,
shelter and education, the right to work, rest, reasonable
payment, appropriate working conditions, labor protection and
social welfare, and the right to sound physical and mental health
and the protection of the family, mothers and children do not fall
into the category of "human rights." The U.S. Constitution
provides no guarantee for the American people to be free from
starvation and want.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, human rights protection provided by the U.S.
Constitution is also very limited. The International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights provides a much wider range of
protection and requires every country to adopt "legislative or
other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights
recognized by the present Covenant."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Constitution, however, merely lists a few individual
rights and stipulates that they not be encroached upon by the
government. But it does not ask or authorize Congress or the
federal government to take positive measures to promote and
protect those rights or adopt remedial measures when violations
occur.
</P>
<P>
The United States always portrays itself as the incarnation of
the "international human rights model." However the level of
constitutional rights granted to its citizens is far below
internationally accepted standards. Even Louis Henkin, an American
constitutional scholar, has noted that U.S. commitments to
protecting human rights, especially the right to equality and
social and economic rights fall short of the international
standards of today.

2. Moneybag Democracy
</P>
<P>
The United States, which brags about being the model of
democracy, has been peddling its democratic system throughout the
world with wishful thinking, although everyone knows that this
200-year-old American democracy remains a democracy for the rich.
</P>
<P>
For a long period after the founding of the United States,
suffrage remained, both in practice and in law, the privilege of a
small number of rich, white males. It took 94 years for the
blacks, 144 years for women and 172 years for the Indians to
win their right to vote.
</P>
<P>
It was not until 1971, nearly 200 years after the founding of
the republic, that the United States legally recognized universal
suffrage. Even so, universal suffrage has never been realized in
its true sense. Voter turnout has always been low and the turnout
in every election for the U.S. House of Representatives since the
beginning of this century has hovered somewhere between 30 and 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the presidential election, which is cited as a major
political event in the country, the highest voter turnout was only
65 percent. Since a presidential candidate needs only a simple
majority of votes to win the election, U.S. presidents are
actually elected by a very small proportion, often below 35
percent, of eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, voter turnout in the 1996 presidential
election was only 49 percent, the lowest since 1924. That means
the president had the support of only some 25 percent of eligible
voters. It is obvious that the results of the so-called general
election reflects neither the will of the people as a whole nor
the majority.

Political democracy in the United States has always been a game
of the rich. Since the early days of the republic, the
overwhelming majority of high public office holders, including
presidents, vice presidents, members of the cabinet and the
Supreme Court, have come from families in the richest five percent
of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Even the U.S. Congress, which always boasts about its so-called
link to ordinary people, is in fact a congress of the rich, by the
rich and for the rich. According to reports in the Washington
Post in April 1994, at least 28 senators, more than a quarter of
the Senate, were millionaires. Millionaires also accounted for
11.5 percent of the members of the House of Representatives, more
than 50 congressmen. The ratio of millionaires in the
U.S. Congress was at least 30 times that in U.S. society as a
whole where the ratio is less than 0.5 percent. At least a quarter
of the Republican senators elected in 1994 were millionaires.
</P>
<P>
American democracy is, in the final analysis, a "moneybag
democracy." In the United States, running for public office
requires large sums of money. Without money, it is virtually
impossible to run for offices like the presidency and
Congress. Statistics show that the average spending per candidate
who won a Senate race was 4.5 million U.S. dollars in 1994, or
more than six times that in 1976. A candidate had to raise an
average of 15,000 dollars a week over six years to get that amount
of money.
</P>
<P>
The cost of a presidential race is even more breathtaking.
According to a non-profit election watch group, the total cost of
the presidential race and the Congressional elections hit a record
high of 1.762 billion dollars in 1996. The presidential race alone
cost a record 1.145 billion dollars, more than double the 550
million dollars of the 1992 presidential election.

Results of past presidential elections show that the candidate
who spends most tends to win. It is a rare exception for the
candidate with less money to win the election. Even the
Independent, a British newspaper, noted in a story on January 28,
1996, that money is the key to the White House.
</P>
<P>
American politics has become more and more the politics of
buying power through money. Political campaign finances in the
United States are funded mainly through donations from large
wealthy organizations and individuals. According to statistics,
70 percent of campaign donations come from big corporate
donors. In the 1996 elections, both the Democrats and the
Republicans raised huge amounts of money by auctioning
opportunities to meet the president or congressmen.
</P>
<P>
At a fund-raising party of the Democratic National Committee,
those who donated 100,000 dollars got dinner with the president
and the vice president. Fund-raising parties of the Republican
National Committee were just the same: those who donated 250,000
dollars could personally present their views before some Senate or
House committees and attend a luncheon with House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
The Public Ethics Center published a report entitled "The
Buying of the President" in 1996 after examining the relationship
between presidential races and money. The report described the
election as a package deal and a grand auction. The election not
only selects political figures, but also sponsors and priorities.
</P>
<P>
An official of the U.S. Natural Law Party noted on December 5,
1996, that although the United States calls itself a democratic
country, there is no democracy in the nation's political life
and the allowing of private donations in elections has actually
legalized bribery.

3. A Land of Terror
</P>
<P>
Terrifying bomb explosions in the United States in recent years
have stunned the world. In February 1993, a 1,500 pound car bomb
damaged the underground garage of the 110-story World Trade Center
in the financial district of Manhattan, New York, killing six
people and injuring more than 1,000 others, and forcing 50,000
employees and tourists to flee the building.
</P>
<P>
In April 1995, a powerful 1,200 pound car bomb destroyed a
federal office building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, killing 168
people and injuring 850 others. Among the victims were 19 children
in a day-care center in the building. In July 1996, a bomb
explosion in the Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, Georgia,
killed two people and injured more than 110 others during the
Olympic Games, a sports event that attracted world-wide attention.
</P>
<P>
It is not accidental that terrorist bomb attacks continuously
occur in the United States, an excessively violent country where
terrorism is deeply rooted in society.
</P>
<P>
The United States has the highest rate of violent crime in the
world. An average of two million violent crimes occur annually
with six million victims, of whom 24,000 are murdered.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Justice Department in August 1995, a crime
occurs every two minutes and a violent crime every seven minutes
in the United States. In Florida, which is knowned as a "state
full of crime", an average of 1.1 million crimes and 1,263 murders
are reported every year.
</P>
<P>
In the U.S. capital, Washington, D.C., the annual murder rate
is 80.6 out of every 100,000 people. In New York, 2,000 people are
murdered, 3,000 raped and 93,000 robbed every year. According to a
report released by the Inter-American Development Bank, between
eight and 11 out of every 100,000 people are killed in the United
States every year, 10 times higher than in China.

The United States also has the highest rate of rape in the
world, with half a million cases reported annually, one case
almost every minute. A report released by the U.S. Justice
Department in 1996 showed the nation's economic losses caused by
crime amounts to 500 billion dollars a year, twice the
country's defense spending in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the world's number one gun-owning
country. There are 220 million firearms in private hands, which
translates into nearly one gun per person. Armed criminals are on
the rampage, shootings are non-stop, a large number of
innocent people have fallen prey to violence.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that one million crimes involving firearms
occur every year and more than 20,000 people are shot and
killed. In addition, more than 10,000 people a year commit suicide
by shooting themselves and 200 people are killed by accidental
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
shows that 39,720 people were killed and about 110,000 others
injured by firearms in 1994. In seven states, shooting incidents
were the major cause of death and injury.
</P>
<P>
Official reports released at the end of 1996 show the number of
violent crimes has receded since 1992, with the rate of homicides
falling to 8.2 per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
But a report issued by a crime committee in the same year noted
that the nation's crime rate was actually much higher, with
homicides, rapes, assaults and robberies 5.6 times as high as
official figures. The report shows that contrary to official
reports, crime figures remain at their highest level in history
and that violent crime is a ticking time bomb in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States has one of the world's largest police forces
relative to its population and the largest prison population. A
report released by the U.S. Justice Department on June 30, 1996
said the number of people serving a sentence in the country was
5.36 million, three in every 100 adults.
</P>
<P>
By June 30, 1996, there were 1.63 million prison inmates in the
United States, up 120 percent from the 740,000 prisoners 10 years
ago or three times that 20 years ago, according to a Justice
Department report released on January 20, 1997. One out of every
162 Americans is in jail.

of Washington, D.C.. A spokesman for the American Civil Liberties
Union's prison program noted that the United States is the only
country in the world that has been putting more and more people
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 4,000 prisons in the United States, but the
number and capacity is still too small to cope with the growing
number of criminals and many are overcrowded. A report from the
U.S. Justice Department in August 1996 said that in 1995 federal
prisons were overcrowded by 26 percent and state prisons by 14 or
25 percent, with some prisons having three times the number of
inmates they were built for.
</P>
<P>
Crowded and lacking necessary sanitary facilities, prisons are
permeated with hostility and have become places that breed
violence, rape and disease. Some civil rights organizations in the
United States reported that certain prisons, filthy and run-down,
are no different from the medieval lairs of small animals.
</P>
<P>
Prison guards mounted on horseback keep watch on inmates as
though they are herding animals. Inmates are sometimes forced to
fight among themselves and are whipped. Many are locked up in
separate cells all year round without being let out into the
sunshine while others, handcuffed and fettered for violating
prison rules, have to crawl on the floor to eat, and lick their
plates like dogs.
</P>
<P>
U.S. prisons are schools for crime, as more than 40 percent of
those who have served their sentences re-commit crimes. About 75
percent of juvenile offenders freed from Washington, D.C. juvenile
correction centers re-offend. At present, 45 percent of the
prisoners are in jail for the third time at least.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, violence and imprisonment are two sides
of the same coin. The high crime rate leads to a high imprisonment
rate which in turn breeds a higher crime rate, creating a vicious
circle which is almost impossible to break.

4. Poverty, Hunger and the Homeless
</P>
<P>
The United States is the richest country in the world, but
because of the serious polarization between the rich and poor, the
issues of poverty, hunger and the homeless have always been an
inherent malady in its society.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the haves and have-nots in the United States is
one of the widest in the western world. According to statistics,
the richest 1 percent of families today possess 40 percent of the
nation's wealth.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the U.S. Census Bureau show that in 1994 the
average income of the richest 20 percent of families was 14.7
times that of the poorest 20 percent of families. The Washington
Post reported last year that the pay for chief executives of major
companies in 1974 was generally 35 times that of the average
workers, a figure which shot up to 120 times in 1995.
</P>
<P>
New York City is home to 36,000 millionaires, and at the same
time home to 36,000 poor people who survive by scavenging for food
in trash cans.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this polarization, the number of poor people is
increasing. The Christian Science Monitor wrote in 1995 that since
1973, the real income of 80 percent of American families had
declined or remained the same, their living standards had fallen
significantly, and they have suffered a significant loss in their
economic security.
</P>
<P>
At constant prices, the average hourly pay for American
employees fell 0.73 percent between 1974 and 1993. In 1978, 24.5
million Americans lived below the poverty line; by 1993 the figure
had risen to 39.3 million. In its January 1995 issue, the Hong
Kong monthly Wide Angle said the number of Americans below the
poverty line had climbed to some 50 million, about one fifth of
the nation's population.

<P>
Poverty results in hunger. A Reuter story on January 16, 1996,
said 26 million Americans, one in 10 of the population, lived on
hand-outs from charity institutions. Statistics from the
U.S. Congressional Hunger Center show that there are 30 million
Americans, including 4.9 million elderly, who cannot afford
adequate food and have to go hungry. In 1995, one sixth of
California's residents, some 5 million people, did not have enough
to eat.
</P>
<P>
The homeless issue epitomizes the social illness afflicting the
United States. According to U.S. official data, there were seven
million homeless people in the late 1980s, accounting for 2.8
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
In May 1994, in a "strategic plan" on the homeless, the
U.S. government estimated there were 9.52 million homeless people
in the country, of whom 43 percent were drug users, 26 percent had
mental disorders, eight percent were Aids patients or HIV
carriers, and 40 percent were alcoholics.
</P>
<P>
Every winter, about one thousand homeless people die on the
streets from the cold. Statistics show that in the winter of 1991,
some 1,750 homeless people died in 19 large and medium-sized
cities excluding New York, half of whom were found dead on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
In January 1996, a U.S. homeless organization reported that in
the eight years to 1995, more than 100 homeless people died every
year in San Francisco. In 1995 itself, the homeless death toll in
the city exceeded 140. U.S. President Bill Clinton has to admit
that the issue of the homeless has become a serious headache and
one of the most embarrassing issues in American society.

5. Deep-rooted Racial Discrimination
</P>
<P>
The whole world is aware of racial discrimination in the United
States. The racial genocide of native Americans and the bloody
enslavement of black people based on the slave trade are two
indelible blemishes on American history.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have witnessed one scandal of racial
discrimination after another in America. The large-scale racial
conflicts triggered by the 1992 beating of black driver Rodney
King by white policemen, the popularity of the 1994 book "The
Bell Curve" that openly advocates black inferiority, the racial
response to the so-called "trial of the century" in 1995 in which
O.J. Simpson was charged with murder, the "Million Man March" and
the growing number of incidents against immigrants have all
clearly demonstrated that discrimination against ethnic minorities
remains the darkest abyss in American society.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, blacks and other ethnic minorities have
always been second-class citizens. Black people, who account for
12 percent of the American population, occupy only five percent of
elected positions at various levels and one percent of the seats
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
A 1995 U.S. government survey indicated that although women and
ethnic minorities accounted for two-thirds of the total population
and 57 percent of the total workforce, 97 percent of the
high-level executives in big businesses were white males. In
contrast, the unemployment rate among black people was twice as
high as that among whites.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, while the national unemployment rate was 5.6 percent,
15.9 percent of black adults, 40 percent of black youth and 46
percent of native Americans were out of work. The poverty rate
among blacks, Hispanics and Indians was more than 30 percent,
three times that for whites, and the chances of black children
living in poverty were four times greater than for white
children.

<P>
Among the homeless, 48 percent were blacks. Both the mortality
rate for black infants and the number of black women who died of
heart disease were twice as high as that of their white
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
A report from a U.S. national AIDS committee notes that black
and Hispanic Americans, who make up 21 percent of the total
population, account for 46 percent of the AIDS patients registered
so far in the country.
</P>
<P>
Racial discrimination in America's judicial system is also a
serious problem. Although blacks, Hispanics and other minority
people account for less than a quarter of the American population,
they account for two-thirds of criminals serving a sentence and 70
percent of all those jailed. Blacks, who make up 12 percent of the
population, account for 54.2 percent of the prison population and
more than 40 percent of those sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
A study report presented by Maurice Glele-Ahanhanzo, a special
rapporteur of the United Nations Commission of Human Rights, who
toured the United States in October 1994, said that sentences
meted out to blacks and colored people were usually two or three
times as severe as those given to whites for committing the
same crime. The number of blacks sentenced to death for killing
whites were four times that of whites condemned for killing blacks.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported in 1995 that although the number of
murder victims in the country since 1977 was divided almost
equally between blacks and whites, 85 percent of those who received
capital sentences were blacks for killing whites. Only 11
percent were whites for killing blacks.
</P>
<P>
Statistics in 1991 in the U.S. showed that the country had the
highest number of juveniles sentenced to death and that all
juveniles condemned to death in the country were blacks.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. national drug addiction research group reported that
although 80 percent of drug users in the country were whites, only
seven percent of those arrested for taking drugs were whites while
28 percent were blacks. Blacks accounted for 98 percent of those
receiving life sentences for cocaine addiction.

Racial discrimination is so pervasive in America that three of
the country's five largest sites for hazardous commercial waste
are in black or Hispanic ghettos, and 60 percent of these
minorities live in areas with hazardous waste sites. In 25
states and 50 major cities, two-thirds of black and Hispanic
residents live close to toxic waste sites. Indian reserves are also
targets pursued by waste disposal companies. Blacks and colored
people in very poor housing conditions have little access to the
housing allowances or home loans provided by the government.
</P>
<P>
Washington, D.C. boasts of hundreds of branches of 15 major
banks in addition to dozens of small and medium-sized banks. Yet
the value of loans offered to white communities (areas with more
than 75 percent white residents) during the 1985-1991 period were
twice as high as those offered to black communities (areas with 75
percent black residents). In fact, some black communities have
never had access to home mortgages from the banks.
</P>
<P>
Racism in the United States has been growing in recent years,
and racial violence erupts frequently. In 1991 alone, 4,558 such
cases were reported. Since early 1995, more than 30 black
churches in southern U.S. states have been burnt down by white
racists. Within a matter of 10 days in June 1996, five such
incidents occurred.
</P>
<P>
A study released on August 5, 1996, by the National Asia-
Pacific American Legal Consortium reported that a total of 458
cases of anti-Asian violence were filed in 1995, 37 percent up
from 1993. A Mexican official report said that 1995 saw 72,864
human rights violations against Mexican immigrants in the United
States. Some 100 Mexicans have been killed by American police and
border patrols since 1990, but most culprits are still at large.
</P>
<P>
Discrimination against blacks and colored people is
an inherent evil in the U.S. and this tragic problem continues to
plague American society.

6. The Deplorable State of Women and Children
</P>
<P>
Sex discrimination is a long-standing problem which still dogs
American society today.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in September 1995 by a U.S. company reported
that 84 percent of the female respondents said they still faced
restrictions and discrimination of one form or another. Not until
1920 did American women legally win the same voting rights as
men. Today, women have only about 10 percent of the seats in
Congress and less than 12 percent of senior federal posts.
</P>
<P>
The "USA Today" newspaper reported on January 27, 1997, that
12.2 million women stayed at home as housewives in 1995, more than
double the 5.5 million figure reported in 1970. Statistics
indicate that on average American women have 32 percent fewer job
opportunities than men do, while their unemployment rate is more
than twice as high as men's.
</P>
<P>
The majority of American women work in the low-paid service
sector. A 1995 survey by the magazine Fortune reported that women
accounted for only 5 percent of top-level executives in
U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, men and women do not receive equal pay for equal
work. Waitresses in restaurants are paid the equivalent of
only 75 percent of the wages paid to their male counterparts, and
the incomes of male scientists are generally 24 to 35 percent
higher than their female counterparts. Female civil servants at
different levels earn only about half of the salaries of their
male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, 14.9 percent of American women lived in poverty, more
than 1.5 times the poverty rate for men. A 1996 report by the
Older Women's League of the U.S. said that 73 percent of American
women over 55, who accounted for 60 percent of the female
workforce, lived below the poverty line and received only 66
percent of the pay received by men of the same age group. In 1993,
the average annual income of retired women over 65 was only 57
percent of that received by men of the same age.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the number of violent crimes against
women is appallingly high. Each year, more than six million women
were beaten and 4,000 were murdered, according to a Los Angeles
Times report on December 27, 1995. One case of family violence
occurred every 18 seconds, and one in three women were victims of
such offenses. Between 2,000 and 4,000 women were beaten to death
every year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A five-member delegation of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) will arrive here on Thursday on
a two-week visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team will hold extensive discussions with Pakistan
government officials for the third review of Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA) both on technical and policy matters, according to a local
press report today.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has received two trenches of 80 million U.S. dollars
each from the reactivated and augmented SBA released by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government is facing a lot of problems in the
implementation of the SBA, which was agreed to and approved during
the caretaker government's tenure.
</P>
<P>
"We will apprise our position to the IMF team and we have
bright chances to get some conditions relaxed," the report quoted
an official source as saying.
</P>
<P>
After coming into power, the government of Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif has launched an extensive National Debt Retirement Program,
which has attracted a lot of money both in foreign and local
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will send its recommendations to the IMF
Executive Board for whether releasing or not the third trenche
from the SBA, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Denies Difference Over Major Hydro Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Prime Minister's Office
(PMO) of Nepal has denied any difference within the government
over a major hydropower project in which a U.S. energy company has
shown its interest to develop.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's office Monday issued a
press release saying that the government wants to utilize and
develop the country's abundant water resources in the larger
interests of the nation and the people.
</P>
<P>
There is unanimity within the government that water resources
development activities should be transparent and based on the
concept of national consensus, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Some local newspapers here recently reported that the PMO and
the Water Resources Ministry had a difference over whether to
allow an American group to invest and develop a 10,800-megawatt
hydropower project in West Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Enron Corp. of the United States last year contacted with the
PMO here and put forth its proposal for developing the Karnali
project, about 400 km from here, with some 9 billion US dollars on
a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis.
</P>
<P>
The PMO reportedly has been in favor of granting the Karnali
project to the U.S. company, which claims to be a leading
developer of independent energy projects in the world, in
accordance with the government's "first come, first serve" policy
on large hydropower projects.
</P>
<P>
However, the Water Resources Ministry delayed in deciding on
Enron's proposal and insisted that additional bids from other
foreign companies be invited for the project, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners are highly interested in investing in Nepal's water
resources sector and proposals are coming in, the PMO's press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The Water Resources Ministry has initiated necessary steps
under the government's policy and will deal with any interested
private sector investor, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has adopted a policy to encourage private
investment in developing the country's water resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Enron group, which expects to export power from
the Karnali project to India, has been lobbying for its
development plan, saying that any delay in the implementation of
the project would cost Nepal at least 2 billion dollars in power
revenue and tax every year.
</P>
<P>
According to the company, a process of competitive bidding for
such a big project would lower the values of Nepal's water
resources.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 127 in Pak Train Derailment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the train
derailment, which occurred early Monday in central Pakistan, rose
to 127, the official Associated Press of Pakistan said today.
</P>
<P>
Rescue operations are still going on and the injured, about 450
people, have been shifted to various hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Five cars of the train, which was heading for Pakistan's
southern port city of Karachi, skidded off the tracks early Monday
morning outside the rural station of Mirshah near Khanewal,
northeast of Multan in Punjab province.
</P>
<P>
Passengers were enjoying sound sleep when the train derailed,
which could be one of the reasons for the high death toll, the APP
said.
</P>
<P>
The actual cause of the accident has not been found so far, but
some reports suggested that some problem in the brake system of
the train may have directly led to the derailment.
</P>
<P>
The train reportedly developed some problem in the brake system
just before approaching the Mirshah station, which made the driver
unable to stop the train, sources at the Khanewal station were
quoted as saying.

COLOMBO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Gamma Club of Israel, one of
the biggest international dealers in garments, is set to invest in
a garment factory in Sri Lanka in collaboration with Tri Star
Apparel Exports (Pte) Ltd., one of Sri Lanka's largest garment
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The partnership is expected to result in increasing Gamma
Club's purchases from Sri Lanka from the present 5 million US

</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman of the venture today, the factory to
be set up in the deep South at Matara in May this year will be set
apart for the manufacture of garments by Gamma Club.
</P>
<P>
While the factory will initially employ 600 persons, it finally
proposes to employ as many as 2200 employees, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Gamma Club, which is known to have introduced high-tech systems
in garment manufacture, will transfer their managing systems and
technology to Sri Lanka and integrate them with Tri Star Group's
own systems, they added.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Bosses in Vietnam Blasted Over Labor Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Firms from Taiwan, Hong Kong and
South Korea are the most sharply criticized companies in Vietnam
for alleged labor abuses, a Vietnamese labor official was quoted
as saying by a local magazine.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published in the latest issue of the Vietnam
Investment Review, Tu Le, a senior official from the Vietnam Labor
Union, said that overwork and physical maltreatment of workers are
the biggest problems.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea are among Vietnam's five
largest foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Violations of labor rights generally occur in small joint
ventures or wholly foreign-owned ventures, in which the Vietnamese
side has minimal control, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, he said, at Keyhing Toys, a wholly foreign-owned
company, more than 25 workers collapsed and 200 fell sick or
fainted because of acetone poisoning and overwork.
</P>
<P>
The company's employees had to work an average of nine to 10
hours a day, seven days a week for a salary of 200,000-250,000 VN
dong (18-22 U.S. dollars), in an atmosphere polluted by acetone.
</P>
<P>
The official alleged that in some factories, workers were
allowed to go to the toilet only once during working hours while
others were forced to sign contracts to make a specific number of
products in an impossibly short period.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners, due to their hot temper and language barrier, often
hit their workers and cut their salary for failing to say hello to
their bosses or for bad quality work, an official from the
Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
The best way to solve the problem is to impose tough punishment
for violations, officials stressed.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were 63 labor disputes and strikes in Vietnam,
a 25 percent increase over 1995.

<HEADLINE> NZ Government to Spend Less than Planned Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government said
today it will spend less in the next financial year than planned.
</P>
<P>
In his first budget policy statement, Treasurer Winston Peters
said the government will spend 950 million dollars (about 650
million US dollars) in the 1997/98 financial year, below the
forecast of 1.2 billion dollars (820 million US dollars) contained
in the coalition agreement signed by the National Party and New
Zealand First last December.
</P>
<P>
The statement sets out government spending and priorities for
the upcoming budget expected to come out in June. Health looks set
to be the winner in the budget.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta to Play Important Role in Satellite Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will continue to play an
important role in the regional satellite business despite it is
facing with foreign competition, a senior telecommunications
official said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is not worried about foreign competition to its
position in the rapidly growing satellite business in Asia,
Djakaria Purawidjaja, director general of post and
telecommunications, said in Bali Island Monday when commenting on
reports that several countries in Southeast Asia were planning to
launch their own communication satellites soon.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot block technology development. Therefore, we cannot
prevent any country from launching its own satellite," reports
reaching here today quoted Purawidjaja as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite the competition, he said, Indonesia would continue to
play an important role in the regional satellite business since
the country possessed certain comparative advantages over other
countries in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and
even in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia was one of the first three countries after the United
States and Canada in the world to operate satellite since the
1970s so that it had thousands of experienced and qualified
experts and seven satellite operating companies.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has operated three generations of Palapa
telecommunications satellite since 1970 to support its vast
communication areas as well as countries in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, which each have embarked on
ambitious and costly programs to own and operate their own
satellites, relied on Indonesia's two Palapa satellites from the
1970s to the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
But since then the three countries have ordered satellites from
the United States, France and other Western countries and they
plan to launch and operate their own satellites soon.
</P>
<P>
Purawidjaja acknowledged that the mastery of satellite
technology by Indonesians was actually not better than other
countries but "we can provide better services thanks to our
qualified and experienced human resources."
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesian companies were world-class satellite
operators, providing optimism that Indonesia could compete with
other countries especially in ASEAN and Asia.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Leaders in Defamation Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and
his son Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will be represented
by Queen's Counsel David Eady in their defamation suit against
Tang Liang Hong, a Singapore lawyer, the Straits Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
It said that Eady, an experienced defamation lawyer, was
admitted by the High Court as the counsel for the Lees in the
first suit they filed last against Tang, the defeated opposition
Workers' Party election candidate.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong are suing the defendant for
his remarks in a June issue of the Hong Kong-based weekly, Yazhou
Zhoukan, about discounts on the Hotel Properties Limited (HPL)
apartment sold to the Lees.
</P>
<P>
A Queen's Counsel since 1983, Eady is known as the lawyer who
acted for Lord Denning, a well-respected British judge who was
sued for slander towards the end of his career in 1982, the
Straits Times report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Eady also represented politicians, movie stars and
the British Broadcasting Corporation in numerous well-publicized
cases and was the lawyer for Lee Kuan Yew in his defamation suit
against J.B. Jeyaretnam, leader of the Singapore Workers' Party,
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who was then prime minister, was awarded 260,000 Singapore
dollars (about 183,099 U.S. dollars at current exchange rate) in
damages on August 3, 1990, over the remarks made by Jeyaretnam on
the suicide of former national development minister Teh Cheang
Wan, who died in 1986 while being investigated for corruption.
</P>
<P>
The suit against Tang will be heard in the High Court on August
18, the report said, adding that Charles Gray, another Queen's
Counsel who is also a defamation specialist, was admitted last
November as the lawyer for Tang.
</P>
<P>
Tang is also facing a second defamation suit filed by the Lees
for his remarks on their purchases of HPL apartments at three
election rallies on December 31 last year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Govt Rushes to Calm Financial Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is hastily
ushering in a big rescue package for the country's upset financial
market, which saw a suspension of share trading in the finance and
banking sectors Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government has designated three large local banks to
organize mergers, while ordering ten ailing finance firms to
increase their reserves or capital.
</P>
<P>
With the move, the government hopes that all commercial banks,
finance firms and credit financiers will add a total of 50 billion
baht (about 1.92 billion U.S. dollars) in reserves for substandard
loans within two years.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan
and Central Bank Governor Rerngchai Marakanond have required the
ten troubled finance firms to raise their capital by 8.2 billion
baht (about 315.4 million dollars) immediately.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Monday ordered suspension
of share trading in the finance and banking sectors after some
finance firms reportedly suffered financial problems.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that the suspension, the first one in the
21-year history of the SET, finally came after weeks of denials by
the government for serious problems in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The SET index lost 20.32 points to close at 707.24 on light
trading with 51 shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh called for investors
to remain calm, stressing the government would take care of
everything.
</P>
<P>
He urged people to refrain from rushing to liquidate investment
or withdraw from bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
Reactions to the government decision to suspend share trading
remained mixed.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts expressed welcome to the decision, but indicating
it came a bit late as rumors about difficulties in the financial
sector have been spreading over the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
With excessive expansion and over-lending to the property
sector, they said, some damage has been beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
Others said that the SET over-reacted. They said that the SET
suspended share trading in the two sectors, maybe it wanted to see
the government's reaction. But it should lift the suspension after
the government unveiled its rescue package.
</P>
<P>
SET President Singh Tangtatsawas said that the trading remains
halted because the authorities wanted to give time to investors to
analyze the new measures.
</P>
<P>
Singh said that the authorities are considering whether to
reopen trading for the two sectors, but the suspension of share
trading for the ten firms will remain.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Amnesty For Illegal Weapons Ends Tonight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's amnesty for the
handover of illegal weapons ends tonight but police say that as
many as 3,297 weapons which have been issued irregularly to the
politicians during the last regime are still to be recovered.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to collect the weapons, the government declared
the amnesty on February 24 and since then police have been
deployed throughout the country to collect them. Only 180 weapons
have been recovered so far.
</P>
<P>
The exercise comes in the wake of widespread political violence
 connected with the run-up to the local government elections
scheduled for March 21.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, there have so far been 560
election-related violent incidents since February 11 when District
MP Nalanda Ellawala was killed in a clash between government
supporters and supporters of the main opposition United National
Party at Ratnapura, a town in the mid-country plantation region.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that persons holding illegal weapons from
tomorrow will be arrested and prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
The unauthorized firearms comprising revolvers, pistols, shot
guns and repeater shot guns are those which were issued to
parliamentarians, provincial councilors and municipal and urban
councilors for self protection by the United National Party regime
during the southern uprising of Sinhalese youths.
</P>
<P>
They should have been returned after the uprising was
suppressed in 1989 but the politicians continued to hold them and
also distributed them among their supporters.
</P>
<P>
The growing political violence has induced political party
leaders to cooperate with the authorities and ensure the voluntary
surrender of arms.
</P>
<P>
A party leaders conference summoned Monday by the Speaker of
parliament K.B. Ratnayake resulted in a joint appeal by all party
leaders being issued to their supporters to cooperate with the
authorities and voluntarily surrender all unauthorized arms.

WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Sales by the General Motors
Corporation (GM) on the United States market dropped by 7.5
percent in February, and Chrysler also saw a decline in the month.
</P>
<P>
General Motors said its car sales declined nearly 10 percent,
and sales of light trucks were down an estimated four percent.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Corporation, the third largest car-maker in the U.S.,
said its sales were down three percent overall. Its car sales fell
seven percent while truck sales were flat.
</P>
<P>
The Ford Motor Company, the No. Two U.S. auto-maker, was
scheduled to announce its February sales on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Honda set a second consecutive monthly sales record.
Its U.S. sales increased nine percent, boosted by healthy demand for
its new CR-V sport utility vehicle and its Civic subcompact.
</P>
<P>
Other Japanese auto-makers will announce their sales in couple
of days.
</P>
<P>
Japanese car makers had particularly strong sales in January,
prompting America's Big Three automakers to complain that weakness
in the Japanese currency, the yen, was giving their competitors an
unfair advantage. A weak yen against the dollar makes Japanese
cars less costly.

<HEADLINE> China Sweeps Violators Out of Securities Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China will ban illegal operators
from its securities market beginning today, another harsh penalty
to stem market irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The securities watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), adopted a set of rules today that will
effectively strip the operating privileges, either temporarily or
permanently, of those who violate market order.
</P>
<P>
"Any market irregularities of securities institutions that are
reported are inevitably connected with individual actions, and the
new rules will help ensure a stable market order by wiping the
irresponsible individuals out of the market," said an official
with the commission.
</P>
<P>
The rules will govern senior management personnel in companies
listed in the securities market, in securities brokerages,
securities registration and settlement companies, and a number of
other securities intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
Violators who have been caught engaging in illegal activities
in the market will be banned from accepting any management
positions in listed companies or securities institutions for three
to ten years. In the most severe cases, the penalty will be a
permanent revocation of the right to engage in securities business.
</P>
<P>
"The commission will publicize the namelist of such market
violators through the media to warn securities institutions
against hiring them," said the CSRC official.

<HEADLINE> China Poised to Become Biggest Market for Household Electrics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to become the
world's leading consumer of household electrical appliances within
a few years, thanks to a huge market potential and the country's
enormous population of 1.2 billion, experts predict.
</P>
<P>
The reasoning was made by experts and officials from the China
Association of Household Electrical Appliances under the Ministry
of Light Industry, which is scheduled to sponsor an international
exhibition on household electrics in Shanghai in October.
</P>
<P>
Major factors cited by the experts include what will soon be a
widespread trend of replacing used household electrical
appliances, a buying spree by an annual 7-8 million
soon-to-be-married couples, more space to accommodate household
electronics, including wide-screens and large-capacity
refrigerators, and marked rise in living standards within the vast
rural population.
</P>
<P>
During the 1997-2000 period, 70 to 85 percent of China's urban
households are expected to buy new color TV sets, refrigerators
and washing machines, while the rural areas will rapidly balloon
into a gigantic market for household electrical items due to
hoped-for improvement in both power supply and people's living
standards.
</P>
<P>
China's household electrical appliances sector has witnessed
rapid growth since the 1979 and has become an important industry
in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China's 33 key refrigerator producers churned out
9.6535 million fridges, of which 9.6343 million were sold.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also indicate that 6.9095 million air conditioners
were turned out by 39 major manufacturers last year, while the
output of washing machines stood at over 10 million. An
overwhelming majority of the air conditioners and washing machines
were sold.
</P>
<P>
In cosmopolitan cities, about 92 households out of every
hundred had had washing machines by the end of 1995, with ratios
of refrigerators and air conditioners hitting 88.95 percent and 17.09
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
At the meantime, every hundred households in medium-and small
cities or townships had averaged about 17 color TVs, nearly 89
washing machines, 66 fridges and eight air conditioners. However,
the ratio of washing machines, refrigerators and air conditioners
in every hundred rural households were much lower, standing at
only 16, five, and 0.18 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Experts said China's huge market potential in household
electrical appliances has lured international electrics giants and
caused an avalanche of Sino-overseas joint ventures in this
field.
</P>
<P>
The influx of overseas investors has ushered in hi-technology,
while the prevalence of international brand names has heightened
competition in China's household electrical appliances market.
</P>
<P>
Imported color TVs, air conditioners, washing machines and
video recorders are occupying a large slice of the China market,
with their market rate hitting 30.9 percent, 31.41 percent, 12.22
percent and 98.1 percent in the first half of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Aviation Sector Prepared for Direct Air Service across Strait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The aviation sector on the Chinese
mainland has made adequate preparations for direct air service
across the Taiwan Strait, said China's top aviation official.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guangyi, director of the Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC) and a member of China's top legislature, made the
remark when attending the ongoing Fifth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Chen, a NPC deputy from east China's Fujian province, said two
newly-built international airports in Fuzhou and Xiamen epitomize
the mainland's efforts to prepare for direct air links across
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The three billion prepare Changle Airport in Fuzhou, provincial
capital of Fujian, is scheduled to become operational in coming
July, and the Gaoqi Airport in Xiamen has just completed a 1.8
billion yuan expansion project. Both airports are able to
accommodate Boeing 747s, the largest jetliner now in service.
</P>
<P>
Fujian will have four airports to service cross-strait flights,
provided two other smaller airports in two other port cities are
taken into account, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
More than one million air passengers have traveled across the
Strait annually in recent years, and passengers from Taiwan to the
mainland may travel with a single ticket by changing flight at
Macao, thanks to an agreement reached between the airlines on both
sides of the Straits years ago.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged the Taiwan authorities to size up the situation and
make the decision at the opportune time. "the establishment of
direct air links across the Strait is the trend of the times and
the aspiration of the people, and the relevant conditions are now
available," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, if the Taiwan authorities deem that the
direct air service cannot be confined to Fujian province alone,
other big cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, can
also be open to cross-strait flights.
</P>
<P>
With Hong Kong's return to the embrace of the motherland
approaching, Chen said, the principles of "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and "a higher degree of autonomy" are also
applicable to Hong Kong's airline industry.
</P>
<P>
The CAAC will give an all-out support the development of Hong
Kong's air transport market and strictly respect the region's
autonomy in this regard, he said. "Hong Kong's status as an air
transport center will remain unchanged."
</P>
<P>
In spite of more air routes to open between the interior areas
and Hong Kong, the conventional practices with regard to the
opening of new routes and market development, will be maintained,
namely, air accesses can be obtained only with the consent of
other side on the basis of mutual reciprocity and mutual benefit.

<P>
LHASA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The power industry department in the
Tibet Autonomous Region has worked out a detailed plan to make
sure that every town there has access to electric power by the end
of the century.
</P>
<P>
Over the next few years, a number of local power networks are
scheduled to go into operation. And by 2000, a backbone power net
in the central parts of Tibet, which will cover the major cities
of Lhasa and Xigaze, will be established.
</P>
<P>
Some power stations in remote areas also will be generating
electricity soon.
</P>
<P>
Through the year 2010, a large-scale power works in central
Tibet, five local power nets and a scattering of power stations in
remote areas will help fulfill the goal to provide electricity
throughout Tibet's townships.
</P>
<P>
By then, the total installed capacity of power in Tibet, which
now accommodates more than 2.3 million people in 1.2 million sq
km, will reach 1.19 million kw.

<HEADLINE> Talks With Armed Rebels Collapse in Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between the government
and an armed group in Nicaragua were called off because of the
absence of the rebel delegation, said Interior Ministry
authorities today.
</P>
<P>
The talks were to have taken place Sunday between Interior
Minister Jose Antonio Alvarado and a faction of the 80 men, led by
Jose Sanchez Borge, from the North 3-80 Front in the community of
El Ayote, in the central department of Chontales.
</P>
<P>
The government calculates that there are about 500 re-armed men
in the north and central zones of the country.
</P>
<P>
Alvarado left here early Sunday morning for El Ayote, but
found, after travelling five hours over bad roads, that the
representatives of the group didn't show up at the planned venue.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry source, the group failed to appear
because of a lack of coordination on the part of the government
delegates about the meeting place.
</P>
<P>
Alvarado did not rule out the possibility that Borge and his
men did not go to the meeting because they wanted to wait for the
results of a meeting, to be held March 8, between North 3-80 Front
leaders and the government.
</P>
<P>
Moises Obando, chairman of the El Ayote Peace Commission, said
the rebel group expressed its unwillingness to turn over its arms
as long as army and National Police remained in the area.
</P>
<P>
Alvarado said that the presence of both the army and the police
was important in the area where a lack of security prevailed.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The total trade volume in
Latin American countries amounted to 543 billion U.S. dollars in
1996, up 11 percent over 1995, according to the U.N. Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL).
</P>
<P>
The CEPAL said that exports from the region, including
intra-regional ones, climbed to 248 billion dollars while imports
totalled 295 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Commission figures show that the countries that increased their
export and import volumes most were Argentina, Brazil and Mexico,
since they increased their presence abroad significantly.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEPAL, most of the countries in Latin America
depend on imports of intermediate products, and their consumption
in world markets increase as their exports increase.
</P>
<P>
Exports from the region increased by 8-10 percent per year
during the 1990's, while imports increased by 12-13 percent, said
the organization.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the trade volume in Mexico made up 40 percent
of the Latin American trade in 1996. The import volume in the
country hit 88 billion dollars, an increase of 22 percent in 1996,
compared with 1995.

<HEADLINE> South China Economic Zone To Improve Residents' Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South China's Shenzhen has come
up with a regulation that sets a ratio on local labor in the
city's employment scheme.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, local labor should account for 78
percent of the work force in wholesale and retail businesses, 50
percent in tourism and restaurants, 60 percent in the transport
industry, 80 percent in post and telecommunications, and 87
percent in finance and insurance.
</P>
<P>
'Local labor' in this case refers to people who have registered
as permanent residents in the city, said an official with the city
government. "The move is intended to promote employment among
local residents and to distribute labor resources in a more
reasonable way," he added.
</P>
<P>
Employers in need of workers should give public notice, the
regulation says, and those who cannot meet the required ratio
within a month can apply to the labor department for employment of
laborers from elsewhere. Employers are not allowed to reject the
application of local residents without providing a suitable
reason, it said.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen is a special economic zone bordering Hong Kong, and
has established a new labor system to accommodate the market
economy. The city employs over a million people from other parts
of China, but stresses employment of local residents, which has
brought its unemployment rate to below 2.5 percent in the past two
years.

<HEADLINE> Italian Court Rules on Priebke's Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The arrest of former SS captain Erich
Priebke immediately following his acquittal on war crime charges
last August was justified, Italy's Constitutional Court ruled
today.
</P>
<P>
Priebke had appealed the decision by a Rome appeals court to
sign a warrant for his arrest after a military tribunal found him
guilty of mass murder, but freed him because extenuating
circumstances meant a 30-year statute of limitations applied..
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Court of Cassation judged his re-arrest
justified because Germany had requested Priebke's extradition to
try him for organizing the Ardeatine Caves massacre. In this, 335
men and boys were killed in 1944 to avenge the killing of 33
German soldiers by partisans.
</P>
<P>
Priebke will be tried for a second time in a military court,
following, earlier this month, the Court of Cassation's resolving
of a case of legal limbo in which the military and civil courts
said they were incompetent to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
Priebke was extradited from Argentina to Italy in 1994 to face
the war crime charges and has been in prison.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Approves 26 Billion Dollar Arms Exports in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton Administration
approved arms exports to 160 countries and regions worth 26
billion U.S. dollars in fiscal year 1996, an Arms Trade News

</P>
<P>
Of the total, 10.5 billion dollars consists of actual sales

Pentagon's Excess Defense Articles program, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Middle East countries received the lion's share of
Pentagon's exports with purchases totaling over 3.8 billion
dollars. The Far East bought some 3 billion dollars of U.S.
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The leading buyer of the weapons were Egypt with 1.4 billion
dollars in acquisitions; Saudi Arabia with 1.3 billion dollars;
South Korea with close to 1 billion dollars; and Israel signed
agreements totalling 883 million dollars, the report said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Delay Liberalizing LPG Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will delay
liberalizing the local liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) market until
the end of this year, according to a senior civil servant.
</P>
<P>
The civil servant was quoted today by local press as saying
that it was not timely to deregulate the LPG market just now
because of the very high price of LPG abroad.
</P>
<P>
The posted price of LPG in the Middle East now tops 300 U.S.
dollars per ton while the local ex-refinery price of LPG, which is
controlled by the government, is 245 dollars per ton, according to
the Petroleum Authority of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
If deregulation was undertaken now, the local LPG price could
rocket, possibly fueling political turmoil, the Department of
Commercial Registration warned.
</P>
<P>
LPG is the only oil product exempted from 1991 deregulation of
the oil market because it is used for cooking.
</P>
<P>
the civil servant said the government would be more inclined to
liberalize the local LPG market towards the end of this year when
world LPG prices were likely to have dropped to a regular level.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reports Initial Success in Reforming State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Some of the measures listed by
Premier Li Peng in his government work report to rejuvenate the
loss-making state sector have proved effective in Shanghai, a
local official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of giving priority support for major state-owned
enterprises and allowing small ones greater freedom and
flexibility of operation has achieved initial success in this
major industrial city," said Xu Zhiyi, director of the Shanghai
Municipal Economic Commission, at a group meeting discussing
Premier Li Peng's government work report as a deputy to the
National People's Congress in session here.
</P>
<P>
"Other steps defined by the premier in his report, such as
standardizing bankruptcy proceedings, encouraging mergers and
supporting re-employment, have also proved feasible in Shanghai,"
Xu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has finally found the root to
problems plaguing state-owned enterprises and ways to solve
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990's, Shanghai's economy with a concentration
of state firms has maintained a sustained, rapid and healthy
development, and achieved double-digit growth rates for six
consecutively years, according Xu.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's GDP in 1996 was 13 percent greater than 1995, and
more than 97.8 percent of its industrial products were marketed.
</P>
<P>
He maintains that these have resulted from reform of the city's
state-owned sector in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Industrial restructuring has been stepped up, he said.
Industries that consume a lot of resources but are barely
profitable have been reduced in size, while priorities have been
given to the development of car, petro-chemical, metallurgical,
power, electronics, telecommunications and hi-tech industries.
These industries today contribute 56.2 percent of the city's
revenues, he said.
</P>
<P>
To optimize the distribution of state assets, the municipal
government has provided conditions for the emergence in recent
years of more than ten large enterprise groups, which hope to sell
100 billion yuan worth of products a year by the end of the
century, from today's 30 billion yuan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring measures in Shanghai include the purchase of
one firm by another, mergers, shareholding arrangement, property
rights transfer, and bankruptcy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, about 240 small state enterprises were
put in the charge of district and country governments, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With these measures, we hope to bring down the debt rate in
Shanghai's state firms by another seven percentage points this
year, to 80 percent for its state sector as a whole," Xu said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Oil Import Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine net oil import bill
jumped 18 percent to 2.67 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 from 2.26
billion dollars in 1995 as world crude prices soared while local
consumption increased.
</P>
<P>
Citing data provided by the Energy Department, today's
newspaper the Philippine Star said the country's sustained
economic growth last year pushed up petroleum consumption by 5.8
percent to 131.6 million barrels in 1996 from the 1995 level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the volume of crude importation was also higher
along with soaring prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The average crude cost of 19.32 dollars per barrel in 1996 was
16.2 percent higher than the 16.62 dollars per barrel posted in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Crude prices reached its peak last October at 22.59 dollars per
barrel, a result of higher demand for heating oil, strong buying
interests and successive leap of crude futures.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' total crude requirement during the period was
almost 100 percent sourced through imports as local crude supplied
a paltry 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Imported crude oil was acquired mostly from Middle East
countries, particularly Saudi Arabia which provided about 58
percent of the total. The Philippines also imported oil from some
African and Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Agree to Reduce Greenhouse Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Environment ministers from the
European Union reached today an agreement to cut the bloc's
emissions of greenhouse gases by 15 percent of 1990 levels by
2010.
</P>
<P>
This objective enables the 15 EU countries to present a united
front at the meeting of parties to the Climate Change Convention
in Kyoto, Japan, in December.
</P>
<P>
Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide from burning fossil
fuels, trap heat close to the earth's surface and are blamed for
what scientists fear will ba a long-term warming of the global
climate.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, who met in Brussels today and Tuesday, agreed on
how to share out individual cuts between countries for only 10
percentage points of the 15 percent pledged, an indication of the
difficulties the EU still faces with its announced target.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Environment Minister Margreet de Boer told reporters late
Sunday, when the 15 ministers met informally, that the 15 percent
figure was a firm commitment.
</P>
<P>
"We go to Kyoto with 15 percent and if that's agreed, then we
will negotiate about how to share out the remaining 5 percent
within the EU," she said.
</P>
<P>
In reaching a deal, ministers revised a previous proposal made
by the Netherlands, which holds the EU presidency, softening the
demand on most countries in striking agreement on the overall
figure, Dutch diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Britain, two of the EU's major fossil-fuel users,
saw their allotted targets cut from 30 percent to 25 percent and
from 20 percent to 10 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The target for France, with a majority of its electricity
coming from non-CO2-emitting nuclear power, was cut to zero from
the originally suggested 5 percent reduction while Italy's went
from the 10 percent cut proposed to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other countries seeing their targets softened included Ireland,
to be allowed a 15 percent emissions increase instead of the
suggested 5 percent rise, Finland, granted an emissions freeze in
place of a 10 percent cut, and Greece, with a 30 percent increase
in place of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Portugal's allowed emissions figure went up 15 percentage
points to 40 percent, Spain's rose two percentage points to 17
percent, and Luxembourg's 40 percent cut became 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Belgium and the Dutch retained their 10 percent cuts while
Austria and Denmark kept their 25 percent cuts and Sweden its 5
percent rise.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Introduce New Game Rules from July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Football Association (FIFA) has finalised rules concerning
players, goalkeepers and referees in a "much simpler and
contemporary language", according to a FIFA press release issued
today in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
At its 111th meeting held on March 1, 1997 in Belfast, the
International Football Association Board (IFAB) of the FIFA
decided to finalise the draft for a revised version of the Laws of
the Game. "The new version will contribute to a better
understanding of the Laws governing the game," says FIFA in the
press release.
</P>
<P>
Examining various specific issues, the IFAB also decided to
further extend the backpass ruling. As of July 1, 1997, when all
amendments will enter into force, an indirect free-kick will be
awarded if the goalkeeper handles the ball after receiving it
directly from a throw-in from his own team. For his part, the
goalkeeper may move on the goal line when a penalty-kick is
taken. Furthermore, a goal may be scored directly from kick-off.
</P>
<P>
The IFAB refused unanimously to authorize experiments with
video systems to assist the referee, including that requested by
the French Football Federation for the friendly international
match between France and Sweden on April 2, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Unsporting behavior, failing to respect the required distance
at a restart of play and delaying the restart of play will become
cautionable offences under the amended rules. But players who
enter the penalty area before the ball has been kicked need not
now be cautioned.
</P>
<P>
As a binding instruction to the referee, he has to consider
that the goalkeeper is wasting time and therefore has to award an
indirect free-kick, if the goalkeeper holds the ball for longer
than a maximum of six seconds.

<P>
GENEVA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The official in charge of security
at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics has been appointed as a special
consultant for the 2000 Sydney Games, IOC officials revealed on
Monday in their headquarters Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
Santiago de Sicart will head up a panel of security experts who

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Province Redoubles Efforts To Combat Lake Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
has vowed to improve water quality in scenic Dianchi Lake before
the end of this century and to restore its ecology by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The lake has a drainage area of 2,920 square kilometers and is
the main source of water for the industry, agriculture and
residents of the province's capital city of Kunming.
</P>
<P>
But, water quality has been deteriorating steadily in recent
years because of pollution, and the state, province, and city have
begun to pay greater attention to pollution control in the area.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has promulgated a series of laws and regulations on
environmental protection in the lake area, and 23 plants with
serious pollution problems have been ordered to improve within a
certain period of time.
</P>
<P>
Construction projects in the region have also been strictly
watched, said an official with the city government.
</P>
<P>
The province has invested 420 million yuan (50.6 million US
dollars) in four sewage treatment plants since 1990, and its
capital city will be able to dispose of 365,000 cubic meters of
waste water daily by the end of this year. The figure accounts for
60 percent of the total that the city spews out, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has also spent 134 million yuan developing drinking
water resources, increasing the storage capacity of a major
reservoir to 229 million cubic meters from 70 million cubic
meters. A new waterworks is also under construction, and the city
has said its 800,000 residents will be able to drink better water
within two years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, with the support of the state, the province has
attracted 150 million dollars in loan from the World Bank for
environmental protection projects with the lake on the focus.

<HEADLINE> Germany, France Agree on EU Reform Initiatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The German and French foreign
ministers said here today that they had agreed on a number of
initiatives on European Union (EU) reform, which would be jointly
submitted to the EU's ongoing Inter-Governmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his French
counterpart, Herve de Charette, told reporters after a meeting in
Bonn that among other things, they had agreed that "strategic
decisions" of the EU should be made by consensus in the future,
and decisions on their implementations be made by "qualified
majority."
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also agreed that the role of the European
Commission president should be strengthened, and that the future
number of the commission members should be smaller than the number
of member states of an enlarged EU.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the common will to gradually integrate the
Western European Union (WEU) into the EU structure, and said that
the government leaders of the EU should draw up guidelines for the
WEU's future mandate.
</P>
<P>
On the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), both sides expressed the confidence that a
compromise on NATO-Russian relations could be found before the
Western alliance's Madrid summit in July, either through a
"charter" or, as demanded by Moscow, through a binding treaty
which needs the approval of NATO members' parliaments.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also stressed their governments'
determination to hold on to the January 1999 startup date of the
single European currency -- the Euro, saying that this would
encourage other EU members to make remarkable efforts in order to
qualify for the Euro.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Admits Producing Large Amount of Deadly Nerve Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has admitted producing
large amounts of a deadly nerve gas agent in 1990 but up to now
has failed to convince U.N. experts that it had destroyed them as
claimed after the Gulf War, a U.N. official said today.
</P>
<P>
Rolf Ekeus, chief U.N. weapons inspector for Iraq, briefed the
Security Council today about the status of his team's efforts to
determine whether Iraq has complied with U.N. orders to scrap its
high-tech weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
According to Ekeus, as early as 1995, Iraq acknowledged having
produced small quantities of the nerve gas. But after further
investigation of the U.N. weapons inspection team, Iraq admitted
recently that it produced 3,800 kilograms of the deadly VX nerve
gas agent and destroyed them after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus said the U.N. weapons inspectors were then taken to sites
in the desert where the destruction was said to have taken place
but they could not verify Baghdad's claims.
</P>
<P>
Following the briefing, the Security Council agreed to maintain
sanctions against Iraq. Iraq has to destroy all its chemical,
biological weapons and missiles before the council can remove the
sanctions imposed on it since 1990.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks End Declining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street ended a
three-session slump today even though interest rates rose again in
the bond market after the latest economic news heightened
inflation worries.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 41.18 points to
6,918.92, after recovering from a nearly 50-point morning deficit.
The blue-chip barometer had lost about 160 points over the
previous three sessions amid worries the Federal Reserve is
planning to raise interest rates to lessen inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by a slim margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, with the NYSE volume totaling 432.63 million
shares as against 508.28 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 4.49 to 795.31, and
the NYSE's composite index rose 1.83 to 417.34.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.19 to 1,311.19, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.58 to 594.82.
</P>
<P>
Inflation worries continued to weigh on the bond market amid
more indications of strong economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that
the nation's manufacturing economy grew faster than expected in
February. It also reported that factories were paying higher
prices for supplies.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending jumped
0.7 percent, outpacing a 0.3 percent gain in incomes. Analysts had
predicted spending growth of 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
rose as high as 6.86 percent, up from late Friday's 6.80 percent.
Later, the yield stood at about 6.83 percent.

<HEADLINE> Absenteeism Costs UK Economy 13 Bln Pounds Each Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Absenteeism at work is growing
sharply in some parts of the British economy and is costing the
country at least 13 billion pounds (21 billion US dollars) each
year, according to a survey published today.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Society, an independent training and advisory
body, said in the study that the proportion of the workforce
absent is now 3.6 percent, or 8.3 days per employee each year, and
it is up by a quarter in the past three years in the public
sector.
</P>
<P>
The survey of personnel managers in more than 300 businesses
and organizations said that the 13 billion pound losses did not
include falls in productivity, the cost of temporary staff,
overtime bills, damage to morale of customers and loss of
customers.
</P>
<P>
The society said that employees recorded colds and flu, stomach
upsets, headaches and back problems as the most common causes for
absence from work.
</P>
<P>
However, employers believed stress and low morale to be two of
the key likely causes.
</P>
<P>
The society pointed out that many organizations were too "lean
and mean."
</P>
<P>
"By reducing staff levels to such an extent, even minimal
levels of absenteeism put intolerable pressure on remaining
employees; this may in due course spread stress-related absence or
other problems across the organization," said the survey.
</P>
<P>
The society called on organizations to monitor absence rates
carefully, identify the true causes and costs, and look for
solutions.

<HEADLINE> Tietmeyer Favors Duisenberg as 1st European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- German central bank president Hans
Tietmeyer today clearly indicated his support for his counterpart
of the Netherlands, Willem Duisenberg, to be the first president
of the European Central Bank (ECB) to be launched in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"With you (Duisenberg) as captain, the ECB crew would be able
to lead the Euro into the safe harbor of monetary stability," said
Tietmeyer in a speech at a ceremony in Frankfurt honoring
Duisenberg, who was chosen today by 20 international finance and
business journalists as "European Banker of the Year 1996."
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer noted that Germany could only accept the planned
single European currency, the Euro, if it would be so stable as
the Netherlandish gulden.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Duisenberg stressed the importance for the
future ECB to adopt a stability-oriented monetary policy, saying
that it would mean low inflation at home as well as a strong
common European money against the U.S. dollar and the Japanese
yen.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg also called for strict adherence to the Maasticht
Treaty criteria for joining the Euro, which is due to launched by
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it should not be dramatized if a few EU member
states fail to join the Euro in the first wave. "It is not an
excommunication," Duisenberg said, adding that with improved
efforts, those countries could still join in in 2002 when the Euro
is planned to be formally circulated.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg, a professor for market economy who was twice
president of the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements
(BIS), was already elected to head the Frankfurt-based European
Monetary Institute (EMI) in July. The EMI is due to be replaced by
the ECB by its launching.

<HEADLINE> British, French Shares Down on Weak Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe ended
mixed today, with Frankfurt slightly up and London and Paris all
in the negative grounds, depressed by Wall Street's losses last
week and another weak start today.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index had dropped as low as 4,287.3 points earlier
in the day, but later struggled above the 4,300 level to finish
only slightly off and at its highest point of the day, down 1.2
points at 4,307.1, as Wall Street recovered most of its early
losses today.
</P>
<P>
Mildly positive factory output and consumer credit data today
had little impact, although the US interest rate specter still
hangs over the market, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Among the three major markets in Europe, the Frankfurt market,
which ended before New York opened, was the only one ending
marginally higher today, with the DAX-30 index 4.22 points higher
at 3,263.86.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that share prices were supported by strength in
the dollar and the bond market, but tradings were lackluster and
uninspired.
</P>
<P>
French shares also closed lower in subdued trade after Wall
Street's fall last Friday and a weak start today. However, hopes
of a short-term rate cut helped stop shares tumbling lower, with
the CAC-40 index closing down 7.29 points at 2,600.26.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index ended down 1.2 points at 4,307.1. In
Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index closed up 4.22 points at 3,263.86. The
Paris CAC-40 index finished 7.29 points lower at 2,600.26.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Bars, Restaurants Ban Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The toughest anti-smoking bylaw in
Canada took effect in Toronto today, making it illegal to smoke in
all of the city's bars and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 to 25 health officials began to fan out across the
largest city of Canada in search of smoking violations, said
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, owners face fines ranging from 150 to 3,650 U.S.
dollars if they refuse to post no-smoking signs. Smokers who
refuse to stop smoking get the same penalties.
</P>
<P>
Bars and restaurants are permitted to allow smoking in 25
percent of their floor area -- but only after they create sealed,
separately ventilated smoking rooms.
</P>
<P>
So far, only two of the city's 4,500 licensed bars and
restaurants have applied for building permits to create rooms for
smokers.
</P>
<P>
The law applies only in the city of Toronto, not in five
adjoining suburbs, where smokers remain free to smoke.
</P>
<P>
The law has been opposed by the hospitality industry, claiming
that it would make bars and restaurants lose many of smoking
patrons.
</P>
<P>
But anti-smoking activists say the experience of other
countries show that most of the industry will not lose business.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Albright Hold Talks on Mideast Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discussed at
length the controversial move by Israel to build Jewish homes in
Arab east Jerusalem in their nearly one-hour meeting, the State
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Albright attended President Bill Clinton's talks with Arafat
this morning and she then had about a nearly one-hour one-on-one
meeting with Arafat, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
told reporters at a regular news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Their discussion "centered largely on the issue of the Israeli
proposal to build housing at Jabal Abu Ghenaim or Har Homa (in
Arab east Jerusalem). And they had a full and very, very detailed
discussion of that and all of its ramifications," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
But Burns declined to disclose the details of their
discussions, only saying, "the United States continues to believe
that this decision to build housing at Jabal Abu Ghenaim risks
undercutting a lot of the progress that has been made so far."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, Clinton openly criticized Israel's
housing project in east Jerusalem, saying it could only build
"mistrust" between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"I would have preferred the decision not have been made because
I don't think it builds confidence. It builds mistrust," he told
reporters at the White House before starting talks with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat staying beside Clinton condemned the housing project,
saying, "The target is to squeeze and to isolate Jerusalem, but at
the same time to build settlements at the entrance of Bethlehem."
</P>
<P>
He said he was "sure" that Clinton "will push forward to
prevent" the Israeli move from building the Jewish homes in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Their talks were followed by a meeting between the U.S. and
Palestinian delegations, in which "economic issues were primarily
at the center of the discussions" with the attendance of Secretary
of the Treasury Bob Rubin and U.S. Aid Director Brian Atwood,
Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the economic discussions, Secretary Albright
and Chairman Arafat have decided to form a joint U.S.-Palestinian
committee... to try to find ways, practically, to move the
relationship forward, whether it's on economic issues or foreign
policy issues or any other issues that are of importance to both
sides," Burns said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Differs with US on SFOR's Mission in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain said today that the
troops sent into Bosnia by the Western allies should leave
together, indicating differences with the U.S. on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"I regard the operation that we're undertaking as being a NATO
operation," British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The British defense secretary met with U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen at the Pentagon over the mission of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in Bosnia and the alliance's
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Cohen had repeatedly affirmed that the U.S. troops in Bosnia
will surely leave by mid-1998 when the mandate of the peacekeeping
force expires. He insists the Europeans should continue the job
of peacekeeping if needed.
</P>
<P>
However, Portillo said, "we went in together, we are working
together, and we shall leave together."
</P>
<P>
The United States contributes some 8,000 troops to the
so-called Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia. Britain, France
and other European countries are also major contributors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the war crimes in Bosnia, Cohen reiterated that
"the apprehension of war criminals is not part of the military
mission."
</P>
<P>
"It is a police function, however, and discussions are under
way at this time as to how a force can be assembled that would
carry out that particular mission," Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
Portillo stressed the importance of apprehending the war
criminals in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be very difficult to have a settlement in
Bosnia while the people who have been indicted for these war
crimes remain at large," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the enlargement of NATO, Portillo said, "I think Russia now
recognizes that there will be new members of NATO, and Russia is
now engaged constructively in creating with us a new NATO-Russia
charter."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that can be a very important part of the new security
architecture of Europe," he noted.
