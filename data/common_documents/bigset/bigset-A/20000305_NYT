SNAKE-BITTEN USC LOSES AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY - The memorable moments just keep piling up in the Bay
Area for USC, but they only seem to be the kind the Trojans would
rather forget.
</P>
<P>
   In search of a road sweep to keep its slim NCAA hopes alive, USC
will instead remember this trip for its off-the-court hijinx.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game even started Saturday, USC guard Jeff Trepagnier
was assessed a technical foul for his windmill dunk during
warm-ups. Dunking is not allowed in pre-game drills, and the
Trojans found themselves down two points prior to taking the court.
</P>
<P>
   This mental lapse occurred just two nights after injured forward
Jarvis Turner, sitting on the bench, grabbed Stanford guard Casey
Jacobsen by the shorts and received a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   That about sums up the highlights of the weekend, because
Saturday's 86-73 loss to California before 12,172 at Haas Pavilion
did nothing for the Trojans' post-season hopes -- except maybe
eliminate them.
</P>
<P>
   After starting the week thinking NCAA Tournament, USC concludes
it as a bubble team for the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   There are an abundance of Western teams that make attractive
candidates (Arizona State, Cal, New Mexico, Wyoming, Nevada-Las
Vegas) and can offer large crowds for a first-round game, meaning
the Trojans might be lucky to squeak in even if they finish with
two victories against the Washington schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win these last two games,'' forward David
Bluthenthal said. ``The NIT is a postseason tournament and our goal
before the season was to play in the postseason. We have to pull
off two more victories.''
</P>
<P>
   USC (14-14, 7-9) came into the game with several factors working
against it: Forward Brian Scalabrine was hobbled by a strained hip,
and forward Sam Clancy was playing in just his second game after
breaking his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   And then came Trepagnier's technical, perhaps a sign the Trojans
were just over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always do that before the game to loosen up,'' Trepagnier
said of his dunk. ``I know you aren't supposed to, but I always do
it when the refs aren't out there.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, a referee happened to be watching, and quickly
flagged Trepagnier.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went back to halfcourt, he told me he would have to
give me a technical,'' Trepagnier said.
</P>
<P>
   It meant USC was down 2-0 before a second elapsed off the clock,
and Cal was awarded possession to start the game. The Bears (16-12,
7-9) jumped out to a 7-2 lead and never trailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're snakebit, you're snakebit,'' USC coach Henry Bibby
said. ``That's why I didn't start Jeff, there's a lesson to be
learned. If we weren't so shorthanded, I wouldn't have played
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans managed to stay close to the Bears, and trailed,
67-66, after Scalabrine's layup with 4:35 remaining. But Cal
extended the lead after Ryan Forehan-Kelly made a 3-pointer and was
fouled by Nate Hair on the shot. That boosted the Bears' lead back
to five points (71-66) with 4:02 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That killed us,'' Clancy said.
</P>
<P>
   Hair was in the contest, because Trepagnier had left the game
with a swollen eye after being poked by Shantay Legans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was seeing double,'' Trepagnier said.
</P>
<P>
   Cal added two more baskets to extend its lead to nine points,
and the Trojans were pretty much done.
</P>
<P>
   Especially with Scalabrine nursing a strained hip that he
injured against Stanford on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are grasping for straws. We were just fortunate Brian could
even play today,'' Bibby said. ``The guys fought. But (Cal) kept
plucking away. ''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine had just nine points and four rebounds, but it was
obvious he was playing more on guts than talent, and somewhat
surprising he lasted 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt maybe I could go out there and maybe my presence would
be enough,'' Scalabrine said. ``I couldn't jump at all or elevate.
Running, sprinting, getting good post position. Anything where you
have to use your lower body was very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scalabrine was trying to do something to shake USC out of
its malaise. The Trojans have lost eight out of nine games and nine
of their past 11.
</P>
<P>
   They need to win their final two home games to surpass last
season's victory total of 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's the direction this team is headed,'' Scalabrine
said. ``Trying to improve just a little bit every year.''

KINGS BENCH AUDETTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an attempt to shake the club from its offensive
problems, Kings coach Andy Murray reinstated Jason Blake on the
second line and benched slumping Donald Audette for Saturday's game
against Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Audette, 30, has just one goal in nine games since returning
from a badly sprained left ankle that forced him to miss six weeks.
Blake had played on the second line during the final weeks of
Audette's absence and had five assists during a five-game stretch
in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nashville is one of the hardest working teams in the league,''
Murray said. ``We have to have our hardest working players out
there. Donald Audette has to work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Audette's name came up at the recently completed general
manager's meetings in Palm Springs, but there is little interest
because of his contract. Audette is in the final year and earning
$2.3 million and probably won't be back.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings don't want to give him up for nothing since they
traded a second-round choice to get him. Last year, they ate most
of a huge contract when they traded disappointing defenseman Steve
Duchesne to Philadelphia. Duchesne later signed with Detroit as a
free agent and revived his career with the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Audette's slump has been part of an overall scoring dip by the
Kings second line. Bryan Smolinski does not have a goal in his last
nine games and one in his last 13. But Audette has upset several
teammates with recent comments that his production is not down.
</P>
<P>
   Audette already had surprised some in the organization when he
did not come to the arena Dec. 30 after Murray notified him by
phone that he would not be playing against the Edmonton Oilers. It
is an unwritten rule that healthy scratches attend games when they
don't play. Audette was at Saturday's game against the Predators.
</P>
<P>
   Audette was acquired from Buffalo in December, 1999 when he
could not reach a new deal. Audette scored 18 goals in just over
half a season with the Kings and five times in his career has
scored 24 or more goals.
</P>
<P>
   But after scoring 10 in the first 25 games, Audette has gone
flat. Even before the injury, Audette had just one goal in his
previous 15 games.

ACUPUNCTURE KEEPS PAROLED ADDICTS SOBER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CALIF. _ Frank Ruiz, on parole for possession
of heroin, cocaine and guns, was shocked when his parole officer
told him he could stay sober with needles.
</P>
<P>
   But three times a week the 39-year-old Panorama City man is
jabbed with five acupuncture needles in each ear, and he said it
has kept him away from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for that program, I'd be back in prison,'' said
Ruiz, who has been on parole and sober for four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'Wait a minute. I was trying to get away from needles
and you guys are trying to get them in me?' '' he said. ``It is
really different but it works out pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Of 98 volunteers who have participated in the pilot program
since May, four have been re-arrested including one on suspicion of
drug sales, said Roy Chaney, the unit supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, we have to chase people down. A lot of drug addicts
will be evasive. But these guys will come _ rain, sleet or snow _
and they like coming in,'' Chaney said. ``And they're losing their
craving for alcohol and drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jails and clinics throughout the nation have used the ancient
Chinese practice to successfully treat substance abusers. But the
Van Nuys program is the only one of its kind within the parole
division of the Department of Corrections in California, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   If the treatment keeps parolees out of jail, it could be
expanded throughout Los Angeles County, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any other programs working with outpatient
parolees to keep them out of jail. We're helping to keep them
out,'' said Joseph Acquah, the acupuncturist and Oriental medical
doctor who treats parolees throughout the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It works like this: half-inch needles are inserted in the
parolee's ears at points that correspond to the lungs, liver,
kidneys and nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say the treatment triggers the release of chemicals
including endorphins, which helps curb drug cravings, withdrawals
and promotes relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works, and they believe it works, then let them use
it,'' said Mike d'Agostine, supervisor of criminal justice services
at the Tarzana Treatment Center.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the clients at the Tarzana center have also been treated
with acupuncture for substance abuse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I saw a benefit to it. It allows some people to
relax more and decrease their anxiety,'' d'Agostine said.
</P>
<P>
   But other forms of treatment are also needed in conjunction with
the acupuncture, he said. The Van Nuys program lasts for at least
12 weeks and requires parolees to attend a drug counseling program
in conjunction with the acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   For Ruiz, acupuncture has meant he can hold down a job, sleep
through the night without drugs and improve his relationship with
his family.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Dolores, can vouch for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not down. He's alert and his eating is great,'' his wife
of 19 years said. ``The acupuncture really helped him out a lot.
Before, he was always sick if he didn't have what he needed.
Everything's getting back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Free of charge to parolees, the acupuncture treatment is a pilot
program at the Department of Corrections' Van Nuys office that
Chaney started in May. There is no set time limit for the pilot
program and the parolees come of their own will after being
informed about it through their parole agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that people have no more cravings for the drugs,''
Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after an acupuncture treatment program at Lincoln
Hospital, a New York City-owned facility in the impoverished South
Bronx, the Van Nuys program treats about 15 drug-plagued parolees
at a time about three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Often the parolees were convicted of other crimes, including
assaults, domestic violence and petty thefts, Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Haradin, 37, of Tujunga said acupuncture has pierced his
addiction to pain pills and stimulants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no cravings. Your thinking's clear. You're more
aware. Your sense of smell and touch is more clear. Before, when I
would drive down the road, I was only focused on where I was going
and now I see everything that's around me,'' Haradin said, with
five needles sprouting from each of his ears.
</P>
<P>
   And he has doubled his productivity at work from three days to
six to seven days of work per week as a tub and spa installer.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the third session, I was hooked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another parolee, who declined to give his name for fear of
hurting the night clubs he has owned for 28 years throughout the
Valley, said he too was hooked on the program after his first few
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a miracle,'' the man said while being treated last
week. ``I drank like a fish. ... Now, I don't touch it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The self-described alcoholic said he tried drinking scotch _
once his drink of choice _ after an acupuncture session.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't taste the same. It was bitter, spicier. It didn't
come in right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The man has a wine cellar at home that he now does not want to
touch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my house, I have every type of cognac and liquor you could
dream about,'' he said. ``I drink a lot of milk now. This is a
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the program began, state corrections officials have seen
dramatic results: Parolees are getting jobs, maintaining healthy
relationships and showing up free of drugs after weekly tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a dedicated group of parolees. They've been testing
free and clear of drugs and alcohol. It's proving to be a viable
treatment,'' said Ivory Roberts, the district parole administrator
for the Valley.

KINGS WIN GAME, LOSE TWO PLAYERS TO INJURIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The crowd was booing, the Kings were limping, and
it was only the second period.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth consecutive game, they came out flat against a
lesser opponent and lost goaltender Stephane Fiset and center Bryan
Smolinski to injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But just 28 seconds into overtime Saturday night, Jozef Stumpel
brought back the cheers when he scored his 100th career goal to
give the Kings a 3-2 victory over the Nashville Predators at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel, who scored on the power play with defenseman Karlis
Skrastins off for tripping, gave the Kings (31-26-8) their first
victory in a week. But it is uncertain when Fiset and Smolinski
will return.
</P>
<P>
   Both injuries came in the second period when the Kings blew a
one-goal lead that led to rare harsh treatment from the sellout
crowd of 18,118 at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset, expected to be the club's goaltender down the stretch
when he started six of the last seven games, left at the 14:15 mark
of the second period with a strained right groin.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Storr, who suffered a similar injury earlier this
season,finished the game and stopped seven shots.
</P>
<P>
   But just 36 seconds after Fiset went down, Smolinski fell to the
ice after taking a slash to the face by Nashville's Greg Johnson.
Smolinski was slumped on the ice for more than a minute and later
was diagnosed with a corneal abrasion of the left eye.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smolinski, who also received two stitches under the
eye, has been in a scoring slump, he was missed by the Kings, who
had just five shots in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was given a four-minute minor penalty for high-sticking
Smolinski, but the Kings were listless on the power play and never
came close to scoring even though Nashville (22-37-6) came in with
three consecutive losses and now have eight in their last 10.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille came in with a league-high 15-game scoring
streak, but was held without a shot for the first two periods.
Leading scorer Ziggy Palffy, who assisted on Stumpel's winning
goal, and second-line winger Glen Murray also were shut out in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray was hoping for better against the
Predators. Murray said Nashville's hard-working style is a good
barometer for his club, which holds the sixth spot in Western
Conference but is 0-2-1 in its last three games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings lost three times to Nashville last year in the
Predators' first season and most of the players said they were
outworked. During training camp, Murray pointed to the Kings'
opening-night matchup in Nashville as a message game and his team
won 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings returned to Nashville on Jan. 27, the night after a
tough loss in Dallas, and beat the Predators 6-2. Fiset was in goal
for both victories.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, Fiset was gone and the big guns weren't there to
help out.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have been slumping on offense and got their first two
goals from unlikely sources - Dan Bylsma and Garry Galley.
</P>
<P>
   With 9:19 gone in the first period, fourth-line winger Dan
Bylsma took a cross-ice pass from Bob Corkum and tucked it past
Nashville goaltender Mike Dunham for a 1-0 Kings lead. It was
Bylsma's third of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But less than a minute later, the Predators tied it when Scott
Walker fired the puck off the skate of defenseman Mattias Norstrom
and past Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings went back on top with just over four minutes to go in
the first. Galley took a pass in the slot from Sean O'Donnell and
scored on a shot over Dunham's right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   For Galley, it was his ninth goal after having just four last
season.

AYALA RETAINS TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS - It wasn't the kind of performance one might expect
from The Ring magazine's fighter of the year for 1999, particularly
against a fighter with absolutely no power.
</P>
<P>
   However, Paulie Ayala did just enough to defeat European
champion Johnny Bredahl by a majority decision and retain his WBA
bantamweight title Saturday at Mandalay Bay Events Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bredahl (45-2, with 23 knockouts), whose constant movement made
Ayala's job difficult, threw more punches than the champion and
landed about the same number.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, who also lacks power, appeared to win the fight by
landing the heavier blows. He knocked down Bredahl in the second
round but never hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   The judges scored it 114-114, 116-111 and 115-113. The Daily
News had it 115-113 in favor of Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   ``He boxed well,'' said Ayala (30-1, 12 KOs). ``I just landed
the better shots. The knockdown helped me out a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bredahl bolted from the ring when the 116-111 score was read by
the ring announcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready, well prepared. I think I did well tonight,'' he
said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary bouts, Bones Adams (39-3-3, 18 KOs) surprised
Nestor Garza (37-2, 29 KOs) by winning a one-sided decision to
capture the WBA junior featherweight championship.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, a slick boxer from Henderson, Ky., dominated Garza in his
third title defense. The Mexican went down twice and suffered a
deep cut above his right eye that bothered him much of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what was wrong with me. I wasn't the same Nestor
Garza,'' Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was knocked out by Orlando Canizales in his only other
title fight, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Oba Carr (50-3-1, 30 KOs) stopped Yory Boy Campas (74-4, 63 KOs)
after the eighth round of a scheduled 10-round bout to remain in
contention for a welterweight belt.
</P>
<P>
   Campas' corner stopped the fight because the former champion's
right eye was swollen closed.
</P>
<P>
   Carr knocked down Campas in the third round and led by a wide
margin on all cards.
</P>
<P>
   And Eric ``Butterbean'' Esch (53-1-2, 40 KOs) stopped George
Linberger(18-5-1, 17 KOs) with the first punch he landed a left
hook only 19 seconds into a scheduled four-round heavyweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   Linberger was knocked to his seat and wobbled to his feet but
referee Jay Nady decided he was too hurt to continue.

WHEN HARPER TALKS, LAKERS LISTEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kobe Bryant has had Ron Harper in his ear all year
and it would appear Harper's superego staccato is starting to drown
out Bryant's ego. The other night against Indiana, Bryant pulled up
on a 1-on-4 so he could use his teammates as a crutch, just like
Harper has been, well, harping on him to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wheeewww,'' Harper said Saturday after the Lakers' practice,
exhaling the way one would after a superb meal. ``That's coming a
long way.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have been talking about Bryant but, in fact, Harper was
speaking of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when it seemed inconceivable that Harper might serve as
the voice of experience for the best team in basketball;
unimaginable that he would sign on as any team's elder spokesman.
As a child he spoke with a stutter and the teasing and taunting he
took from other kids drove him into a cocoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sports, especially basketball, drew him out. Even so, for the
longest time Harper only truly felt comfortable when his play could
do his talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has something they have to deal with, I think,''
Harper said. ``For me, it was speech. It wasn't easy for me. It was
OK because it made me stronger. When you have everybody laughing at
you and saying mean things about you, it motivates you to find
something you can do good. After I started playing basketball, the
teasing stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6 guard hardly notices his speech impediment anymore
so neither does anybody else. Bryant, in particular, hangs on
Harper's words as earnestly as he does the rim of the basket after
dunking in gravity's face.
</P>
<P>
   This Lakers' triangle is working wonders and we're not talking
about the offense, per se. It's really advantageous, having the
benevolent Harper there to rein in the willful Bryant on the court
so the disciplinarian, Phil Jackson, doesn't have to be so harsh
when he gets a hold of Bryant later on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of know how Phil thinks,'' said Harper, who won three
NBA titles in five seasons in Chicago under Jackson. ``So I'll try
to say it first.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Harper so valuable is he also kind of knows how
Bryant thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time Harper, 36, was a slashing, scoring cyclone, a
small market's Michael Jordan. He rocked Boston for 40 points as a
rookie, in 1986-87, and was the central scorer in Cleveland, in his
four-plus years with the Clippers and in Chicago until you-know-who
tired of baseball and returned to the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's comeback relegated Harper to the bench. His pride was
hurt and he cried. But he quickly got over it and became a
defensive stalwart - chronic tendinitis in his right knee
notwithstanding - and the glue that kept all the Bulls' crown
jewels in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept all the egos in check,'' Harper said, starting with his
own.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder, then, that when Jackson took the Lakers'
coaching job in June one of the first calls he made was to Harper.
Their conversation went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Harp, it's Phil. Get your (butt) off the couch. I need you
here in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aww, P.J., I think I'm going to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hell you are! Drag that bad leg of yours off the couch and
hit the gym. Start training now.''
</P>
<P>
   How could Harper resist such sweet-talk? He knew it would be
hard leaving his 10-year-old daughter behind in Cleveland, but
Harper relished the chance to play alongside Shaquille O'Neal and
Glen Rice and Bryant, with whom he hit it off immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe was picking my brain those first two weeks,'' Harper
said.
</P>
<P>
   That was fine by him; he had who had planned to be a teacher if
his professional basketball career didn't pan out. Harper is happy
to conduct tutorials on basketball, even if it means teaching
Bryant and Derek Fisher and Brian Shaw so well his own job
eventually becomes obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted he had heard stories about Bryant - ``that he waves
the older guys off and does his own thing, that kind of stuff.'' So
Harper was relieved to find, in Bryant, the antithesis of all the
young players in the league who, in Harper's view, ``just go out
and play for themselves and don't even bother to learn how the game
is played.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is a quick study. So much so, it scares Harper, if you
want to know the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have all the basketball skills Kobe does, you feel
like you can do it yourself,'' Harper said. ``When I was that age,
I was the same way. I thought I could take two or three guys. I
eventually learned that if you can use all five guys on the
basketball court it can be a lot easier. Kobe's starting to figure
it out and when he does, man, this league isn't going to be any fun
anymore. Because he has the skills to flat-out carry a team.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Bryant walked by Harper in the hall of the Lakers'
practice facility just then. ``See ya, Old Head,'' Bryant said as
he breezed out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``See the abuse I take from this team?'' Harper said and his
smile broadened. That kind of teasing, Harper knows, is rooted in
respect.

 PAULIE AYALA RETAINS WBA BANTAMWEIGHT
CROWN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By JOHN STURBIN
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ A candidate for ``Fight of the Year'' it was not.
But reigning World Boxing Association bantamweight champion Paulie
Ayala knew he had left himself a tough act to follow in 2000, and
challenger Johnny Bredahl refused to make it any easier last night.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's Ayala, the 1999 ``Fighter of the Year,'' emerged
with a majority decision after a 12-round technical duel at the
Mandalay Bay Events Center. Ayala scored the only knockdown of the
night early in the second round against the gangly European
champion from Copenhagen, Denmark, who acquitted himself well in
his first fight in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala went off as a huge 17-1 betting favorite, but he needed
all of his boxing savvy to record the second defense of his title
at 118 pounds. Judge Guillermo Perez of Panama scored the bout
114-114. But judges Chuck Giampa and Al Siciliano, both of Las
Vegas, favored the champion by respective scores of 115-113 and
116-111.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let him dictate the pace,'' said Ayala, sporting sunglasses
in the ring immediately after the decision had been announced. ``He
was a good boxer. He had good lateral movement. He pecked a lot.
The knockdown really helped me with the fight. He was moving pretty
good. I couldn't catch him to the body as well as I thought I
would. However, I landed the better shots ... the more solid shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it tells me what I need to work on _ cutting off the ring
and being more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala improved to 30-1 with 12 knockouts and went the distance
for the third consecutive title fight.
</P>
<P>
   Bredahl, meanwhile, suffered only his second professional defeat
_ both in bantamweight world title matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped to win. I was ready and well-prepared,'' said
Bredahl, now 45-2 with 23 KOs. ``I think I did well tonight.'' He
had come into the fight as the WBA's No. 4-ranked contender.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala landed a left early in Round 2 that resulted in a flash
knockdown and standing eight-count administered by referee Richard
Steele. Bredahl continued to jab effectively thereafter and landed
an uppercut in the last 30 seconds in a round he otherwise
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala began pressing forward in the third, with Bredahl
attempting to spot his jab. Ayala landed a waving right to the head
with about one minute left, and tried to work to the body late in
the round. CompuBox stats showed Ayala had landed 58 of 116 punches
after three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala cranked up his jab in the fourth and began aiming to the
upper body and head. Ayala landed a looping right hook to the head
halfway through the round as Bredahl became a little more
stationary. Bredahl came back with a pair of straight-on
combinations, and the area around Ayala's right eye began to swell.
</P>
<P>
   Bredahl lost his balance slightly after an exchange to open
Round 5, but he recovered behind his long jab. The challenger
enjoyed three-inch height and five-inch reach advantages against
the champion. Ayala landed a nice counter right inside the final
minute, but Bredahl began to score with his left hook.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala landed 21 power punches in Round 6, when he hooked
effectively with both hands and landed a right to the forehead.
</P>
<P>
   An Ayala left to the face stopped Bredahl in his tracks with
about 1:20 left in Round 7, but the challenger laughed it off and
continued. Ayala scored with a pair of short lefts in the final 30
seconds before getting tagged by a left hook. Ayala landed 27 power
shots in the round to 10 by Bredahl.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, 29, weighed in at 117/2 pounds Friday afternoon, but
figured he would enter the ring at 125. Bredahl, 31, weighed in at
the division limit of 118.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala had been holding as a 61/2-1 favorite for the past two
days. But as first bell for the main event neared and wagering
closed, bettors at the Mandalay Bay Sports Book had installed Ayala
as a runaway 17-1 pick.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala was a 6-1 underdog when won the title with a unanimous
12-round decision against the formerly undefeated Johnny Tapia here
June 26. Ayala followed that slugfest with a 12-round decision in
his first defense against No. 1-ranked contender Saohin Srithai
Condo of Thailand at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum in Fort Worth on
Oct. 23. Ayala fought the final 10 rounds of that bout with a
``blowout fracture'' of the left cheekbone, the result of a right
uppercut delivered in the second round. nn

CYCLONES WIN TITLE, BUT CELEBRATION UNDERCUT BY BAYLOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO _ Iowa State is the undisputed champion of the Big 12
Conference men's basketball regular season after the Cyclone's
75-54 victory over Baylor at Ferrell Center yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cyclones, who were not allowed by Baylor officials to
cut down the nets after the game, still have the chip on their
shoulder from being picked to finish last by a prognosticator from
at least one publication before the season started.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy,'' Iowa State head coach Larry Eustachy said, ``I'm
sure he's looking for a job right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that anyone was pulling for us. We've used this
`Us against the world.' We finish on top with no `co' or tiebreaker
and didn't have to share this with anyone. We won it outright.''
</P>
<P>
   ISU (26-6, 14-2) blew open a 43-40 game with 12 minutes to go by
scoring nine consecutive points in the next three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones have a bye in the first round of the Big 12
tournament in Kansas City, Mo., and won't play until noon Friday.
The Cyclones meet the winner of the Nebraska-Baylor game, which
will be played at noon Thursday. Baylor (13-14, 4-12) is seeded
ninth in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 4,815 _ at least half of them wearing Iowa State
cardinal red and gold _ saw ISU win a conference men's basketball
championship for the first time in decades. One of the Cyclones
fans knew exactly how long it's been, and she displayed it on a
sign near the end of the game:
</P>
<P>
   ``55 YRS'' it read, while ISU fans chanted ``Big 12 champs. Big
12 champs.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1945. So there was plenty of celebration. But no one
in Waco was willing to go along with the party.
</P>
<P>
   When time expired, Eustachy instructed a team manager to get to
Cyclones guard Michael Nurse before he tossed the game ball into
the stands. The Cyclones wanted it for a keepsake.
</P>
<P>
   ``But \RBaylor officials\S came up to me and say `No. You can't
take that ball. Not here,''' Nurse said. ``They said they were
going to call the cops on us. This place is terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyclones players donned special T-shirts proclaiming their
championship. Then they headed toward one of the rims with scissors
in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   But the traditional postgame net-cutting celebration was rebuked
by another Baylor official. Security guards were called to stand by
while school officials negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that everybody does,'' said Cyclones forward
Marcus Fizer, who scored 34 points in 39 minutes. ``Our guys were
disappointed that they wouldn't let us take \Rthe nets\S down.
They're, what?, $30 or $40 nets. I'm sure ISU's got enough money to
pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even \Rthe players\S have enough money to pay for it.''

KINGS WIN GAME, LOSE TWO PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The crowd was booing, the Kings were limping, and
it was only the second period.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth consecutive game, they were flat against a lesser
opponent and suddenly were a lot weaker when goaltender Stephane
Fiset and center Bryan Smolinski went down with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But just 28 seconds into overtime Saturday night, Jozef Stumpel
brought back the cheers when he scored his 100th career goal to
give the Kings a 3-2 victory over the Nashville Predators.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel, who scored on the power play with defenseman Karlis
Skrastins off for tripping, gave the Kings (31-26-8) their first
victory in a week. But it is uncertain when Fiset and Smolinski
will return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal meant a lot to me, but I think it was even bigger for
the team,'' said Stumpel, who beat Mike Dunham for his 12th goal of
the season. ``We haven't been playing that well and we lost some
important guys tonight. But we came together with them gone.
Winning in overtime will give us confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Both injuries came in the second period when the Kings blew a
one-goal lead that led to rare harsh treatment from the sellout
crowd of 18,118 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset, expected to be the club's goaltender down the stretch
after starting six of the last seven games, left at the 14:15 mark
of the second period with a strained right groin.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Storr, who suffered a similar injury earlier this season,
finished the game and stopped seven shots.
</P>
<P>
   But just 36 seconds after Fiset went down, Smolinski fell to the
ice after taking a slash to the face by Nashville's Greg Johnson.
Smolinski was slumped on the ice for more than a minute and later
was diagnosed with a corneal abrasion of the left eye.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smolinski, who also received two stitches under the
eye, has been in a scoring slump, he was missed by the Kings who
had just five shots in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was given a four-minute minor penalty for high-sticking
Smolinski, but the Kings were listless on the power play and never
got close to scoring even though Nashville (22-37-6) came in with
three straight losses and now have eight in their last 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd wasn't happy with that,'' Stumpel said. ``They have
been very good to us this year, but we had four minutes and did
nothing. We heard them. We wanted to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille came in with a league-high 15 games scoring
streak, but did not get a shot off the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Leading scorer Ziggy Palffy, who assisted on Stumpel's winning
goal, and second line winger Glen Murray, also were shut out in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray, who is battling the flu, was hoping for
better against the Predators. Murray said Nashville's hard working
style is a good barometer for his club, which holds the sixth spot
in Western Conference, but was 0-2-1 in its previous three games.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gives the Kings 73 points, two ahead of No. 7
Colorado, which defeated Tampa Bay. No. 8 San Jose lost 5-2 to
Carolina and is four points back.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings got their first two goals from unlikely sources --
fourth-line winger Dan Bylsma and defenseman Garry Galley. Both
came in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   But until overtime, that was it.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings caught a break with 25 seconds left in regulation when
Skrastins tripped Palffy. The crowd continued to boo when the Kings
played it safe. But Murray had a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them there was no need to go all out until the end of
the period and maybe lose a chance for a point,'' he said. ``We
came out with the man advantage in overtime and I thought our
players matchup better with theirs. This is a good win.''

AYALA RETAINS WBA TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS - It wasn't the kind of performance one might expect
from The Ring magazine's fighter of the year for 1999, particularly
against a fighter with absolutely no power.
</P>
<P>
   However, Paulie Ayala did just enough to defeat Johnny Bredahl
by a majority decision and retain his WBA bantamweight title
Saturday at Mandalay Bay Events Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bredahl's constant movement and tremendous punch output - 962,
according to punch stats - made the champion's job difficult. The
European champ outpunched Ayala 2-1 and landed a comparable number.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala won the fight by landing the heavier blows. He knocked
down Bredahl in the second round but never hurt him seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The judges scored it 114-114, 116-111 and 115-113. The Daily
News had it 115-113 in favor of Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was faster than I expected,'' said Ayala (30-1, 12 KOs).
``But I have to say he hit a lot of arms and elbows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I landed the harder punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Mendez, Ayala's trainer, said his fighter strayed from a
game plan that called for more combinations and more punches to the
body. Instead, Ayala hunted almost exclusively for Bredahl's head.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Ayala was trying too hard to look like the
fighter of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I (begin ital)did(end ital) try too hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bredahl (45-2, 23 KOs) bolted from the ring when the 116-111
score was read by the ring announcer and later suggested that Ayala
was the benefactor of a hometown decision.
</P>
<P>
   However, remarkably, Bredahl (begin ital)missed(end ital) 751
punches. He landed 211 to Ayala's 275.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew with the fight being in the U.S. I had to win by
knockout,'' he said. ``What's done is done, though. I'd love to
fight him in !ital!my!off! home ring.''
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary bouts, Bones Adams (39-3-3, 18 KOs) surprised
Nestor Garza (37-2, 29 KOs) by winning a one-sided decision to
capture the WBA junior featherweight championship.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, a slick boxer from Henderson, Ky., dominated Garza in his
third title defense. The Mexican went down twice and suffered a
deep cut above his right eye that bothered him much of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what was wrong with me. I wasn't the same Nestor
Garza,'' Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was knocked out by Orlando Canizales in his only other
title fight, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Oba Carr (50-3-1, 30 KOs) stopped Yory Boy Campas (74-4, 63 KOs)
after the eighth round of a scheduled 10-round bout to remain in
contention for a welterweight belt.
</P>
<P>
   Campas' corner stopped the fight because the former champion's
right eye was swollen closed.
</P>
<P>
   Carr knocked down Campas in the third round and led by a wide
margin on all cards.
</P>
<P>
   And Eric ``Butterbean'' Esch (53-1-2, 40 KOs) stopped George
Linberger (18-5-1, 17 KOs) with the first punch he landed - a left
hook - only 19 seconds into a scheduled four-round heavyweight
bout.
</P>
<P>
   Linberger was knocked to his seat and wobbled to his feet, but
referee Jay Nady decided he was too hurt to continue.

DE LA HOYA FOCUSED ON MOSLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS - Don King, Felix Trinidad's promoter, warned Friday
that Oscar De La Hoya's controversial loss to his fighter last
September will haunt him if he doesn't seize the opportunity to get
it right in a second fight.
</P>
<P>
   However, the De La Hoya camp isn't biting. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, said Saturday that his fighter
remains committed to Shane Mosley for his next fight, on either
June 10 in Las Vegas or June 17 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he and King will negotiate for a bout to take place in
September and is optimistic that the money the fighters stand to
make - about $20 million each - will lead the camps to an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But weight remains a problem: Arum said De La Hoya is determined
to fight at his weight _ 147 pounds _ and it seems unlikely
Trinidad will move down from 154 after his spectacular victory over
David Reid here Friday in which he won the WBA junior middleweight
title.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said the fight would likely take place only if one or both
of the fighters are willing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long way from now until September,'' he said. ``...
When everyone cools off, takes a breath, I really believe it will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If they don't fight in September? It might be years before they
do.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is committed to staying at 147 pounds for at least a
year and, as more time passes, it becomes increasingly unlikely
that Trinidad will come down in weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't happen in September, it'll happen eventually,''
Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   If De La Hoya fights and beats Mosley, he is considering Vernon
Forrest, Shannon Taylor and Arturo Gatti as opponents this year.
Madison Square Garden in New York is pushing for a De La Hoya-Gatti
fight.

 &HT;    Former Coke employee accuses company of ``ethic cleansing''
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole and Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About 500 former and current Coca-Cola employees and
their supporters demanded Saturday that the world's largest soft
drink company be fairer in its treatment of black workers.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated rally at St. Philip A.M.E. Church in
Decatur came a day after Coca-Cola decided to allow
African-Americans affected by a massive layoff to participate in a
racial discrimination suit against the company without jeopardizing
severance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Larry D. Jones, a former human resources manager who was laid
off and the organizer of Saturday's event, said the group was on
the verge of calling a ``nationwide boycott'' of Coke products,
partly because of the pressure to sign waivers relinquishing the
right to sue the company.
</P>
<P>
   Now that those boycott plans have been ``postponed'' _ but not
abandoned _ Jones said he will work toward pressuring Coke to
change its employment practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fundamental problem that the Coca-Cola Co.
discriminates against blacks in the hiring, promotions, pay and
performance evaluations,'' said Jones to repeated applause.
Standing behind him on the church's front steps were about 100
supporters, including attorneys in the racial discrimination case
against the company and representatives from local civil rights
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Without providing supporting evidence, Jones said blacks
affected by the layoffs are leaving ``in droves,'' and he said the
exodus amounted to ``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who had been with the company for 15 years, said he has
asked Coke to provide specific data on how blacks have been
affected by its plan to cut 6,000 jobs worldwide, including 2,500
in Atlanta, or 40 percent of its local workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch said Jones' reference to ethnic
cleansing was ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The decisions we are making are being done for business
purposes only,'' Deutsch said. ``We are trying to do everything we
can during this extremely difficult time to do the right thing for
our current and former employees at every turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's severance policy became the lightening rod issue for
many blacks affected by the layoffs. Before Coke's switch, laid-off
workers had to give up the right to sue the company at any time in
the future if they wanted the more lucrative benefits package,
about double the regular severance.
</P>
<P>
   That meant those African-American employees who signed the
waiver would not be able to participate in the current racial
discrimination case, even if it is certified by the federal judge
as a class action, which plaintiffs are pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   Eight current and former employees allege Coca-Cola has
discriminated against African-Americans in pay, promotions and
performance evaluations. Coca-Cola denies the allegations. Both
sides have been ordered to settle the suit through non-binding
mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's surprise change of heart on the waiver policy, which
some observers called a smart public relations maneuver, came as
plans were being finalized for the meeting at St. Philip. Jones'
supporters first held discussions behind closed doors Saturday
afternoon and later held a press conference on the steps of the
church, on the corner of Memorial Drive and Candler Road.
</P>
<P>
   Telain Ware, a former Coke associate manager of national
consumer marketing programs, said the company's upper management
</P>
<P>
   ``is in complete denial'' about discrimination within the
company. Ware said that when she first started at the company 5 1/2
years ago, she was told by a recruiter that priority was given to
applicants who were already worked at Coke and wanted a transfer,
relatives of Coke employees and those referred by Coke employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few African-Americans have people who can go in and vouch
for them,'' she said. ``There was systematic discrimination even at
the point of hiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Another former worker, Angela Davis, said she supports a boycott
and said there is blatant racism in the company. ``You've got to
hit them where it hurts, although I hope it doesn't get to this
point,'' she said. ``I just want to see action.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph Wheeler, president of the Clayton County NAACP,
urged ``all members of the civil rights community not to sit on the
fence by stand with us and these workers...We cannot and will not
turn our head from injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said the NAACP will hold a regional meeting in
Greensboro, N.C. later this month at which time he plans to ask the
board of directors to approve a ``selective buying campaign''
against Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus Mehri, the lead plaintiffs' attorney in the racial
discrimination lawsuit, said the plaintiffs are ``more energized
than ever.'' Mehri also attended a meeting Jones held several weeks
ago to discuss the waiver issue with Coke employees. It was after
that meeting that Jones tried to persuade Coca-Cola President Jack
Stahl to change the policy. Jones later found out he was on the
layoff list.

 &HT;    CANTERBURY TALES MYSTERY SOLVED?
 &HT;    For Monday, March 6
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - A Texas physics professor thinks he may have solved
a centuries-old mystery from ``The Canterbury Tales'' by the
Medieval English poet Geoffrey Chaucer.
</P>
<P>
   Donald W. Olson of Southwest Texas State University in San
Marcos suggests that a rare configuration of the sun, Earth and
moon could have produced unusually high tides that are described in
one of the tales.
</P>
<P>
   In the classic collection of stories, which Chaucer wrote in the
late 1300s, pilgrims on an April trek to Canterbury take turns
telling stories. The work has been both bane and delight to
generations of high school students, many of whom have been forced
to memorize and recite its lengthy prologue.
</P>
<P>
   The students are later rewarded when they read the bawdy and
hilarious ``Miller's Tale.''
</P>
<P>
   But another story, ``The Franklin's Tale,'' has puzzled scholars
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The franklin, a landowner of free but not noble birth,
entertained the other pilgrims with a story about a young squire
who was eager to win the affections of a beautiful woman who lived
in a castle on the rocky coast of Brittany, France.
</P>
<P>
   To impress her, the youth hired a magician to cause menacing
offshore rocks to disappear. After exacting an enormous fee, the
magician performed an astronomical calculation.
</P>
<P>
   On a particular day in ``the cold, frosty season of December''
the magician declared that he would cause the rocks to disappear _
and they did.
</P>
<P>
   The magician's trick can be explained by an extremely high tide,
and Olson believes he has found that tide.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the April issue of Sky &AMP; Telescope Magazine, Olson
says that on Dec. 19, 1340, the sun and moon aligned to produce a
solar eclipse. Further, each body was near its least possible
distance from the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Olson says the combination would have led to exceptionally high
tides, the kind that could have caused offshore boulders to briefly
disappear. This type of alignment has only occurred a handful of
other times in recorded history; it will not happen again until the
year 3089, Olson says.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that Chaucer was familiar with astronomy and likely
knew of the unusual Dec. 19, 1340, tides, which he could have
incorporated into his tale.
</P>
<P>
   Chaucer also had visited France several times and he must have
been familiar with the remarkable tides for which the Brittany
coast is so famous, Olson writes.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said that as an older man Chaucer studied astronomy and
astrology. Since he is believed to have been born in late 1340 or
early 1341 _ within a very short time of the remarkable
tide-raising configuration of Dec. 19, 1340, he could have learned
of it and the corresponding Earth-moon-sun alignment while
calculating his own horoscope.
</P>
<P>
   If Olson's theory is correct, Chaucer would not be the last
Englishman to have a strong interest in the French coast and the
way the sun and moon could influence its tides, says Yale
University astrophysicist Bradley Schaefer.
</P>
<P>
   In March, 1942, almost exactly 600 years after the high tides
that may have inspired ``The Franklin's Tale,'' British commandos
on the HMS Campbelton took advantage of unusually high tides to
pull off one of the most daring raids of World War II _ also on
France's northwest coast, Schaefer says.
</P>
<P>
   The commandos sailed the Campbelton, (cq) an old four-stack
destroyer England had received from the United States under the
pre-war ``Lend- Lease'' program, into the teeth of German defenses
to destroy a naval dock at St. Nazaire, on the Normandy coast of
France.
</P>
<P>
   The dock, then the largest on Earth, was a worthy target, the
only haven on the Atlantic coast for the German Navy's capital
ships, including the mighty battleship Tirpitz.
</P>
<P>
   Like Olson, Schaefer uses astronomy to investigate history. He
said in an interview that in planning the raid, the British team
knew the vital dock would be heavily fortified.
</P>
<P>
   They chose a night when the moon was full and near ``perigee,''
the closest point its orbit would bring it to the Earth, Schaefer
said. The full moon meant the sun and moon were in an approximate
line with the Earth. That factor and the nearness of the moon meant
tides would be unusually high.
</P>
<P>
   The British commandos avoided the heavily fortified channel
leading to the dock altogether. Rather, they took the destroyer,
loaded with five tons of explosive, over tide-flooded salt flats
until they were near the dock.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the super-high tides, the captain had to have a
full moon in order to navigate over the flats,'' Schaefer said.
After slicing through anti-submarine nets, the ship crashed into
the docks at 20 knots.
</P>
<P>
   Commandos who survived the collision had scrambled off and
started blowing up pump houses and other facilities. Then the
Campbelton exploded and destroyed the dock, which was out of
commission for the remainder of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the 300 British officers and men were killed or
captured in the raid, and 400 German troops died when the
Campbelton exploded.

 &HT;    Killing poisonous snakes may become illegal in North Carolina
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the South it has always been accepted custom to
kill snakes, especially the poisonous kind.
</P>
<P>
   But that may soon be illegal in North Carolina, where the
state's Wildlife Resources Commission is considering rules to bar
killing and capturing of four species of venomous serpents.
</P>
<P>
   The eastern diamondback rattler and the coral snake are being
considered for listing as endangered species in the state, while
the pygmy rattler and the timber rattler would be considered
``species of special concern.'' The rule allows the snakes to be
killed only if a person's life is in danger, but outlaws the
keeping or trade in the snakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will result in increased concern by the public for the
snakes,'' points out Randall Wilson, manager of the state's
non-game and endangered wildlife program. ``It makes a statement
that these species are in trouble and need help.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will take action on the proposal in May. The
rules would not take effect until April 2001. The new rules are
part of several species of animals being added or deleted from the
North Carolina endangered, threatened or special concern lists, as
recommended by a panel of scientists, representing various
universities and federal and state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The state's other poisonous serpents, cottonmouths and
copperheads, are considered stable and locally abundant, Wilson
says, and don't warrant special protection. Opponents of the new
rules, mostly breeders for the pet trade and amateur collectors,
contend the measure would put them out of business and would do
nothing to stop the decline of the species.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all a wasted effort,'' argues Jerry Brewer, owner
of the Wilmington Tote-em-In Zoo, who displays snakes. ``The
depletion is not from the commercial trade, it's from development
of habitat, and more get killed on the highway than anywhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Brasswell, a herpetologist at the North Carolina Museum of
Natural Sciences, agrees that commercial and residential
development of habitat has taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that the snakes will blossom with this protection and
be crawling all over people's yards.'' he says. ``But if in the
remote areas we may be able to stop the decline, we've got a chance
to save the species. We need to be identifying large tracts and
protecting those areas for the snakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson adds: ``These species are being impacted by commercial
collecting.''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, people can legally trap or kill as many poisonous
snakes as they want, says John Jensen, a herpetologist with the
state's non-game and endangered wildlife program. Diamondbacks by
the hundreds are captured each spring at rattlesnake roundups in
Claxton, Whigham and Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   The roundups, coupled with development of diamondback habitat
for pine-tree plantations and farms, have been hard on diamondback
numbers in the past decade, he says
</P>
<P>
   ``Eastern diamondbacks are definitely in trouble in Georgia,''
Jensen says.
</P>
<P>
   Neither diamondbacks nor coral snakes were ever abundant in
North Carolina, found mostly in the southeastern corner.
Diamondbacks can exceed six feet, while the brilliantly colorful
coral snake is seldom larger than two feet. Both snakes are rarely
seen in North Carolina anymore, says Dave Davenport, curator of
herpetology at the state Science Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Timber rattlers, which can grow to six feet, and pygmy rattlers,
which are about two feet, were once common throughout North
Carolina, but are now in a steady decline, Wilson says. The North
Carolina pygmy has a reddish color, unlike the gray or brown
coloring of pygmies elsewhere, ``making them especially attractive
to collectors
</P>
<P>
   Snake breeder and herpetologist Dean Ripa of Wilmington disputes
that timber or pygmy rattlers are in decline. He also disagrees
with the idea that poisonous snakes are sold in the pet trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a harebrained idea,'' he says of the proposed rules.
</P>
<P>
   Ripa contends the rules will result in more snake bites, while
the Wildlife rangers will be tied up with thousands of telephone
calls from homeowners. Most of the calls, he contends, ``will be
bogus because most people can't identify one snake from another.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can people determine if their life is endangered by a
venomous snake when statistically the only snakes that is likely to
bite them is one they will never see until after the bite has
occurred,'' Ripa argues, adding that most snake bites occur by
accident.
</P>
<P>
   David Stephan, a professor at North Carolina State University,
contends that death from snake bite is more rare than people think.
A Duke University study of death records from 1972 to 1989 showed
that only two people died from snake bite in North Carolina, while
insects and spiders killed 42 and horses were responsible for 20
deaths. Even dogs and cattle killed more people than snakes, 14 and
nine respectively.

 &HT;    Census is too risky, immigrants say
 &HT;    By Gaiutra Bahadur
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Most of the men at First Workers Corp. were
entering the fifth hour of their vigil. They were whiling away the
time by playing checkers and watching television when Luis Fuentes'
voice broke their tight huddles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here in the United States,'' he shouted in Spanish.
``So, it's very important that we participate in the census.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes is a day laborer. Like the men he addressed, he often
waits for work on a construction site or with a landscaping
company. Their lives are divided between two countries, hustling
American dollars here for part of the year, returning home to be
with families in Mexico or Central America for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Fuentes is one of them, the other laborers shook
their heads at his appeal. Some laughed.
</P>
<P>
   They are perhaps the most hardened skeptics of the Census
Bureau, and, as recent immigrants, they rank among the groups most
undercounted by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Many are here illegally. Others live with several other
immigrants in cramped quarters meant only for one or two people,
without the knowledge of their landlords. Most change addresses
often. The rule in their world is to keep a low profile, not to
report their existence to the government.
</P>
<P>
   They are undercounted partly because of language barriers,
partly because of concerns about confidentiality and partly because
they move back and forth across national borders so frequently.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome that, census outreach teams in Austin and across the
country have tried to enlist the help of organizations that serve
and represent immigrants. But the effort has been hobbled locally
by a continued mistrust of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. The doubt has been nurtured by a possible loophole in the
confidentiality of the census and memories of a raid in South
Austin close to the time of the last census.
</P>
<P>
   The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act
of 1996 says government agencies or officials cannot be punished
for giving information to the INS. That conflicts with another
federal law that imposes a penalty of as many as five years in
prison and a $5,000 fine for Census Bureau employees who
violatepromises of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   After outcries from national advocacy groups such as the Asian
American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Department of
Justice in June confirmed that it is a crime for the Census Bureau
to reveal private information about individuals to any outsiders,
including the INS, FBI or Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   THE RUMOR MILL
</P>
<P>
   But the contradiction has left both immigrants and their
advocates uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could we imagine a situation where something would go wrong?
Yes,'' said Marisa Demeo, a lawyer with the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund in Washington, D.C. ``But by not
participating, immigrants will lose valuable resources and access
to political power. I believe we lose too much.''
</P>
<P>
   MALDEF is satisfied with the Justice Department ruling, and the
organization has devoted five community organizers across the
country, including one based in San Antonio, to reinforce the
importance of the census. It also has created a national media
strategy, including a public service announcement featuring Chicano
boxer Oscar de la Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   The position of the Asian American Legal Defense and Education
Fund is a little more guarded.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department ruling is ``a very good promise, but it's
not a guarantee,'' said Glenn Magpantay, a staff lawyer at the New
York-based organization. ``But in our legal advice, as an
organization that represents illegal immigrants, we can recommend
that the community should participate, and we will be monitoring
the Census Bureau for inappropriate conduct and will litigate if
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Asian Americans, Magpantay said, it is still lore that
President Franklin D. Roosevelt used census information in 1942 to
find Japanese-Americans for internment camps. A 1990s report by the
Congressional Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of
Civilians was unable to prove or dispel this rumor.
</P>
<P>
   But the INS also has tried to allay fears, announcing last month
that it will suspend ``routine operations'' across the country to
combat the fears of immigrants and their advocates. The agency will
continue to pursue cases that affect public safety and national
security, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these gestures, several local advocacy groups courted by
the Census Bureau to help promote the count remain unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language is too vague,'' Adriana Cadena, a policy analyst
for the Texas Immigrant and Refugee Coalition, said of the INS
statement. ``What is a `routine operation'? I don't know if there's
a monitoring process to make sure it trickles down to the agent on
the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, an umbrella group for immigrants rights and
service organizations in Texas, is providing clients with
information needed to make an independent decision, Cadena said.
But it has stopped short of putting its imprimatur behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big dilemma,'' said Nidia Salamanca, executive director
at the Political Asylum Project of Austin. ``On the one hand, we
acknowledge the need to get everybody counted for programmatical
purposes. For writing a grant, I need to know how many people there
are in Central Texas. But without a guarantee of the safety of our
clients, we can't endorse it.''
</P>
<P>
   Promotores en Accion is one grass-roots group that has agreed to
canvass Austin to educate its clients _refugees from the aftermath
of Hurricane Mitch in Honduras, more established Salvadorans and
Guatemalans here since the 1980s and a steady flow of others from
Mexico and South America.
</P>
<P>
   But while the group sponsors information sessions about the
benefits of the census, some of the group's own leaders, including
a 38-year-old woman from El Salvador who asked not to be named,
have second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   She has lived and worked in the United States for 13 years
without a valid visa and fears that she'll be discovered and
deported if she participates in the census.
</P>
<P>
   In all of her time here, the woman has never returned to her
native country to visit her family. The memory of her four-month
journey from San Salvador to the U.S.-Mexico border is too
harrowing to contemplate doing again.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, only a week after telling other immigrants that the
census is confidential, the woman doesn't know if she will
participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me?'' she asked. ``Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Her case of cold feet is rooted in the past actions of the INS,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of raids _ one that took place in the late 1970s,
during an Austin dress rehearsal for the 1980 census, and another
series conducted at restaurants and laundries in 1990 _ run deep in
the immigrant community and might have a chilling effect on
participation in the census, advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's likely to be a historical memory,'' said Luis
Plascencia, an associate director at the Tomas Rivera Policy
Institute, an Austin-based non-partisan think tank that studies
issues relating to Latinos in America. ``The details will probably
not be clear. But the perception will be there. And perceptions are
important. To the extent that the immigrant community communicates
internally, stories get their own momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   ARGUMENT FOR AMNESTY
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who works with immigrants is reluctant to recommend
participation in the census.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Fuentes, who made the onetime pitch to his fellow day
laborers at First Workers Corp., was speaking on behalf of Juan
Burrola, who teaches GED preparation and English as a second
language at Austin Community College. Armed with poster-size maps,
Burrola has been giving workers civics lessons on the census and
will help them fill out their forms.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question from a worker, Burrola said more
accurate information about the number of undocumented workers _ an
estimated 700,000 people in Texas and 6 million nationwide by an
1996 INS estimate _ would boost arguments for a general amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you remove day workers, you're not going to have anyone to
build the houses,'' Burrola said. ``(An amnesty) is needed. It's
time that the politicians started facing up to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Census estimates played a role in the 1986 amnesty that allowed
1.7 million illegal immigrants to remain in the United States. The
figures tempered political debates over the amnesty by providing a
relatively accurate size for the undocumented population, said Jeff
Passel, a demographer for the Urban Institute who worked at the
bureau at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Though convinced himself, Fuentes said he's unsure whether his
compatriots will see the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're kind of afraid a little bit,'' he said. ``They know
the situation. They know what they can do. But they are waiting.
... If the government is going to do something, they have to see if
it's positive.''

   McCAIN-BUSH (Undated) _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John
McCain criss-crossed the nation Sunday in search of votes in
Tuesday's presidential primaries. The Super Tuesday results could
clinch the nomination for Bush or, at the very least, provide the
momentum for him to dominate the March 14 primaries in six southern

McCain is fielding rapid fire queries from reporters aboard his

during the pepper drills of spring training. One minute McCain is
offering his political calculus of victory and defeat in Tuesday's
13 Republican presidential primaries. The next minute, he's
revealing intimate details of his personal life, such as how he
likes to pray. By STEWART M. POWELL.

</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PUTIN (Moscow) _ Acting President Vladimir Putin, in his
first interview with a Western news organization, said that Russia
must be a ``strong, powerful state'' that sheds confrontational
Cold War politics, avoids isolation from the West and remains
willing to seek ``more profound integration'' with NATO even by
joining it so long as Russia ``is regarded as an equal partner.''
By Patrick E. Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-PARLIAMENT (Beijing) _ Premier Zhu Rongji opened the
annual 11 day session of China's parliament with a statistic-filled
speech, highlighting economic progress, the government's battle
with corruption, and its hope for a peaceful reunification with
Taiwan. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-PINOCHET (Santiago, Chile) _ President-elect Ricardo Lagos
has launched into a harsh public criticism of the hero's welcome
staged by the armed forces for Gen. Augusto Pinochet's return to
Chile last Friday _ kindling a controversy that is testing Lagos'
relationship with the still-powerful military less than a week
before he takes power. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   PARIS-GRAFFITI (Paris) _ Ten years ago, some of France's most
prominent politicians defending graffiti writers as artists of the
pop culture. One Paris museum even displayed a subway car covered
with graffiti, along with videos of young spray painters explaining
just how they do it. No more. These days, Parisians have had it
with this particular form of art. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN-U.S (Dateline TK) _ The situation in Pakistan as
President Clinton decides whether to go there. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-PULLBACK (Dateline TK) _ Israel's Cabinet pledged Sunday
to withdraw its soldiers by July from the embattled strip of
southern Lebanon that they have occupied since 1982, preferably,
but not necessarily, within the context of a peace accord with
Syria.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   (Coded a)
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY (Miami) _ On the distant edges of the storm that has
whipped around Elian Gonzalez, another, similar child custody case
here has been quietly and quickly decided. In both cases, the
mothers of the children left a foreign country for sanctuary in the
United States without, allegedly, the fathers' knowledge, and in
both cases the fathers have demanded their sons' return. One,
2-year-old Khalil Shanti, of Jordan, has been ordered home. The
other, 6-year-old Elian, of Cuba, remains here. The difference, say
experts on immigration and Miami politics, is one of flags,
passions and power. By Rick Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   ABANDONED-INFANTS (Calimesa, Calif.) _ Simple white crosses mark
the graves of 38 children buried in a cemetery here. Abandoned in
life, in death they were cared for by a stranger, Debi Faris, who
was so touched by the story of an infant found dead in a duffel bag
that she convinced the coroner to let her give the child a proper
burial. So began the Garden of Angels, a burial place for
unidentified abandoned children. Now Faris has become their
advocate in another way: She is pushing for legislation that would
offer legal protection to parents who abandon their babies in safe
places. By Barbara Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   BOEING-STRIKE (Tukwila, Wash.) _ The chants and placards along
the picket lines are a bit unusual. ``No nerds, no birds,''
proclaims one sign. And many engineers at Boeing Co., most on
strike for the first time in their lives, say they are stunned at
how unified their group has become in the face of its dispute with
the huge aircraft manufacturer. Now into its fourth week, the
increasingly bitter protest here by the Society of Professional
Engineering Employees in Aerospace has mushroomed into one of the
largest strikes by white-collar workers against a private company
in years. By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>

anniversary of the historic march in Selma, Ala. By Marc Lacey.

   SOSNICK-PROFILE (Washington) _ Over the past six years, on
matters small and large, Doug Sosnik has been one of most
influential members of the president's staff, and one of the least
known to the public. He left the White House last week for a senior
position at the National Basketball Association in his typically
quiet way, with no public ceremony or presidential proclamation. By
John M. Broder.

   CALIF-CRIME-VOTE (San Francisco) _ When California voters enter
the polling booths on Tuesday to choose presidential candidates,
they will also decide whether to make radical changes in the law
that would make California the strictest state in the nation on
juvenile crime and punishment. By Evelyn Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-BACKSTAGE (JACKSONVILLE, Fla.) _ Like all presidential
candidates, Al Gore accomplishes most of the work of running for
office offstage, out of the public view. He spends far less time
speechifying or debating his Democratic rival, Bill Bradley, than
he does on the phone massaging supporters. Or going over the
details that are only minor when you get them right. On a recent
campaign day, Gore allowed a reporter to watch the way he and his
top campaign aides spent a few of those hours in between public
events. By Melinda Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN (Wilmington, Ohio) _ After the most tumultuous week of
his campaign, Sen. John McCain is still clinging to the hope that
Tuesday's critical set of primaries will give him some rationale to
keep his insurgency alive. By Alison Mitchell.

   CIGNA-TAX-SHELTER (Undated) _ Cigna has discovered a stunningly
simple tax shelter for nearly all its income. It earns its money on
investments, and Bermuda does not tax investment income, so Cigna
has moved its corporate parent to Bermuda. If other big
property-casualty insurers follow suit, some $40 billion in
investment income would go untaxed and the IRS would lose roughly
$14 billion. But the other insurers worry that if they all move
offshore, Congress will crack down and they will have wasted time
and money. So instead of jumping on the bandwagon, they're quietly
pressing Congress to shut down the shelter. By David Cay Johnston
and Joseph B. Treaster.
</P>
<P>
   EASY-ILLEGALS (Chicago) _ With unemployment low and companies
scrambling to find workers for the jobs they are creating, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service is looking the other way
when it finds illegal immigrants on the job. Border patrols are
working harder than ever, and the INS still comes down hard on
companies that smuggle aliens into the country. But once inside the
U.S., illegal immigrants are largely left alone. Unions are even
negotiating contracts that shield these workers from INS scrutiny.
By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   ASIANS-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ As the mass market continues to
fragment, one of the most desirable demographic niches is turning
out to be Americans of Asian descent, who are relatively affluent
and educated. But the market remains a daunting challenge to most
mainstream advertisers because of language and cultural barriers
and the great differences within the Asian-American market itself.
By Stuart Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-PAPER-USE (Undated) _ G. Christopher Hargett, president
of Meridian Research, a market research firm in Memphis, recently
used Mimeo.com, one of several new print-and-deliver companies, to
convert a 28-page black-and-white report from electronic form to
print, and to send three copies to an out-of-town client. It cost
around $30. ``I don't even know if it cost me more or less than
going to Kinko's, but it meant I didn't have to leave my desk,'' he
said. So much for the internet replacing paper with electrons.
Every study shows that e-mail, web pages and such are generating
more paper, not less. And now, it looks like they are creating a
need for those feet-on-the-street services they were supposed to
make obsolete. By Claudia Deutsch.
</P>
<P>
   ECOMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) _ The E-Commerce column: Privacy
advocates were relieved last week when DoubleClick, Inc., the
Internet's biggest supplier of banner advertising, announced that
it would put a hold on its plan to link personal identities and
other information to anonymous data it collects about Internet
users. Some of DoubleClick's competitors were just as relieved. As
privacy groups and legislators began to look past DoubleClick and
into the broader business of companies that serve ads on behalf of
Web site publishers, those competitors had been bracing for more
intense scrutiny of their own data-gathering practices. By Bob
Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
   FREE-ACCESS (Undated) _ Sizing up the prospects for the various
companies offering free Internet access services. Just this week,
both Lycos and NBC Internet jumped into that market. But some
analysts, and executives in the paid-access business, contend that
the free services will attract only budget-minded consumers willing
to endure lots of ads and limited privacy. By Laurie J. Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-DEMOCRACY (Washington) _ An international plan to
create the Internet's first democracy is plagued by skepticism,
conflicting goals and a lack of accountability, which will make it
nearly impossible for the Internet's new oversight organization to
hold a fair election in September, according to a report released
on Friday. By Jeri Clausing.

   &QL; 
``AS NATURE MADE HIM'' &QL; 
By John Colapinto (HarperCollins, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard about this book on television magazine and
talk shows, but until you read what happened to Bruce Reimer on
April 7, 1966, you won't understand the staggering trauma he
endured. On that day, Bruce and his twin brother, Brian, were set
to undergo routine circumcisions in the Canadian hospital where
they had been born eight months earlier. Bruce went first. Doctors
never got to Brian. Instead, their young parents were told that
there had been an ``accident'' during Bruce's procedure _ the
circumcision had been botched, his genitals were all but destroyed
and the family was left to make wrenching decisions in an era of
little knowledge and few options. In desperation, they consulted a
sex researcher at Johns Hopkins Hospital, who advised them to
``reassign'' their son as a girl, mentally and physically. So,
Bruce was castrated and raised as a girl _ Brenda _ until she was
14 and, in the book's most moving scene, finally told what had
happened to her. This is a chilling story about the power of
nature. If you have a baby boy in your house, you will want to grab
him and run for the hills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE WORKSHOP: SEVEN DECADES OF THE IOWA WRITERS' WORKSHOP'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Edited by Tom Grimes (Hyperion, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's some great fiction here, but we fell for the
introductions, the brief lead-in to each story written by the
writer or, in the case of Flannery O'Connor, Wallace Stegner, Andre
Dubus, Raymond Carver or others no longer living, by a
contemporary. Michael Cunningham, for example, tells the publishing
history of his story ``White Angel'' (an early chapter in his
novel, ``A Home at the End of the World''). He had sent many
stories to ``The New Yorker'' to no avail, but a friend insisted
that he try again with ``White Angel.'' To his astonishment, the
magazine said yes, and the story's appearance in 1988 made, he
says, ``more difference than I'd ever imagined,'' with a dozen
editors calling to ask whether they could have a chance at his
first novel. The stories are arranged chronologically, with Stegner
in the 1930s; writers such as Elizabeth McCracken and Buddy Udall
in the 1990s; and Ethan Canin, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Jayne Anne
Phillips, Stuart Dybek, Thom Jones, John Casey and others in
between. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``SHRUB'' &QL; 
By Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose (Random House, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We'd buy this one just for the title. In the introduction, Ivins
shifts to her other nickname for George W. Bush _ ``Dubya'' _ which
is good, too. Her book, subtitled ``The Short but Happy Political
Life of George W. Bush,'' is written from a Texan's point of view,
which is helpful because Dubya promises to do for the country what
he did for the state. Ivins and Dubose (editor of ``The Texas
Observer'') try to portray the candidate as he really is:
privileged, personable, unintellectual and most of all, LUCKY. For
one thing, he inherited a healthy Texas from Ann Richards, his
predecessor in the Governor's Office. Then there is his father.
``The political career of W. Bush is a fairly funny yarn,'' the
authors write, ``on account of being the son of a former president
is not . . . actually sufficient job training for the governance of
a large state. Fortunately, in Texas, this makes no difference.''
If you think that Bush's record is different from his rhetoric, and
that his resume is, as Ivins puts it, ``a little light,'' don't
blame her. ``There's really not much there,'' she says. ``We've
been looking for six years.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``DISH'' &QL; 
By Jeannette Walls (Spike, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walls looks at our fascination with gossip, beginning with the
columns of Walter Winchell in the 1920s and the gossip reporters
who subsequently became some of the most influential journalists of
the midcentury, and ending with the notorious events of recent
years _ the O.J. Simpson trial; the death of Diana, Princess of
Wales; Matt Drudge's theft of ``Newsweek'' information to scoop the
world on the Clinton/Lewinsky affair. Also here are miniprofiles of
former ``Vanity Fair'' and ``New Yorker'' Editor Tina Brown;
powerful Hollywood publicist Pat Kingsley (who redefined the term
``star access'' with her belligerence toward reporters seeking
interviews with client Tom Cruise); and Mike Wallace, who jumped
into the gossip cauldron with his 1956 program, ``Night Beat.'' In
the process of reporting all of this, Walls herself panders to the
gossip mill with mention of rumors of Cruise's homosexuality and
John and Robert Kennedy's simultaneous affairs with Marilyn Monroe.
Best of all, she provides an index. You can choose your own gossip,
and leave the rest to the tabloids. &QL;

`CARE OF THE SOUL' AUTHOR THOMAS MOORE SUGGESTS WAYS TO SAVE SELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN JENKINS  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (ALSO MOVIN IN THE ``E'' CATEGORY)
</P>
<P>
   In the Western world, a hard-and-fast line often is drawn
between the sacred and secular. But to be true to the soul's
nature, says author Thomas Moore, one must integrate the two _ and
learn to live life on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, whose ``Care of the Soul'' spent months on the ``New York
Times'' bestseller list, expands upon the spiritual principles laid
out in this 1992 book and subsequent ones in ``Original Self:
Living with Paradox and Originality'' (HarperCollins, $22). Moore
and his wife, Joan Hanley, whose woodcut drawings supplement the
essays in ``Original Self,'' are making a nationwide book tour.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 59, spent 12 years as a Roman Catholic monk. Living in a
Servite order, which was both contemplative and active, he learned
theological and philosophical truths that influence his writings
about the loss of ``soul'' in our culture. One of the most crucial
lessons he took from that time was ``the importance of living a
contemplative life, having time to be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way to give a little bit of time each day to
contemplation,'' he says. ``If you have that kind of experience, it
can make a crucial difference in the way you live in your active
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He says today's anxious, materialism-obsessed society could take
a page from ancient pagan religion, which took a holistic,
Earth-based approach to all facets of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we imagine the religious or spiritual life in limited ways,
the trouble is all these issues left to the secular world aren't
treated deeply enough,'' Moore says. ``The pagans had a lot of
problems, but one thing they did do right was (knowing) that every
aspect of a person's life has religious and spiritual dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as work. &QL; 
CROSSOVER ROOTS
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to assume it's a secular part of our lives,'' Moore
says, ``that it has nothing to do with our spiritual lives. Both
individually and socially, the difficulties we run into run so deep
they eventually cross over into a religious or spiritual dimension.
We have to begin realizing that everything has these deep roots and
all have some theological roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to think deeply enough, we need to be theologians in our
own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Original Self's'' essays address human personality _ and the
importance of passion, memory, living in the moment. Even the need
to own our neuroses and failures as unique qualities that make us
who we are. When perfection becomes the goal, much of life's
originality gets lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it,'' Moore says, it's about ``the faith in
oneself and trusting that life is offering what you need to live,
and take it on with such gusto that you can make mistakes. And
that's what I mean by original _ it takes a great deal of faith in
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore started writing the pieces that would eventually compose
``Original'' ``Se''lf over a year ago, finding quotes from his
favorite writers and expounding on them. His wife then read each
essay and created ``woodcuts in her own way that represented the
theme of each piece.''  &QL; 
KEY CONNECTIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Working as a psychotherapist for nearly 20 years, Moore says
that ``dealing with people's lives in tense situations'' helped him
clarify the themes he now writes and speaks about. He felt that
part of his job as a therapist was to help patients see the
connection between faith in a spiritual, as well as practical, way.
Being confident in themselves _ as well as trusting in some power
greater than themselves _ was key.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not separate at all,'' he says. ``It's a part of the
whole story. If you can just carry that faith forward, you don't
have to be paranoid. And beyond that, you can have faith that life
is worth living. It's seamless, as far as I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue is to have the faith (to) live your life so that
you don't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one major fault of our full-speed-ahead, Type A society,
he says. People are so obsessed with trying to master their fates,
to somehow reach perfection, that they fail to take ``generous
participation in the concrete life we're given.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of people who are realizing (that
being) a spiritual person is to be more tolerant of yourself and
others,'' Moore says.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he says, ``the word `perfect' means to complete, not
to be without mistake or error or fault.'' &QL; 
FEAR-BASED RELIGION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in some ways, Moore says, organized religion and its
concrete ``thou shalt not'' rules are partially to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of religion is based on fear, and that we should be
perfect,'' he says. ``It's a fear of letting life happen. I think
there's a profound lack of faith in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's only through releasing control that life gets
lived with passion and balance.
</P>
<P>
   As Moore writes in ``Original Self,'' ``. . . We pride ourselves
on our freshly won intelligence, while religion teaches the value
of holy ignorance. There is a thickheaded form of not knowing, from
not having reflected or thought, and an inspired way, being
sufficiently educated that we realize how absurdly little we know.
The former is plain ignorance, the latter verges on the sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   In his writings, Moore includes tenets and quotes from Daoism,
from Buddhism, from Christian mystic traditions, showing readers
that ``letting go'' is a common thread woven through most of the
world's faith traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't know everything,'' he says. ``In this Information
Age, it's hard to imagine this. What we have to do is become smart
enough to realize we're never going to know the context in which we
live. To me, that's opening the door to true faith.'' &QL; 
SECURE IN HIS BELIEFS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of his books' popularity, Moore often is invited to
speak at churches. He's talked to Catholics, Episcopalians,
Unitarian Universalists, and others. He's comfortable speaking to
churchgoers from ministers' pulpits, yet feels equally secure
addressing folks who ``hate church'' and organized religion,
because both audiences can relate to the spiritual nature of his
writings.
</P>
<P>
   The author of 10 books, Moore next will deal with deepening
one's spiritual life by ``connecting the spiritual with the
emotional, and tying together things pulled apart.''
</P>
<P>
   After that book is completed, Moore and his family will move to
Ireland while he writes about the richness of that country's
culture. He says travelers are drawn to Ireland not just for its
residents' trademark humor, music and storytelling, but because the
Irish have managed to syncretize strong Catholic faith with an
earthy, Celtic spirituality that's survived the centuries. He hopes
to show readers that it's possible to live in today's modern world
while retaining values that shape close-knit communities.
</P>
<P>

TIRED OF THE RESTAURANT RUNAROUND? GIVE THIS PASTA DISH A WHIRL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Good Friday and the majority of restaurants in Munich
were closed, so when we spotted one serving dinner, our group of
nine Americans arrived without reservations but with a powerful
hunger.
</P>
<P>
   The waiter's grasp of English was limited, our German was
non-existent. Guess what happened when I asked for separate checks?
</P>
<P>
   What happened was the waiter nodded, pulled out a little machine
and began to punch out our credit-card numbers and the individual
tabs. In no more than five minutes after finishing our meals we all
had individual receipts and were on our way.
</P>
<P>
   I cite this recent experience in an attempt to convince domestic
food-servers and restaurateurs that providing individual checks is
not rocket science. Although, I will admit, the Germans used to be
pretty good at rocket science.
</P>
<P>
   Why do some involved in a service industry refuse to offer this
basic service? It can't be because food servers are pressed for
time. How long do they have to wait while nine diners try to split
a single check that involves cocktails, appetizers, entrees,
desserts and tips? In the same time the Gaza Strip could be
peacefully divided up nine ways.
</P>
<P>
   Food servers who complain about separate checks should be made
to listen to a few things that bug the customers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Like busboys who try to sneak up and steal a plate when they
can see the diner isn't finished. Or who ask, ``Are you still
working on that?'' as though they are addressing a 2-pound dog
working on a 20-pound bone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Like food servers who insist, ``Well, I'll bring out the
dessert tray anyway,'' after being told it wasn't desired.
</P>
<P>
   _ Like waiters and waitresses who glower their way around the
room and smile only when you are about to calculate the tip.
</P>
<P>
   _ Like food servers who ask white-haired customers, ``How are
your kids tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   And Alice the Artist wants to know why order-takers often say,
``Great choice, terrific, that's my favorite, too,'' when I order
my entree. But when she orders, they nod silently and say, ``OK.''
She wants to know if they are trying to tell her something.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect they are trying to tell her they won't tolerate
requests for separate checks.
</P>
<P>
   One place where I have never encountered any of the above
problems is the popular Rhododendron Cafe in Bow, Wash. Here is a
recipe only slightly different from a dish they frequently feature.
</P>
<P>
   Rhododendron Cafe Pasta
</P>
<P>
   2 red bell peppers
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup chili sauce (I used Heinz)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons molasses
</P>
<P>
   Cayenne pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces smoked salmon
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sliced mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil (or 1 teaspoon dried)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups broccoli tops
</P>
<P>
   1 cup diced tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cream
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound spaghetti or other pasta
</P>
<P>
   Roast peppers under a broiler flame until blistered, turning
often. Let them sit in a paper sack until cool, then peel. Or, you
can use the equivalent of roasted and peeled red peppers sold by
the jar.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of cream, you can use low-fat evaporated milk. Instead
of smoked salmon, I used a leftover hunk of fresh salmon that had
been cooked in our covered barbecue the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the peeled peppers into a food processor or blender. Add {
cup of chopped onion, the garlic, chili sauce, vinegar, mustard,
molasses, cayenne, salt and pepper. Lean on the button until you
have a puree.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet heat the oil and saute the remaining { cup of
onions plus the sliced mushrooms. Cook until the onions have
relaxed. Add broccoli tops, tomatoes, basil, cream, Parmesan
cheese, the puree from the blender and the salmon, broken up into
small pieces. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the pasta in boiling, salted water until done to the tooth.
Drain then divide the pasta among four large bowls. Top with the
sauce.

`CARE OF THE SOUL' AUTHOR THOMAS MOORE SUGGESTS WAYS TO SAVE SELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN JENKINS  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (ALSO MOVING IN THE ``L'' CATEGORY)
</P>
<P>
   In the Western world, a hard-and-fast line often is drawn
between the sacred and secular. But to be true to the soul's
nature, says author Thomas Moore, one must integrate the two _ and
learn to live life on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, whose ``Care of the Soul'' spent months on the ``New York
Times'' bestseller list, expands upon the spiritual principles laid
out in this 1992 book and subsequent ones in ``Original Self:
Living with Paradox and Originality'' (HarperCollins, $22). Moore
and his wife, Joan Hanley, whose woodcut drawings supplement the
essays in ``Original Self,'' are making a nationwide book tour.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 59, spent 12 years as a Roman Catholic monk. Living in a
Servite order, which was both contemplative and active, he learned
theological and philosophical truths that influence his writings
about the loss of ``soul'' in our culture. One of the most crucial
lessons he took from that time was ``the importance of living a
contemplative life, having time to be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way to give a little bit of time each day to
contemplation,'' he says. ``If you have that kind of experience, it
can make a crucial difference in the way you live in your active
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He says today's anxious, materialism-obsessed society could take
a page from ancient pagan religion, which took a holistic,
Earth-based approach to all facets of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we imagine the religious or spiritual life in limited ways,
the trouble is all these issues left to the secular world aren't
treated deeply enough,'' Moore says. ``The pagans had a lot of
problems, but one thing they did do right was (knowing) that every
aspect of a person's life has religious and spiritual dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as work. &QL; 
CROSSOVER ROOTS
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to assume it's a secular part of our lives,'' Moore
says, ``that it has nothing to do with our spiritual lives. Both
individually and socially, the difficulties we run into run so deep
they eventually cross over into a religious or spiritual dimension.
We have to begin realizing that everything has these deep roots and
all have some theological roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to think deeply enough, we need to be theologians in our
own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Original Self's'' essays address human personality _ and the
importance of passion, memory, living in the moment. Even the need
to own our neuroses and failures as unique qualities that make us
who we are. When perfection becomes the goal, much of life's
originality gets lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it,'' Moore says, it's about ``the faith in
oneself and trusting that life is offering what you need to live,
and take it on with such gusto that you can make mistakes. And
that's what I mean by original _ it takes a great deal of faith in
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore started writing the pieces that would eventually compose
``Original'' ``Se''lf over a year ago, finding quotes from his
favorite writers and expounding on them. His wife then read each
essay and created ``woodcuts in her own way that represented the
theme of each piece.''  &QL; 
KEY CONNECTIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Working as a psychotherapist for nearly 20 years, Moore says
that ``dealing with people's lives in tense situations'' helped him
clarify the themes he now writes and speaks about. He felt that
part of his job as a therapist was to help patients see the
connection between faith in a spiritual, as well as practical, way.
Being confident in themselves _ as well as trusting in some power
greater than themselves _ was key.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not separate at all,'' he says. ``It's a part of the
whole story. If you can just carry that faith forward, you don't
have to be paranoid. And beyond that, you can have faith that life
is worth living. It's seamless, as far as I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue is to have the faith (to) live your life so that
you don't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one major fault of our full-speed-ahead, Type A society,
he says. People are so obsessed with trying to master their fates,
to somehow reach perfection, that they fail to take ``generous
participation in the concrete life we're given.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of people who are realizing (that
being) a spiritual person is to be more tolerant of yourself and
others,'' Moore says.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he says, ``the word `perfect' means to complete, not
to be without mistake or error or fault.'' &QL; 
FEAR-BASED RELIGION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in some ways, Moore says, organized religion and its
concrete ``thou shalt not'' rules are partially to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of religion is based on fear, and that we should be
perfect,'' he says. ``It's a fear of letting life happen. I think
there's a profound lack of faith in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's only through releasing control that life gets
lived with passion and balance.
</P>
<P>
   As Moore writes in ``Original Self,'' ``. . . We pride ourselves
on our freshly won intelligence, while religion teaches the value
of holy ignorance. There is a thickheaded form of not knowing, from
not having reflected or thought, and an inspired way, being
sufficiently educated that we realize how absurdly little we know.
The former is plain ignorance, the latter verges on the sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   In his writings, Moore includes tenets and quotes from Daoism,
from Buddhism, from Christian mystic traditions, showing readers
that ``letting go'' is a common thread woven through most of the
world's faith traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't know everything,'' he says. ``In this Information
Age, it's hard to imagine this. What we have to do is become smart
enough to realize we're never going to know the context in which we
live. To me, that's opening the door to true faith.'' &QL; 
SECURE IN HIS BELIEFS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of his books' popularity, Moore often is invited to
speak at churches. He's talked to Catholics, Episcopalians,
Unitarian Universalists, and others. He's comfortable speaking to
churchgoers from ministers' pulpits, yet feels equally secure
addressing folks who ``hate church'' and organized religion,
because both audiences can relate to the spiritual nature of his
writings.
</P>
<P>
   The author of 10 books, Moore next will deal with deepening
one's spiritual life by ``connecting the spiritual with the
emotional, and tying together things pulled apart.''
</P>
<P>
   After that book is completed, Moore and his family will move to
Ireland while he writes about the richness of that country's
culture. He says travelers are drawn to Ireland not just for its
residents' trademark humor, music and storytelling, but because the
Irish have managed to syncretize strong Catholic faith with an
earthy, Celtic spirituality that's survived the centuries. He hopes
to show readers that it's possible to live in today's modern world
while retaining values that shape close-knit communities.
</P>
<P>
   Which gets back to that premise of linking the sacred and
secular in everyday life. It's not just a message Moore preaches,
but one he himself lives out, whether walking on the beach with his
family, cooking a meal or visiting with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best meditation for me is playing the piano every
morning,'' he says. ``My work is so caught up in religion, and I
don't see any separation between my spiritual life and my work. I
feel a certain call from the world to `come out here and talk to
us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, if you're living a real spiritual life, you're living a
real full secular life. If you can (tell the difference), you're in
trouble.'' &QL; Reach the reporter at maureen.jenkins(at)arizonarepub

   Christopher R. Wilder had less than 24 hours to prepare a
presentation. He composed it on his laptop, uploaded it to a new
Web site, Nowdocs.com, and ordered 15 bound copies, complete with
20 color illustrations. Two hours later, the package was on his
doorstep. Total cost: $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convenience is terrific, and the price was right,'' said
Wilder, an executive with the Knowledge Capital Group in Austin,
Texas
</P>
<P>
   Then there was G. Christopher Hargett, president of Meridian
Research, a market research firm in Memphis, Tenn. He used
Mimeo.com, another new print-and-deliver company, to convert a
28-page black-and-white report from electronic form to print, and
to send three copies to an out-of-town client. It cost around $30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it cost more or less than Kinko's, but I
didn't have to leave my desk,'' Hargett said.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the Internet replacing paper with electrons. Study
after study has shown that e-mail, Web pages and such are
generating more paper, not less. Now it seems they are creating a
greater need for the printing and delivery services they were
supposed to make obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses require physical documents that arrive on time,''
said Melissa Shore, digital commerce analyst at Jupiter
Communications. ``And that means paper and people.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, no one suggests returning to the old practice of
print-and-distribute _ create a brochure or report, make scores of
hard copies and ship them out. The Internet is switching that to
distribute, then print _ create a document electronically, send it
out in bits and bytes and let recipients make hard copies as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   But this new approach brings its own problems. If the
recipient's computer is incompatible with the sender's, the
document can get garbled. And recipients have to really want to see
a lengthy document to scroll through pages of text, let alone print
it out _ not a great prospect for a marketer making a pitch or a
publicist distributing press kits.
</P>
<P>
   So it was probably inevitable that someone, somewhere, would see
a lucrative opportunity in adding physical distribution back into
the electronic equation. And now, several companies have done just
that.
</P>
<P>
   Internet start-ups, including Nowdocs.com, Mimeo.com and
Reprint.com, accept documents in electronic form, print them and
deliver them to as many recipients as the customer will pay for.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox Corp., hoping to get into the game, has been keeping a
running list of new entrants. At last count there were 40 names,
``and more get added every day,'' said Larry G. Wirth, vice
president for strategy at Xerox's graphic arts group.

   Copy shops like Kinko's are jumping in with similar services.
Web-based printing brokers like Noosh.com now handle large print
jobs from start to finish. Office supply chains like Staples and
Office Depot, most of which already own delivery trucks and offer
printing services, are considering similar Web-linked
printing-and-delivery services.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them are looking to blend dot-com technology with local
delivery service,'' said David Kaplow, vice president of the
Internet Research Group, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the companies that make copiers and printers
want to capitalize on the budding trend. ``We are poised to enter
the market at any time,'' said Timothy Andree, a Canon vice
president.

   Hewlett-Packard Co. has taken a stake in Mimeo.com, and is
including that company's services in its print services package.
``The Internet-enabled printing space is emerging rapidly, and
hooking up with Mimeo accelerated our entry,'' said Kriss
Kirchhoff, Hewlett's general manager for digital workplace
services.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox is nosing around for a partner, too. It, like other
established companies, views the newcomers as customers.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-coms may compete with us, yes, but they also can be
excellent customers for our equipment and services,'' said Frank D.
Steenburgh, a senior vice president at Xerox, which sold
Nowdocs.com its copiers and printers.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of adding delivery to printing service is not new,
of course. Bowne &AMP; Co., for one, has long offered such services to
large clients. ``The dot-coms would like to think they're inventing
a new wheel, but large players have done this for years,'' said
Robert M. Johnson, Bowne's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But while the dot-coms salivate over large corporate clients, it
is the myriad smaller businesses with occasional needs for printing
and delivery that are their most attainable market.
</P>
<P>
   Such customers may not be easy to land. ``Our biggest
competition is our own potential customers,'' said Jeff Stewart,
chief executive of Mimeo.com, which has been in business since
1998. ``They are used to driving to Kinko's, or sitting in front of
the printer or copy machine. We have to change behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   First, the dot-coms have to find these customers. One way is to
be featured on other Web pages. Nowdocs.com, for instance, is
listed on OfficeClick.com, which has a directory of services for
office managers. Mimeo.com has a link on Hewlett-Packard's page.
But the main form of outreach remains so-called viral marketing _
in effect, word of mouth (or mouse).
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kristie Royce, president of the training firm KLR
Associates, has used Nowdocs to print and deliver training manuals.
She recently persuaded the National Speakers Association to run a
blurb about Nowdocs in its newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a raving fan, and I'm telling everyone to try it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts worry whether such accolades will yield enough
customers before the companies' financing runs out. ``The question
is, will people find them?'' said Darcy Fowkes, an analyst for the
Aberdeen Group, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The other question is: How will each company set itself apart
from the growing pack?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the print-and-deliver start-up companies allow customers
to e-mail or upload documents to their Web sites, or even create
documents on the sites. Most provide electronic previews of how the
printed documents will look. Most will store the electronic
documents so that customers can reorder copies. Most offer a
variety of colors and bindings for the finished pieces. Most track
the documents from receipt to delivery.
</P>
<P>
   And most guarantee rapid delivery. Nowdocs.com and Mimeo.com
have both set up shop in Memphis, in the shadow of Federal Express'
main hub, so that customers can file documents late in the day and
still get them sent out that night via FedEx. Nowdocs also runs
printing operations in 13 other cities, in which it guarantees
two-hour delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of ourselves as a blend of the best of Kinko's and
Federal Express,'' said Brad Adamske, president of Nowdocs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Later deadlines certainly are a selling point. Geoffrey A.
Garbacz, a co-founder of Independent Research Associates, sends
confidential documents throughout the country. But he is in Little
Rock, Ark., and ``Airborne and FedEx stop taking deliveries at 4
p.m. around here,'' Garbacz said. ``With Mimeo.com, I can go work
out, have dinner, get home, send a document at 8:30 p.m., and it
still goes out that day.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the competition promises to be fierce. Although the
dot-coms have jumped into the market first, many of the older
latecomers already have their distribution routines down pat. Many
also have long-standing customer relationships, and deep pockets
for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Kinko's, for example, already has Kinkonet, which accepts print
jobs electronically, and the company is about to introduce free
software that will give customers an electronic preview of the
finished product.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kinko's is ready to add delivery options. It has more than
1,000 copy shops in the United States that it just hooked together
with high-speed data transmission lines, enabling Kinko's to move
documents around rapidly. In addition, the company has signed an
agreement with America Online. AOL gets to put demonstration
centers in Kinko's stores, while AOL customers are showered with
Kinko's banner ads and hot links to Kinko's electronic services.
Kinko's also acquired Liveprint.com, which offers document-creation
software online.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the brand and the distribution, and we've invested in
infrastructure, technology, everything to make sure we have a true
clicks-and-bricks solution,'' said Charles R. Morrison, Kinko's
vice president for product marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are finding less capital-intensive ways to enter
the business, without printers and delivery trucks.
</P>
<P>

   Sidona Systems, an Arizona company that owned Reprints.com,
tried a ``desktop-to-doorbell in 70 minutes'' approach a few years
ago, but could not make a profit. Sidona has since been bought by
Incunet.Com, a Phoenix investor group, which will soon reintroduce
the service. But this time Reprints.com will not do its own
printing or delivery. It will accept the documents electronically,
format them, give customers an online preview of how they will
look, then let the customers choose from a list of geographically
dispersed print shops that can handle the job. Reprints.com's
service will be free; its money will come as commissions from the
printers that the customers choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to own equipment, we don't have to worry about
billing, and our expansion is not limited,'' said Dan Blackledge,
Incunet's information technologies manager.
</P>
<P>
   For the early entrants, the growing competition is a blessing as
well as a curse. ``A year ago, you had to convince investors this
was a viable business,'' said Adamske of Nowdocs, which recently
went public. ``Now there's enough activity so that investors are
calling me.''

<P>
   As toll-free telephone numbers go, something like 1-800-FLY-4444
might seem a fine fit for an airline.
</P>
<P>
   But in the small but growing Asian-American consumer market,
``the number four is bad,'' said Eliot Kang, president of Kang &AMP;
Lee Advertising in New York, because it implies death in various
Asian cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives ``didn't think anything of using that
number,'' said Kang, recalling that an airline did briefly use such
a phone number years ago. ``But it would be like having the number
1-800-FRIDAY-THE-13TH in English.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the difficulties in aiming sales pitches at the
estimated 11 million Americans of Asian ancestry. Those problems,
principally involving language and cultural barriers, can lead
advertisers astray in embarrassing ways that most have already
learned to avoid in courting the larger African-American and
Hispanic markets. That is why mainstream marketers have hesitated
until recently to enter a niche that they might otherwise have seen
years ago as the most desirable of the nation's demographic
markets.
</P>
<P>
   After all, according to federal census and industry data,
Asian-Americans make up not only the fastest-growing population
group, but they are also generally the most affluent, best-educated
and most likely to hold technology jobs. They outspend other ethnic
groups, on average, in important categories like computers,
insurance and international long-distance telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers help explain why Asian-Americans have become
increasingly appealing to advertisers, as the mass market continues
to be fragmented by forces that include the increase in
nontraditional families and the rise of segmented media like cable
television and special-interest magazines. So-called diversity
marketing _ pursuing customers based on differentiations like race,
language preference, sexual orientation and age _ has become a
lucrative strategy for mainstream advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, on Madison Avenue, Asian-Americans appear to be
diversity's darlings. And with the 2000 census placing a new
emphasis on counting and profiling Asian-Americans, ad industry
executives expect the focus on that demographic group to become
more intense in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   But, as suggested by the way that airline stumbled over the
number four, advertisers seeking a foothold among Asian-American
consumers know they face challenges that daunt all but a hardy
handful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an uphill battle,'' said Kang, whose agency, a unit of
Young &AMP; Rubi-cam Inc., is considered the largest full-service
specialist in the Asian-American market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about doing the right thing, it's about doing the
smart thing,'' he added. ``But there is some discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   The significant differences among the ethnicities that compose
the Asian-American population require marketers to spend additional
time and money to communicate with a group that is relatively small
_ 4 percent of the total U.S. population _ and at the same time
highly fractionated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of confusion,'' said Bill Imada,
president and chief executive at the Imada Wong Communications
Group in Los Angeles, an Asian-American specialty agency that is 49
percent owned by True North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are fearful that if they get into the market, they
could make a mistake,'' Imada added, ``even though consumers tell
us they appreciate the attempts to touch them, even if there are
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another reason why those barriers to entry are not easy
to skirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, many marketers really don't think about this market
because they don't have many Asian-Americans on their staffs,''
said Alfred L. Schreiber, president at Diversity Business
Imperatives in New York, a consulting company he recently formed
with Wesley, Brown &AMP; Bartle, an executive recruitment firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``That lack of representation in corporate America puts this
group at a disadvantage,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   That is compounded by the unavailability of data like TV ratings
to help guide ad spending and placement decisions for the market,
which is still not large enough to be tracked by number-takers like
Nielsen. And some personal attitudes among ad and marketing
executives about Asian-Americans remain problematic, defeating
efforts to persuade advertisers to consider the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've bumped into stereotypes,'' said Michael J. Sherman,
general manager of KTSF in San Francisco. The television station,
owned by the Lincoln Broadcasting Co., runs programming aimed at a
dozen ethnic groups including Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans
and Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we went to an agency that represents one of the two major
supermarket chains in the Bay Area,'' Sherman added, ``and we were
told, `When your viewers go shopping, they head to Chinatown to buy
a chicken on a string.'
</P>
<P>
   ``These consumers are pretty much like other consumers,'' said
Sherman, whose station has sponsored surveys to help dispel
misimpressions. ``But with different cultures, with different
languages and different values, it's a little difficult for
advertisers to get their arms around.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not address the market in English?
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies indicate Asian-Americans want to be marketed to in our
own languages,'' said Wanla Cheng, principal in the Asia Link
Consulting Group in New York, because that is perceived as ``a sign
an American company respects us, values us and wants our
business.'' Indeed, by some estimates, two-thirds of the people in
the market are what's known as language preferent, meaning they
would rather speak in their own language at home.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers making the extensive efforts to tailor sales
messages to the market say it has paid off. For example, The New
York Times ran its first sustained non-English campaign last year,
aimed at Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to do a lot of work to build an infrastructure,'' said
Alyse Myers, vice president for marketing services at the Times,
published by the New York Times Co. The measures included changing
the colors of vending machines in the Chinatown section of
Manhattan from blue, their standard color, to red. The reason,
Myers said, was that ``blue is considered the language of
mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which included print ads, commercials, direct mail
and community events, was deemed successful enough to be expanded
beyond New York to San Francisco, Oakland and Silicon Valley in
California, Myers said. There will also be campaigns addressed to
New Yorkers of Korean and South Asian descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The different languages and cultures for each segment bring
levels of complexity, difficulty and expense,'' said Lynette Pinto,
director for multicultural marketing communications at AT&AMP;T
Consumer Services in Basking Ridge, N.J. ``But if it's done well,
it can provide strong returns.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T concentrates on marketing in seven languages to
Asian-Americans and Asian immigrants from six countries: China (in
the Cantonese and Mandarin dialects), India, Japan, Korea, the
Philippines and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But ``you have to be very careful,'' Pinto said, offering the
example of AT&AMP;T's so-called dial-around discount long-distance
telephone service, initially introduced in the general market as
the Lucky Dog Phone Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Asian market, we needed to adapt it,'' she added.
```Lucky Dog' was idiomatic English and did not translate in
language.'' Asian-Americans were invited to try the service under
the access code, 10-10-345.
</P>
<P>
   Those wading into the market point approvingly to a lengthening
list of blue-chip marketers that are joining them. Others include
Apple Computer, Hallmark Cards, MCI WorldCom, Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.,
the Seagram Co. and the Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that America is evolving and we have to respond
accordingly,'' said Gilbert Davila, vice president for
multicultural and relationship marketing at Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. in
Hoffman Estates, Ill. Sears has intensified efforts aimed at
Asian-Americans that range from posting store signs in languages
like Vietnamese, to giving away Lunar New Year calendars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful opportunity to capture a new customer,''
Davila added. ``We feel we have an edge over our competition.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Attempts to provide advertisers with data about Asian-American
consumers are being stepped up, led by a new organization named the
Association of Asian-American Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market is hungry for information, hungry for advertising
and responsive to it,'' said Shelley Yamane, a member of the
association board who is also vice president for strategic services
at Muse Cordero Chen &AMP; Partners in Los Angeles, an agency owned by
Muse Creative Holdings that specializes in multicultural marketing.
``We're hoping the census will establish the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The decennial federal census for 2000 is now getting under way
across the country, with the data expected to be released in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community was not organized'' for the 1990 census, said
Imada of Imada Wong, referring to Asian-Americans. ``But we are
this time around, and fully behind getting an accurate count.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the information is released,'' he added, ``the
growth from companies jumping into the marketplace will be
significant.'' The Chevron Corp., an Imada Wong client, donated
$50,000 to produce public service announcements in 12 languages
encouraging cooperation with the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian-American population is certainly getting a lot of
attention from us,'' said Kenneth Prewitt, director for the U.S.
Census Bureau in Suitland, Md. ``There's simply no comparison to
anything we've ever done before.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the census questionnaire will come in four
Asian languages in addition to English and Spanish, Prewitt said.
Census employees speaking those languages _ Chinese, Korean,
Tagalog and Vietnamese _ will be staffing telephone assistance
centers.
</P>
<P>
   And 13 percent of the estimated $165 million that the bureau
plans to spend on a paid advertising, marketing and research
campaign to stimulate census participation will be aimed at
Asian-Americans, Prewitt said, ``quite a bit higher than their 4
percent share of the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at agencies specializing in the market expect the
more detailed data from the 2000 census to draw advertisers in big
categories like drugs, entertainment, health care, packaged food
and travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have test buys from Gap and other consumer product
companies,'' said Hurst Lin, ``and we're carefully watching the
click-through rate results.'' Lin is vice president for business
development and U.S. general manager at Sina.com in Sunnyvale,
Calif., which operates four Web sites in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes by,'' Lin added, ``we'll have to do less and less
convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Kang of Kang &AMP; Lee put it: ``The Asian-American market is
like an oil change. You could put it off, but eventually you have
to do it.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The director of the highly regarded Spoleto Festival USA in
Charleston, S.C., says he is determined to put on this year's event
despite an economic boycott organized to protest the flying of the
Confederate battle flag over the state Capitol and his own
abhorrence of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the boycott, called by the state branch of the NAACP,
one of the festival's marquee performers, Bill T. Jones, has
withdrawn his dance company from the festival. In addition, at
least half a dozen performers, including Patti LaBelle and the
O'Jays, have canceled other concerts in the state in the last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nigel Redden, Spoleto's general director, said that
despite his personal opposition to the flying of the flag, the
18-day festival, which runs from May 25 to June 11 and is the
pre-eminent arts event in the Southeast, would go on.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he hoped that the flag, which the NAACP and
its allies regard as a symbol of racism, would be removed before
the end of the legislative session, which runs until June 1 and
overlaps with Spoleto.
</P>
<P>
   If it is removed and the boycott is ended, Jones will perform,
both the dancer and Redden said. ``But we can't plan on that,''
Redden added.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Jones said of his cancellation, ``It was the
only decision I could make.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Redden and the Spoleto board's executive committee
issued a statement saying that while they supported the flag's
removal, all the artists scheduled to appear had been asked to do
so in spite of the boycott ``because the festival strongly believes
that the arts have a unique ability to stimulate debate, draw
people together and ultimately to change them in ways nothing else
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Redden said that no corporations or foundations had withdrawn
their support because of the boycott, but that ``two corporations
we had been courting said it would be difficult at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was too early to determine what impact the boycott
might have on ticket sales, which are slightly up from this time
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' Redden added, ``we are receiving letters from
people saying they will not come if the boycott continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoleto USA has a major impact on the South Carolina economy.
Last year the state estimated that the festival had generated $1
billion in local spending since it began in 1977 as the American
counterpart of the festival founded in Spoleto, Italy, by
Gian-Carlo Menotti. LaBelle had been scheduled to give a concert at
the Carolina Coliseum on the campus of the University of South
Carolina in Columbia on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   After she canceled, the concert's producer, Woody Johnston,
lined up five rhythm-and-blues acts, including the O'Jays, to
replace her. But they also withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said he agreed with the singers' decision to adhere to
the boycott, which several sports organizations are also
supporting. They include the New York Knicks, who are to stop using
the College of Charleston as a training site. ``It's only going to
get worse until the flag comes down,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the South Carolina House, David H. Wilkins, who
defends the battle flag as a symbol of tradition, said, ``I would
like very much to resolve this issue with dignity and finality.''
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed removing the flag to the Confederate Soldiers
Monument in front of the Capitol, but the NAACP has rejected the
idea, and both sides appear to be hardening their positions.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight C. James, the executive director of the NAACP branches in
South Carolina, said he was pleased by Jones' withdrawal from the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It speaks well of Mr. Jones' character,'' he said, ``that he
has the courage to take an individual stand when he sees something
that's wrong, to have this symbol of bigotry and oppression removed
from the state Capitol of South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   James added that he hoped others would follow Jones' example,
forcing a cancellation of the festival. ``The festival, because of
its impact on the tourism industry, is a prime target,'' James
said. ``We have reached a lot of folks who make up the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Jones first approached the NAACP when he heard about the
boycott, the organization has been trying to persuade other
performers to cancel their appearances at Spoleto. So far none
have, James said, adding that he remained hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Redden said he would allow any performer to cancel a contract
because of the boycott with no ill feelings. Both he and Jones said
they hoped the dispute would end in time for Jones to appear at the
festival, and Redden said, ``I am already talking to Bill about
future engagements.''
</P>
<P>
   Most performers scheduled to appear at Spoleto did not respond
to phone calls about their plans. One that did was the American
Music Theater Group of New York, which is to perform ``Running
Man,'' a jazz-inspired opera written by a black composer and
performed by an all-black cast to the music of a mostly black band.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Wondisford, the group's general director, said the company
had decided to go ahead with its performances. ``I have had
discussions with the composer, Deirdre Murray, and others,'' she
said, ``and they are respectful of the position taken by Bill T.
Jones and are confident that the Spoleto Festival, working on
behalf of the participants and South Carolina, will do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Flummerfelt, artistic director for choral activities at
the festival, said the Westminster Choir College at Rider
University in Princeton, N.J., of which he is artistic director and
principal conductor, would also appear even though he is adamantly
opposed to the flag's remaining. ``It's a big opportunity for the
students,'' he said. ``None of us like this, but we have not
considered withdrawing from the festival.''
</P>
<P>
   If the flag does not come down and the boycott continues, ``it
could impinge upon the life of the festival,'' Flummerfelt said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, the producer of the canceled LaBelle show, said the
artists who would have performed at the Carolina Coliseum as her
substitutes had they not canceled as well were Destiny's Child, a
rhythm-and-blues group, and the singers Eric Benet, Brian McKnight
and Gerald LeVert, as well as the O'Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that other promoters aren't going in there because of
the boycott,'' Johnston said. ``It will be a unison situation.''

   In presidential politics, says Dr.  &UR; Randall Weil &LR; , chief of

</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Bill Bradley  &LR; could use some liposuction on his neck to
remove ``those extra folds under his chin.'' This would help in his
quest to ``be perceived as more energetic.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Al Gore &LR; 's furrowed forehead makes him look too serious, says
Weil. If he wants to be ``more engaging,'' he should have some
Botox nerve-zapper injected to ``smooth out those lines and lighten
the image.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - John McCain  &LR; is too white. A natural tan ``may not be great
for the skin, but he can use products. He's articulate, dynamic,
but looks too pale. More color will correspond with his
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; George W. Bush &LR;  should cover his gray, ``to add to a
good-looks package that will revitalize what's beginning to look
like a little weariness. It's also good for connecting with younger
voters, women. Hair color played a major part in  &UR; Ronald &LR;

was in his '70s!''

   &UR; SPREWELL EXPLAINS &LR;

   &UR; Latrell Sprewell &LR; , who became a New York Knicks star after

coach has to understand who you can push, who you can't push and
who you can push a little.'' If a coach is aggressive, he said, ``a
lot of players in the NBA are not going to tolerate that. Because
we're men, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell said he has definite limits to the amount he can be
disrespected. ``I'm not going to sit here and say that if I'm
really pissed off and in a dogfight, you know, I'm not going to
scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   About the incident with &UR; P.J. Carlesimo &LR; , Sprewell said their
relationship was ``abusive.'' The magazine notes that Sprewell has
hinted that he was abused by his father. What Carlesimo ``was
saying is not really as important as the frequency of it,''
Sprewell said.

&HT;     ON THE ROAD WITH MCCAIN'' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD ``STRAIGHT TALK EXPRESS'' _ Sen. John McCain is fielding
rapid-fire queries from reporters aboard his campaign bus, with the
aplomb of a veteran baseball shortstop lunging for grounders, line
drives and pop ups during the pepper drills of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   His easygoing repartee changes direction without warning, like a
flat stone skipping across a quiet lake.
</P>
<P>
   One minute McCain is offering his political calculus of victory
and defeat in Tuesday's 13 Republican presidential primaries. The
next minute, he's revealing intimate details of his personal life,
such as how he likes to pray.
</P>
<P>
   The bus, a luxury coach with leather-like armchairs and benches,
is equipped with a bathroom and kitchenette. The campaign, fueled
by doughnuts, also keeps a hefty supply of bottled water and soda
on board. The candidate sits in an arm chair in the middle of the
bus, surrounded by reporters, in a scene that combines a rolling
news conference, fraternity house bull session, and a holiday
dinner with extended family all rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a campaign aide calls out that the driver in a white
van alongside McCain's campaign bus is holding out a hand-written
sign of support for the candidate. McCain enthusiastically waves at
the driver and gives him a thumbs up before spotting cigarettes on
the shelf beneath the driver's windshield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a smoker,'' laments McCain. ``God almighty, I hope he
gets to vote before the lung cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the free-wheeling world of John McCain, a
let-it-all-hang-out habitat built around the irreverent former Navy
fighter pilot who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war
during the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's insurgent campaign for the GOP presidential nomination
has been centered on his bus _ the ``Straight Talk Express'' _ as
he traveled in smaller primary states. But now, with the Super
Tuesday states spread around the nation, McCain has abandoned the
bus in favor of a chartered Pan American 727.
</P>
<P>
   Chatting with reporters on what may the last leg of the bus
odyssey as he traveled from New York City to Fairfield, Conn., last
Friday, McCain sounded like he was saying good bye to a good
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I was thinking,'' McCain said. ``Between now and
Tuesday, there's not going to be a lot of bus time.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, McCain awoke in Buffalo, N.Y., and flew to campaign
events in two communities in Ohio before ending his day in San
Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Larson, a traveling campaign aide, likes to think that
the Straight Talk Express will live on as the moniker for whatever
mode of transportation McCain uses for the remainder of the
campaign. It will be just like the designation ``Air Force One''
that applies to any aircraft carrying the president, Larson says.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has set an unprecedented standard for media access during
his campaign. His campaign is on display every waking moment.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments during these rolling news conferences have
occasionally required follow-up explanations or apologies by the
candidate or his aides.
</P>
<P>
   But they have generated nonstop news coverage for the
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways McCain's life aboard his campaign bus resembles the
collegiality and hardships of imprisonment in North Vietnam and
before that, his day-to-day existence in the cramped, crowded
spaces aboard the aircraft carriers where he often served as a
fighter pilot during his 22-year Navy career.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy is non existent. Off-the-cuff humor is welcome. Quips,
kidding and pranks are tickets to entry.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing across a dozen reporters gathered around him in booths
aboard his campaign bus and across their tape recorders on the
table before him, McCain lets it all hang out. What about a letter
written by his campaign to New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
commending the New York Republican's efforts to keep the
McCain-Bush contest in New York focused on the issues?
</P>
<P>
   The letter is news to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey Rick,'' McCain shouts to his campaign manager, Rick Davis,
who is standing at the rear of the bus near the kitchenette. ``Did
I write a letter to Giuliani?''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who exercises wide leeway the McCain camp, sheepishly
tells his boss that, yes, indeed, the senator did send a ``Thank
you'' letter to Giuliani that had been released to the press two
hours ago back in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I do that during my nap, Rick?'' McCain jokes. ``Looks
like I'm pretty prolific while I'm asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   What about campaign travel plans after Super Tuesday primaries?
McCain turns to Davis to handle ``process'' questions. Davis lays
out an ambitious schedule of visits to Colorado, Utah and Illinois
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like the cuckolded husband _ always the last to know,''
jokes McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The range of the conversation is astonishing. In barely two
hours, McCain expresses disappointment with portions of last
Thursday night's nationally broadcast candidates' debate. He
analyzes his speech in the financial district on Wall Street on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He concedes an absence of experience dealing with education
issues, as a result of devoting his Senate career to military
issues and chairing the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain touches on his plan to topple rogue nation dictators like
Iraq's Saddam Hussein. He expresses ambitious hopes to help Sri
Lanka settle a domestic guerrilla war. He says America ought to
lend a hand battling the AIDS epidemic crippling black Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Without warning, McCain is asked about his personal religious
practices. McCain says he began attending a Baptist church in
Arizona because he was drawn to the minister. His children were
christened as Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his late father, a Navy admiral, McCain adds: ``I
pray, but not in the way that he did. He was one of those that got
on his knees.''
</P>
<P>
   He moves on to voice admiration for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., as a savvy, single minded ``warrior'' for his causes in
the Senate. He talks at length about his tempestuous relationship
with Texas billionaire Ross Perot, who helped prisoners of war
during Vietnam but broke with some veterans such as McCain over his
dogged insistence that living American prisoners were abandoned by
the U.S. government at the end of the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who long had a reputation as a prankster in his Navy
days, still likes to play the part. He invokes an exemption to the
ground rules for dealings with the press corps on his campaign bus
_ on-the-record for quotation all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond Tuesday's make-or-break primaries for McCain, a
``low ranking campaign official'' on McCain's campaign bus delights
his audience with the possibility that the presidential candidate
might just venture to Austin, Texas, to sign copies of his memoir
``Faith of My Fathers'' at a bookstore a block down the street from
the state capitol where Bush presides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't that be fun?'' wonders the campaign official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   McCain just smiles.

 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The first full-scale biography of David Geffen,
which depicts the billionaire entertainment industry figure as
brilliant but cunning and corrosive, has outraged Geffen, stirred
tensions at his studio, DreamWorks SKG, and placed pressures on
media companies as diverse as Time Warner, Dow Jones, and
Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book, which was kept under wraps until recently,
will be distributed to stores this week, it has already created
extraordinary interest in the entertainment industry, where the
career of the the 57-year-old executive has included the roles of
talent agent, music mogul, Broadway producer and Hollywood studio
founder.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys and Sells
the New Hollywood,'' is by Tom King, a former reporter for The Wall
Street Journal and now a columnist at the newspaper. Geffen
selected King to serve as his biographer in 1996, gave eight
interviews to the writer and allowed unimpeded access to his circle
of friends, including movie and recording industry stars and
executives. But when King was at the midpoint of his research,
Geffen abruptly broke off contact with the author and said he was
writing a salacious book and not a serious one. King denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his home in Malibu, Calif., Geffen said he would have
no comment on the book. Privately, Geffen has told friends that
cooperating in the book project was the biggest mistake of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   But Terry Press, the executive in charge of publicity and
marketing at DreamWorks, said some details of the book were
factually untrue. ``David feels the book impugns his integrity to a
level that's not true,'' Press said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book does not have, on balance, the way that David has
played out his life,'' she said. ``David is truthful about his
life, warts and all. And he wished to have that reflected in the
book. He was also hoping the book would be an inspiration to young
gay people.''
</P>
<P>
   King himself said he believed that he was selected by Geffen to
write the biography _ and numerous writers have sought out Geffen
to write such a book _ for two reasons. ``I work for a respectable
organization like The Wall Street Journal, and I'm gay,'' King
said. ``It's no secret that David has a rather colorful personal
story. I think he thought having a biographer who was gay might
lead to a more empathetic portrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, Geffen agreed to cooperate with King and open as
many doors as possible to the author. King interviewed about 300
people, including Barry Diller, Calvin Klein, Steven Spielberg,
Jeffrey Katzenberg, Michael Ovitz and Edgar Bronfman Jr., Yoko Ono,
Donna Summer, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young. The
agreement, though, between the author and Geffen was that the mogul
would have no control over the content of the book.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Godoff, president and editor in chief of Random House, which
is publishing the biography, said the book had a first printing of
80,000 copies, and there had been extraordinary anticipation for
it, especially in Los Angeles. ``I'm cautiously optimistic about
the sales,'' Godoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Random House, which is part of the German media conglomerate
Bertelsmann, has gone to an unusual length to promote the book in
Los Angeles. It purchased a billboard on the busy corner of Sunset
Boulevard and Doheny Drive. The billboard, usually reserved for
film and television advertising, is less than a block away from a
building that served as Geffen's headquarters for years.
</P>
<P>
   Godoff made it plain that Geffen's past use of litigation was
never far from the minds of executives at Random House. ``We
certainly vetted the book very carefully,'' she said. ``We were
aware of his reputation that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The book depicts the extraordinary rise of an entertainment
industry titan from a poor family in Brooklyn, N.Y., to lavish
success. On a business level, Geffen is seen as dazzling in his
ability to spot talented entertainers _ whether it was Jackson
Browne, the Eagles or Tom Cruise _ as well as ruthless in his
pursuit of money, sometimes at the expense of friends. On a
personal level, Geffen is viewed by King as a man with a
frightening temper, sometimes generous, sometimes bullying,
calculating, and, to some degree, lonely.
</P>
<P>
   King, in his book, calls Geffen ``a shrewd, remarkably focused
strategist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an uncanny ability to understand people, recognize
their weaknesses, and capitalize on them,'' King wrote. But Geffen
was also depicted ``at his worst, as a man willing to implode any
business or personal relationship to attain his goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is littered with incidents involving people who were
once close friends of Geffen's but endured long estrangements from
him because of incidents that one side or the other viewed as
betrayals. These include performers like Paul Simon, Don Henley and
Joni Mitchell, as well as the music industry figures Clive Davis
and Ahmet Ertegun.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to other entertainment power brokers, Geffen did
clearly seek a serious and even balanced book. Other Hollywood
moguls, like Michael Ovitz, have been the subjects of biographies
that were discredited by critics because they were so fawning.
Similarly, a recent autobiography by Michael D. Eisner, chairman of
the Walt Disney Co., was attacked by reviewers for its lack of
candor.
</P>
<P>
   Random House executives said that they had been aware for months
of Geffen's strong feelings. Last fall, Bert Fields, a well-known
entertainment industry lawyer who represents Geffen, visited the
offices of Random House to express his concerns to Peter Olson, the
publishing house's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Random House executives said, Geffen himself
called Thomas Middelhoff, chairman and chief executive of
Bertelsmann. Middelhoff told Geffen to take his complaints to
Olson. Random House executives said Geffen phoned Olson on Feb. 8.
``Geffen characterized the book as dishonest, offensive and
inaccurate,'' said Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House.
``Peter made it clear that he stood behind the publisher and the
vetting process.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Readers got their first peeks at the book recently when The Wall
Street Journal and People magazine published excerpts. Godoff said
that Talk Magazine and Vanity Fair had also sought exclusive
magazine rights, but that she had opted for People, which is owned
by Time Warner, because it had a broad range of readers, especially
in the middle of the country. That excerpt dealt with Geffen's
complicated relationship with, and near-marriage to, Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief at Time Inc., who oversees
the company's magazines, including People, said that before the
publication of the article he received three phone calls from
mutual friends of his and Geffen's. Pearlstine said he has known
Geffen for nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them called and said, `Don't run the piece,'''
Pearlstine said. ``One person called and said David was raising
questions about factual accuracies in the book. They said there
were myriad mistakes. People called and said that David was very
concerned about the excerpt and would I take a look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearlstine said he would have read the excerpt beforehand
anyway, but that he had asked for and received the entire
manuscript. Pearlstine himself, a former executive editor of The
Wall Street Journal, had hired King there in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept hearing about mistakes,'' said Pearlstine. ``I finally
called David and said, `If you think there are serious mistakes in
this book, I'd like to know what those mistakes are.' He said he
didn't want to go into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Geffen himself called Laura Landro, a Journal editor in charge
of media and marketing coverage, to complain about the newspaper's
decision to print an excerpt.
</P>
<P>
   The excerpt was a brutal one: It dealt with what King
characterized as Geffen's humiliation of the wife of Mo Ostin, a
top record executive, in order to deliberately break off his
friendship with Ostin so that he could win favorable terms in a
deal that would eventually make him a billionaire. (Despite the
incident, Ostin now runs the music division at DreamWorks, the
company Geffen owns with Spielberg and Katzenberg.)
</P>
<P>
   Richard Tofel, vice president of corporate communications at Dow
Jones &AMP; Co., which publishes The Journal, said: ``Laura had a
conversation with someone at DreamWorks expressing great
unhappiness about the book. Frankly, they were venting.'' Others
said that it was Geffen who called Landro.
</P>
<P>
   The book has stirred tensions at DreamWorks. Geffen has lashed
out at Press, the DreamWorks executive, who had urged him to
cooperate with King because of his solid reputation and because it
would preclude more scandal-ridden books by marginal writers.
</P>
<P>
   Press did not deny that Geffen was upset with her. ``He's mostly
angry at himself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Press said that Geffen's initial aim was to have a biography
similar to Roger Lowenstein's 1995 best seller, ``Buffett: The
Making of an American Capitalist,'' about Warren Buffett, the
Omaha, Neb., billionaire. But Buffett's personality, life, career
and friendships are hardly as colorful as Geffen's.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what soured Geffen on King's work, even before he read
the book, is unclear. By all accounts, he began hearing from
friends and associates about King's line of questioning. One person
who was interviewed secretly tape recorded the interview, and sent
it on to Geffen, people connected with the book say.
</P>
<P>
   King said that in October 1997, Geffen called him and calmly
told him: ``I am not going to grant you any more interviews. Why
should I cooperate with a book that may offend me?''
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, King sent Geffen the entire copy of the book.
King said A. Scott Berg, the biographer and a friend of his, had
told him that, customarily, authors send their subjects a copy of
the transcript in order to make last-minute corrections of fact.
</P>
<P>
   King said he received a one paragraph fax from Geffen,
expressing his deep unhappiness. ``He said he didn't want to waste
any time or energy making corrections,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   King insisted that the book was balanced. ``It gives David
Geffen every credit he deserves for the irrefutable and staggering
contribution that he's made to pop culture history, while at the
same time baring the man behind the legend.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An international plan to create the Internet's
first democracy is plagued by skepticism, conflicting goals and a
lack of accountability, which will make it nearly impossible for
the Internet's new oversight organization to hold a fair election
in September, according to a report released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by two influential public interest groups, stopped
short of recommending that the organization, the Internet Corp. for
Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, postpone its September board
election.
</P>
<P>
   But the report urged Icann to make major improvements in its
plan to let individual computer users around the world help elect
half the board's 18 members. Otherwise, the report said, Icann
risks losing the legitimacy that it needs to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan is clearly not ready for prime time,'' said Jerry
Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and
Technology, which wrote the report with Common Cause, both public
interests groups based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson, interim chairwoman of Icann, called the report
``sensible.'' But she said remedies, if any, would not come at the
risk of delaying the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic message from them is go slow,'' Dyson said of the
report's writers. ``And our basic message is we have got to move
forward,'' she said in a telephone interview from Britain. ``We
agree with you that it is experimental and we are putting in as
many checks and balances as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Icann's current voting plan would allow any Internet user over
the age of 16 who has an e-mail and postal address to participate
in the international election of a special council, which in turn
would appoint the remaining nine members to the 18-member board.
The other nine members, representing various commercial
constituencies, were appointed last fall by the interim board led
by Dyson.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report said the main problems with the plan were a lack
of clarity about Icann's mission and a lack of controls to keep the
special council from being swayed by special-interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until these fundamental concerns are fully addressed, this
election will not be able to confer the consent of the governed
onto Icann,'' the report said. ``Instead, the initial election can
only be viewed as an experiment in democracy that must be
re-evaluated if it is ever to confer legitimacy.'' The report
recommends that Icann change its rules to allow for direct
elections of the nine additional board members.
</P>
<P>
   But Dyson said that would not happen. ``That decision has been
made,'' she said. ``I think the board is very open to iterative
improvements as we go along. But we are moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups that issued the report will officially present their
findings to Icann at its board meeting this week in Cairo. Although
the report lays out widespread skepticism and criticism, Berman
said it was intended to be a constructive way to help Icann and
other interested parties debate the issues and reach a consensus on
how to improve them.
</P>
<P>
   Their main message, the report's authors say, is to place the
goal of holding effective elections ahead of the goal of completing
them by September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a way to do these elections in a way that would be
fair and efficient,'' said Scott Harshbarger, president of Common
Cause. ``We are urging them to take some time and take the
opportunity to use Cairo to really discuss this.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was commissioned through a grant from the Markle
Foundation last year. Markle officials, who have committed $1
million in grants to help advance public interest in Internet
governance issues, said they would not take a position on the
report, although the group was pleased with its depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a short time they not only thought through some very
difficult issues, but they really succeeded in getting input from
key constituencies, including nonprofits, academics and industry
groups, international advocates and experts in democracy and voting
systems,'' said Andrew Shapiro, a senior adviser at the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Icann was selected by the Clinton administration in late 1998 to
oversee the system for assigning Internet addresses, or domain
names _ a system previously run by federal contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The organization initially operated under the direction of an
interim board appointed by a small group of Internet founders and
insiders. Its main mandate was to introduce competition into the
business of registering domain names and to build a membership that
represents Internet users around the world.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year and a half, however, most of its
organizational energy has focused on creating so-called
``supporting organizations'' of business groups that will provide
the bulk of financing for the nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   Those constituencies _ representing such commercial interests as
Internet service providers, intellectual property interests, and
registrars of domain names _ were officially agreed upon last year,
and nine board members to represent them were elected last fall by
the supporting organizations.
</P>
<P>
   So the last big task for Icann's interim board is to create the
at-large constituency to elect the board members who will replace
the interim board and work alongside the business representatives
selected last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But with a limited budget and just a few employees, Icann has
been torn by tension between groups pushing it to move faster and
others urging it to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   The debate this week in Cairo will probably be no different.
Under pressure by both its own bylaws and by people pushing for
representation of noncommercial interests, Icann started a Web site
(www.members.icann.org/) last week, where computer users can
register to become at-large members of the nonprofit group. Those
registrations, however, are tentative, with the understanding that
final details about exactly who qualifies, whether they will be
required to pay a fee and how their voices will be counted _
through a direct election or a council _ will be resolved in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   While Friday's report recommended specific changes like those
involving election procedures, Berman and Harshbarger said in
interviews that Icann needed to answer even more fundamental
questions before a vote proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they said, Icann needs to define its mission more
clearly and adopt language that limits its scope of power.
</P>
<P>
   While Icann's official mission is to oversee the operations of
the domain name system, one of its first policy decisions last year
was to lay down rules for resolving so-called cybersquatting cases,
which involve disputes over the use of trademarks in domain names.
That has caused widespread confusion about the scope of Icann's
power, Berman said.

`M: THE MAN WHO BECAME CARAVAGGIO': THE RENAISSANCE BRAWLER WHO
COULD PAINT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the masterpieces of the late Renaissance artist most of
us know as Caravaggio is ``The Death of the Virgin,'' in which the
mother of Jesus is pictured without a trace of the ethereality of
standard religious painting. Or, as Peter Robb puts it in this
intellectually potent new Caravaggio biography, this was not death
``as resurrection, transcendence, rebirth, vindication'': it was
``death as the loss of physical life, death as coldness, weight,
silence, immobility.'' It was ``death as the end of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Robb's view of ``The Death of the Virgin'' is typical of the
forceful work that this aesthetically armed author has done on
Caravaggio, whom he defines not just as the greatest late
Renaissance painter but as the first modern painter. Robb's view of
Caravaggio's role in art history cleaves to the standard
interpretation. More generally his biography does not add much
sheer data to the large gaps in the record of this painter, whose
short, brilliant and violent life has both frustrated and excited
the public's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Robb, an Australian who lived in Italy for many years,
writes with a vigor and freshness that invest his ``M: The Man Who
Became Caravaggio'' with enormous spirit. For one thing Robb is so
drenched in the Italian culture of the late 16th and early 17th
centuries that his biography, despite its necessary lacunae, comes
across almost like an eyewitness account.
</P>
<P>
   His commentaries on the paintings convey a kind of informed
passion in confrontation with genius. His story is replete with
finely drawn individuals, from the adolescent boys who served as
the painter's models and probably lovers, to the high-class Roman
prostitutes who posed for him, to the more fun-loving cardinals at
the Vatican who recognized the painter's unorthodox genius. Robb
also persuasively re-examines some of the conventional accounts of
Caravaggio's final days, arguing, among other things, that his
mysterious death in 1610 was a murder carried out by vengeful
members of the fraternal order the Knights of Malta.
</P>
<P>
   ``M: The Man Who Became Caravaggio,'' in other words, is art
history of the broadly contextualized kind, splendidly informed by
this author's mastery of the political and moral world in which the
man he calls M lived. This is true despite a number of stylistic
tics that detract, not the least of which is Robb's use of the
letter M to refer to Caravaggio throughout.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that the written record on Caravaggio, whose name is
conventionally given as Michelangelo Merisi, is so vague that we
cannot even be sure of his real name. (Caravaggio, near Milan, was
his hometown.) Even when Robb cites contemporary witnesses, he has
them referring to Caravaggio as M, which means he has doctored the
quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps trying to give his prose a conversational pitch, Robb
also uses many nonsentence sentences (``Which felt like forever'')
of a sort more common to thriller writers than art historians. He
has a weird love of contractions: ``that thought'd never occurred
to him''; ``where the art'd be seen.'' This small quirk had a
water-torturelike effect on me. I'd've preferred that Robb'd used
more conventional prose. Another frustration is the paucity of
reproductions to accompany Robb's highly imaged, pellucid
descriptions of Caravaggio's paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his account achieves both intimacy and vibrancy because
of the richness of its layering, its nonstop accumulation of
analyzed detail. Born about 1571 (there seem to be no public record
of the event), the man Robb calls M lived through the
Counter-Reformation and the Inquisition of late 16th-century Italy.
He experienced the hypocritical repression of the erotic,
especially of the homoerotic, that accompanied those institutions,
and he maneuvered inside a cutthroat art world not all that
dissimilar in some respects to the New York boom of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Caravaggio came to Rome as a young man and struggled for a time
there, until he attracted the attention of Cardinal Francesco del
Monte, who became his lifelong patron. From that point on
Caravaggio _ full-time painter, part-time street fighter _ lived
between the extremes of theocratic repression and artistic
celebrity. As Robb makes clear, painting in late Renaissance Italy
was like filmmaking now, the way to high fame and fortune. Like
some celebrities today Caravaggio was intermittently in trouble
with the law, episodes that Robb skillfully teases out of the
meager available record.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1606 street brawl Caravaggio killed a man about town,
Ranuccio Tomassoni, and he fled Rome for Malta, where in exchange
for his astonishing talent he seems to have been well received. But
he ran into trouble there, too, and left for Naples.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of that trouble was mysteriously never specified in
the knights' records, but that fact by itself leads Robb to some
fascinating speculation as to its nature. In any case four years
after his street brawl Caravaggio was mysteriously dead himself.
Robb's account of these last years is an especially evocative and
complex weave of the interrelated themes of Caravaggio's life: a
life anchored, as Robb puts it, in Caravaggio's determination ``to
be his own man, create his own life and project his own vision of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The artistic vision involved the transformation of ordinary life
into a timeless image ``so purged of visual rhetoric and
transcendental messages that it demanded attention.'' It was this,
in its way, that caught Caravaggio in the same web of theocratic
convention as his near contemporary, Galileo. The relentless
realism of Caravaggio's art was, in Robb's vision of it, an
artistic counterpart to Galileo's telescope, another instrument for
seeing things as they were rather than as the church wanted them
seen.
</P>
<P>
   This idea of Caravaggio's painting has of course been expressed
before. Still, Robb's compact, compressed descriptions of it make
for many vivid passages, like this one about ``Lazarus Raised,'' in
which it is the light itself that brings Lazarus back to life:
``Forget  &UR; history &LR; . Forget how everyone else had done it. If he was
 &UR; drawing in paint &LR;  here, the drawing was the picking out of the
essential highlights, the minimal flecks and smears and lines of
white and gold that defined solid things in a darkening world.''
</P>
<P>
   Robb does much the same thing for Caravaggio himself,
illuminating solid things in a world that otherwise exists in
shadows, making us see in a way we haven't seen before.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Monique Greenwood, the new editor in chief of Essence
magazine, was working at home one afternoon last week.
</P>
<P>
   The home Greenwood shares with her daughter and her husband, a
broadcast engineer, is not what one might expect from the
potentially frenzied editor of a monthly magazine with a
circulation of 1 million readers. Hers is an 18-room
bed-and-breakfast, Akwaaba House, in a historic mansion in
Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant section and is flanked by a 72-seat
restaurant, which she also owns and runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just bought a building, too,'' Greenwood said, as a
sporadically ringing telephone beside her went unanswered. ``A
six-family building with five commercial spaces.'' And, Greenwood
added, she plans to run yet another business _ a coffee shop _ in
that building.
</P>
<P>
   Which all leads to the inevitable question: How much time does
all this activity leave for Essence, which is celebrating a
significant anniversary and facing a growing field of competitors?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a great multitasker,'' Greenwood said. ``I have a great
passion for all that I do. And everything I do _ the restaurant,
the B-and-B, the magazine _ is interrelated.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood's ascension marks a historic shift at Essence, the
most widely read publication for black women in the United States.
She is taking over the job from Susan L. Taylor, Essence's editor
the last 19 years, who will become editorial director of Essence
Communications. The magazine is celebrating its 30th year, and
though circulation is healthy, Essence is still battling image
problems with advertisers, said Edward Lewis, chairman and chief
executive of Essence Communications.
</P>
<P>
   And in 2000, Essence faces a growing field of competitors, a
group that includes Hearst's O: The Oprah Magazine, which arrives
in May; B. Smith Style, a monthly lifestyle magazine from American
Express Publishing; Heart and Soul, a growing fitness and lifestyle
title published by BET Holdings; and Honey, a fashion magazine for
women in their 20s from Vanguarde Media.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last three decades, Essence magazine has been
the most popular arbiter of fashion, beauty and lifestyle advice
for black American women, addressing issues as nationally important
as racism in the workplace and as quirkily personal as one
contributor's recent essay on why she has abstained from sex for
1,095 days (and counting). With a circulation at 1 million, Essence
sits just below Vogue magazine's 1.1 million and well above the
750,000 of Harper's Bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   But stacked up next to those two magazines, Essence is painfully
scrawny. Circulation has climbed from 850,000 in 1991 and
advertising pages increased 8.7 percent in 1999 from the previous
year. But the magazine still gets about half as many advertising
pages as Glamour and a third as many as Vogue. Total advertising
pages for 1999 were 1,167, compared with 1,555 for Harper's Bazaar
and 3,167 for Vogue, according to the Publishers Information
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essence does not get its fair share of advertising,'' Lewis
said. ``This is still my frustration after 30 years of
publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Essence's problems in attracting advertisers is the
increasing age of its readers. The median age of women reading
Essence rose to 37 in 1999 from 35 in 1998, while the median age of
all adults reading the magazine rose to 37.6 from 34, according to
studies by Mediamark Research.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that shift, both Taylor and Greenwood have featured
rap stars popular with younger audiences, like Missy Elliott and
Foxy Brown, on recent covers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that in terms of the age demographic getting older
that might be happening at magazines across the board,'' Greenwood
said. ``But I think that a lot of our culture is influenced by
these younger hip-hop celebrities, so we have to be inclusive of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I also believe that our reader may not be getting
younger, but her mindset is. Our older readers are looking to us to
be youthful, and we have to have vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   The recognition that Essence's readership is aging comes when
young black readers _ or, as they are known in the coy nomenclature
of the advertising industry, urban readers _ have become more
attractive to some advertisers because of their perceived influence
in fashion.
</P>
<P>
   And Lewis said that not all advertisers were still shying away
from Essence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is in some quarters finally a recognition of the value
of black women as major consumers,'' Lewis said, adding that the
fragrance industry, which avoided Essence for years, is now
advertising in almost every issue, with ads for cosmetics and
fragrance from Lancome, L'Oreal and Estee Lauder. Luxury
automakers, including Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz, are advertising in
Essence for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But advertisers for high-end fashion still elude Essence. For
example, Calvin Klein advertised in Honey several times last year,
but has advertised in Essence only once, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the March issue of Essence and then look at the March
issue of Vogue or Harper's Bazaar,'' Lewis said. ``The thing that
always bothers me is that we have almost as many readers as Vogue,
yet we don't get some of that major advertising. How can they say
to me that African-American women don't go into Prada or Bergdorf
Goodman? How do they know that?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Garfinkle, director of print media at the advertising
agency McCann-Erickson New York, said that while Essence was a
strong choice for advertisers trying to reach black women,
advertisers can be deterred by the household income of Essence
readers: $34,936 in 1999, smaller than Vogue readers' $47,576 or
Harper's Bazaar readers' $50,140.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Greenwood countered, Essence readers tend to
be the heads of households. So advertisers for less glamorous, but
necessary, purchases like household products and automobiles are a
natural fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a plus for advertisers knowing that black women are the
decision makers in their households,'' she said. ``They are the
ones deciding what car to buy and what life insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   But insurance and automotive advertising will not guarantee the
future of a women's magazine, so as part of her new mission at
Essence, Greenwood, who came to the magazine four years ago as
style director and spent most of her career working as a fashion
journalist at Fairchild Publications, will be adding more editorial
pages for fashion and lifestyle articles as well as financial and
travel sections.
</P>
<P>
   Will that be enough to stave off the competition? The publisher
of Honey, Len E. Burnett Jr., who founded the music magazine Vibe
with Keith Clinkscales, said that Honey would pursue some of
Essence's younger readers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that times have really changed,'' he said. ``Twenty
years ago, Honey could not have existed. But you can't be
everything to everyone. Sometimes you have to become more
niche-oriented, as we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Honey's niche, with its hip-hop celebrity interviews (``D'Angelo
Bares His Brown Sugar and It Feels Good'') and copious beauty
coverage, is clearly the 20-something woman who cares about fashion
and pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are predominantly a young women's fashion and lifestyle
magazine, and we are certainly going to take on some of the topics
that Essence has,'' said Asondra R. Hunter, the editor in chief of
Honey. ``There are obviously women who are going to read both
magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Honey is, of course, only one magazine that can nibble away at
Essence.
</P>
<P>
   ``B. Smith is real clear that she is looking at the world and
not just black women,'' said Taylor, the departing editor of
Essence, referring to the restaurateur Barbara Smith, whose
magazine was introduced last fall. ``Certainly, Oprah's will, too.
Essence is still really solidly focused on just black women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mass media has over the years regularly debased black women
and demonized black people,'' she continued. ``This is why Essence
has been so embraced by its readers, and why we can't change that
focus too much. The vast majority of African-Americans and
African-Caribbeans are doing well. They are not on welfare. They
are productive members of society. But you would never know that
looking at the nightly news. Our people love us because they find
in Essence something that is so extremely rare in society: the good
news about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood said that her extracurricular activities _ a concern
among staff members who spoke on condition of anonymity _ keep her
in touch with the community, which is part of her job as editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I do on the outside is about empowering our people
and learning about our people,'' she said. ``With the
bed-and-breakfast, it's a respite for people from the community,
mostly local folks who come to recharge their batteries. With the
restaurant, I employ people here from the community and keep those
dollars flowing back to our neighborhood. And when I see a couple
sitting in my restaurant for two hours not talking to each other,
that tells me it's time to do an article in the magazine about
recharging your marriage.''

GAY GROUP CAMPAIGNS AGAINST RADIO HOST'S PLAN FOR A TV SHOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For years, there has been friction between groups
supporting the rights of gays and Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the
conservative host of the nation's most popular self-help radio talk
program. Now, one group has begun a campaign to protest a new
television program that she will be the host of next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom's Paramount unit, which is producing the program, was
reportedly besieged last week with telephone calls and e-mail
messages from people upset by Schlessinger's comments on
homosexuality, which she has described as ``deviant'' and
derivative of ``biological error.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, known as Glaad,
placed advertisements in Variety and The Hollywood Reporter last
week, containing examples of her comments and encouraging people to
complain to Paramount. A Web site, www.stopdrlaura.com, has also
been set up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking Paramount not to let her show see the light of
day,'' said Alan Klein, a public relations executive in New York
who is a spokesman for the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Glaad first criticized Schlessinger, whose radio program is
broadcast from Los Angeles, in 1997 for her calling homosexuality a
``biological faux pas,'' and it has tried to meet with her about
the dispute ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts have failed, and the group and others intensified
their campaign after the announcement last May that Paramount would
produce a syndicated television talk program starring Schlessinger.
</P>
<P>
   To television executives, the program represents a potential
ratings bonanza; some 20 million people listen to Schlessinger's
radio program each week, and her four books have sold a total of
more than 3 million copies. Last month, Paramount reported that it
had sold the television program, called ``Dr. Laura,'' in more than
160 markets, representing 90 percent of the country. It is to begin
in September.
</P>
<P>
   In January, The Los Angeles Times reported that many in the
entertainment community, including some producers of Paramount's
hit situation comedy ``Frasier'' and others at the studio, were
dismayed about Schlessinger's views and Paramount's decision to
give her a television platform.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Feb. 8, Paramount said its executives
``respect and believe in Dr. Schlessinger's right to have and
express her own point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount executives declined to comment beyond prepared
statements in response to the criticism, though they did meet with
Glaad representatives on Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Glaad had complained that too many of the experts who appeared
on Schlessinger's program were from the Family Research Council, a
conservative group based in Washington. In a joint statement after
the meeting, Glaad and Paramount agreed that the format of the
television program would differ from that of the radio program and
that the television program would present ``many points of view,
derived from a variety of sources, guests and a studio audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Glaad described the meeting as productive, it said that
not all the group's concerns were addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger, who declined to be interviewed about the protest,
has said in published opinion articles and broadcast commentaries
that the gay groups are taking her statements out of context.
</P>
<P>
   She has said that while she opposes homosexuality and a ``gay
activist agenda,'' she does not oppose gays.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger has also said that while gays are ``as entitled to
love and respect as all human beings,'' homosexual activity is
incompatible with Scripture. She has said she supports the concept
of reparative therapy for gays who wish to change their sexual
orientation. And she has publicly supported a ballot proposition in
Los Angeles, which voters will decide on Tuesday, that would outlaw
same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger characterizes much of the criticism of her as
heavy-handed and superficial. ``Gay activists claim that because I
don't subscribe to their political agenda, I am a homophobe,
meaning I have a mental disorder _ because that is what phobias
are,'' she said in a commentary broadcast on Feb. 23. ``I
personally reject this kind of twisted logic. You should, too. It's
simplistic and dishonest.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay organizations say they are concerned that Schlessinger's
rhetoric gives listeners license to discriminate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are incensed,'' said Steve Spurgeon, a Glaad spokesman.
``She has a platform to do a lot of good or a lot of harm.''

 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The other day on the subway, I sat opposite a sleekly
proportioned young woman in bell-bottom jeans, platform boots, a
leather bomber jacket, with brass rings on every finger, a row of
thick bracelets on one arm, a small delicate nose ring and
dreadlocks with gold-blond extensions. It worked, and, while I
wanted to go on looking, her attitude made clear that anything
beyond a glance was a presumption.
</P>
<P>
   Several stops and neighborhoods later I found myself standing
next to a young preppie (in pink and khaki), with no accessories
beyond the unostentatiously expensive watch and sunglasses. That,
too, worked. He had casually careful ``it just grows like this''
hair and the manner that signals: don't hate me because I'm
privileged, but if you can't help yourself, I couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   Call them downtown Afro-American and uptown Nordic-American
fashion ethics, two of many now thriving on the streets where we
live, the television screens we gape at and in the magazines we
leaf through in waiting rooms, bathrooms and supermarket lines. But
I'm inclined to call all of this body art after seeing the
exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History that takes us
through centuries of human self-display and decoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Body Art: Marks of Identity'' includes clothing, naturally
(kimonos, corsets, suits and loin cloths) but also all manner of
hair and head gear and jewelry. More unusual to Western eyes are
body painting (we restrict ours to the face and the nails),
scarification, body piercing beyond the ears and extensive
tattooing, although navel and mouth piercing are more popular now.
</P>
<P>
   The museum shows assorted everyday Americans displaying what
they call neo-tribal body art. And highly elaborate tattooing _
face and back, arms and midriff, upper arms and chest _ is so
popular here that the museum felt obliged to include a health
warning in its guide. Like drinking, tattooing under age 18 is not
allowed in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The further back in time we go (mostly through sculpture and
painting) and the more traditional the societies, the more body art
signifies group status: profession or religion, expectations
imposed by gender and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   There's always room for personal expression or invention, but
people aren't apt to work at deliberately reinventing themselves,
as fashion invites us to do, day by day or season by season.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the show's fascination comes from the combination of
visual pleasure and physical shock. The sumptuous tattoos across
the bodies of Japanese artists could be brocade or petit point
embroidery. An Inuit girl has a heart tattooed around her eyes, as
if she were wearing a mask of flesh. And the face of a Maori chief
resembles a ceramic mask with its pattern of half-moon curves.
</P>
<P>
   These bodies give fresh meaning to that line (Yeats, I think)
``We must labor to be beautiful,'' or labor to show that our
collective lives have order and meaning, or that as individuals we
are daring and original. And, my, how many modes of labor we have.
Those elaborate scar patterns on the chests and faces of American
Indians or Africans startle us because we practice scarification
through cosmetic surgery, keeping it private, and the result is
supposed to be naturalistic rather than abstract or symbolic. We
like to redesign rather than redecorate our bodies. (And not
without suffering, as so many exercise videos, gyms and injuries
make clear.)
</P>
<P>
   Here's another striking thing. When you look at photographs and
video clips of modern-day Americans who have tattooed, painted or
pierced parts of their bodies, perfection of shape is suddenly much
less compelling than the play between one- or two-dimensional
designs and a three-dimensional human form.
</P>
<P>
   No show that surveys so many cultures can be without moments
that range from the ironic to the cynical to the plain old ugly. In
a photograph from the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904 a matron in
white (white skin, white full-length dress with nipped waist,
flared sleeves and high neckline, large white hat) holds the hand
of a Filipino man (one of the many exotic groups on display in
their reconstructed native habit). He is clothed in his dark
gleaming skin, a kind of loincloth and a straw brimmed hat. Both
have their left foot pointed forward jauntily; she is teaching him
the cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder North Americans aren't much interested in full body
paint: skin color provides enough visual and cultural excitement
and drama. According to family history, a photograph of my maternal
grandfather appeared in that fair, with the caption ``The Smartest
Colored Boy in St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   The show contains a short film of the Nuba people painting
themselves for the tourists who have come to the Sudan in droves
ever since Leni Riefenstahl published her triumphantly erotic and
elegiac book ``The Last of the Nuba'' in 1976. An elder remarks
that Riefenstahl only wanted to photograph naked men. And
subsequent visitors want to photograph near-naked men painting
their faces and bodies in what has become an on-site version of
airport art. ``That doesn't look like a hyena,'' one man reproaches
his fast-working neighbor. ``It's good enough for them,'' the
unrepentant hack replies.
</P>
<P>
   Who could leave such a show without being instantly overwhelmed
by the body art of fashion here and now? Thank God for style
mobility. My downtown Afro girl and uptown preppie boy could
exchange outfits and do very well; plenty of their ilk already
have. Under the right circumstances (usually when we're playing,
not working) we can be whatever our incomes and imaginations allow.
</P>
<P>
   Still, fashion is always pushing certain visual ideas. This
season we're supposed to savor the haut bourgeois glamour (``haut
bourgeois'' means we shouldn't call it vulgar) of busy prints, loud
colors and fabrics that cling, wrap and plunge enough to make the
concept of imagination null and void. This is not just for women
either. For men young and handsome enough there are form-fitting
lace and net tops along with patterned or bejeweled pants that
grasp and bind the lower body.
</P>
<P>
   Leather and fur of every hue abound, as do animal prints. You
would think we were trying to create a human version, part
nostalgic, part futuristic, of our rapidly declining animal
kingdom. Logos are tattooed on everything. Skirts, coats,
pocketbooks and swimsuits bear that Gucci or Fendi or Louis Vuitton
mark. And fabrics echo the intricacies of scarification:
perforations, paillettes, studs and beads that look stitched onto
flesh.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also fashion that acknowledges the technological
and spiritual forces around us. These clothes, called sculptural or
minimalist or deconstructionist, use bodies as forms that can be
added to or subtracted from. And this kind of fashion can be as
startling as anything from another civilization. It not only
observes the Oscar Wilde dictum ``One should either be a work of
art, or wear a work of art,'' it includes the more generous thought
that one can be a work in progress and wear a work in progress.

   On Sunday 70 degree readings were observed as far north as
Minnesota as breezes from the South directed spring-like warmth
toward the Canadian border. The next several days will feature a
continuation of the unseasonable warmth in the central and eastern
states as the jet stream retreats into southern Canada. Amid
abundant sunshine, readings will approach 70 degrees Monday
afternoon from the southwestern Great Lakes to the middle Ohio
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Ample sunshine and very mild conditions will also prevail
throughout the Southeast and Northeastern states as high pressure
builds over the region. An exception will be found over far
northern New England where winds from the Northwest import chilly
air southward from Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled weather will cover much of the interior West Monday as
a complex storm traverses the region. Moist air circulating
northward from the Pacific Ocean will cause showers across southern
Arizona and portions of Utah. As the damp air ascends the
surrounding mountains and cools, the stage will be set for heavy
snow. Indeed, over a foot of fresh snow could whiten the ground of
the Mogollon Rim Monday. Snow showers of lesser intensity will also
affect the Sierra and Wasatch ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Sinking currents associated with high pressure will promote
partly sunny and seasonal conditions over the Pacific Northwest.
Farther south, California will stay rather cool with spotty
afternoon showers occurring across southern sections. Elsewhere,
patchy clouds and isolated sprinkles will cover Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Perennial Storms
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of unusually tranquil weather in Alaska, blizzard
warnings were issued for parts of the south coast on Sunday,
signaling an active phase in one of the hemisphere's perennial
storms. The Aleutian low, named for its proximity to the Alaskan
archipelago, appears on weather maps for most of the year. Gales
that develop near eastern Asia are drawn to the large temperature
contrasts in the Aleutians that result as polar winds meet the
warmer waters of the Pacific. In the Atlantic, surges of frigid air
from Greenland provide energy for a similar atmospheric whirlpool,
the Icelandic low.

<P>
   Two New York journalists who have had difficult relations with
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani are writing books about him that are
scheduled to be published this summer, just as the mayor's race for
the United States Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton would be
heading into the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kirtzman, a political reporter for New York One, a local
cable TV news station, who has covered Giuliani since 1993, is
writing ``Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City,'' a look at the
mayor's administration, for William Morrow Press, an imprint of the
News Corp.'s HarperCollins unit.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Barrett, a longtime investigative reporter for The Village
Voice, is writing ``Rudy: Gotham's Goliath,'' a biography of
Giuliani, for Basic Books, an imprint of the Perseus Books Group.
</P>
<P>
   Neither writer found a publisher when the proposals were first
made in 1998. But after Clinton expressed interest last year in
running for the New York seat, both writers got many offers.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has refused interviews with both writers, and both said
they had had strained relations with him. Both have sued the city
to get documents from the mayor's public information office.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Applebaum, a Random House spokesman and a longtime
publishing industry executive, noting that there have been several
critical books about Clinton recently, said, ``It may be
unprecedented where you have a trail of books about both candidates
in a statewide race.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has agreed to appear only once on ``Inside City Hall,''
a program on which Kirtzman is the host. ``We have invited him
thousands of times, no exaggeration,'' Kirtzman said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirtzman said his goal was to write a fair book. But, he added:
``The mayor is very sensitive about criticism, and I can't
guarantee that he's going to love this book.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said his biography of Giuliani would report on ``areas
of his life that are not well known.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly going to be a mixed biography,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, declined to
comment on the books.

   Sibling Rivalry at Advance Publications
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over as chief executive at Fairchild Publications
in December, three months after the company was bought by Advance
Publications, Mary Berner has dismissed dozens of staff members,
including the entire Fairchild Internet group, and reorganized the
company, which publishes Footwear News, Jane magazine and 10 other
publications. Perhaps more important, she has already begun to
irritate her former colleagues at Conde Nast, which is also owned
by Advance.
</P>
<P>
   First, Berner poached more than 15 staff members from Glamour,
where she last served as publisher. Now, she has taken aim at
another corporate cousin, Vogue _ and fashion magazines in general
_ by introducing Women's Wear Daily: The Magazine, a twice-yearly,
glossy publication loosely styled on its successful monthly sister,
W, and scheduled to be on newsstands on March 20. The magazine will
be published shortly after the spring and fall fashion collections,
so its coverage of the twice-yearly fashion collections will be out
before that of Vogue and of every other monthly fashion magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vogue and the other fashion magazines are our direct
competition,'' Berner said. Because designers, who do not advertise
in Women's Wear Daily, will advertise in the new magazine, it
competes with Vogue for advertising. (W already competes with Vogue
for advertising, and Berner is ramping up the W marketing campaign
to attract even more.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, how long those advertisers will stay is another
matter. There have been concerns that Advance's ownership of
Women's Wear Daily could mean softer coverage because of potential
anger from Conde Nast advertisers. But Stephanie George, the
president of the Women's Wear Daily Group Worldwide, said that the
daily's stance as an unflinching trade publication _ it recently
included negative reviews of Giorgio Armani and the DKNY line _
would be preserved in the magazine version.
</P>
<P>
   For all the Fairchild chest-thumping, the Women's Wear Daily
magazine will not have Vogue's 1.1 million circulation. Women's
Wear Daily reaches 30,000 readers every day. The new magazine will
be mailed to subscribers, and 20,000 will go on sale on newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   Richard D. Beckman, the publisher of Vogue, had no comment.

   Get Ready for Ads During the Workout
</P>
<P>
   Marketers have come up with many ways to put out their messages
_ product placement, digital imagery, virtual tours.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is exercise equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Walk into a New York Sports Club gym these days, for example,
and you may see an E-Zone personal entertainment system attached to
each piece of aerobic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It is a six-inch television screen with CD and tape players and
its own advertisements all in one. It enables advertisers to make
pitches to, and keep track of, exercising consumers whose attention
is undivided.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it works: A user buys an E-Zone headphone and plugs
it into the console. If she decides to become an E-Zone subscriber,
a registration form is filled out. The data on the form, including
age and sex, is linked to statistics about the member's visits,
like frequency and duration. A 45-year-old white man and a
20-year-old Hispanic woman could get different sets of commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements run at the start of workouts.
</P>
<P>
   E-Zone is not the first player in this market. Netpulse, a
console with a 15-inch touch-screen monitor and a high-speed
Internet connection, can be used while exercising to surf the Web,
check e-mail, watch TV or listen to CD's. Commercials are activated
by clicking a banner on the bottom of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The last six months, Netpulse Communications of San Francisco
has supplied consumer information to advertisers like General
Motors and iVillage and gyms like Crunch and 24-Hour Fitness in
major cities. (The machines are now installed at more than 500
health clubs.) In January, Netpulse decided to offer the consoles
for free, to broaden its audience and increase ad sales.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hoffman, a spokesman for E-Zone Networks in Calgary,
Alberta, said the company had installed 6,000 consoles at 150 gyms
in places like YMCA's in the South and Midwest and Club Ones in
California and had plans to install consoles in all clubs of Town
Sports International, which operates New York Sports Club and other
gyms.

 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Privacy advocates were relieved last week when DoubleClick Inc.,
the Internet's biggest supplier of banner advertising, announced
that it would put a hold on its plan to link personal identities
and other information to anonymous data it collects about Internet
users.
</P>
<P>
   Some of DoubleClick's competitors were just as relieved. As
privacy groups and legislators began to look past DoubleClick and
into the broader business of companies that serve ads on behalf of
Web site publishers, those competitors had been bracing for more
intense scrutiny of their own data-gathering practices.
</P>
<P>
   One company in particular, 24/7 Media, escaped the public
flogging endured by DoubleClick, even though it had planned _ and
still plans _ to implement a data-gathering technique almost
identical to the method that earned DoubleClick the wrath of
privacy advocates and investors. Indeed, early last year, long
before DoubleClick announced its plans, 24/7 Media began developing
technology to marry offline data about consumers' spending habits
with data compiled about their online viewing habits.
</P>
<P>
   To advertisers, the combination of the two databases promises a
much greater chance of presenting advertisements to people who will
respond to them. That is considered essential at the end of a year
in which advertisers have watched ``click through'' rates _ the
average percentage of Web surfers who click on any single banner ad
_ fall below the 1 percent mark, compared with about 2 percent in
1998. In view of that drop, advertisers have become less willing to
pay high advertising rates for banners, forcing Web site publishers
to scramble for other sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Which is perhaps why advertisers, publishers and the advertising
networks said little about possible privacy objections last year
when the new ad-targeting approach was developed.
</P>
<P>
   But to make that approach work, the advertising networks must
first match consumers' identities with anonymous data gathered
online as the consumers surf the Web. The online data is gathered
by means of ``cookies'' _ tiny files that are placed on users' hard
drives when they are served ads or visit Web sites. Each cookie
contains a tracking number, and since the number identifies a
computer, not a specific user, it is considered anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   That anonymity ends the moment a site or an advertiser matches a
cookie with a name, which can happen whenever a user enters
personal information on a Web site, by, for example, registering a
piece of software or entering a contest. Once a consumer's identity
is known, a site or advertising network can get reams of data about
that consumer from an offline data company like Acxiom _ or in
DoubleClick's case, from its Abacus division, which tracks the
offline buying habits of millions of customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of 24/7 Media, the company has an agreement with
Naviant Technology Solutions, which processes online product
registrations for computer companies like IBM, among others. When a
consumer registers a new computer online, he or she is given the
option of receiving relevant product offers and a cookie is placed
on the computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Naviant has placed 24/7 Media's cookies on registrants' hard
drives at a rate of ``well over a million per month,'' said C.
Andrew Johns, 24/7 Media's chief financial officer. That gives the
company a database of more than 15 million cookies that it has
matched with individual names, which it can now use to direct ads
to specific people based on their offline personal data _
everything from age and zip code to retail purchasing habits.
</P>
<P>
   Before the flap over DoubleClick's plans, Johns had predicted
24/7 Media would combine the offline and online data by the end of
July, ``with full disclosure'' to users of the company's intentions
when Naviant collected the data, and the chance to ``opt out,'' or
decline participation in the program. On Thursday, however, he said
the company had decided to join DoubleClick and wait ``until there
is clear definition about guidelines in the industry'' before
starting the program.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like DoubleClick, 24/7 Media argues that some uses of offline
data to target customers on the Web would be acceptable to privacy
advocates. For example, they argue that while advocates oppose
actually mixing information from the two kinds of databases, they
would not find it objectionable to merely use cookies to link a
computer with a specific person's offline consumer behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong,'' said Evan Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, a
Washington-based newsletter. Hendricks said such a practice was
also a privacy invasion, because consumers who disclosed their
identities to particular Web sites would not expect that
information to be used by advertisers to build profiles for
purposes of sending advertisements anywhere on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That clearly is a major privacy concern, and will keep this
issue alive,'' Hendricks said.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress and the Federal Trade Commission continue to
investigate online privacy _ and as the industry pushes for
self-regulation _ more subtle nuances about the methods of
advertising networks will almost surely be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Schmitt, an analyst with Forrester Research, says the
advertising industry's hopes for self-regulation may not survive
such scrutiny. In the past year, he said, advertising networks have
been under increasing pressure to make ad campaigns more effective.
</P>
<P>
   That situation, Schmitt said, has resulted in publishers
increasingly passing information about their users to the ad
networks. He cited one particularly egregious example involving an
unnamed advertising network that he had spoken to _ ``not
DoubleClick,'' he said _ and an online credit card company.
</P>
<P>
   The credit card company, he said, passed along the names of
people whom it considered high credit risks, so the network could
report on their online surfing habits and help determine their
creditworthiness. ``The credit card company could base their
decision on whether the person spent their time on the Black
Entertainment Network, or whatever,'' Schmitt said. ``Pick your
poison.''
</P>
<P>
   Johns, of 24/7 Media, said there are no such practices at his
company. Michael Griffiths, chief technology officer of MatchLogic,
an advertising network that is a unit of Excite(AT)Home, said his
company does not match personal information with cookie data, even
though it collects both types of data.
</P>
<P>
   Engage, an advertising network that is a unit of CMGI and
includes the Flycast and AdSmart advertising companies, states on
its privacy page that it ``does not store any personally
identifiable information or even combinations of data that can be
potentially personally identifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves the prospect of someone either not telling the
truth, or not being aware of a privacy violation within their
company.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, such examples are anathema not only to
advertising networks, but to online media companies like America
Online and Yahoo, which have the potential to track their users'
activities and match them with registration data to yield rich
personal profiles. Both companies say they do not mix their users'
personal information with their click patterns, and both companies
portray themselves as leaders in the online privacy effort.
</P>
<P>
   But these companies face guilt by association in an atmosphere
of diminishing user trust. While consumer distrust has not yet
shown signs of affecting any site's visitation levels, it could
yield something equally unpalatable: government regulation. The FTC
has already released several reports highly critical of Web privacy
polices in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all sitting on a heck of a lot of information on your
Internet use,'' said Andrew Shen, policy analyst with the
Electronic Privacy Information center, who also serves on an online
privacy advisory panel for the FTC ``It's an endemic, industry-wide
problem, and relying on the FTC to just look into it isn't going to
solve the problem.''

   Last week, Advanced Micro cut prices on its chips for home

continues to carry a list price of $849, according to Merrill
Lynch's weekly report on chip prices.

 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Makoto Ooka, a diminutive man of 69, has written 200
major works _ books of poetry, plays, screenplays, journalism and
essays on art and literature. He is one of Japan's most celebrated
artists and intellectuals. But perhaps his most remarkable
accomplishment is his column, which has been published without a
break seven days a week for 20 years on the front page of Asahi
Shimbun, Japan's leading newspaper. The column includes an ancient
or traditionally styled poem selected by Ooka and his commentary on
it.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper has 7 million readers and, in a communal
commentary of their own, a substantial number of them start their
day with Ooka's poetry fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can read my column on the way to work, even while they
are tying their shoes,'' said Ooka (pronounced OH-ka) with a
chuckle. ``Many of my readers clip out the column to save in a
scrapbook and throw the rest of the newspaper away.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. on Monday, Ooka is to deliver the annual Sen
Distinguished Lecture on Japanese Culture at the Donald Keene
Center of Columbia University. The lecture, which is free, will be
at the university's Casa Italiana at 1161 Amsterdam Ave., between
116th and 118th Streets in Morningside Heights.
</P>
<P>
   He will offer reflections on what he describes as collective
cultural consciousness in Japan. But in an interview after he
arrived in New York last week he was far more eager to discuss the
poetry at the center of his life, the 17-syllable Japanese haiku,
and its literary cousin, the 31-syllable tanka.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional Japanese poetry expresses the greatest and deepest
meaning and stirs the most intense reactions,'' he said. ``The
Japanese people are drawn to poetry perhaps more than other people
because their life and art are very close. It's like the tea
ceremony, or the appreciation of incense, or the artistic way that
food is arranged on a plate. Japanese people believe that life
should be a work of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if one of the English poets had not said that, he burst
into laughter. ``If one did,'' he said, ``he was very Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Japan's deep popular appreciation of its national
culture, its poetry, which dates in written form from the seventh
century, lends itself to brevity and compression, Ooka explained.
``Because Japanese people have a shared cultural knowledge, a poem
need only hint at its meaning in order to be understood,'' he said.
``Excessive description is considered vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course no matter how compressed a bad poem may be, it is
still a bad poem. But a good poem is like a tiny seed that contains
a great tree. If you can grasp the seed, you will understand the
tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Ooka gave a few examples of poems and analysis he has published
in his column.
</P>
<P>
   The first, an anonymous 12th-century poem from a compilation
called the Ryojin hisho, was so evocative that it required no
explication beyond the observation that it was more in keeping with
Shintoism than with the asceticism of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   This lovely girl _ as soon as I see her
</P>
<P>
   I would change myself into a spiral of vines
</P>
<P>
   Twine myself around her from bottom to top
</P>
<P>
   So that they might slash at me, chop at me,
</P>
<P>
   But never tear me away: such is my fate
</P>
<P>
   Ooka then recited a poem expressing anguish.
</P>
<P>
   An orphan's hand _
</P>
<P>
   how can it be this soft?
</P>
<P>
   The autumn wind
</P>
<P>
   He explained that in this poem, a haiku written in 1951 by Iida
Dakotsu, the orphan is the poet's grandchild, the daughter of one
of two sons killed in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The hand, Ooka said, is the ``infinitely soft hand of a child
who never knew a father.'' The autumn wind is a traditional
Japanese metaphor for loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   Another poem, this one by the 17th-century haiku poet Matsuo
Basho, exemplified how complex these works can be.
</P>
<P>
   Octopus pots!
</P>
<P>
   Fleeting dreams,
</P>
<P>
   a summer moon ...
</P>
<P>
   Ooka explained it this way. Fishermen trap octopuses, a Japanese
delicacy, by lowering ceramic pots into the sea. The octopuses,
which are active at night but seek a confined place in which to
hide in the daytime, slither into the pots. There, the summer moon
lights up the sea and the octopuses have ``fleeting dreams of a
life brief as the night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On first reading,'' Ooka said, ``the poem has a deep feeling
of pathos. But at its core lies okashi, a kind of irreverence or
humorous detachment toward the absurdity of life that is often
found in haiku.''
</P>
<P>
   This attitude is a mark of the poetry. ``There is also
playfulness in Japanese poetry, which makes it easy to enjoy,'' he
said. ``A famous 13th-century poet, Fujiwara no Teika, created a
poetry game that is still played in Japan today. A player has to
memorize the poems and faces of 100 poets as they appear on cards,
and then he must match them as in a game of cards. The result is
that millions of Japanese people have memorized at least 100
poems.''
</P>
<P>
   Ooka, who was born in 1931 in Mishima in central Japan, started
writing poetry at 17, inspired by his father, an educator and poet.
Later he majored in Japanese literature at Tokyo National
University, graduating in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Since beginning his column Ooka has been awarded nearly every
Japanese literary award. He recently collaborated with the director
Tadashi Suzuki on a translation of Euripides' ``Trojan Women'' and
with the composer Toshi Ichiyanagi on an opera dealing with the
Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. After speaking at Columbia, he
will deliver his lecture at Harvard, Princeton, the Japan Society
of Boston and elsewhere around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is definitely one of Japan's most important and influential
living poets,'' said Donald Keene, professor emeritus of Japanese
literature at Columbia, who will join the poet John Ashbery in
introducing Ooka on Monday. The Keene Center, named in Keene's
honor in 1985, has a $2 million endowment and raises money to
develop and operate public programs on Japanese culture in the
United States. It is the host for the lecture.
</P>
<P>
   For all his artistic successes, Ooka said, it was probably
another consuming Japanese activity, commerce, that led to his most
influential position, that of Page 1 poetry columnist. ``I think
they wanted a poetry column because they were ashamed of so much
advertising on the front page,'' he said with a chuckle.

INTERNET PROVIDERS TRY TO MAKE FREE ACCESS PAY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With announcements last week by Lycos and NBC Interactive that
they would join the list of companies offering free Internet
service, it became clear that the free-access movement is a trend.
But what remains less clear is whether the trend will alter the
financial fundamentals of the Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements by Lycos, the fourth-most-visited site on the
World Wide Web, and NBCi, a popular news and entertainment site
part-owned by General Electric's NBC, followed similar
announcements of free Internet service in January by Excite(AT)Home
and Juno Online Services. And just before those announcements,
Kmart said it had a deal with Yahoo to provide free Internet access
through a new shopping site called BlueLight. Even ``The Simpsons''
is offering free Internet service through www.thesimpsons.com, the
TV show's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   NetZero, the largest of the free service providers, says its
registered user base has reached 3 million _ which would rank it
with the top tier of commercial Internet access providers, like
Earthlink and Microsoft's MSN, although well back of America Online
and its 20 million paying subscribers. (America Online and
Microsoft both charge subscribers $21.95 a month. Earthlink charges
$19.95.)
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for free Internet service, users typically must view
a continual barrage of advertising, usually in a narrow bar that is
ever-present on the screen. For the providers, the idea is to
recoup the cost of the service through those ads and through online
product sales. One provider, WorldSpy, carries no advertising but
counts on all its revenues coming from purchases that subscribers
make through its site.
</P>
<P>
   But critics also point to the sticky matter, perceived or real,
of privacy: Sites that offer free Internet access typically require
subscribers to divulge a certain amount of personal and demographic
information, and the subscribers usually must agree to allow the
site to trace their activities on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   To some analysts, the increase in Internet companies that offer
free access is the next logical step in the commercial evolution of
the Internet, following naturally behind the advent of so-called
portals, or gateway sites, and free e-mail. But other analysts and
company executives contend that the free Internet services will
appeal only to the most value-conscious consumers, those willing to
overlook disadvantages that might keep the bulk of Internet users
ready and willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Zia Daniell Wigder, an analyst with the research firm Jupiter
Communications, says that there is too much brand loyalty among
Internet consumers who already pay for access, and too little
advertising to carry the revenue burden for the free services.
``There simply aren't enough ads,'' Wigder said.
</P>
<P>
   She is among the analysts who say that many consumers are simply
unwilling to be a captive audience to advertisers. A recent Jupiter
study predicted that by the end of 2003 only 13 percent of Internet
users would receive access to the network through a free provider.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, America Online is in no hurry to embrace the trend.
The company gets nearly two-thirds of its revenues from monthly
subscription fees, which amounted to $1.1 billion in the company's
most recent financial quarter. Free access, America Online
executives predicted, will alienate consumers with its tradeoffs
and the lack of customer service and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe there are viable business models today,''
said Barry Schuler, president of AOL Interactive Services. Last
year, America Online began offering free Internet service in
Britain through its Netscape brand, but company executives contend
that market bears little resemblance to the one in the United
States, where telephone lines (used for modem connections) are
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   If America Online were to make such a move in this country, it
might involve its CompuServe brand, which the company considers its
service for the budget-minded. ``There might be an emerging segment
that looks something like TV,'' Schuler said, referring to cable
television's tiers of free and pay services.
</P>
<P>
   Juno, which was one of the earliest providers of free e-mail,
already offers tiered service. For $9.95, subscribers get
around-the-clock customer service; the free service has none.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Earthlink, the second-largest service provider,
express little interest in considering free Internet service.
``Currently, we don't feel it's a sustainable business model,''
said Kirsten Witt, a company spokeswoman. ``We wouldn't be able to
offer the service and support that, at this point, is what our
customers say they want.''
</P>
<P>
   If the nation's largest Internet service providers see
themselves as above the free fray, however, smaller, regional
providers may not fare as well, Wigder said. These smaller, ``mom
and pop'' operations typically do not have the money to invest in
providing their own information and entertainment material, she
said, which gives consumers less reason to shell out $200 or so a
year to subscribe.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, most online access services charged by
the minute, like long-distance telephone services, with bills
sometimes totaling $100 a month or more for active users. But these
days, even the pay services have been retooled as flat-fee
services, in which some revenues come from advertising and
electronic commerce. The free-service providers see themselves as
simply taking that evolution to the next logical step.
</P>
<P>
   Within the industry, the beneficiaries of the free-service trend
include companies like 1stUp, which act as the behind-the-scenes
network operators and manage the advertising.
</P>
<P>
   1stUp, based in San Francisco, is the company behind AltaVista's
free service and Excite(AT)Home's FreeLane, and has already signed
up some four dozen other corporate clients. They include The Denver
Rocky Mountain News, which offers free Internet access through
1stUp, as well as special-interest portals like Gay.com, Senior.com
and Afronet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Spinway.com, another start-up based in San Francisco, made news
in December with the announcement that it would provide
BlueLight.com's infrastructure. At the same time, Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia Inc. announced it would spend $13 million for a 5
percent stake in BlueLight.com. And in its announcement of free
service last week, NBC Interactive said it was taking a minority
stake in Spinway.com, which is operating the free service.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Katz, chief executive at 1stUp, acknowledges that free
Internet service is not for every consumer _ particularly those who
object to Web sites' collecting data about them. But he defended
the company's business model and said his service is a viable
alternative for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we are giving consumers a choice,'' Katz said. And he
said he considered the advertising on 1stUp sites no more intrusive
than television advertising, which the public accepted long ago.
``Sure, it's noticeable,'' he said, ``but it doesn't get in the
way.''

`IMPERFECT LOVE': SELF-CONGRATULATORY BACKSTAGE COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Brandon Cole, who wrote ``Imperfect Love,'' calls his
play a romantic farce, but it never quite ascends to that level of
antic lunacy, and in any case there is something in the work that
suggests a serious intention. That hybrid quality testifies to
ambition, and it's pardonable that the play doesn't live up to it.
The pleased-with-itself tone of the production, which Cole also
directed, is more difficult to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   A backstage comedy set in 1899 in Rome, the play (which was the
source material for the 1999 film ``Illuminata'') is an imagined
work drawn from the real-life love affair of the Italian actress
Eleanora Duse (here called Eleanora Della Rosa) and the poet and
playwright Gabriele d'Annunzio, who has been rechristened Gabrielle
Torrisi. It opened on Saturday in a cozy new space at New York
Performance Works in TriBeCa.
</P>
<P>
   The action takes place on the day following the disastrous
opening night of Gabrielle's new play. The reviews are far from
favorable, and the theater owner has threatened to close the play
(and replace it with ``A Doll's House,'' Ibsen being a new arrival
on the European theater scene), unless it can be fixed before the
next performance.
</P>
<P>
   The theater company, a dysfunctional family that includes two
clowns, Marco and Beppo, and Eleanora's leading man, Domenica,
employs a variety of gambits to help Gabrielle in his furious
rewriting, tiptoeing around his imperious egomania and the notion
that he may have purposely written a dud so he could escape Rome to
be with a secret paramour in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Their main idea is to draw on the real-life passions the two
strong-willed lovers habitually express to each other. Several
scenes are presented as purposely deceptive: Are Eleanora and
Gabrielle rehearsing or actually threatening to kill each other? It
is a well-constructed plot, meant both to amuse and to illuminate
that ever-evanescent link between life and art.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that this is a work that wants to be more than it
can be, never abandoning either its hyperbole or its realism, never
settling down as a period piece or a modern take on one. Much of
the play is written to suggest European diction of a bygone age,
but some _ notably the punch lines _ is in a more contemporary
American vernacular. Among other things, this pattern sends out
laugh cues.
</P>
<P>
   Before long this begins to feel as if the author is striking a
self-congratulatory pose, a sense that is underscored by his
direction. Visual gags are just a trifle too well choreographed;
when the clowns emerge in ludicrous costumes, you can almost hear
the stage-whispered ``Ta-daaah!''
</P>
<P>
   And the actors seem to be laboring under rigorous constraints.
Only the clowns, Ed Hodson (Marco) and Peter Dinklage (Beppo), seem
to be enjoying themselves and working with individual actors'
instincts. As Gabrielle, Christopher McCann is locked into a
grimace and a stiff-spined arrogance; John Gould Rubin plays
Domenica with the blase presumption of an artiste who is
predictably skewered by intrusive moments of insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   And Leslie Lyles as Eleanora seems to be imitating some idea of
an Italian diva, frequently braying in Mediterranean outrage and
otherwise sounding like Sophia Loren venting in English at top
speed.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three adds an unexpected jot to the stereotypes of
self-importance, and none is in the least sympathetic. To give
professional actors their due, this doesn't feel like their fault.
</P>
<P>
   One can't help but sense the hand of an ill-advisedly autocratic
auteur; even if this is farce, characters, not characteristics,
must rule.

&HT;     BUSH LEADS IN POLLS FOR SUPER TUESDAY PRIMARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN and STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Polls released Sunday showed Texas Gov.
George W. Bush ahead of Sen. John McCain in most of the 13 ``Super
Tuesday'' primary states, an indication that McCain's insurgent
campaign may be in its final days.
</P>
<P>
   Polls sponsored by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal showed
Bush ahead in six of the eight major states with contests Tuesday,
including California, New York, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri and
Maryland. The survey showed McCain ahead of Bush only in
Connecticut and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 613 Republican delegates are at stake Tuesday, with a
minimum of 1,034 needed to win the nomination. Bush leads in the
delegate count, 208-104.
</P>
<P>
   In New York _ a state that McCain has said is a ``must-win'' for
him _ Bush held a 45 percent-39 percent lead over McCain among
Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   A separate poll by Zogby International of Utica N.Y., showed
Bush has widened his lead among all voters in California, a trend
that would add up to a huge setback for McCain if it is reflected
in the Tuesday vote.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, trailing Bush among the registered California Republican
voters who alone will select the state's delegates, has staked his
California fortunes on winning the state's non-binding `beauty
contest'' in which independents and Democrats also can participate.
</P>
<P>
   A main campaign theme for McCain has been that he can attract
non-Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Among all California voters, Bush led McCain on Sunday, getting
27.4 percent to McCain's 20.9 percent, nearly a percentage point
better than Bush's lead on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans in California, Bush also extended his lead to
53.9 percent over McCain's 25.6. Those numbers reflected a nearly
three-percentage-point increase for Bush and a two-and-a-half
percentage point drop for McCain from similar polls Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Sunday said he would support McCain if McCain won the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   `I've always said if John is the nominee, I'll support him,''
Bush said on `Face the Nation'' on CBS. Bush added, however, that
he expects to be the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded to a slightly different question _ whether he
would actively campaign for Bush _ by adding the condition that
Bush would have to embrace campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the fact that so many people have responded to his
appeal for reform shows that reform ``is clearly now a very
essential _ if not the most important _ part of this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes, asked whether Bush, if he wins
the nomination, would consider McCain as a running mate, responded:
``The governor won't speculate about that. It would be terribly
presumptuous while he's still competing for the presidential
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain rejected any possiblity that he would run as the vice
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said from the beginning that I would not under any
circumstances consider being vice president of the United States,''
McCain told NBC News ``Meet the Press.'' A vice president's sole
duties are to ``inquire daily as to the health of the president''
and to ``attend the funerals of third world dictators,'' McCain
said. ``Neither of those do I find an enjoyable exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain tried to dismiss the polls by saying that pollsters have
been fooled in early contests in New Hampshire and Michigan by
unprecedented turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of volatility out there and the models of the
pollsters are not indicative in some ways because we've had such
huge voter turnouts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what awaits him if he loses his bid, McCain replied: ``A
happy life. I have a wonderful life of living in Arizona (with) my
family there.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would return to the Senate. ``I love the Senate.
I love being chairman of the Commerce Committee,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth on the Sunday morning television talk shows
represented a lessening of tension between the two candidates that
took the form last week of a spiraling round of attacks and
counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At issue were controversial Bush ads criticizing McCain's votes
against spending bills that included funds for breast cancer
research, and an ad underwritten by a Bush political ally that was
critical of McCain's environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning in Buffalo and Ohio before flying to
California, proclaimed that he is the ``only candidate'' in the GOP
primaries who can win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   McCain fought off questions about his dimming political
prospects against Bush with fresh attacks on the Republican front
runner during a final cross-country swing before Tuesday's
primaries in 13 states.
</P>
<P>
   McCain repeated accusations raised on Saturday that Bush and his
``Texas cronies'' are trying to ``hijack'' the outcome of Super
Tuesday's 13 Republican contests with a $2.5 million advertising
assault challenging McCain's record on clean air.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are ``not true'' and they are ``trying to fool you,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let them do it; don't let them get away with it. The
message is, maybe that's the kind of politics they practice in
Texas but it's not the kind of politics that we would accept in New
York, Ohio and California. Go back, go back with your dirty
money.''

3-WAY MERGER DANCE FOR COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Lawyers for Qwest Communications International Inc. and Deutsche
Telekom of Germany spent the weekend exploring ways to unravel
Qwest's pending agreement to acquire U S West Inc. in an effort to
set up a three-way merger among the companies, executives close to
the discussions said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said that Joseph P. Nacchio and Philip P.
Anschutz, Qwest's top executives, would like to sell their company,
a long-distance communications upstart based in Denver, to the
German communications giant, which is trying to expand overseas.
Standing in the way of such a deal, however, is Qwest's earlier
agreement to acquire U S West, the smallest of the regional Bell
phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   When Qwest agreed to acquire U S West last summer for $36.5
billion, the deal appeared to catapult Qwest into the major leagues
of communications. But now the U S West deal is largely preventing
Nacchio, Qwest's chairman, and Anschutz, Qwest's largest
shareholder, from selling their company to Deutsche Telekom,
Europe's biggest communications carrier.
</P>
<P>
   A Deutsche Telekom-Qwest tie-up could make strategic sense, said
Rob Van Der Valk, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in
London. The deal would benefit Deutsche Telekom's pan-European
ambitions by putting it in a relationship with the Dutch phone
company Royal KPN, which has a relationship with Qwest. ``They can
kill two birds with one stone,'' he said. Nonetheless, he
acknowledged, ``It's going to be very complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of the work done this weekend, many people close to
the discussions between Qwest and Deutsche Telekom handicap the
chances of any merger agreement being struck over the next few
weeks at less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest has built a state-of-the-art fiber-optic communications
network that covers the United States. Acquiring that asset would
immediately give Deutsche Telekom credibility in the lucrative U.S.
communications market. U S West, on the other hand, is the local
phone provider in some of the most rural parts of the country, in
addition to also serving cities including Seattle and Phoenix, and
is far less valuable to Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Deutsche Telekom's ideal agreement would be for U S
West to simply disappear from the equation, allowing the German
company to pursue a relatively straightforward acquisition of
Qwest, executives close to the negotiations said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But unless U S West inexplicably decided to simply walk away
from its deal with Qwest _ a possibility that one person close to
the talks said ``is just not going to happen'' _ the German company
is saddled with having to negotiate with both U S West and Qwest at
once. Were Qwest and Deutsche Telekom to make a side deal without
including U S West, U S West could sue the two other companies for
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   For Deutsche Telekom, the essential question is whether it wants
to acquire Qwest so badly that it is also willing to take on the
less attractive U S West, and at what price.
</P>
<P>
   U S West's board and shareholders, after all, have agreed to
accept Qwest stock in exchange for their U S West shares, and they
figured that that deal would close this summer. Deutsche Telekom is
now faced with the prospect of starting a new set of negotiations
with U S West's board (and, by proxy, U S West's shareholders) to
persuade them to accept Deutsche Telekom shares instead.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the institutional investors that own U S West stock may
not be authorized to hold international shares, and any deal
between U S West and the German company would not close until next
year at the earliest. So in the end, to make any renegotiation
worth their while, U S West's shareholders would almost surely have
to get more from Deutsche Telekom than they had agreed to receive
from Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   Because U S West is not the company that Deutsche Telekom really
wants anyway, the German company may yet decide that the Qwest-U S
West morass is not worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   At least as attractive, and far easier, would be an acquisition
of Global Crossing Ltd. of Bermuda, instead. Global Crossing, like
Qwest, owns a U.S. fiber-optic network, but Global Crossing is also
building undersea communications links around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing's shares closed at $56.4375 last week, giving it
a market value of $45 billion, and analysts think that Deutsche
Telekom would have to offer $90 to $100 a share for Global Crossing
to strike an agreement. But time is not on Deutsche Telekom's side
because Global Crossing appears convinced that with the planned
initial public offering of its Internet unit, the value of the
overall company is set to expand on its own. That means Global
Crossing may be willing to hold out for a few quarters to see
whether it can bring even richer offers to the table.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Greater New York,'' the floor-to-ceiling survey at
P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City, Queens, has a
Manhattan skyline of cards stacked against it.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 150 artists, the show is ungainly in size. It has no
theme, was selected by committee and, as the first official
curatorial collaboration between P.S. 1 and the Museum of Modern
Art, comes with the kind of institutional clout that makes the art
world see red.
</P>
<P>
   The model is virtually identical to that of the Whitney
Biennial, which ``Greater New York'' precedes by a few weeks and to
which it will inevitably be compared. It is one that has caused the
Whitney headaches for years.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, though, the formula works, or at least works as
well as such a daft thing can. It ends up producing a good, solid
exhibition, one with arid patches, moments of mere cleverness but
also flashes of inspiration. Its tone is low-key, distinctly
un-Sensational. The number of women is, for a change, high. With a
third of the artists foreign born, there is a cosmopolitan
undercurrent: subliminal, maybe, but there.
</P>
<P>
   The show doesn't pretend to be more than a jumbo-size sampler.
It leaves a million things out (New York has dozens of art worlds;
only a few are represented here) and provides a gold mine of nits
to pick. But as a highly selective recap of what's cooking in new
art locally _ which, in this case, means the five boroughs, plus a
fringe of Westchester _ it's invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new art'' part is important. The curatorial team _ Brian
O'Doherty, Klaus Biesenbach, Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev and Russell
Haswell from P.S. 1, and Paulo Herkenhoff, Laura Hoptman and
Deborah Wye from the Modern _ set a base-line criterion that only
artists who had not had a solo exhibition before 1995 were eligible
for inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a showcase of youngish artists and young careers,
some of which are already in full gear. Several of the participants
_ Chakaia Booker, E.V. Day, Shirin Neshat, Paul Pfeiffer, Lisa
Yuskavage and Ghada Amer with an exceptionally beautiful sculptural
piece _ will also be included the next Whitney Biennial.
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't ``Greater New York'' feel as fraught with thumbs-up,
thumbs-down pressures as the Biennial? For one thing its focus is
comparatively narrow (though still insanely huge). For another, it
arrives with no burden of history either to live down or to live up
to.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, despite the evidence of the Modern's
fastidious, patrician hand in the selection _ no messy
installations, not much sex apart from a spectacular X-rated
painting by Cecily Brown _ the show appears at a place known for
its quirky, in-the-trenches, youth-friendly house style. P.S. 1, at
22-25 Jackson Avenue, is the kind of place where thousands of
intensely art-literate people can show up for an opening, as they
did for ``Greater New York'' last week, and the atmosphere will
stay stoop-party casual.
</P>
<P>
   Something of that mood is distilled in a text-based painting by
Erik Parker that opens the show. Titled ``What It Looks Like (Smart
Art),'' it's a big bouquet of thought balloons, jazzy and elegant
to look at. But each is crammed with names of rap singers, artists
and art world insiders, in a hero-worshiping litany as infectious
as a hip-hop beat and as hermetic as the art world itself.
</P>
<P>
   Painting, that evergreen medium, is the star of the show.
Artists who have been on the scene for a while, like Ellen
Gallagher, Udomsak Krisanamis, James Siena and Shazia Sikander,
deliver fine work. Newcomers like Tim Gardner and Julie Mehretu
take a place in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The formal range is, to say the least, eclectic, the way things
are these days. A painting by Diana Cooper comes out from the wall
to form a fragile 3-D cubicle festooned with pink pompoms. Jeremy
Blake revisits the standard modernist painting vocabulary of color
and geometry, but does so through a series of slide projections,
which dissolve into snow in the end. Ruth Root makes organic
painted paper collages the size and shape of pastries.
</P>
<P>
   Organic abstraction is the theme of one of the more resolved
gallery groupings. It brings together David Dupuis' drawings of
spoorlike forms, the pattern-rich gouaches of Bruce Pearson and a
rainbow-hued net made of pipe cleaners by Lucky DeBellevue. Lisa
Ruyter's wiry narrative, ``Sunset Boulevard,'' adds just the right
astringent touch. The days when decorative was anathema are behind
us once again.
</P>
<P>
   Broader themes are spun out elsewhere, with varying success. One
first-floor ensemble tries to get something going with the overlap
of infantilism and glamour, a promising idea that some editing
might have sharpened. A neat trio of Rob Pruitt's glitter-encrusted
pandas, T.J. Wilcox's mesmerizing, noirish video fantasy of the
Marlene Dietrich funeral that never was and Elizabeth Peyton's
man-child portrait would have done the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood shading into adolescence has been a driving metaphor
in contemporary work for years; recently it has taken the form of a
hard-to-pinpoint blend of sweetness and scariness. So it makes
sense that one of P.S. 1's second floor galleries seems to have
reverted to the public school classroom it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it is given over to a Mick O'Shea installation
``Artworld,'' a toy town with tulips for trees, houses made of
folded-up gallery invitations and an electric train that transports
gobs of paint out to the hall and back. Sharing the space are the
sinister-looking (though actually quite poetic) contraptions of
Paul Etienne Lincoln. They suggest the work of a brainy, off-center
eighth grader who spends Saturdays in the basement with his
chemistry set trying to conjure up alien life.
</P>
<P>
   What could easily be the products of such experiments fill a
gallery across the hall. Here one finds Keith Edmier's scalded-pink
mutant waterlily, Rob de Mar's long-stemmed biospheres and a Seth
Kelly sculpture that looks like a moon rock in meltdown. Similar
rocks, which appear to be aquarium accessories, are on view in a
fish tank installation by Michael Phelan, who enlivens the weird
science around him by having real goldfish flitting through his
work.
</P>
<P>
   Science is about systematic thinking. And systems of all kinds,
the more elaborate and labor-intensive the better, recur. Mark
Lombardi draws dense fields of multidirectional arrows to explicate
economic history. Elizabeth Campbell applies the same obsessive
flow-chart analysis to her personal life.
</P>
<P>
   A gorgeous, light-glinting painting by Sam Gordon looks like a
data bank for esoteric spiritual matter. Olu Oguibe, in one of the
few uses of interactive computing (yet another art world, and one
that the Whitney Biennial will explore), offers a multimedia work
station dedicated to the myths of ethnology. Dylan Stone, in the
guise of urban archaeologist, is in the process of photographing
every architectural facade in Manhattan; his archive-in-progress is
here.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture and, by extension, design have an important place.
Mark Dean Veca, a kind of pop Tiepolo, has turned the interior of
P.S. 1's cafe into a roiling vortex of cartoon clouds, while Ricci
Albenda transforms a remote basement room into an immaculate,
milky-white sculptural environment, illuminated through overhead
sidewalk grates: sunshine by day, street-lamp light by night.
Wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   There are even some houses on hand. A many-layered installation
by Javier Tellez, who is, like Oguibe, an interesting thinker and
one of the show's finds, consists of a giant, walk-in birdhouse
filled with real birdhouses made by psychiatric patients in
London's infamous Bedlam hospital, where Tellez once worked.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And P.S. 1's vast third-floor gallery is dominated by a
full-size house stitched from turquoise silk by Do-Ho Suh. Titled
``Seoul Home/L.A. Home/New York Home,'' it is modeled on the
one-room house in Korea that this artist grew up in and is named
for the cities where she has lived since. It floats on high like
the set for a fairy tale ballet about to descend from the flies.
</P>
<P>
   Suh is one of 49 artists in ``Greater New York'' born outside
the United States. Their presence gives a clear picture of how the
demographics of art in New York are being reconfigured.
(Institutions like the Bronx Museum of the Arts and the Queens
Museum of Art have of course been presenting and actively creating
this picture for years.)
</P>
<P>
   The show also reflects developments less easy to tabulate. The
body, that endlessly scrutinized and dissected emblem of the 1990s,
radically shaped, like the era itself, by AIDS, now has a subtler,
less emphatic presence. It is back to being ``the figure,'' but
often as an actor in uneasy, dreamlike narratives of a kind seen in
the photographs of Adam Baer and Justine Kurland and a rapid-fire,
paranoidal video by Jordan Crandall.
</P>
<P>
   Neither beauty nor style as subjects get much attention.
Political ideas are muted and oblique; they have a tone of earnest,
repressed worrying rather than protest. The insistent, extroverted
glamour and aggression of British art recently seen in the city is
little in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In place of Damien Hirst's dead shark there are Phelan's living
goldfish. Instead of the Chapman brothers' naughty tableaux there
is Lawrence Seward's little cabinet of sculptural wonders, ghastly
but cute. The pretentious historical references of Sam
Taylor-Wood's photographs have been replaced by far more modest
homages. Near the fuse box powering his art-world Lilliput, O'Shea
has hidden a tiny version of Giotto's Padua chapel, from whose
murals, he implies, the energy of a grand art tradition flows.
</P>
<P>
   Overall an air of grandeur, of the big, thrown-open gesture, is
missing in the show itself, and when it comes it tends to be
directed at the ear rather than the eye. Military marches blast
from Nadine Robinson's room-size boombox, passionate Colombian folk
songs soar through a lovely video piece by Adriana Arenas, and a
throbbing, addictive technopulse (music by Wolfgang Voigt) emanates
from Julian Laverdiere's dark, beetling installation, a romantic
monument to failed ambition that is also, appropriately, one of the
largest pieces on view.
</P>
<P>
   Also appropriately, some of the physically most attenuated works
come with expansive ideas. Nina Khatchadourian performs ambitious
feats of restorative microsurgery on broken spider webs. Manuel
Acevedo, in hand-altered photos, erects sculptures resembling
Tatlin's utopian monument in desolate urban lots as perches for
birds. And then there is Stone's project, a truly Sisyphean task
given the rate at which things in this city rise and fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greater New York,'' on view until May 16, is in the category
of ``things that rise.'' It doesn't rise sky-high, but it forms a
core of information to which stories, wings, even foundations can
be added, as they will be, mentally, by every critically alert
visitor to the show. As everybody knows, there is no ``New York
art.'' But there is a ton of art in New York, with distinctive
looks and concerns shaping up at the beginning of the decade.
However that message is delivered, and it is delivered with care
and intelligence here, it's good news.

Qwest's pending agreement to acquire U S West Inc. in an effort to
set up a three-way merger, executives close to the talks said.

   TWO NEW BOOKS COMING ON GIULIANI
</P>
<P>
   Two New York journalists who have had difficult relations with
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are writing books about him that are
scheduled to be published this summer, just as the mayor's race for
the U.S. Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton would be heading
into the stretch. Andrew Kirtzman, a political reporter for New
York One, a local cable TV news station, who has covered Giuliani
since 1993, is writing ``Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City,'' a
look at the mayor's administration. Wayne Barrett, a longtime
investigative reporter for The Village Voice, is writing ``Rudy:
Gotham's Goliath,'' a biography of Giuliani.

   COKE LOSES MONEY ON ITS BOTTLERS
</P>
<P>
   If there was any question that Coca-Cola's global bottling
system ran into trouble last year, the company's latest annual
report eliminates it. The report shows that Coke lost $184 million
on investments in its bottlers. In 1998, it earned $32 million on
those investments.

   DOUBLECLICK TAKES HEAT OFF RIVALS
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates were relieved last week when DoubleClick, the
Internet's biggest supplier of banner advertising, announced that
it would put a hold on its plan to link personal identities to
anonymous data it collects about Internet users. Some of
DoubleClick's competitors were just as relieved. Those rivals had
been bracing for more intense scrutiny of their own data-gathering
practices.
</P>
<P>
   THE PROFIT MOTIVE IN FREE ACCESS
</P>
<P>
   With announcements last week by Lycos and NBC Interactive that
they would join the list of companies offering free Internet
service, it became clear that the free-access movement is a trend.
But what remains less clear is whether the trend will alter the
financial fundamentals of the Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
   GAY GROUPS PROTEST TV PROGRAM
</P>
<P>
   There has been friction for years between gay rights groups and
Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the conservative host of the nation's most
popular self-help radio talk program. Now, the groups have begun a
campaign to protest a television program that she will be the host
of next fall. The Paramount unit of Viacom, which is producing the
program, was reportedly besieged with telephone calls and e-mail
messages from people upset by Schlessinger's anti-gay comments. She
has said that while she opposes homosexuality, the gay rights
groups are taking her statements out of context.
</P>
<P>
   ICANN ELECTION PLAN IS CRITICIZED
</P>
<P>
   A plan to create the Internet's first democracy is plagued by
skepticism, conflicting goals and a lack of accountability, which
will make it difficult for the Internet's new oversight
organization, the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, to
hold a fair board election in September, according to a report by
two influential public interest groups.

   CHINA-SMUGGLING (Shantou, China) _ After years of tolerance,
China is waging a desperate war on the smuggling and corruption
that have long helped enriched country's prosperous southern
provinces at the expense of central government coffers. But the
anti-smuggling campaign, designed to increase revenues and to clean
up the government's badly tarnished image, has already proved to be
an exceedingly delicate balancing act, both because important
regional economies are intertwined with smuggling, and also because
zealous pursuit of the crime often, embarrassingly, ends up at the

   INTERNET-DOCTORS (Undated) _ Doctors and patients say the
Internet has profoundly changed their relationships. With an

much as mentions a possible diagnosis, many patients rush to their
computers to learn more about it. When a doctor suggests a drug,
patients go online to find its side effects. And when they arrive
at their doctor's office, more and more patients are bearing pages
of information printed from Web sites. By Gina Kolata.

PAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY: A MEETING IN THE PARK TURNS DEADLY 
</HEADLINE>

 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Sunset'' and ``Esplanade'' are two of Paul Taylor's
finest and strangest works: Typically, they do not resemble pieces
in any other dance company.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sunset'' a bittersweet encounter of six soldiers and four
young women in a park becomes a vision of death. In ``Esplanade''
the transformation is very different, quite startling.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary movement like walking, skipping and running becomes
dance movement. By the time the fearless cast in the Paul Taylor
Dance Company stops throwing itself to the floor with
heart-stopping fervor, the realization is that everyday gestures
and jogging have been reorganized rhythmically into choreographed
phrases to Bach's music.
</P>
<P>
   The two works look different. One is a dramatic vignette, the
other an experiment in movement. Yet when they shared a program on
Thursday night at City Center, along with the previously reviewed
``Arabesque,'' it was clear that both had similar moments of light
and shade.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's usual idiom owes something to Martha Graham, with whose
company he once danced. That vocabulary is less evident in
``Sunset,'' which nonetheless epitomizes Graham's belief that
movement reveals inner emotion. ``Sunset'' is about nothing but
emotion and its very obliqueness symbolizes the hidden fears it
expresses under the surface of an innocent episode.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sense of specific time or place, although the
soldiers' red berets and the women's 1950s white frocks suggest a
European park of the past. The painter Alex Katz scatters
aquamarine foliage on two panels behind a park railing. Elgar's
music, heard on tape as are all the scores this season, is as
bittersweet as the dance images. The immediate suggestion is that
the soldiers, on leave and lonely, are out to meet girls who are
modest and shy.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Tipton's lighting and the dancing turn the initial
sunniness into a vision frozen out of time. As Ted Thomas, one of
the men, dives to the floor, the music stops and is replaced by a
tape of loon calls. Thomas reaches toward Andy LeBeau, carried in
by the women. Images of men dying on the battlefield intrude upon
the peaceful scene.
</P>
<P>
   Comradeship on all levels, epitomized by the duets of Patrick
Corbin and Andrew Asnes, is the leitmotif. Corbin has the right
casual rhythm. Asnes, too jazzy in his weight shifting, adds a
nasty competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   The cast was completed by Michael Trusnovec, Francie Huber,
Kristi Egtvedt, Takehiro Ueyama, Heather Berest and Maureen
Mansfield.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way ``Sunset'' incorporates everyday gesture into the
dance phrases. The men leap with hands in their pockets or brush
imaginary dust off the women's dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Esplanade'' keeps its plain-Jane vocabulary up front. The
darker aspect of the piece is in the middle section, which could be
about a dysfunctional family unable to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the two ensemble sections (with the amazing Lisa
Viola taking daredevil leaps into her partner's arms or reeling
backward) are about communicating with the audience. The splendid
cast included Huber, Asnes, Richard Chen See, Egtvedt, Silvia
Nevjinsky, Ueyama, Mansfield and Amy Young.

COCA-COLA REPORTS LOSING $184 MILLION ON BOTTLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there was any question that Coca-Cola Co.'s global bottling
system ran into trouble last year, the company's latest annual
report eliminates it.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued on Friday, shows that Coke lost $184 million
on investments in its bottlers. In 1998, it earned $32 million on
those investments, a 79 percent decline from the 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Coke continued to make hefty payments to its
largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, of which Coke owns about 42
percent.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Coke paid $1.1 billion to Coca-Cola Enterprises, about
8.3 percent less than the $1.2 billion it gave the bottler in 1998.
The 1998 payments were questioned by some analysts, particularly
since they increased significantly from 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to shareholders, Coke's chief executive, Douglas
N. Daft, calls Coke's results ``disappointing to us and not what
you have rightly come to expect from the Coca-Cola Co.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the general tone of the report is forward-looking.
Coke's former chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, who
retired abruptly in December, is mentioned only when Daft says: ``I
appreciate the counsel and friendship of my predecessor, Doug
Ivester.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's proxy statement, also made public on Friday,
showed that Ivester left Coke with $17.8 million in payments and
other benefits, plus restricted stock worth $97.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter of last year, Coke took a writedown of
$813 million for various costs. The annual report says that those
costs included $74 million ``primarily related to the change in
senior management'' and other organizational changes. About $543
million was attributed to underperforming investments in Russia,
the Caribbean, the Middle and Far East and North America, the
annual report states, and another $196 million is tied to troubled
vending properties in Japan and excess capacity in the Baltic
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the reports says that Coke will not repurchase shares
of its stock until the second half of this year. The costs of a
company restructuring announced in January is one reason given. The
other is the cost of a planned reduction in concentrate inventories
held by some bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   A Coca-Cola spokesman, reached Sunday, could not provide further
details on the annual report.

CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA: A CONDUCTOR MOLDS THE PLIANT CLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (lb) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The look of the stage for the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra concert conducted by Daniel Barenboim at Carnegie Hall on
Saturday evening gave the impression of a work in progress. The
extra chairs stacked on either side as the program opened, with
Barenboim playing and conducting a reduced orchestra in Mozart's
Piano Concerto No. 25, came into play in the second half,
consisting of Bruckner's mighty Fourth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   But there was still the matter of that elongated electronic
screen hanging idle above Barenboim's head. Presumably awaiting
supertitles in the second concert, on Sunday, when the orchestra
was to present the New York premiere of Elliott Carter's opera
``What's Next?'' along with Falla's ``Three-Cornered Hat,'' it set
a listener to fantasizing about the possibility of using it as a
scoreboard to liven up concerts with a tally of orchestral runs,
hits and errors.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the orchestra finishes up Monday evening with works by
Pierre Boulez and the Fifth Symphony of Mahler, Barenboim will just
be getting warmed up in his Perspectives series at Carnegie. On
Tuesday he directs a workshop for pianists and conductors with the
Civic Orchestra of Chicago, the training arm of the Chicago
Symphony, culminating in a concert on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the notion of a work in progress seems apt with
regard to Barenboim's activities with the Chicago Symphony since he
became music director in 1991, at least in this listener's limited
experience. And it applies to individual performances as well as to
the larger tasks of rebuilding and guiding the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In the grander scheme Barenboim has gone some way toward
breaking down the monolithic sonority that prevailed during the
tenure of his immediate predecessor as music director, Sir Georg
Solti, impressively in the earlier years and tiresomely toward the
end, as the sound turned increasingly to a preening brute strength.
</P>
<P>
   And on the level of individual interpretations, unlike Solti,
who drilled a performance to within an inch of its life, Barenboim
seems more inclined to experiment, to meander, to try different
tempos on different nights or even within a single performance.
</P>
<P>
   The results can prove exciting, as they did on Saturday,
especially in the first movement of the Bruckner. With Solti, you
well knew the sound of the orchestra with all stops pulled, so you
knew what to expect at almost every climax, as tightly controlled
as it was overwhelmingly loud.
</P>
<P>
   When these high-powered players put their backs to a climax now,
you are never sure what to expect: The climax may storm the
heavens, or it may fizzle for lack of unanimity. But you also sense
that it could spin out of control in a chain reaction and wipe out
much of 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   And that first movement was no less notable for the beauty of
its quieter moments. Clearly the orchestra is a more pliable
instrument now, and it needed to be when Barenboim stretched tempos
to the breaking point in the finale.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as became increasingly apparent in the Bruckner, it is also
less reliable, more erratic, at times even fragile-sounding. Adolph
Herseth, long a magnificent principal trumpeter, is 78, and finally
sounds it with some regularity. Cracked notes abounded elsewhere in
the brasses as well; the woodwinds, with Mathieu Dufour as the fine
new principal flutist, generally fared better.
</P>
<P>
   The Mozart showed some of the same instability of tempo as the
Bruckner, seeming merely impetuous rather than searching. When
Barenboim was playing, the pace became more urgent if not
necessarily faster, though sometimes that, too.
</P>
<P>
   For all its new-found pliancy, the Chicago Symphony may not yet
be a convincing Mozart orchestra. ``Reduced'' is a relative term,
as the 40 or so players proved in a weighty, proclamatory opening
that might have strained the resources of a period band twice the
size.
</P>
<P>
   It is still hard to get a fix on precisely where Barenboim and
the Chicago Symphony stand in the suddenly fluid scheme of American
orchestras. What seems to be needed is judicious pruning and
painstaking refinement, and it will be interesting to see how much
those tasks appeal to the mercurial Barenboim.

LFO: HEARTTHROB BOYS THREATEN TO BURST BUBBLE GUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One bit of sweet revenge accomplished by today's
teeny-bop stars is the symbolic displacement of the popular boy.
Boy bands like 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys teach girls to favor
sensitive choirboy types over the football-playing kind who barely
assert themselves on a date until it comes to fumbling in the back
of a car.
</P>
<P>
   Yet pop is never through providing idols, and some boy bands
fulfill more conventionally masculine roles. Foremost among them is
LFO, a trio sponsored by Lou Pearlman, the mogul who also put
together 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys. LFO plays things a little
risky, teasing fans at the boundaries of sex and race. At Irving
Plaza on Friday its arrogance added something to the boy-band
lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   LFO gained fame from the bubble-gum rap song ``Summer Girls,''
sometimes mistaken for an advertisement for the clothiers
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch. The hit, rapped by the group's blond hunk _
Rich Cronin, who is one of its writers _ cannily enters a
teen-ager's attention-deficit-plagued brain.
</P>
<P>
   As the song's light groove floated along at Irving Plaza, Cronin
spun out lines in which his passion for a lost love was constantly
obstructed by thoughts of his favorite clothing, movie stars, food
preferences and brand names. The crowd of screaming girls shouted
along with this information mishmash.
</P>
<P>
   The songs with similarly scattered attitude were the best in
LFO's set. Cronin's cotton-candy raps stood out in ``Girl on TV,''
about an unlikely romance with a Hollywood star. This song neatly
fulfilled a double fantasy: the common fascination with
inter-celebrity romance, and the fan's basic desire to mate with
someone famous.
</P>
<P>
   Cronin, Brad Fischetti and Devin Lima do seem fairly datable,
although more dauntingly handsome than most boy-band members. They
showed an appealingly lazy confidence, slumping through dance
routines and showing off well-tended torsos. Lima did most of the
singing, emulating Stevie Wonder with a fluttery falsetto.
Fischetti mostly just posed well.
</P>
<P>
   The group switched between rap and dance pop, sticking to black
pop references. Up-tempo numbers honored New Edition, and the
frankly sexual tone of several songs recalled Jodeci or Dru Hill.
Its backing band was spunky, though not funky, and mostly avoided
Las Vegas-style flourishes. When LFO did succumb to a big ballad,
however, the sound became generic and dull. Cockiness is the
group's best quality; it has no talent for being soft.
</P>
<P>
   Two new teen-age acts, SK8 and Boyz and Girlz United, opened the
show. The latter was notable for its diverse membership and sassy
spirit. The former was as plastic as pop acts come.

THOSE FICKLE AESTHETES! LE GRAFFITI IS NOW REVILED
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ First, Mehdi Dairi used a digital camera to take a
picture of the wall at 26, rue Fontaine _ a stretch of beige stucco
splashed with pink swirls, silver exclamation marks and just
possibly black initials, though it was hard to be sure that
lettering was actually involved. That was the ``before'' picture.
</P>
<P>
   Then, taking the right shade of paint from the assortment at the
back of a City of Paris truck, Dairi and his partner, Christophe
Margery, began their work, applying smooth, even strokes. Fifteen
minutes later they were ready to take an ``after'' picture of a
perfectly clean wall.
</P>
<P>
   It was pretty much the only clean surface to be found in this
area of Paris, which is largely devoted to nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with an arsenal of paints, solvents, steam machines and
sand blasters, three dozen anti-graffiti teams began working the
streets of this city last month, trying to erase the scrawl that in
some parts of Paris now covers every wall, door and ornate entrance
that a youth can reach with a spray can.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, France debated the beauty of graffiti, with some
of its most prominent politicians defending graffiti writers as
artists of the pop culture. Such was the love affair with street
art that exhibits sprang up around the country. One Paris museum
even displayed a subway car covered with graffiti, along with
videos of young spray painters explaining just how they do it.
</P>
<P>
   No more. These days polls indicate that Parisians have had it
with this particular form of art. In a recent survey, graffiti
joined dog droppings and pollution as the biggest complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are such beautiful places in this city, really charming
spots, and they are ruined by all this scribble,'' said Alaize
Momou, 62, who had stopped to admire the work of the anti-graffiti
team on Rue Fontaine in the Ninth Arrondissement. ``It's not like
you can even tell what they are writing about. It's like this rap
music that has no music to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paris, which already is one of the world's big spenders in
keeping up its appearance, has decided to spend another $12 million
a year on getting rid of its graffiti. Until now, the city has only
had programs to clean city-owned property. The new program will
clean up private property, too. Citizens who refuse the cleanup
must do it themselves or face a potential fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to a few years ago, the Parisian is much more
sensitive to the cleanliness, to the general appearance of the
city,'' said Patrick Tremege, the assistant mayor in charge of the
cleanup effort for the city. ``The thing about graffiti is that it
is even more than a cleanliness issue. It gives a sense of
insecurity _ that things are a little out of control and the people
don't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the problem has continued to grow in recent years.
Surveys show that now more than 40 percent of the city's 90,000
buildings have been ``tagged,'' and that private citizens,
discouraged by the constant bombardment with spray paint, no longer
even try to clean it up.
</P>
<P>
   The new anti-graffiti program aims to clean 90 percent of the
graffiti within a year. After that the teams will concentrate on
new hits, which the city is promising to cover within 12 days.
Citizens can make a phone call to sign up for a cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Dairi and Margery could hardly ask for more support as they went
about their business the other day. Parisians passing by showered
them with approval, from offering friendly thumbs up signs to
admiration for their technique and the solvents they used that
seemed to melt the chaos off metal storefront gates with ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good work,'' said one elderly woman pausing before a
freshly cleaned doorway. ``Le graffiti,'' she added, ``is the shame
of our century.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are still a few supporters of graffiti to be
found here and there. Frank Dimenna, 26, who works in the piano
store on Rue Fontaine says he does not even notice the stuff nor
mind it. ``When they are really well done, it can be pretty and
should be left alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his seems to be the minority opinion. Even Jack Lang, a
culture minister of the 1990s who courted the break-dancers,
rappers and graffiti writers in an effort to demonstrate that
France's Socialist Party had not lost touch with its
underprivileged urban youth, seems on the defensive over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said that vandalism was OK'' Lang said recently.
``People who are bringing up this issue are just trying to make
trouble. There is a place for this kind of thing, in areas that
have been specially designated for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Parisiens will say quite frankly that their problem with
graffiti is the fault of Americans. ``You send us all your
diseases, '' said Momou, who has worked as a janitor at a movie
house on the Rue Fontaine for four decades. ``This comes from the
states. Don't you have this mess all over the place over there?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, French officials say they have been studying New York
City's efforts to reduce graffiti. The problem, says Tremege, is
that the Paris mayor has no control over the police force and
therefore cannot coordinate cleanup efforts with police patrols as
has been done in the United states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficulty for us,'' Tremege said. ``The mayor is
often like an S O S doctor. But he really can't get at the root of
the problem. We will see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the anti-graffiti teams say their work is usually undone
in a matter of days. That is why the digital cameras recording that
work has actually been done is so important. ``I give it 48
hours,'' said Margery looking over his morning's work. ``The
writers see a really clean wall and it is too tempting.''

`THE LIFE AND MORALS OF A NIGHT CHAMELEON': NEW `DREAM' IS AT LEAST
PUCKISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes when choreographers try to adapt great
literature, they take such pains to distill and refine a work that
the dance they create, though filled with movement, looks curiously
lifeless. That, unfortunately, can be said of Philippe Saire's
``Vie et Moeurs du Cameleon Nocturne/The Life and Morals of a Night
Chameleon,'' which Cie Philippe Saire presented on Friday night at
St. Mark's Church as part of the Danspace Project's Global Exchange
series.
</P>
<P>
   This Swiss choreographer derived his hourlong piece from
Shakespeare's ``Midsummer Night's Dream,'' a comedy that has
inspired several successful dance productions. Saire's version for
his Lausanne-based troupe began promisingly with Nicholas Pettit
darting so slyly about the space that one knew he must be Puck.
</P>
<P>
   He commanded attention throughout the evening. This Puck was an
eternal busybody who knew how to use technology. He beamed
spotlights at other dancers, lighted matches, filled the church
with smoke and caused snippets of music by Ravel to come and go by
turning a tape machine on and off.
</P>
<P>
   Corinne Rochet also made a striking first impression as she
entered accompanied by Nabih Amaraoui, Manuel Chabanis and Karine
Grasset, who wore animal masks. She thereby brought to mind how
Shakespeare's Titania was infatuated with a donkey.
</P>
<P>
   But when the dancers removed their masks and moved in
modern-dress costumes by Nadia Cuenoud, they resembled
Shakespeare's squabbling lovers. Sometimes goaded by Puck, they
kept throwing themselves at, and then repulsing, one another, and
the clatter of their heeled shoes on the floor provided the action
with a sense of nervous intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The hurly-burly grew progressively less interesting, for Saire
failed to characterize these people. Their comings and goings
simply exemplified various choreographic ways of advancing and
retreating, with few hints of Shakespeare's wit, mystery and
malice. Although a lot happened, little mattered much.

 &HT;    ISRAELI CABINET VOTES TO WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM LEBANON
 &HT;    625&AMP;Add
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After 18 years of casualties and controversy,
Israel's Cabinet voted unanimously Sunday to withdraw its troops
from Lebanon by early July.
</P>
<P>
   The pullout would keep a campaign promise made by Prime Minister
Ehud Barak a year ago to end Israel's unpopular and costly
involvement in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is gambling that Syria, which largely controls Lebanon,
will abstain from encouraging guerrillas in southern Lebanon from
launching cross-border attacks on cities in northern Israel. Syria
is believed to use the guerrillas in Lebanon to pressure Israel to
return the nearby Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria
in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Barak hopes that a withdrawal will, in turn, prod Syria to give
Israel better terms in any deal for return of the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   Syria and Israel began peace talks in December but the Syrians
broke them off in January when Israel would not guarantee a full
Golan withdrawal. Israeli generals have warned that attacks could
come across Israel's northern border from Lebanon if the Israeli
troops pull back without a Syria peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an end to the tragedy,'' Barak told reporters. ``We're
bringing the boys home.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Barak could only give vague reassurances of how Israel will
protect its northern border if Syria does not sanction the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we are fulfilling a major commitment that we made to
the public and I don't suggest that anyone should assume what our
response will be when we redeploy to the international border and
defend Israel from there,'' Barak said in an interview on Israeli
television Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said that, in the months ahead, Israel will fortify its
northern towns. Though Barak did not say so Sunday, Israeli
officials frequently threaten that they will respond with air
strikes to any attacks across Israel's borders. Some analysts worry
that a withdrawal without an agreement with Syria _ a so-called
``unilateral withdrawal'' _ could lead to more, rather than less,
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet decision appeared to leave some room to maneuver in
the event there is no peace deal by July by saying that it would
meet again to decide how to implement a withdrawal. A withdrawal is
expected to take three months and could be done in phases while
peace talks with Syria continue.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Griver, an Israeli activist against the war in southern
Lebanon, said the Cabinet cannot go back on its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't do it, there will just be too much public
pressure on Barak,'' she said of the planned withdrawal. ``It's
going to reach the point where people just can't take any more.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 Israeli troops man hilltop bunkers in southern
Lebanon. They are backed by another 2,000 troops in a Lebanese
militia, the South Lebanon Army, that is trained and funded by
Israel. About 100,000 Lebanese live in the roughly nine-mile wide
swath of land across Lebanon's southern border.
</P>
<P>
   Israel first invaded Lebanon in 1978 to fight Palestinian
Liberation Organization terrorists who had attacked civilians in
northern Israel. Israel withdrew within a few weeks, leaving the
area to the control of pro-Israeli Lebanese militias.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight against Palestinian terrorists took Israel into
Lebanon again in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Israel withdrew to roughly the current swath across south
Lebanon in 1985. Israelis call it the ``security zone,'' but most
governments around the world consider it occupied territory.
</P>
<P>
   The PLO fled Lebanon. But Hezbollah, a well-disciplined
guerrilla army of Iranian-backed Shiite Muslims, rose up in
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 650 Israeli troops were killed following the 1978
invasion. Another 250 have been killed in the occupation zone since
it was established in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The war has become increasingly unpopular with Israelis and has
been the subject of large anti-war demonstrations. This year,
Israelis were shocked when Hezbollah killed seven soldiers in just
over two weeks in early February. Television footage of bloodied
soldiers injured by a Hezbollah roadside bomb intensified the
debate and two soldiers went anonymously on Israeli radio to
protest the war they were in.
</P>
<P>
   But Israelis worry that Hezbollah, or perhaps refugee
Palestinians, could strike into Israel once the troops withdraw.
The key appears to lie in reaching a deal with Syria next door.
</P>
<P>
   With about 35,000 troops there, Syria largely controls Lebanon
and demands that Israel also withdraw from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Israeli officials believe that Hezbollah strikes on
Israeli troops are encouraged by Syria to put pressure on Israel to
get out of the Golan _ a sort of proxy war that Syria could use to
avoid all out war.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, an air shipment of weapons from Iran lands in the
Syrian capital of Damascus and is transported by land to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli withdrawal could eliminate Syria's leverage over
Israel for the Golan. Syria could opt to encourage strikes into
Israeli territory.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa
warned that Israel would ``bear the consequences'' if it withdrew
from Lebanon without a peace deal with Syria.

MAILING SUPPLIER AND IBM TRY POSTAGE SALES ON NET 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   So it has come to this. The latest convenience, brought to you
by the Internet economy, will be the ability to go out and buy
stamps?
</P>
<P>
   That is the selling point for the latest offering from Neopost
Online, the Internet arm of the mail-room equipment company
Neopost. Until now, Neopost Online concentrated on persuading
people to download postage from their computers. Now it has formed
a partnership with IBM to dot the landscape with kiosks that can
dispense postage to those not tethered to a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The self-service kiosks, envisioned for college campuses,
grocery stores and post-office lobbies, would enable customers to
weigh packages and select a postage category _ say, first class or
priority mail. The kiosk would calculate the postage needed, print
a digital stamp on a self-adhesive label, and charge the customer's
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   David Crisp, Neopost Online's chief executive, bridles at the
suggestion that the kiosks are digitally gussied-up versions of
conventional stamp machines. ``All you can do at those is buy a
book of stamps,'' he said. ``The kiosks let you weigh packages, get
exact postage, do all those things you had to stand on line at the
post office for.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the U.S. Postal Service may have the most to gain. The
kiosks will save on labor costs, since the Postal Service can
automatically replenish the postage levels by computer via the
Internet. Moreover, each stamp will contain a two-dimensional bar
code that will identify the kiosk where it was issued, a feature
that Crisp says will enable the Postal Service to quickly spot
bogus stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Crisp said 15 kiosks had been in operation in a Florida test for
three months, and ``they've vended hundreds of thousands of stamps,
far exceeding our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Neopost, IBM and the Postal Service had yet to
decide on the exact financial arrangements, and even on a schedule
for putting kiosks in other states. ``But I'd really love to see
this rolling out nationally this year,'' he said.

PATENTS COLUMN: ETHICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT PATENTING A HUMAN GENE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Finding a cure for people infected with the AIDS virus is an
ambitious goal, but even more far-reaching may be the drive to
create a vaccine that would keep people from getting the disease in
the first place. Human Genome Sciences, Inc., one of the companies
leading the international race to map the entire human genome, has
won a patent for a gene that might one day do both.
</P>
<P>
   While the gene has potential in the fight against AIDS, the
patent intensifies the debate over the propriety of patenting human
biology. It will be years before either the potential or the debate
is resolved, but in the meantime, news of the patent caused the
stock value of Human Genome to jump 21 percent in one day when the
patent was announced last month.
</P>
<P>
   Human Genome won the patent for a human gene that produces what
scientists believe is a receptor, or entry point, for the AIDS
virus into cells. Blocking that receptor might block AIDS from the
body and make transmission of the disease impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists know that some people are born without this receptor
gene, and that they appear immune to the AIDS virus. With years of
experimentation, researchers may be able to produce drugs to treat
AIDS from this newly patented gene, or they might be able to devise
a way to engineer everyone's genes so that everyone becomes immune
to HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Heady claims. But for all the research and expectations of the
last 20 years, so far the Food and Drug Administration has not yet
approved a single gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   That may be why William Haseltine, chairman and CEO of Human
Genome, goes to great lengths to establish the pedigree of his
company's latest patent. He describes the extensive hypotheses,
experiments and research that started in 1994. ``There's a lot of
concern going on for some time about gene patents, what they mean
and who gets them,'' Haseltine said. ``This patent is based on the
discovery of a new gene through sequencing that confirmed the
proposed utilities and gives basis for the claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene patents are categorized as chemical patents (as opposed to
general and mechanical, or electrical, the other two categories
established at the Patent and Trademark Office), and the government
has clear rules about what kind of genetic discoveries can win a
patent. But that doesn't mean the debate over gene patenting is
settled.
</P>
<P>
   Religious leaders, medical ethicists and scientists have argued
that the human genome belongs in the public domain and not in the
portfolios of private companies. Opponents of gene patenting worry
that commercial considerations might hamper medical or scientific
discovery, and there's alarm at the idea that one or two companies
could hold enough patents to make them the gatekeepers of the
biopharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the original head of the Human Genome Project at the
National Institutes of Health resigned in the early 1990s to
protest the issuing of patents for genes. Since then, the Project
has stepped up its research and is actively placing thousands of
genes it discovers into the public domain. The government's stated
goal is to make the sequence of human genes available for the
common good.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of gene patent applications are still pending,
however. Only a fraction have been issued, and none of those have
been tested or defended in court, but Human Genome continues to
amass patents. Headquartered just outside Washington, D.C., the
company now owns 112, one of the largest portfolios in the genomics
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine says that ``we do not use our patents to prevent
anyone in academics or the non-profit world from using these
materials for whatever they want, so long as it is not
commercial.'' Nevertheless, the company has licensing agreements
with U.S. Japanese, French and German drug companies that allows
some of the world's major pharmaceutical giants access to its
arsenal of patents.
</P>
<P>
   Since research is a commodity to bio-technology and drug
companies, many discoveries that might be crucial to the treatment
of disease are patented to protect investment.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, because of the overwhelming public interest in AIDS
research, the Patent and Trademark Office was pressured into
establishing a separate database for AIDS-related inventions in
1994, to give other scientists access to the cutting-edge research
in patents.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, searching through patent archives was a
specialized, time-consuming task. But now that the agency has put
much of its patent database on the Internet, anyone can track down
AIDS-related patents.
</P>
<P>
   The work of two scientists at Human Genome, Li Yi and Steven
Ruben, now joins that group. Their patent covers a gene known as
the CCR5 receptor gene. Receptors are found on the surface of
cells, much like pins sticking out of a pin cushion, and act as a
sort of docking port, sometimes for lethal viruses. But the
receptor and the virus have to match, like a key and a lock. CCR5
is known to fit the AIDS virus. The virus binds to the receptor,
then fuses to the cell, and fusion allows HIV to work its way
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for substances that use the cell lines and
methods described in the patent to find new anti-HIV drugs that
work by binding to CCR5 receptors and blocking them,'' said
Haseltine, who did pioneering work in sequencing the genome of HIV
at Harvard's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ``Think of it as a
blanket over the receptor. The virus must recognize special
structures on the surface of the cell. If it can't see them, it
can't get to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The CCR5 receptor is important because in 1996, researchers at
the National Institutes of Health discovered that the small number
of people who are missing that gene appear immune to the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The defect is ``present in about 5 percent of the population
originating from Northern Europe,'' Haseltine explained. ``There's
speculation that a previous viral epidemic was highly lethal and
those who survived had this natural variation that caused the
defect in the CCR5. It's not widely distributed in Asian or African
populations.''
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine hopes the patent could be used for research that will
create drugs to treat, cure and even prevent AIDS in the first
place. The latter might mean finding a therapy that healthy people
could adopt to block transmission of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might get long, slow-acting release forms of drugs, or
genetically engineer genes to create inhibitors,'' Haseltine said.
``You could protect people from this virus, same as a vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   Human Genome Sciences, Inc. (www.hgsi.com) received patent
6,025,154.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

ISRAEL VOTES TO WITHDRAW FROM SOUTHERN LEBANON, WITH OR WITHOUT
SYRIAN ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel's cabinet pledged Sunday to withdraw its
soldiers by July from the embattled strip of southern Lebanon that
they have occupied since 1982, preferably, but not necessarily, in
the context of an accord with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, adopted unanimously, gives extra teeth to the
solo promises of a withdrawal made in the last eight months by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who set ambitious deadlines when he took
office for securing regional peace on the Lebanese, Syrian and
Palestinian fronts.
</P>
<P>
   As an official statement of government policy, as opposed to
simply Barak's word, it stands particularly as a challenge to
Syria, which has used the Israeli presence to justify its support
of the Lebanese guerrillas who have waged a costly war of attrition
against the Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution stressed that the withdrawal would preferably
take place in the context of a peace agreement. If there is none,
it added, the cabinet will hold another discussion about how to
carry out the withdrawal. It did not specifically make the
withdrawal contingent on a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have cut today the Gordian knot between Syria and
Lebanon,'' said Haim Ramon, a cabinet member who is close to Barak.
``If the Syrians want to reach an agreement, and it is preferable
that an agreement be reached, good.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, he added, ``we will leave without an agreement, we will
bring the boys home, and we will defend the northern communities
from the international border with all of our might.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's negotiations with Syria have been stalled for nearly two
months, a period that saw a sharp rise in attacks by Syrian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister said Sunday that he could not predict whether
the pullout would take place under the umbrella of a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have contacts with the Americans,'' he told Israel 2
television. ``We do not have any contacts with the Syrians. I
cannot say that I know whether the talks will be renewed at all,
and therefore I certainly cannot say whether they will succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Barak's ministers have openly advocated a unilateral
pullout from southern Lebanon, with or without a peace treaty with
Syria. But the prime minister, clearly hoping to get a peace deal
in partial exchange for leaving Lebanon, has not gone so far in his
public statements.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli experts have said the Barak government believes that if
there is no agreement within the next two to three months, then
there will be no chance for one until well into next year, when a
new American president might be able to turn his attention to the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Israel invaded Lebanon to crush Palestinian guerrillas
who were attacking across the border. From 1982 on, Israeli leaders
argued that the impotence of the government in chaotic Lebanon
meant that they could secure their northern border only by
stationing troops inside Lebanon. A 9-mile-deep ``security zone''
was formally created in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The occupation has exacted a high price: From 1995 through 1999,
123 Israeli soldiers and one civilian have been killed in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Upon taking office on July 7, Barak set a deadline of one year
for bringing the troops home. While the prospect of leaving the
killing zone in southern Lebanon appeals to much of the Israeli
public, the cabinet did not start discussing it until this month.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a series of Hezbollah ambushes and bombings killed
seven Israeli soldiers in the zone within three weeks, prompting a
wave of retaliatory Israeli missile attacks that continued Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The recent surge in violence has led some Israeli military
officials to question whether they could withdraw in a diplomatic
vacuum without exposing Israeli civilians and soldiers to guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A pullout under the terms of an agreement with Syria, on the
other hand, would presumably mean that Syria would rein in
Hezbollah and provide security for the departing Israelis and their
Lebanese Christian allies.
</P>
<P>
   Arab officials have expressed similar misgivings about a
unilateral Israeli withdrawal that could invite Hezbollah attacks
on departing troops and deteriorate into another destabilizing
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, for instance, Prime Minister Selim al-Hoss of Lebanon
reacted with restrained enthusiasm Sunday to the cabinet vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish the pullout will take place in accordance with an
agreement,'' he said. ``But should Israel decide to withdraw
unilaterally, Lebanon would accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the grinding occupation of southern Lebanon has long
been unpopular and becomes even more so whenever young army
conscripts are killed or wounded. Opinion polls have indicated
recently that nearly two-thirds of Israelis would support a
withdrawal even without an accompanying peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of Barak's peace initiatives with Syria, among
them Ariel Sharon, have also pushed for a unilateral withdrawal
from southern Lebanon. Sharon, the chairman of the opposition Likud
Party and one of the architects of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon
18 years ago, said Sunday that a withdrawal should start now.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli experts have said the right wing reasons that if Syria
and Israel do reach a peace accord, Barak might well link it in a
public referendum to the troop withdrawal. Presented with the
choice, then, Israelis might well vote to accept peace with Syria,
even at the cost of giving up the Golan Heights, if getting the
soldiers home is the reward.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the domestic implications, an Israeli withdrawal from
southern Lebanon would shift the ground under many of the region's
political and military forces.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, for instance, established itself as a resistance
movement of Shiite Muslims fighting the Israeli occupation. But it
has since moved into the political arena in Lebanon and holds seats
in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Still, its military operations depend on Syria's acquiescence to
arms transfers from Iran. Syria has traditionally unleashed
Hezbollah, as it apparently did in recent weeks, to remind Israel
that it counts in the regional peace equation. Iran, too, has used
Hezbollah, mostly as a lever on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   If the Israelis are gone from Lebanon and Hezbollah's need for
arms is reduced, the role and the influence of its patrons may
lessen as well.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa,
predicted that unilateral withdrawal would be akin to Israel's
committing ``suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to pull out unilaterally, let them do that,'' he
said in an interview in the London-based Arabic daily Al Hayat.
``They will bear the consequences and should never use this
possibility as a means of pressure against us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CALIMESA, Calif. _ Simple white crosses and pinwheels spinning
quietly in the breeze mark the graves of 38 abandoned babies buried
in a cemetery here. Anonymous in death, the babies were given names
and proper funerals by a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of that stranger, Debi Faris, a mother of three from
Yucaipa, 80 miles east of Los Angeles, began over three years ago
when she heard the story of an infant found dead in a duffel bag
along a road in Los Angeles and wanted to give the baby a proper
burial.
</P>
<P>
   After making certain that Faris had no connection to the case,
the county coroner gave permission, and then asked if she would
take two others, who would otherwise be cremated, put in a
cardboard box and given a number.
</P>
<P>
   So began the Garden of Angels, a small burial area in a cemetery
in the shadows of the San Bernardino Mountains. There, Faris
started by buying 42 graves with $27,000 of her own money, burying
first Michael, abandoned on the roadway; Nathan, strangled by his
own umbilical cord and discovered in a trash bin, and Dora, 2,
whose body washed up on a Malibu beach.
</P>
<P>
   Now Faris, who had worked as a school instructional aide, has
become their advocate in another way: She is pushing for state
legislation to offer legal protection to parents who abandon their
babies in safe places.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really very overwhelming when you go to a coroner's
office. They bring you a child wrapped in plastic and you look in
their face,'' said Faris, whose own children are ages 22, 19 and
14. ``It's like `Oh, God, what can we do to make this stop?'''
</P>
<P>
   Across the United States, lawmakers and prosecutors are
beginning to ask that same question, weighing changes in laws that
they hope might reduce, if not eliminate, the number of infants
found dead each year after being abandoned. Although the laws vary
in their details, generally they would allow parents to avoid
prosecution for child abandonment if they left their babies in a
safe place. The laws are typically intended to protect infants.
</P>
<P>
   Texas enacted such a law in September, becoming the first state
to do so. The bill, which stipulates that leaving a baby in a
designated safe place can be used as a defense, was passed as
Houston was experiencing a rash of abandonments last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now 23 other states, including California, New York and New
Jersey, have proposed legislation, many of them since mid-January.
At the same time, district attorneys in Minnesota and Alabama are
declining to prosecute women who leave their babies with designated
officials like emergency-room personnel, and are sending the women
instead to social-service agencies for help.
</P>
<P>
   On the federal level, Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Houston, is
drafting legislation that proposes studying the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the efforts are applauded as well meaning. But
organizations like the Child Welfare League of America say more
information about the problem is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on in the mind of someone who puts a baby in a
Dumpster or throws their baby in the woods?'' said Joyce Johnson, a
spokeswoman for the league. ``We don't want to come off sounding as
though we don't care. We want to prevent it, but it leaves so many
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates for children say efforts should be focused on
providing options to women when they are pregnant. They worry that
bringing the law into the picture will drive these women further
from resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is it will actually cause girls to go to the
hospital less often, because they know the law is involved,'' said
Debbe Magnusen, founder of Project Cuddle, a California service
that operates an emergency telephone line intended to prevent
abandonment of babies.
</P>
<P>
   Only sketchy statistics exist on how many babies are abandoned
in public places each year. Relying on news media reports, the
Department of Health and Human Services determined that 65 babies,
eight of whom died, were left in public places in 1991. In 1998,
there were 105 such abandonments and 33 of the babies were found
dead.
</P>
<P>
   To give that number some context, officials noted that 22,000
babies were left in hospitals in 1991, many by drug-addicted or
HIV-infected mothers. The number increased to 31,000 in 1998.
Typically, babies recovered by the authorities are placed for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   But cases in which babies are found in trash bins or wrapped in
blankets outside hospitals tend to be highly publicized; for
example, the case in Delaware in which a young couple dumped their
newborn's body in a motel trash bin, and the case in New Jersey in
which a teen-ager gave birth in the bathroom at the senior prom,
wrapped the baby in plastic and then returned to the dance.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases it is clear that parents are not abandoning a live
child but discarding a dead one in a moment of panic, and the new
laws may not make much difference. But in other cases, officials
say, legal protection might encourage parents to take a few extra
steps and ensure their child's safety, helping to prevent cases
like the one in January in Indianapolis in which a newborn bundled
in blankets died before he was discovered near a hospital entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the legislation also point to abandonments in
Texas last year as examples of the need for action. From December
1998 to September 1999, 13 babies, three of whom died, were left in
various locations around Houston.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Texas law has had no obvious effect. In the first
four months of the law, nine babies were abandoned statewide, four
in Houston, none in compliance with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Unruh, the legislative assistant to state Rep. Geanie
Morrison, sponsor of the legislation, said efforts were under way
to better publicize the law and try to make it more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Williams-Mbengue, who has been tracking the legislation for
the National Conference of State Legislatures, said that although
the laws have the same purpose, they deal with specifics
differently.
</P>
<P>
   Under California's proposal, parents can avoid prosecution if
they give an unwanted newborn to certain law-enforcement or
social-services officials.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota goes into detail in the proposed legislation on what
the hospital can ask a mother and also provides numbered
identification bracelets to link the mother to the newborn if she
decides to return. It does not permit the mother to regain custody
on demand.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas grapples with how to implement its law, places like
Mobile County, Ala., and Dakota County, Minn., have gone ahead
without the benefit of legislation to establish programs in which
women who relinquish their babies in designated safe places are not
prosecuted.
</P>

<P>
   In November 1998, the district attorney in Mobile County started
``A Secret Safe Place for Newborns,'' a program that promised
confidentiality and no prosecution if the child was left at one of
four hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What motivated us as much as anything were not the children
that were abandoned, but the children that were murdered on the day
they were born,'' said John M. Tyson Jr., the Mobile County
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a case in which a mother and grandmother were
convicted of murder for drowning a newborn boy, whom they saw as an
embarrassment and an inconvenience because he was illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Five women have taken advantage of the Mobile program thus far.
In two cases, teen-agers _ 13 and 15 _ telephoned Jodi Brooks, a
television reporter who was instrumental in the creation of the
project. She persuaded the girls to tell their parents and referred
them to assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the other cases, Mobile officials say, two women quickly
handed over their babies, while another returned to take custody of
her child, and sought help in attending parenting classes and
finishing high school.
</P>
<P>
   Only one abandonment has been reported since the Mobile program
began _ a baby that sanitation workers found wrapped in a bag,
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand we promise confidentiality and no
prosecution,'' Tyson said. ``On the other hand, if you injure your
child, if you throw it into a Dumpster, we're going to prosecute
you every way we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Twyana Davis knows firsthand about the desperation of some young
mothers-to-be. At 19 she was pregnant and petrified of telling the
grandparents with whom she lived.
</P>
<P>
   She hid the pregnancy, until as a student at Ohio Dominican
College she found herself alone giving birth on the floor of her
dormitory room. Most of the students had left for Thanksgiving
break and she was soon to be picked up by an aunt.
</P>
<P>
   Scared, in pain and desperate, she eventually wrapped the baby
in layers of clothing and carried it to a trash bin outside the
dorm. She then called campus security and watched from her room as
the officer took the baby away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking to myself how was I going to bring this baby
home to my grandparents,'' Davis said. ``Their expectations for me
were very high. I didn't want to let them down.''
</P>
<P>
   But within a day, the police were knocking at her grandparents'
door, tracking down students from the dorm. She pleaded guilty to
child endangerment and served a year under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of her grandparents, she was able to reclaim
her baby daughter, now 4, and she has completed college.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to look back on what might have provided an alternative,
Davis said it probably would not have been knowing she could take
the baby somewhere without fear of prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been during the pregnancy being able to talk to
somebody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Magnusen on a talk show, Davis began volunteer
work for Project Cuddle. Magnusen said the group has helped nearly
200 women since the telephone line was put into service, and in
recent weeks, as the issue has been gaining prominence, the group
has taken on 225 new cases.
</P>
<P>
   In California, state Sen. James L. Brulte, a Republican who
developed legislation at Faris' urging, said the proposed
legislation was a starting point. He said he could envision a
public-private partnership that might be put into place using
efforts like Project Cuddle.
</P>
<P>
   The California legislation was presented in January, with
hearings possible within the next month, and if it passes, it would
most likely be enacted in July or August, Brulte said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, this month Faris is preparing to bury a 39th
baby. Her volunteer effort is expanding into a storefront in
Yucaipa, as she explores ways to reach women and their babies
earlier so there will be no need for the grave sites that stand
ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to see even one more child being buried,'' said Judy
Sturlaugson, a Garden of Angels volunteer who was helping paint the
new office. ``But what's really frightening is there are so many
out there we'll probably never know about.''

<P>
   SHANTOU, China _ From a small storefront in an old section of
this neon-laced seaside city, Zheng Jie has a unique way to
quantify the effect of China's current antismuggling campaign: He
counts snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Zheng, a snake broker, sells an aphrodisiac made with venomous
snakes, as well as live black slithering ones that restaurants use
in expensive stews. Two years ago the store sold 600 snakes a day.
Now it is lucky to offload 60. Employees have dwindled to seven
from 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snakes are something that businessman eat at banquets, but
ordinary people can't often afford,'' he said. ``So of course the
antismuggling campaign affects us locals, because smuggling is how
business is done here.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of tolerance, China is waging a desperate war on the
smuggling and corruption that have long helped to enrich the
country's prosperous southern provinces at the expense of central
government coffers.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where government campaigns often amount to
background noise, this campaign _ expected to be a central theme of
China's parliamentary session _ has clearly hit its mark.
Nationally, tariff income was up 80 percent last year. In Shantou
itself, the increase was nearly 500 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the antismuggling campaign, designed to increase revenues
and to clean up the government's badly tarnished image, has already
proved to be an exceedingly delicate balancing act, because
important regional economies are intertwined with smuggling, and
also because zealous pursuit of the crime often, embarrassingly,
ends up at the Communist Party's own door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party has the determination and the ability and the means
to punish corruption and excise this malignant tumor,'' said Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji, in a recent antismuggling speech, hammering on
what is expected to be a central theme of China's annual
parliamentary session this month.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Shantou, where the smuggling of diesel oil, cars,
cell phones, videodisk players and much more has long underpinned
the economy, there is a vast ripple effect when police get tough
with smugglers: Lime-green luxury flats sit empty on Jinsha Road,
taxi drivers queue for hours to get a fare, factories that used
cheap smuggled cloth now teeter on the brink of bankruptcy.
``Without smuggling there is no economy here,'' said a taxi driver
named Gao.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, as investigations drag on, the number of
senior government officials involved seems to grow. In Shantou, the
customs chief and numerous local officials were replaced last year.
In Xiamen, the government's about-to-be completed investigation of
a $10 billion smuggling ring has implicated the city's deputy party
secretary, the head of its customs office and the provincial police
chief, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign and Chinese experts estimate that half of all
Chinese customs officials in some areas are involved in smuggling,
and add that the corruption extends far up the chain of command.
They question whether Zhu will be able and willing to excise a
malignant tumor that lies so close to the country's economic and
political heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government says that the top priority is to crack down on
smuggling and corruption, that if we don't take measures the
economy and the state will collapse,'' said a senior researcher at
a government research organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you take measures that are too stringent, you run the
risk that the party will collapse,'' he said. ``And if it comes to
implicating senior leaders, the priority is to protect the party,
not the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the antismuggling campaign has reflected Zhu's
serious and uncompromising style.
</P>
<P>
   Whole teams of central government investigators descended on
suspected smuggling ports and set up shop in local hotels. The
boats from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau that had previously docked
freely at the many jetties and harbors that dot the coastline were
suddenly impounded. Midlevel customs officials were led away from
their desks, never to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party knows that it has to maintain political corruption
at a low level. Otherwise the people will lose confidence in the
government and the party will lose its legitimacy,'' said Zhang
Xiaojin, a political science professor at People's University.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1949, the Communist Party won widespread support through
its attacks on the corruption of China's pre-Communist ruling
party, the Kuomintang. But corruption _ which in coastal China
generally amounts to collusion with smugglers _ has grown steadily
during China's period of economic reforms, as the government has
progressively loosened controls on business.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the smuggling operations uncovered by the
recent investigations, as well as the role of local officials, has
shocked the central leaders, government researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-week period in February 1999, the police in a small
port city called Lufeng seized 761 crates of cigarettes and 100
tons of diesel oil, reported Guangdong Province's Communist Party
newspaper, the Southern Daily.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to overstate the degree to which smuggling had
integrated itself into the southern coast's economic life _ a
reliance that is now mostly visible in relief, since smuggling has
been curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Chiwei Road that goes between Puning and Lufeng
in Guangdong was one 30-mile outdoor market, dotted with shacks
selling ``imported'' Suzuki motor scooters, Mercedes cars, bolts of
fabric and Sony television sets.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they are mostly shuttered and those remaining are
impossibly forlorn, selling snacks, bottled water and a few
battered second-hand goods, another sign of the region's hard
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is terrible,'' said Li Yanchang, sipping tea in dirty
pajamas in a stall devoid of both customers and products. ``Now to
sell imported goods you have to pay all sorts of taxes and fees. A
few are still coming in on boats, but I don't dare display them
because of the crackdown.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Li said he used to make several major sales a day for the
equivalent of about $250, but now goes weeks without a sale. He
added that today there is less economic incentive for smugglers to
resist the ban, since Chinese consumers have become increasingly
willing to buy domestic products, whose quality has improved as
their prices have gone down. Domestic videodisk players cost less
than $100.
</P>
<P>
   Economic hardship has also trickled down to those who have
always made an honest living, affecting them in countless ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, people had lots more money to buy, now there's no
money around,'' said Shen Yuexun, sitting in his small deserted
store selling household wares and plastic goods in Lufeng, long
known as a smuggling haven. ``Migrant workers no longer come here
for jobs. People have left to look for work. Some of the really
rich have moved to Macau.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the small chairs and wash basins that are
the backbone of Shen's business are made at a local factory, which
has long used cheap smuggled plastic. After the smuggling
crackdown, the price of plastic increased sharply, he said, and he
has raised his prices about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They should be higher still, but ``if I push prices up I'll have
no business at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He has started to sew suits at home to bring in money and is
looking for other work, but has little hope for a local revival,
noting that the area has been so closely tied to smuggling that it
will be hard to attract legitimate investment, even with recent
changes in local political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In Lufeng, 11 of 20 township party secretaries were removed from
their jobs in 1999, according to the Southern Daily. The Guangdong
Party Committee on Discipline Inspection announced last month that
in 1999 it had penalized 4,505 officials for corruption last year
in 4,199 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really going after midlevel people,'' said an
official. ``People are being yanked away from their desk, and never
seen again.''
</P>
<P>
   On a larger scale, economists say the effect of the
antismuggling campaign can be gauged by the wild fluctuations in
prices and revenues associated with formerly smuggled goods over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the price of diesel oil rose by more than 20
percent in the second half of 1999, to about $350 a ton. According
to government statistics, imports shot up more than 20 percent, at
a time when economic growth was slowing, and imports were deemed
likely to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to believe that the vast majority of this reflects a
switch of goods from the black market to the white market,'' said a
western diplomat in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a number have decided to go legit,'' he said. ``They
had goods waiting to come in, and when they saw the crackdown was
not going to go away in three months like previous efforts, they
decided they couldn't wait any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for the first time in recent history, China's central
government revenues rose as a percentage of gross national product.
China had been the only country in the world where this percentage
was falling.
</P>
<P>
   Although some experts believe that money that once went into
officials' pockets may now be channeled into, say, hospitals or
schools, many Chinese _ and scholars in and out of China _ remain
somewhat skeptical that the government will be able to sustain the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When the wife of Beijing Party Secretary Jia Qingling was about
to be implicated in the Xiamen scandal in January, government Web
sites took the extraordinary step of issuing denials on her behalf,
even though the scandal has not been reported in the Chinese press;
most Chinese learned about it from Hong Kong-based Internet sites.
Many well-placed Chinese believe that Jia's wife, who used to run a
huge import-export company in Fujian, was spared because of her
husband's close ties to President Jiang Zemin. They remain
convinced that she was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, residents of coastal Guangdong laughed when they
recently heard that the deputy party chief of impoverished Jiangxi
Province had been sentenced to death for taking $600,000 in bribes.
``That would be just a little dessert for leaders here,'' a local
businessman said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it may be difficult to pursue each and every case in a
country where questionable business practices are so widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like me think that corruption is now very serious, even
worse than under the Nationalists,'' a researcher at a government
research center said, referring to China's pre-Communist
government. ``But it's going to be hard to pursue because nine out
of 10 top leaders have some close relative whose business dealings
might look OK on the surface but would prove illegal if someone
looked at them closely.''

 &HT;    BRADLEY SAYS HE WOULD NOT SERVE AS GORE'S RUNNING MATE
 &HT;    By KEN FOSKETT and SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With this presidential hopes hanging by a thread,
Democrat Bill Bradley said Sunday that were ``no circumstances''
under which he would consider serving as Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running for president of the United States,'' Bradley said
on NBC's Meet the Press. ``I think my ability matches the national
moment, and therefore that's where I'm investing all of my energies
and all of my time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, nonetheless, reiterated that he would support Gore if
he became the Democratic nominee. But he stopped short of saying
that he would back away from some of the accusations that he has
leveled at the vice president in the course of their sometimes
acrimonious nominating contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley again asserted Sunday that Gore had misrepresented both
his own record and Bradley's during the campaign. And he said
Gore's involvement in some of the Democratic Party's fundraising
scandals on 1996 could hurt him and the Democrats in the fall
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What Gore knew about a 1996 fundraiser at a Buddhist temple in
California would be something that Republicans would use against
him in the fall, Bradley said. ``I think that will remain an issue
until it's fully explained,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Meet the Press host Tim Russert if he would back away
from those comments if he were to end up campaigning for Gore,
Bradley said: ``Well, you know, I think you end up standing where
you have stood, and so I'm going to say what I think at the time. I
would, as I said, support him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore on Sunday said he had learned from the controversy over the
Buddhist temple fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake and I think the importance of making a
mistake is what you learn from it,'' he told reporters. ``And what
I learned from it was the need for campaign finance reform. I
strongly supported campaign finance reform in the past. I support
it even more strongly today.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Cranston, Rhode Island Sunday night, Gore
suggested that any primary victories by Texas Gov. George Bush on
Tuesday will be tainted by $2.5 million spent by a Bush supporter
on behalf of the GOP presidential frontrunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gov. Bush defeats John McCain in some of these contests on
Tuesday, this will raise serious questions about whether he did so
fair and square,'' Gore said during a visit at a senior center.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was referring to television commercials that aired in New
York and other primary states that were financed by wealthy Dallas
investor Sam Wyly. The ads praised Bush's environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly, who supports alternative energy sources, has denied the
ads represented ``soft money'' expenditures. He insists he did not
coordinate them with the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, ``We knew that Gov. Bush was in the hip pocket of the
special interests. Now we find out what deep pockets that is _ $2.5
million all of a sudden flooding into these contests.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that he, Democratic challenger Bill Bradley and GOP
challenger John McCain all support a ban on soft money as part of
reforming campaign financing. He said banning soft money would
``elevate'' political debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Sunday that he thought the negativity of the
campaign has ``calmed down'' in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged that he has eased up on Bradley. In recent
weeks, the vice president has stopped mentioning Bradley in stump
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said that didn't mean he had sewn up the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that his tone changed in the last several days with
far less of the attacks that have become commonplace and I wanted
to reciprocate,'' Gore told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley returned to New York Sunday night after a whirlwind
schedule that took him to his native Missouri Saturday evening and
Maryland and Ohio on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In at least a sentimental blow to his struggling campaign, The
New York Times on Sunday endorsed Gore for the nomination. Bradley
played ten years for the New York Knicks and served for 18 years as
senator in neighboring New Jersey. New York state and New York City
were almost home to Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The Times editorial praised Bradley for a ``promising start,''
but faulted his ``lack of energy'' in conveying his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If overeagerness to please is a defect in Mr. Gore. Mr.
Bradley possesses an even more disturbing inability to convey a
real hunger for the opportunity to serve,'' the Times wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley disputed the criticism Sunday when asked about it on
ABC's ``This Week with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 14 months ... I've been out crossing this country
14 to18 hours a day, listening to people, talking to people,''
Bradley said. ``I don't think anybody could have worked harder, I
don't think anybody could have fought stronger.''

 &UR; TRIALS  &LR; _ Nancy Schroeder sounds matter-of-fact as she describes
her cancer prognosis as ``terminal.'' But these days, the
59-year-old Fresno woman is simply grateful that, for now, an
experimental cancer therapy seems to have restored the speaking
ability that brain cancer threatened to destroy.

laying the groundwork for a counterattack on the handheld computer

   Microsoft's not-so-secret weapon will be a new generation of
products it calls the ``Pocket PC.'' Slated to hit the market next

   That was years ago. Doctors treated her cancer aggressively and,
thankfully, it hasn't returned. My mother, mother-in-law and
several close friends could tell the same story.

<P>
   But not everyone discovers the disease in time for today's
therapies to give them a fighting chance.
</P>
<P>
   It is these people who make up the ranks of clinical trial
volunteers. It is unethical to withhold a proven medicine to test
whether an experimental drug might work better. Their participating

DOCTORS AND PATIENTS SAY THE INTERNET HAS CHANGED THEIR
RELATIONSHIPS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Victoria Schlesinger had a puzzling rash on her face,
so she visited her doctor to ask what it was. The doctor told her
she might have lupus, but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Let's not talk about it until we know,'''
Schlesinger said, a remark that only served to terrify her. ``I
walked out of there thinking, `This can't be good.'''
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger, 31, the chief counsel for the Teligent
communications company in Vienna, Va., had never heard of lupus and
was too intimidated to press her doctor for more information. But,
like more and more patients in recent years, she also knew she had
another resource. She went to her computer, typed in ``lupus'' and
clicked.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites that popped up were unsparing in their details
about the disease, which is caused when the body's immune system
attacks a patient's tissues and organs. While lupus can range from
very mild to life threatening, Schlesinger found descriptions that
emphasized the grim outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you, I was pretty shocked,'' Schlesinger said. ``I
looked up this thing they thought I had and I saw things like,
`survival rates.'''
</P>
<P>
   She turned out not to have the disease. But partly because of
her doctor's dismissive remarks, she also ended up changing
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, doctors and patients say the Internet has
profoundly changed their relationships. With an estimated 100,000
medical Web sites, patients can look up any disease, drug or
medical condition in seconds. When a doctor so much as mentions a
possible diagnosis, many patients rush to their computers to learn
more about it. When a doctor suggests a drug, patients go online to
find its side effects. And when they arrive at their doctor's
office, more and more patients are bearing pages of information
printed from Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a massive revolution,'' said Dr. Rita Charon, a
specialist in internal medicine at Columbia University's College of
Physicians and Surgeons. ``It altogether shifts what goes on when a
patient comes in with pages of downloaded stuff and half the time
the doctor looking at it has never seen it before. There's a whole
new set of emotions present.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is complicated by time constraints on doctors who
are part of managed care groups, said Prof. E. Haavi Morreim, an
ethicist at the University of Tennessee College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of patients come in with this sheaf of papers,'' Morreim
said. ``A lot of it may be completely irrelevant, or it may be bad
information _ who knows what you're getting off the Net. Now the
physician has to spend a lot of time sifting through this stuff and
explaining. The physician either resents spending the time or truly
doesn't have the time. Then the patient may feel he is being given
short shrift.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas R. Reardon, a general practitioner from Portland,
Ore., who is president of the American Medical Association, said
that while ``we do support patients having access to good,
reliable, information,'' the problem is that the information on the
Internet varies from sound to irresponsible. ``Right now, anybody
can put anything on the Internet,'' Reardon said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement the medical association warns, ``The AMA is
greatly concerned that a substantial proportion of information on
the Internet might be inaccurate, erroneous, misleading or
fraudulent and thereby pose a threat to public health.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Reardon said, doctors are going to have to adjust.
``I think this is the wave of the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites include those sponsored by responsible groups like the
National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association as
well as ones run by purveyors of herbs and supplements or of
unproven treatments like coffee enemas for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   They include sites put up by hospitals and medical centers
looking for business and by individual doctors, some of whom
provide links to articles in medical journals and others who say
they have secret cures. They also include countless chat rooms for
patients, their families and the worried. More sites are added each
day, like one to be available soon run by a company formed by the
American Medical Association and six doctors associations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As Schlesinger discovered, those who search for medical
information soon find themselves buried in it. And some find
themselves duped, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   Some fields, like plastic surgery, are almost magnets for
misinformation, doctors said. ``There is so much plastic surgery on
the Net,'' said Dr. I. Kelman Cohen, a plastic surgeon at the
Medical College of Virginia of Virginia Commonwealth University in
Richmond. ``Look younger, look beautiful, have a peel at lunch and
go out shopping in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   One highly educated woman went to see a doctor who advertises
widely on the Internet that he does plastic surgery. The man is
actually an oral surgeon, Cohen noted. ``He says he is board
certified, but he doesn't say in what,'' Cohen said. The woman
wanted plastic surgery for her eyelids. Cohen said she ended up
needing a skin graft from his group to repair the operation by the
oral surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many patients check out the Internet before they go to their
doctors, deciding sometimes what they think their condition is or
what drugs they need or what drugs they would refuse to take.
Doctors can be taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some doctors deal well with it, some don't,'' Reardon said.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors make no pretense of being interested in the
Internet data of their patients. Dr. Albert Kligman, a dermatology
professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, says he
knows what is about to happen when he sees a patient carrying in a
pile of printouts from Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `Doctor, I have a few questions,''' Kligman said.
``Then they take out about 200 of them. I tell them: `I only have
12 minutes. I can examine you or I can answer your questions. Make
up your mind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other doctors say that even though they may become frustrated
when patients look up every symptom, every diagnosis, every medical
test and every drug on the Internet, the information can sometimes
do more good than harm.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Lockshin, a rheumatologist at the Hospital for
Special Surgery in Manhattan, said: ``I've had a bunch of people
say, `I've been chasing down my symptoms, and this is what I think
it is, and my doctor hasn't paid attention to me.' About 50 percent
of the time when I see patients like that, they're correct.''
</P>
<P>
   But more often doctors say they are peeved by the new demands
being placed on them, frustrated in their efforts to convince
patients that a prescription drug is not a poison or that a new
treatment detailed on the Internet is not proven and annoyed when
patients tend to believe that the information from the Web is right
and their doctor is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they take a drug and they have a lousy response to it, they
will go to a Web page that says it's a poison,'' said Dr. Alan
DeCherney, an infertility expert at the University of California in
Los Angeles. ``You send them to the reputable pages, but they don't
want that. They don't listen because it's not what they want to
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some patients and their families, however, tell a different
story.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Goldstein, legal recruiter for the McCormick Group in
Arlington Va., said the Internet was the first place she turned
when doctors diagnosed a brain tumor in her mother last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeding in keywords as fast as I could,'' Goldstein
said. It was terrifying, at first, she said, adding: ``Everything
you read says, `prognosis very poor,' `traditional protocols
showing little effect.'''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, when her mother's biopsy results came back,
Goldstein at least knew what they meant, and she was able to focus
her Internet research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't take me quite as much by storm,'' she said. ``I
think you get panicky when you don't understand.'' Her father,
Goldstein said, ``wanted to defer to the doctor's expertise, but
that really wasn't sufficient for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with her Internet research, she said, she peppered her
father with questions: ``Why did the doctor choose this over that?
I know there are these five protocols. Why aren't they doing a
different surgery? Why why why why why?'' She also questioned
doctors she found on the Internet. ``I go to doctors online to sort
of hone the information I have read,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   She stayed in touch with relatives of other brain cancer
patients through Internet chat groups, finding their experience and
expertise immeasurably helpful.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Flanagan, a 35-year-old lupus patient in Manhattan, said
she regularly went to the Internet to learn about her disease and
to share experiences with others who were taking the same drugs and
who, like Flanagan, had a particularly severe form of lupus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the medications we take have horrible side effects,''
Flanagan said. ``It's nice to be able to chat with someone else who
has it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Others say they turn to the Internet to learn what their medical
test results mean. When John Franz, a 42-year-old engineer who
lives in Moorestown, N.J., discovered that he had an unusual
pattern of blood cholesterol, he immediately turned to the
Internet. He went to his doctor to discuss his research, but Franz
said, ``He didn't think it was important.'' So Franz changed
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients now have an active role,'' Franz said. ``With managed
care you almost have to. It's up to you now, and if the doctor's
not going to support that, you don't have to be involved with
them.''

 Bay Area biotech firms advance cancer research  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Nancy Schroeder sounds matter-of-fact as she describes her cancer
prognosis as ``terminal.'' But these days, the 59-year-old Fresno
woman is simply grateful that, for now, an experimental cancer
therapy seems to have restored the speaking ability that brain
cancer threatened to destroy.
<P>
   ``I understood what I was supposed to say, but it wasn't coming
out,'' said Schroeder, who recently underwent a 10-day regime of
radiation therapy augmented by doses of an experimental drug to
help shrink the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Given the nature of her cancer, Schroeder wasn't expecting a
cure. She was simply hoping to slow the symptoms of decline.
Indeed, within days, her speech improved, and her doctors told her
the experiment ``could give me another whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearly 30 years since former President Richard Nixon declared
war on the disease, new discoveries are helping to detect and halt
early-stage cancers and prolong life or ease suffering in advanced
cases. But few researchers nowadays are so bold as to talk about a
cure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, cancer remains the most common target of clinical trials
in the United States. Of 305 human experiments conducted in the
United States last year, 1 out of 4, or 78, tested cancer
treatments, according to Ernst &AMP; Young. Bay Area biotech firms ran
more than half of all U.S. cancer-drug experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The process of getting a drug to market is long and arduous,
beginning with safety tests in animals, followed by two more rounds
of safety tests in humans before prospective drugs pass the third
and final phase of testing _ and the manufacturers ask the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration to reward their efforts by approving
the drug for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Here are four vignettes about experimental cancer drugs being
tested by Bay Area firms. Pharmacyclics Inc. and Matrix
Pharmaceutical hope to augment the power of radiation and
chemotherapy. Onyx Pharmaceuticals and Cell Genesys are testing
novel additions to the cancer-fighting arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   All four firms have something in common with the many other
companies fighting cancer. They're all looking for ways to
selectively destroy tumors with minimal harm to healthy organs. And
they're all aware that their work could take years.
</P>
<P>
   As Richard Miller, president of Sunnyvale's Pharmacyclics, said,
developing cancer drugs is a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's experimental drug had its genesis in the mid-1970s,
when Miller was an oncologist at Stanford University. His patients
included chemistry researcher Jonathan Sessler. While treating
Sessler for Hodgkin's disease, Miller learned that the chemist was
interested in a family of molecules called porphyrins. cq &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Porphyrins are doughnut-shaped molecules that have a metal
atom where the hole would be. They are catalysts, chemical agents
that transfer energy. The metal atom dictates the work they do. The
magnesium atom in chlorophyll aids photosynthesis. The iron atom in
hemoglobin carries oxygen in the blood. Sessler, the chemist, knew
all that.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the oncologist, knew something else about porphyrins.
They accumulated in tumors. It wasn't clear why but, being
scientists, both the doctor and the patient puzzled over the
possible cause _ and wondered whether these energetic molecules had
cancer-fighting potential.
</P>
<P>
   Years passed. Sessler beat his Hodgkin's. And though the two men
went their separate ways, Sessler into academia and Miller into
biotech, they stayed in touch and traded ideas about porphyrins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, they founded Pharmacyclics on the idea that
porphyrin-based drugs could augment the cancer-fighting power of
radiation therapy.
</P>
<P>
   As Miller explained, radiation therapy splits water molecules _
and most of our bodies is are  &LR; water _ into charged particles.
These ions wreak havoc inside cells and can ultimately kill them.
</P>
<P>
   But radiation is indiscriminate. It hits healthy as well as
cancerous cells. Oncologists have to deliver a dose high enough to
kill cancer cells, but low enough so that healthy cells can recover
from the bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacyclics is trying to accentuate the damage inside the
cancer zone, using a porphyrin named Xcytrin that Sessler built
from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of this molecular doughnut, the chemist placed an
atom of gadolinium, a rare magnetic element. The magnetic core had
two advantages.
</P>
<P>
   First, being magnetic, it was visible in MRI scans of trial
patients, confirming that Xcytrin found its way to tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porphyrins take up electrons from one chemical and give them
to another, that's what they do for a living,'' Miller said. Tumor
cells divide rapidly, burning energy in the process. To Xcytrin,
they are where the action is.
</P>
<P>
   The magnetic core in Xcytrin wasn't simply there to look pretty
in MRI scans. Inside a cell bombarded with radiation, with water
ions zinging about, gadolinium was supposed to add to the chaos _
like tossing a magnet into a pinball machine.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that's the theory. Pharmacyclics is midway through a
comparative study of 425 patients with brain cancer. Half will get
radiation plus an intravenous dose of Xcytrin. The rest will get
only radiation.
</P>
<P>
   In a year or so, the FDA will consider whether Xcytrin patients
lived longer than those who were simply irradiated. Only then will
we know whether the 20-year-old brainstorm will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Chemotherapy is a perfect example of the cure that's nearly as
bad as the disease. It was after World War I that doctors first
noticed that mustard gas seemed to be most deadly in organs, like
skin, where cells divided rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Because Since  &LR; cancer is a condition of runaway cell growth,
doctors began looking for poisons that would kill rapidly dividing
cells. In time, they hit upon cisplatin. It contains platinum atoms
that stick to strands of DNA, throwing a monkey - &LR; wrench into the
cell's reproductive machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Because chemotherapy is generally administered intravenously,
the poison flows through the bloodstream, killing not just cancer
cells, but hair cells, taste buds, gut linings and other normal
tissues that also divide frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Leavitt, medical director at Fremont's -based &LR;   &LR; Matrix,
said his company is trying to create a new formulation of cisplatin
that could be injected right into a tumor _ and stay there _ so it
could kill cancer cells with fewer side effects than chemo
administered intravenously.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish this, Matrix is testing an experimental drug
called IntraDose. Stanford cancer researcher Dennis Brown and
biotech scientist Ed Luck came up with the idea, in 1985, of
combining cisplatin with collagen, a natural protein that forms a
matrix inside skin, muscle and other flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gristle in meat is collagen,'' Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the cisplatin would be held in the collagen. Together
they would be injected into the tumor, where the collagen would
form its natural matrix, keeping the poison near the tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   Matrix has added a third chemical to the mix _ epinephrine. It
constricts the blood vessels around the site of the injection,
further limiting the chance that cisplatin will escape into the
bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Matrix is close to completing two Phase III trials looking
at 183 patients who have advanced head and neck cancer. The
subjects have already taken intravenous chemotherapy, only to have
their cancers return. With no real treatment options left, they
often have less than six months to live.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt said two-thirds of the patients will get six weekly
shots of IntraDose, straight into the tumor. The rest will get a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Matrix will compare the two groups. In patients who get
IntraDose, tumors should shrink in size. Tumor shrinkage should
relieve the pain and discomfort caused by the cancer. If the data
bear this out, Matrix will seek FDA approval to sell a drug first
conceived 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Frank McCormick, a biotech researcher since the early days of
Cetus Corp., was toiling away at Chiron in the early 1990s when he
had the brainstorm that led him to form Richmond's -based &LR;   &LR; Onyx.
</P>
<P>
   His idea revolved around a gene known as p-53cq &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Think of p-53 as the judge, jury and executioner of wayward
cells. If a cell begin to mutate and grow in a cancerous fashion,
p-53 is supposed to kill it. Since the late 1970s, scientists have
know that successful cancers somehow manage to inactivate p-53.
</P>
<P>
   Cancers aren't the only bad actors that turn off this cellular
self-destruct system. Since the 1980s, scientists have known that
adenovirus _ the bug that causes colds _ also deactivates turns off
 &LR; p-53. When adenovirus invades a cell, it turns off p-53, then
inserts itself into the cell's DNA. The virus uses the cell's
reproductive machinery to produce so many copies of itself that it
eventually explodes the cell from the inside out _ showering the
body with new viral particles to infect other cells.
</P>
<P>
   All that was old hat. But McCormick had a new idea. Say he could
snip out the portion of the adenovirus that turned off p-53. If
such a neutered virus entered a normal cell, p-53 would clobber it,
no harm done.
</P>
<P>
   But if this special virus invaded a cancer cell _ which had
already inactivated p-53 _ it would run wild, taking over the
cell's DNA, reproducing itself and exploding the tumor from within
_ showering the adjoining tumor cells with the neutered virus
capable of invading and killing them.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the tame virus would fight the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, McCormick formed Onyx to pursue this strategy.
McCormick has since left the firm to head cancer research at the
University of California at San Francisco, leaving veteran biotech
executive Hollings Renton to shepherd this p-53-based drug through
the clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Onyx is poised to start Phase III trials in Europe and the
United States. With backing from drugmaker Warner-Lambert, Onyx
will recruit 290 patients with head and neck tumors. Some will get
intravenous chemotherapy. Others will get chemo plus the Onyx
injection _ a vial of tame virus particles shot straight into the
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Those tests will take well over a year. Until the results are
in, all Onyx can do is take pride in its speedy progress _ from
idea to pivotal trial in  &LR; only  &LR; seven years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the marvels of the human body is its backup systems.
Cancers that evade p-53 must still contend with the T cells and B
cells of the immune system. They roam the body on
search-and-destroy missions, looking for infectious organisms and
mutated cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have cancer, the immune system isn't doing its job,''
said Steve Sherwin, chief executive of Cell Genesys in Foster City.
</P>
<P>
   Yet cancers manage to trick the immune system into treating them
as normal. Cell Genesys is developing cancer vaccines that aim to
teach the body how to recognize cancer cells for the danger they
present.
</P>
<P>
   It hopes to accomplish this by taking tumor cells _ it is
furthest along on prostate cancer _ and treating them in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, it adds a gene to the tumor cells. The gene produces a
hormone that stimulates the production of immune cells. Then
scientists hit these altered cells with enough radiation to prevent
them from replicating, but not enough to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   In Phase II clinical trials, Cell Genesys has injected these
treated cancer cells under the skin of prostate cancer patients.
Subjects get booster shots every other week for six months. These
tame tumor cells are supposed to emit hormones thatattract immune
cells.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, these hormones will alert the immune system to create
antibodies and killer T t- &LR; cells that will attack not only the
injected cells, but the indigenous tumor cells that had previously
escaped detection.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good strategy, but the current trials are only testing
vaccine safety at various dosage levels. Sometime next year, Cell
Genesys hopes to pass that hurdle and ask the FDA for permission to
begin a Phase III test.
</P>
<P>
   So even under the best of circumstances, it would be several
years before Cell Genesys could hope to sell an experimental
vaccine that has been in the works for about seven years so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I've learned,'' said Sherwin, who has been
in biotech since he left the National Institutes of Health to join
Genentech in 1983, ``is that when you're patient, the rewards can
be immense.''

 SF CHRON   A Thank You to the Volunteers Who Step Up for Clinical Trials 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
I remember the day my friend JoAnn told me she had breast cancer.
She was chopping carrots in her kitchen, when she mentioned it
matter-of-factly, brushing the carrots off the cutting board into
the salad.
<P>
   That was years ago. Doctors treated her cancer aggressively and,
thankfully, it hasn't returned. My mother, mother-in-law and
several close friends could tell the same story.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone discovers the disease in time for today's
therapies to give them a fighting chance.
</P>
<P>
   It is these people who make up the ranks of clinical trial
volunteers. It is unethical to withhold a proven medicine to test
whether an experimental drug might work better.
</P>
<P>
   So physicians must find patients who have already undergone
unsuccessful surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, and ask them to
be test subjects, even though the doctors cannot hold out much hope
of a cure.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough sell. But the volunteers I've spoken to are
generally upbeat about their decisions. ``I really believe in
this,'' said Nancy Schroeder, a cancer trial volunteer living in
Fresno. ``When you're under a research program, they monitor you
closely. You really get top care.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Cancer Institute has made clinical trials easy to
find on the Web at cancertrials.nci.nih.gov.  &LR; cq
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  More information can be found in a book by science writer
Robert Finn, ``Cancer Clinical Trials: Experimental Treatments &AMP;
How They Can Help You'' ($14.95 softcover).
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, their participating in a trial is a gift to the
rest of us. To Nancy and the many people like her _ thanks!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THIRD WORLD VACCINES &QL; 
Pharmaceutical and biotech executives met President Clinton last
week and made a substantial down payment toward the goal of making
vaccines widely available in the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   Merck, American Home Products, SmithKline Beecham and Aventis
Pharma all pledged substantial donations of free medicines. Merck
will donate $100 million worth of its Hepatitis B vaccine.
SmithKline said it will expand its malaria vaccine research and
renewed its pledge to donate $1 billion to help fight
elephantiasis, a parasitic disease that enlarges the arms, legs and
breasts and afflicts 120 million people in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area biotech executives Donald Francis of VaxGen and Sean
Lance of Chiron helped brief the president on the results of a
recent workshop _ led by Richard Feachem of the Institute for
Global Health in San Francisco _ which came up with proposals to
stimulate vaccine development. (Bioscope, February 21).
</P>
<P>
   Some of these ideas have been incorporated into the Vaccines for
the New Millennium Act, introduced last week cq  &LR; by San Francisco
Rep. Nancy Pelosi. The new bill updates similar legislation Pelosi
introduced last year (Bioscope, April 5, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_THE QUIET GAME: &QL; 
Firms raising money on Wall Street are supposed to observe a
``quiet period'' during which they refrain from statements that
might be construed as touting the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Companies interpret this requirement quite differently, as is
evident by watching two Bay Area biotech firms play the quiet game.
</P>
<P>
   First, realize that at the moment, biotech is so hot that all a
company has to do is whisper ``genome'' and Wall Street will shower
it with money.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, I called Lou Lange, chief executive of CV
Therapeutics in Palo Alto late one Friday afternoon, to express
interest in profiling one of his drugs. Great, Lange said, call
next week, and we'll get going.
</P>
<P>
   But when I called back, public relations guy Chris Chai said the
company wasn't interested in talking, and when I asked him to
explain the sudden change, he promised that all would be clear in a
few days.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, after CV Therapeutics announced plans to raise $175
million, Chai called back to explain that company lawyers had told
him to avoid any publicity during the quiet period.
</P>
<P>
   At roughly the same time, Avigen Inc. of Alameda filed plans to
sell 4 million additional shares. Avigen is conducting an early
human trial of an experimental gene therapy for hemophilia. Its
goal is to restore at least some blood clotting ability &LR;   &LR; capacity
to people who bleed uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I wrote about this was after a scientific meeting
in December, when Avigen revealed that the first three patients in
its experiment had produced some clotting chemicals _ without
specifying exactly how much.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the scientists working with Avigen published a
scientific paper with more details. Most press accounts glossed
over the details, portraying the experiment as a potential cure for
hemophilia. Dow Jones put Avigen on its ``hot stocks to watch
list.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE STOCK DID WHAT? &QL; 
I would think that when Avigen officials announced their stock
offering in February, they knew the scientific paper would give
them some timely publicity. (I phoned to check out this supposition
but didn't get a call back.) The stock jumped from $60 to $80 in
the two days before the scientific article appeared, and enjoyed a
little bump after publication. Avigen lost six points Friday, to
close at $76.94.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Avigen violated any quiet period guidelines. There
aren't any.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no specific rules on what people can say or when
they can say it,'' said Securities and Exchange Commission
spokesman John Heine.
</P>
<P>
   How companies behave depends on common sense and the advice of
their lawyers, said Joe Grundfest, an expert on securities law at
Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are permitted to go about their standard business in
the standard way,'' Grundfest said. ``You don't stop announcing the
results of research.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Avigen didn't even announce the results. That was done
by the university scientists conducting the study. This is the
quiet period philosophy of ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, who let
Charlie McCarthy do his talking.
</P>
<P>
   One last point about the Avigen experiment that got lost in all
the quiet _ just how much clotting factor did the patients produce?
</P>
<P>
   I didn't see that detail in the press release issued by
Stanford, where some of the experiments are being done. But
Stanford professor Mark Kay, who conducted some of the trials and
holds stock in Avigen, told me one patient produced almost 1
percent of the normal level. Another produced something less than 1
percent, and the third was too tough to measure.
</P>
<P>
   The mere fact that any clotting factor was produced is
noteworthy. But how much is enough? In earlier briefings, Kay had
told me something between 2.5 percent and 5 percent would be
needed. Now, he says, observing these patients makes him think that
even a 1 percent change could make a dramatic difference in the
lives of hemophiliacs.
</P>
<P>
   The first three patients took a low dose of the gene therapy.
The next three patients will get three times as much. Will that
boost the clotting factor production threefold? We'll have to see.

 Sun Microsystems Makes A Wish on StarOffice Software  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
At first glance, StarOffice looks like a case of Sun Microsystems
trying to beat Microsoft at its own game.
<P>
   Dig a little deeper, though, and you'll find that Sun believes
its free, downloadable office software, and an upcoming portal that
lets workers tap into their company network from any
Internet-connected computer, will do no less than revolutionize the
way the world computes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're changing the rules of the environment,'' said Marco
Boerries, vice president and general manager of Sun's Web-based
appliances. ``It's not only about dot-comming the business model,
but about dot-comming the software.''
</P>
<P>
   With interest running high in application service providers
(ASP), or firms that sell and distribute software via the Net, and
so-called network computers, which rely on hosted applications, it
seems Sun's mantra ``The network is the computer'' is catching on.
</P>
<P>
   But on both fronts _ the assault on Microsoft and dot-comming
the office software market _ Sun and StarOffice have a long way to
go. Part of the problem is infrastructure; the other is Microsoft's
commanding lead in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boerries sold his Fremont Star Division software firm
to Sun Microsystems for about $75 million, in what many called a
direct attack on Microsoft's stranglehold on the corporate desktop.
With Sun's marketing muscle behind it, StarOffice's suite of
presentation, word processing, e-mail, calendar and spreadsheet
applications has been downloaded almost 2 million times.
</P>
<P>
   That trend is being fueled, Boerries says, because more and more
people are sick of trudging to the store, installing software on
their PCs and worrying about upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike conventional software contained on a CD, StarOffice
``lives'' on large servers. At the Sun site, www.sun.com, consumers
and businesses can download the 65 megabyte file using a standard
Internet browser. The StarPortal, due late this summer, will take
the concept one step farther. Like Internet-based e-mail, users
will go to the site, type in a user name and password, and
manipulate corporate files all on the server. For instance, a
traveling salesperson could log onto the company network via a PC
sitting in a client's conference room and pull up a presentation.
No more software to install or even download.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the rise of ``smart'' appliances, which seem a
natural fit with Web-based applications, the hard numbers show Sun
and other office suite makers are hardly in the office software
race.
</P>
<P>
   According to research firm PC Data, StarOffice controlled so
little of the office software market in 1999 that its share is
listed as 0.0 percent, even though it's ranked fifth in terms of
unit sales. Corel, Lotus and Adobe are second, third and fourth
with a total of 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, more and more softwaremakers _ maybe emboldened by the
rise of alternative operating systems like Linux and network
computers _ are launching similar office suite portals.
</P>
<P>
   Such models put ``a little pressure on Microsoft, in particular
because they're so far behind on delivering a version of Office
that can run remotely,'' said Jeff Tarter, editor of Softletter, a
software industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Sun's plan to launch StarPortal this summer,
smaller Bay Area companies like iAmaze.com and ThinkFree.com are
capitalizing on the shift from traditional shrink-wrapped to
Web-based office software.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the natural evolution of the software business,'' said
Michael Bloom, president of San Francisco's iAmaze.com. ``Software
just doesn't need to be as difficult as it is today. The Web is the
computing platform of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, StarOffice has been downloaded about 1.8 million times;
and Sun has sent out an additional 5 million CDs. The marketing
frenzy is part of Sun's strategy of creating buzz about StarPortal
through StarOffice. It also doesn't hurt that Web-based
applications like StarOffice provide greater impetus for companies
to buy Sun's core server products, which are needed to run the
software.
</P>
<P>
   Sun hopes to market StarOffice and StarPortal through Internet
service providers and ASPs, and then charge service fees to
end-users. Fees would range from $1 to $100 per seat, depending on
the size of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a relatively small service charge or no charge at all,
Palo Alto's Sun and smaller players have a steep hill to climb in
shifting corporate users away from Microsoft's ubiquitous Office
software. And it's not just Microsoft's huge market share.
</P>
<P>
   Two words inevitably pop up when the idea of software as
services over the Internet arises: security and broadband.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rash of attacks on several high-profile Web sites has
raised the public's awareness of the Web's vulnerability to even
semi-sophisticated hackers. Understandably, some might be squeamish
about the prospect of transferring proprietary sales data across
the Internet all day long.
</P>
<P>
   Second, in order to access the all-powerful network, users need
a fairly speedy Internet connection, and broadband is still spotty.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's Sun's biggest obstacle: Microsoft. PC Data
research shows clearly that the Seattle behemoth owns the business
desktop.
</P>
<P>
   And that's ``owns'' with a capital ``O.'' Microsoft Office
commands 95 percent of the office suite market and has done so for
the past four years running.
</P>
<P>
   That could change, though few analysts believe it's likely
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, known mainly for making high-end workstations and
Unix-based servers for large organizations, and Microsoft are
bitter rivals.
</P>
<P>
   And although Boerries claims that the StarOffice acquisition
wasn't an attempt to turn Microsoft's strategy of giving away its
Internet Explorer _ the death blow to Netscape's Navigator _ back
on itself, it's clear that the house that Bill Gates built is never
far from his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is trying to move the paradigm with Office Online,''
he said. ``But they have a PC desktop-centric application.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft has been working to outfit Office with
Web-friendly features since 1997. But some analysts conjectured
that Microsoft's announcement in November to offer Office Online
via bCentral.com, an online portal providing services to small
businesses, was a knee-jerk reaction to Sun's purchase of Star
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, not the most fleet-footed company when it comes to
the Internet, said the timing was related to growing interest in
such applications. But officials also point out that such interest
hasn't reached critical mass yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really isn't a lot of customer demand for this type of
service,'' said Lisa Gurry, Office product manager. ``Microsoft has
continued to investigate the market and invest in it. But customers
aren't using applications over the Internet in this way yet.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Gurry admits that while the Office product does have a
vast customer base _ about 100 million licenses sold worldwide _
Microsoft ``definitely recognizes that it's a competitive
environment out there.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gurry said, Microsoft has partnered with about 20 ASPs
and telecommunications companies in a trial program to offer Office
Online. But it doesn't expect to have the service up on bCentral
until the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Newsletter editor Tarter doesn't expect a lot of takers, in part
because the prototype Office Online hasn't been well received. well
so far. &LR; He says the product is extremely slow and costly _ about
$10 a month versus $400 for a shrink-wrapped version _ particularly
when ASPs that sell the software tack on additional fees for extra
storage or premium features.
</P>
<P>
   Cost factored into BlueWave Communications' decision to begin
using StarOffice in early 1998. But the more significant issue was
the fact  &LR; that StarOffice runs on Solaris, Windows and Linux
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for something that could do everything Office
could do but would work on Unix and Solaris,'' said David Nix,
president of the small San Francisco multimedia firm. ``Our
business requires us to create high-end presentations used by
presidents, CEOs ... so we needed to have something that would work
ideally on everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10 employees, BlueWave is a good example of the size and type
of company drawn to StarOffice, Tarter said. But he doubts that
larger, more conservative corporations will jump on the StarOffice
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Big companies ``are very fond of compatibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's big selling point is that it defines compatibility
standards. And the fact is, big companies like to standardize on
mainstream products.''
</P>
<P>
   Boerries doesn't seem concerned. He believes that Sun is
encouraging a shift toward a more fluid, connected computing world
that doesn't rely on the standard desktop box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants an alternative,'' he said. ``If you're a large
company, you're paying in the tens of millions of dollars yearly in
maintaining your Microsoft Office. On the other hand, what do they
do about the Internet? The Internet is changing the way companies
work _ companies want more flexible structures. That's what this is
about.''

 &HT;    BRADLEY SAYS HE WOULD NOT SERVE AS GORE'S RUNNING MATE
 &HT;    By KEN FOSKETT and SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With this presidential hopes hanging by a thread,
Democrat Bill Bradley said Sunday that were ``no circumstances''
under which he would consider serving as Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running for president of the United States,'' Bradley said
on NBC's Meet the Press. ``I think my ability matches the national
moment, and therefore that's where I'm investing all of my energies
and all of my time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, nonetheless, reiterated that he would support Gore if
he became the Democratic nominee. But he stopped short of saying
that he would back away from some of the accusations that he has
leveled at the vice president in the course of their sometimes
acrimonious nominating contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley again asserted Sunday that Gore had misrepresented both
his own record and Bradley's during the campaign. And he said
Gore's involvement in some of the Democratic Party's fundraising
scandals on 1996 could hurt him and the Democrats in the fall
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What Gore knew about a 1996 fundraiser at a Buddhist temple in
California would be something that Republicans would use against
him in the fall, Bradley said. ``I think that will remain an issue
until it's fully explained,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Meet the Press host Tim Russert if he would back away
from those comments if he were to end up campaigning for Gore,
Bradley said: ``Well, you know, I think you end up standing where
you have stood, and so I'm going to say what I think at the time. I
would, as I said, support him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore on Sunday said he had learned from the controversy over the
Buddhist temple fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake and I think the importance of making a
mistake is what you learn from it,'' he told reporters. ``And what
I learned from it was the need for campaign finance reform. I
strongly supported campaign finance reform in the past. I support
it even more strongly today.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Cranston, Rhode Island Sunday night, Gore
suggested that any primary victories by Texas Gov. George Bush on
Tuesday will be tainted by $2.5 million spent by a Bush supporter
on behalf of the GOP presidential frontrunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gov. Bush defeats John McCain in some of these contests on
Tuesday, this will raise serious questions about whether he did so
fair and square,'' Gore said during a visit at a senior center.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was referring to television commercials that aired in New
York and other primary states that were financed by wealthy Dallas
investor Sam Wyly. The ads praised Bush's environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly, who supports alternative energy sources, has denied the
ads represented ``soft money'' expenditures. He insists he did not
coordinate them with the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, ``We knew that Gov. Bush was in the hip pocket of the
special interests. Now we find out what deep pockets that is _ $2.5
million all of a sudden flooding into these contests.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that he, Democratic challenger Bill Bradley and GOP
challenger John McCain all support a ban on soft money as part of
reforming campaign financing. He said banning soft money would
``elevate'' political debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Sunday that he thought the negativity of the
campaign has ``calmed down'' in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged that he has eased up on Bradley. In recent
weeks, the vice president has stopped mentioning Bradley in stump
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said that didn't mean he had sewn up the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that his tone changed in the last several days with
far less of the attacks that have become commonplace and I wanted
to reciprocate,'' Gore told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley returned to New York Sunday night after a whirlwind
schedule that took him to his native Missouri Saturday evening and
Maryland and Ohio on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In at least a sentimental blow to his struggling campaign, The
New York Times on Sunday endorsed Gore for the nomination. Bradley
played ten years for the New York Knicks and served for 18 years as
senator in neighboring New Jersey. New York state and New York City
were almost home to Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The Times editorial praised Bradley for a ``promising start,''
but faulted his ``lack of energy'' in conveying his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If overeagerness to please is a defect in Mr. Gore. Mr.
Bradley possesses an even more disturbing inability to convey a
real hunger for the opportunity to serve,'' the Times wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley disputed the criticism Sunday when asked about it on
ABC's ``This Week with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 14 months ... I've been out crossing this country
14 to18 hours a day, listening to people, talking to people,''
Bradley said. ``I don't think anybody could have worked harder, I
don't think anybody could have fought stronger.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Microsoft's Pocket PC Hits Store Shelves Next Month  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Palm's on a roll, but the empire is preparing to strike back.
<P>
   The empire, of course, is Microsoft. While most of the high-tech
world last week had its eyes on Palm Inc. and its heavily
publicized initial public offering, the giant to the north was
laying the groundwork for a counterattack on the handheld computer
market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's not-so-secret weapon will be a new generation of
products it calls the ``Pocket PC.'' Slated to hit the market next
month, these new devices will be only slightly larger than Palm's
products, and probably not much more expensive than Palm's high-end
models, yet they'll have about as much processing power and memory
as a vintage-1997 desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   And they'll come with software that offers many of the
capabilities of a full-blown PC _ including the ability to surf the
Web, play classic games such as Shadowgate and Doom, and read and
edit Microsoft Word and Excel files.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of any of the Windows versions that run on desktop PCs,
Pocket PCs will sport a new version of the stripped-down system
Microsoft used to call Windows CE. But the company has abandoned
that product, moniker &LR;  at least in this market, apparently because
it's now perceived by too many potential buyers and developers as a
loser.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even while emphasizing that the new machines ``bring
the power of the PC to your pocket,'' Microsoft is,
uncharacteristically, downplaying the whole Windows connection.
That's not just a matter of branding, either: In the process of
redesigning the system's graphical user interface to make it
simpler and less cluttered than previous CE releases, the company
has also made it look and feel a lot less like desktop Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, for example, is Windows' familiar Start button in the
lower-left corner; it has been replaced by an icon in the upper
left. Instead of beveled buttons and other 3-D effects that are
pervasive in the current CE interface as well as in the desktop
versions, the Pocket PC will revert to a more plain, plainer, &LR; 
 &LR; flatter look. And Palm-style single taps will replace Windows'
double clicks.
</P>
<P>
   As with conventional PCs and as well as  &LR; previous ``palm-size
PCs'' based on Windows CE, Microsoft will leave the job of
manufacturing and marketing Pocket PCs to other companies. So far,
none of Microsoft's hardware partners has officially announced
Pocket PC models, but companies currently offering Windows CE
handhelds _ most notably, Casio, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard _ are
expected to lead the charge.
</P>
<P>
   They'll face a formidable challenge, and one Microsoft and its
allies are not exactly accustomed to. Roughly 9 nine  &LR; out of 10
desktop and notebook PCs ships with Microsoft operating software _
Windows 98, NT or now 2000. But in the handheld market the
situation is almost a mirror image: According to NPD Intelect, a
Port Washington, N.Y., research company, Palm models in December
1999, represented 84.9 percent of handheld sales, measured in
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   That's not even counting sales of other companies that have
licensed the Palm OS, including newcomer Handspring and giant IBM.
Casio, the leader in the Windows CE market, garnered only 7 percent
of handheld dollar sales, with HP and Compaq trailing at 4.1 and 1
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Since Windows CE devices generally cost more than Palm products,
the unit-share breakdown looks even worse for Microsoft. And as for
the more elusive but still critical concept of ``mindshare,''
Palm's dominance is all but total.
</P>
<P>
   Palm won that position by an unwavering focus on a few key
values: simplicity, reliability, compactness and long battery life.
And in recent months, since challenged by licensee Handspring, Palm
has been surprisingly aggressive in cutting prices on its low-end
models _ to as little as $179 _ even as it has delivered a steady
stream of innovative products priced at $400 and above.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, nearly all CE-based handhelds (not counting fire
sales on inventory that couldn't be sold at full price) have been
priced well above $400.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of focusing on simplicity and stability, Microsoft
and its allies have pursued a handheld strategy similar to the one
that has served them so well in the conventional-PC marketplace:
continually piling on new features, functions and options that
demand ever more memory and faster processors. With the exception
of built-in wireless Internet access, Windows CE has regularly led
the way with new features that weren't (and in some cases still
aren't) available from Palm or its licensees: color screens,
standard expansion slots and such audio capabilities as voice
recording and MP3 music playback.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Microsoft has bowed to critics of its old,
Windows-derived user interface for handhelds, it's not at all
abandoning its tradition of packing in features and pushing the
limits of the available hardware. Pocket PCs are expected to have
16 or 32 megabytes of memory, compared with to  &LR; the 8 megabytes in
even the beefiest Palm products, and 32-bit processors running at
100 to 200 megahertz, compared to the 16-bit, 10- or 20-megahertz
chips Palm still relies on.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft continues to boost the Pocket PC's features, too. At a
workshop for journalists and analysts in Seattle last week, the
company previewed a slew of impressive new applications that will
be built into Pocket PCs.
</P>
<P>
   _A special version of the Internet Explorer browser, for &LR; 
example, &LR;  will automatically reformat Web pages and shrink graphic
elements on the fly so they'll be readable on the Pocket PCs'
240-by-320-pixel screens without constant scrolling. The browser
also supports many of the latest Internet standards, including the
new XML language, as well as Microsoft software-development
technologies that are widely used by corporate developers, such as
ActiveX controls.
</P>
<P>
   _Pocket versions of Word and Excel will let users read standard
word processing and spreadsheet files downloaded from their PCs
sent and send sent to them  &LR; as e-mail attachments. It will even be
possible to edit such documents on the Pocket device, although not
all features of the corresponding desktop applications are
supported, and in some circumstances a user making and &LR;  small
changes on the handheld could unwittingly destroy formatting and
even data from the original document.
</P>
<P>
   _A new Windows Media Player will play back MP3 files as well as
music in Microsoft's own digital-music format. Unlike current MP3
players, the Pocket PC player will support copy protection, a
feature major studios are insisting on before they'll release most
of their titles in downloadable form.
</P>
<P>
   _Other new software will include Microsoft Reader, a program for
reading electronic books, and pocket companions versions of
Microsoft personal-finance and street-mapping programs.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Microsoft has invested so heavily in developing these
new capabilities, company officials said last week, is that their
research shows that most users of handheld computers _ even Palm
customers _ want more from their devices than just an electronic
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Some outside analysts agreed. ``When people see a Pocket PC on
the shelf side-by-side with, say, a Palm IIIc, and they find out
that they cost about the same but the Pocket PC has four times as
much memory and can do so much more, a lot of them are bound to go
for it,'' said Jill House of International Data Corp. ``People
always want more features. How many of them they'll actually use is
bed &LR; side the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Le Tocq of the Gartner Group, while acknowledging that the
Pocket PC is a significant improvement over Microsoft's previous
handheld offerings and should boost the company's market share,
said he doesn't think the new systems will push Palm out of the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of expectations,'' he said. ``Palm's success is
built on exceeding expectations _ delivering something people find
themselves enjoying and getting more use from than they ever
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Pocket PC, Microsoft has `less-than' positioning'' he
said. ``It encourages people to compare the device to a PC, but
when people start comparing Web surfing on one of these, for
example, to what they can do on a Windows notebook, they're bound
to be disappointed.''

 &HT;    EDS: Fix in first line ``With this'' changed to ``With his''
 &HT;    Bradley says he would not serve as Gore's running mate
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett and Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With his presidential hopes hanging by a thread,
Democrat Bill Bradley said Sunday that were ``no circumstances''
under which he would consider serving as Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running for president of the United States,'' Bradley said
on NBC's Meet the Press. ``I think my ability matches the national
moment, and therefore that's where I'm investing all of my energies
and all of my time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, nonetheless, reiterated that he would support Gore if
he became the Democratic nominee. But he stopped short of saying
that he would back away from some of the accusations that he has
leveled at the vice president in the course of their sometimes
acrimonious nominating contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley again asserted Sunday that Gore had misrepresented both
his own record and Bradley's during the campaign. And he said

scandals on 1996 could hurt him and the Democrats in the fall
campaign.

CLINTON IN COMMEMORATION AT SITE OF SELMA MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. _ Thirty-five years after Alabama state troopers
waged a bloody attack on civil rights demonstrators here, President
Clinton renewed the call for racial equality Sunday at an
anniversary gathering that drew thousands to the site of the march.
</P>
<P>
   So much has changed, everyone agreed, since that day in 1965
when racism flared up for all to see. But so many challenges
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the police unleashed a fierce attack with clubs, bull
whips, cattle prods and tear gas, blocking the voting-rights
marchers from crossing Edmund Pettus Bridge. On this anniversary
day, law enforcement officers, many of them black, saluted as
Clinton strode across the bridge, arm in arm with a phalanx of
aging civil rights veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five years ago, a single day in Selma became a seminal
moment in the history of our country,'' Clinton said. ``On this
bridge, America's long march to freedom met a roadblock of violent
resistance. But the marchers, thank God, would not take a detour on
the road to freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Hosea Williams, one of the original protesters, was pushed in a
wheelchair during the re-enactment, right down a roadway that has
since become Martin Luther King Jr. Street. He summed up the mood
of many when he remarked, ``We're not where we used to be, but
we're not where we ought to be, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The violent clash in Selma, broadcast nationally on television,
caught the attention of millions of Americans and set off a chain
of events that altered the region's social and political landscape.
Two weeks later, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led a march from
Selma to the state capital, Montgomery, prompting Congress later
that year to pass the Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' recalled John Lewis, who had
been badly beaten when he tried to cross the bridge, named for a
Confederate general. Now, Lewis is a Democratic congressman from
Georgia who returned to Selma with a delegation of colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about all the tear gas and the horses,'' said
Frank Spivey, 53, who was toward the back of the march in 1965.
``The wind was blowing, and the tear gas burned our eyes. All you
could do was run.''
</P>
<P>
   Shielding his eyes Sunday from the blistering sun in the middle
of the mostly black crowd, Spivey said it was a shame that despite
all the progress of the last 35 years, so many of the blacks in
Selma and the rest of the country still lived in poverty. ``White
people are now whupping us economically instead of using fists or
guns,'' Spivey said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has talked throughout his presidency of racial
reconciliation, recalled watching the violence in Selma on
television as a college freshman and feeling the country's great
racial and regional divide. Alluding to the racial challenges of
today _ economic disparities, police brutality, controversies over
the Confederate battle flag _ the president said there were many
more bridges to cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as African-Americans and Latinos anywhere in America
believe they are unfairly targeted by police because of the color
of their skin, and police believe they are unfairly targeted by
their communities because of the color of their uniforms, we have
another bridge to cross,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the reigning symbol of one American's pride is the
shameful symbol of another American's pain, we have another bridge
to cross.''
</P>
<P>
   The voting rights legislation brought down barriers that had
blocked blacks from exercising their rights. The number of black
registered voters skyrocketed in the years after the law's passage,
contributing to the electoral victories of thousands of
politicians, black and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Selma, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton would never have
been elected president of the United States,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But many speakers Sunday lamented the low voting-participation
rates among blacks these days, given how hard previous generations
had to fight for the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five years later, there's a deafening silence at the
polling places throughout the nation,'' said Martin Luther King
III, a son of the civil rights leader, using King's familiar
cadences to urge blacks not to forget that hard-fought right.

 &HT;    McCain rips Bush ads, predicts voter backlash
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROADVIEW HEIGHTS, Ohio _ John McCain said Sunday that he is
counting on election day surprises and public disgust with George
W. Bush's campaign to keep his candidacy alive beyond the 13
Republican contests Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing Bush in polls in the big states that vote Tuesday,
McCain kept up his scathing take on negative advertising by Bush
and an independent group that has close ties to the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let them get away with it,'' McCain said at an airport
rally in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator appeared on two Sunday news programs and
campaigned in three battleground states, New York, Ohio and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also appeared on two Sunday programs and campaigned in
California after spending a rare night in his own bed in Austin,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One ad questions McCain's commitment to breast cancer research.
McCain's sister suffers from the disease, and Bush said last week
that is ``all the more reason to remind'' McCain of his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if someone who would treat a situation like that is
ready for prime time,'' McCain said on CBS's ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad says McCain has opposed breast cancer programs and
concludes: ``John McCain calls these projects just 'garden-variety
pork.' That's shocking. America deserves better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told CBS Sunday that his people lifted the information
directly from McCain's campaign materials: ``John listed a series
of projects, called 'garden-variety pork' on his web page. ... The
(Bush) ad questions the programs that he said he was going to
reduce or eliminate. That's exactly what it says. He can try to
convert this (debate) into something different.''
</P>
<P>
   The radio ad appears to be accurate, only up to a point, because
a top Bush supporter suggested Sunday that the charge is at odds
with McCain's overall record. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas)
told CNN that Republicans had virtually doubled the amount of
federal money for breast cancer research since the party took
control of Congress, and that ``Senator McCain has supported
that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said, on two talk shows, he voted in favor of funds for
breast cancer research at least 10 times, a figure the Bush
campaign did not contest Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The independent ad, backed by $2.5 million from a wealthy Texas
businessman, attacks McCain's environmental record and praises
Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   McCain returned to an old theme Sunday, comparing Bush to
President Clinton. The comparison got him into trouble in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so Clintonesque, it's scary. Raise the soft money. Run
the attack ads,'' McCain said, speaking of the environmental ad.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, McCain pointed out Bush attacked him for being
on the side of environmentalists in Washington state, while Bush
supporters are now criticizing him for a supposedly
anti-environmental stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting more and more like the Clinton campaign.
They'll say anything,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor denied involvement in the ad campaign and
said the issue distracted from his desire to talk about education.
Yet he refused to ask his allies to pull the ads, saying, ``That's
what free speech is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides pointed out that Bush did ask Pat Robertson to stop
making independent anti-McCain telephone calls last month.
</P>
<P>
   Outside McCain's rally at the Broadview Heights High School, the
Bush campaign kept up its attack on McCain. Bush supporters parked
a yellow school bus with the words ``No Education Plan Express''
emblazoned on its side, a jab at what they believe is McCain's
sketchy education agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a noisy, gymnasium crowded with more than 2,000 people,
McCain urged supporters to ignore the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leads in polls in California, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri,
New York and Ohio, which have 75 percent of the 605 delegates at
stake Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But campaigning in New York, Ohio and California Sunday, McCain
said he believes he can beat Bush in the first two states and win
the popular vote, but lose the delegates in California. The Golden
State's primary ballot is open to all registered voters, but only
Republican votes will count toward awarding the 162 GOP delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, I don't know,'' McCain said. ``That's the most
unpredictable of all.''
</P>
<P>
   He boasted about a rare feat in New York, endorsements by all
four New York City newspapers _ the Times, the Post, the Daily News
and Newsday McCain also is ahead in the five New England states
that hold primaries Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the personal rancor of the past few days, McCain
promised to support Bush if he is the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also pledged to support the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In view of the poll numbers, McCain faced questions in his TV
appearances that had an end-of the-campaign feel to them, including
whether he would consider running for vice president or mounting a
third-party candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   He has previously ruled out both options, and did so again
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley appeared on NBC's Meet the
Press in Buffalo. Their chartered airplanes were parked near each
other at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain left the Meet the Press set, he wanted to shake
hands with his fellow underdog, as they did in New Hampshire last
year to publicize their common commitment to campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's aides did not, for some reason, allow the meeting
Sunday, leaving McCain puzzled.

PUTIN SAYS HE WILL SHUN CONFRONTATION AND ISOLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Vladimir Putin, Russia's acting president, in his first
interview with a Western news organization, says Russia must be a
``strong, powerful state'' that sheds confrontational Cold War
politics, avoids isolation from the West and remains willing to
seek ``more profound integration'' with NATO, even by joining it so
long as Russia ``is regarded as an equal partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in an armchair in the Kremlin, Putin recorded the
interview last Tuesday with Sir David Frost of British Broadcasting
Corp. It was broadcast Sunday, and was also picked up by Russian
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is little prospect that Russia will become a member
of NATO anytime soon, Putin's remarks clearly were tailored to a
Western audience, emphasizing a desire to develop stronger ties
with the West as Russia rebuilds its economy. But they also
revealed his eagerness to reduce the tensions over NATO's eastward
expansion and the bombing campaign in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attempts to exclude us from the process is what causes
opposition and concern on our part,'' he said, referring to NATO,
``but that does not mean we are going to shut ourselves off from
the rest of the world. Isolationism is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader gave a spirited defense of his country's
military campaign in the breakaway southern Chechnya region,
comparing rebel forces there to ``Nazi criminals.'' Responding to
reports of serious human rights abuses by Russian forces, he said,
``If there are facts of cruelty, of crimes against peaceful
citizens of Chechnya, then that goes against the aims that the
Russian leadership sets itself, and they're my own goals at the
same time.'' Such cases ``will be scrupulously investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   He contended, though apparently somewhat prematurely, that
Russian forces had stamped out ``organized opposition'' in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But three days after the interview was recorded, a column of
Russian officers and soldiers was ambushed near the Chechen
capital, Grozny, leaving 20 dead and 29 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Though Putin has a commanding lead in public opinion polls to
win the March 26 presidential election, he said, ``I am not
inclined to believe that I am assured of victory, that I have it in
my hand, that the campaign is over.'' He now leads his closest
rival, Gennadi Zyuganov, the Communist Party leader, by nearly 40
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, after the BBC broadcast the interview, Zyuganov
criticized Putin's statements on joining NATO as ``naive and
unpardonable for a politician of his level.''
</P>
<P>
   The communist leader said, ``Our fathers and grandfathers did
not liberate Europe from fascism for the NATO military alliance to
make seven-mile steps advancing to the east and posing a threat to
Russia's national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin said his desire to rebuild Russia into a ``strong,
powerful state'' had ``nothing to do with aggression.'' He added,
``If we again and again go back to the terminology of the Cold War,
we are never going to discard attitudes and problems that humanity
had to grapple with a mere 15 to 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he saw NATO as a rival or enemy, Putin said: ``It
is hard for me to visualize NATO as an enemy. I think even posing
the question this way will not do any good to Russia or the world.
The very question is capable of causing damage.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that the expansion of NATO that has brought Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic into the military alliance should
not be conducted without taking Russia's strategic interests into
consideration, though he seemed to struggle to state what those
interests were.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about our opposition to NATO's expansion, mind
you, we have never, ever declared any region of the world a zone of
our special interests,'' Putin said, adding, ``I prefer to talk
about strategic partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   When Russia states its opposition to NATO expansion, he said
again, ``we're not saying we have some sort of special interests
there; what we are thinking about is the kind of place that our own
country holds today and will hold tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But pretending, or proceeding from the assumption that Russia
has nothing to do with it and trying to exclude it from the
process, is hardly feasible,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether from Russia's standpoint it would be possible
to join NATO, he replied: ``I don't see why not. I would not rule
out such a possibility, but I repeat if and when Russia's views are
taken into account as those of any equal partner.''

 &HT;    Israeli cabinet votes to withdraw troops from Lebanon
 &HT;    By Larry Kaplow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After 18 years of casualties and controversy,
Israel's Cabinet voted unanimously Sunday to withdraw its troops
from Lebanon by early July.
</P>
<P>
   The pullout would keep a campaign promise made by Prime Minister
Ehud Barak a year ago to end Israel's unpopular and costly
involvement in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is gambling that Syria, which largely controls Lebanon,
will abstain from encouraging guerrillas in southern Lebanon from
launching cross-border attacks on cities in northern Israel. Syria
is believed to use the guerrillas in Lebanon to pressure Israel to
return the nearby Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria
in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Barak hopes that a withdrawal will, in turn, prod Syria to give
Israel better terms in any deal for return of the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   Syria and Israel began peace talks in December but the Syrians
broke them off in January when Israel would not guarantee a full
Golan withdrawal. Israeli generals have warned that attacks could
come across Israel's northern border from Lebanon if the Israeli
troops pull back without a Syria peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an end to the tragedy,'' Barak told reporters. ``We're
bringing the boys home.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Barak could only give vague reassurances of how Israel will
protect its northern border if Syria does not sanction the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we are fulfilling a major commitment that we made to
the public and I don't suggest that anyone should assume what our
response will be when we redeploy to the international border and
defend Israel from there,'' Barak said in an interview on Israeli
television Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said that, in the months ahead, Israel will fortify its
northern towns. Though Barak did not say so Sunday, Israeli
officials frequently threaten that they will respond with air
strikes to any attacks across Israel's borders. Some analysts worry
that a withdrawal without an agreement with Syria _ a so-called
``unilateral withdrawal'' _ could lead to more, rather than less,
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet decision appeared to leave some room to maneuver in
the event there is no peace deal by July by saying that it would
meet again to decide how to implement a withdrawal. A withdrawal is
expected to take three months and could be done in phases while
peace talks with Syria continue.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Griver, an Israeli activist against the war in southern
Lebanon, said the Cabinet cannot go back on its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't do it, there will just be too much public
pressure on Barak,'' she said of the planned withdrawal. ``It's
going to reach the point where people just can't take any more.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 Israeli troops man hilltop bunkers in southern
Lebanon. They are backed by another 2,000 troops in a Lebanese
militia, the South Lebanon Army, that is trained and funded by
Israel. About 100,000 Lebanese live in the roughly nine-mile wide
swath of land across Lebanon's southern border.
</P>
<P>
   Israel first invaded Lebanon in 1978 to fight Palestinian
Liberation Organization terrorists who had attacked civilians in
northern Israel. Israel withdrew within a few weeks, leaving the
area to the control of pro-Israeli Lebanese militias.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight against Palestinian terrorists took Israel into
Lebanon again in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Israel withdrew to roughly the current swath across south
Lebanon in 1985. Israelis call it the ``security zone,'' but most
governments around the world consider it occupied territory.
</P>
<P>
   The PLO fled Lebanon. But Hezbollah, a well-disciplined
guerrilla army of Iranian-backed Shiite Muslims, rose up in
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 650 Israeli troops were killed following the 1978
invasion. Another 250 have been killed in the occupation zone since
it was established in 1982.

 &HT;    CLINTON LEADS MARCHERS IN RE-ENACTMENT OF SELMA MARCH
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. _ President Clinton joined civil rights activists
Sunday at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in marking the 35th anniversary
of the attack on voting rights marchers that he said made it
possible for white Southerners like him to reach the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton locked arms with Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Coretta
Scott King and led modern-day marchers to the crest of the bridge
where they stopped and prayed before continuing across.
</P>
<P>
   It was March 7, 1965, when Lewis, then a young black voting
rights organizer, suffered a fractured skull and was left for dead
after being beaten by Alabama state troopers intent on halting
their march through Selma on to the state capital of Montgomery 54
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Bloody Sunday'' beatings, televised on newscasts across
America, galvanized the nation and pressured Congress that summer
to pass the Voting Rights Act that guaranteed the right to vote
regardless of race.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. King, the widow of slain civil rights leader Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr., was also joined by a wheelchair-bound Hosea
Williams, who wore denim overalls and red sneakers and clutched a
metal cane. Like Lewis, Williams was an aide to King in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``'As long as there is any inequality (or) prejudice against any
Americans because of the color of their skin or sexual preference,
we have a very long bridge to cross,'' Clinton told a peaceful
gathering of about 7,000 before re-enacting the walk across the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been said that the Voting Rights Act was signed in ink
in Washington,'' the president said. ``But it was first signed in
blood in Selma.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who marches every year to mark the anniversary, had
invited Clinton. Speaking to the crowd, he recounted how the
troopers had used tear gas, bull whips and clubs to attack the
marchers, who were protesting poll taxes and other methods used to
prevent blacks from voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They turned our non-violent protest into blood,'' Lewis said.
``Today, when we walk arm and arm across this bridge, no one will
beat us. No one will taunt us and call us names. Today, no one will
lose their life for the precious right to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks after the 1965 attack, Martin Luther King Jr., _
under the protection of a federal court _ led hundreds of people in
completing the long march to Montgomery. The march is widely seen
as having launched the careers of black leaders like Lewis, now
serving his 7th term in Congress. It also paved the way for a new
type of white Southern politician who could campaign for civil
rights and, in the process, benefit from the new-found freedom of
blacks and other minorities to freely vote for them in elections.
</P>
<P>
   Without the changes brought about by the Selma march in 1965,
Clinton said, ``Atlanta never would have had the Super Bowl or the
Olympics, and Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton would never have been
elected president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I, too, am a son of the South, the old segregated South,''
Clinton said. ``Those of you who marched 35 years ago set me free,
too, on Bloody Sunday. Free to know you, to work with you, to love
you. I thank you all for what you did here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, as long as Americans are willing to hold hands, we
can walk with any wind, we can cross any bridge. Deep in my heart I
do believe, we shall overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged those who benefitted from the Voting Rights Act to
exercise the hard-fought right in this year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this day in 1965, the eyes of the nation were on Selma. So
it is again today,'' Lewis said. ``I ask you to turn your eyes
homeward to the bridges we must cross in every hamlet. . .every
town and every city. We are Selma. We have come a mighty long way.
Let us summon the strength of those who have walked this bridge
before us and move forward toward a new America.''
</P>
<P>
   During the original 1965 march, mobs of angry whites insulted
Lewis and his fellow protestors. He was among 17 who were
hospitalized. But on Sunday, the mostly black crowd of nearly 7,000
cheered proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Alabama state troopers _ white and black _ saluted the
marchers ad they sang ``We Shall Overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the crowd held up signs reading: ``Don't Dump On Our
Civil Rights Trails'' and ``Human Rights At Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Other participants in Sunday's march were former United Nations
Ambassador Andrew Young and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, both King
aides. Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Bobby Kennedy, also attended, as
did 30 members of Congress from both parties.

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Ohio _ After the most tumultuous week of his
campaign, Sen. John McCain is still clinging to the hope that
Tuesday's critical set of primaries will give him some rationale to
keep his insurgency alive.
</P>
<P>
   For months, as the Arizona senator rose from being a small blip
on the political radar to a national phenomenon, McCain had
declared that the nomination battle would be decided on Tuesday,
when 13 states, including the powerhouses of New York and
California, vote in what amounts to a national primary.
</P>
<P>
   Now he says, ``I don't know if it's decisive or not,'' and
points to the mercurial and competitive nature of this season's
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had the momentum, we'd still be in the game,'' McCain
said on his campaign bus this weekend, where more and more of his
family and senior staff members are gathering for these critical
days of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But just what can count as momentum was the question facing the
campaign Sunday as it hopscotched frantically from rallies in New
York to Ohio to California. With an ever-more rebellious soundtrack
blaring behind him _ Sunday it was ``Born to Be Wild'' surging from
loudspeakers in an airport rally in Buffalo _ McCain continued to
assail Gov. George W. Bush of Texas over attack ads that were
financed by what he called ``Governor Bush's cronies.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush seemed to be playing it safe, promoting his
tax cut plan and his educational priorities in appearances from
Northern to Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's top advisers admit they have given up hope of winning
California's 162 Republican delegates, because of Bush's strength
among the state's Republicans. Instead, the McCain camp is pulling
for an alternative scenario that would allow him to claim a mandate
to carry his struggle for the Republican nomination further into
the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   It would start with sweeping New England, where 102 delegates
are chosen, and winning a clear majority of New York's 101
delegates. McCain's aides said he would also have to rack up a
decent number of delegates in Ohio _ whose primary is open to
Democrats or independents _ or a victory in the popular vote in
California, which would allow him to make the case with new force
that he would be his party's best candidate in November.
</P>
<P>
   Such a split decision in California is possible because the
primary is open to all parties, but the state's 162 delegates are
allotted based only on the Republican votes, and the winner gets
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain wins the popular vote in California and Bush loses
it, I think it destroys what final shred of credibility the
argument had that Bush can be elected president in the fall,'' said
Mike Murphy, McCain's senior strategist Sunday. ``We're getting to
the point now where a vote for Bush is a vote for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   But even his supporters concede that this whole scenario is a
long shot. With the exception of New England, the polls this
weekend showed Bush in the lead in most states _ no matter that
McCain scored such upsets as winning the endorsement of the five
daily newspapers in New York City and Long Island, which rarely
back the same candidate.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 days, McCain's always improvisational campaign
has lurched in contradictory fashion from tactic to tactic, trying
to find a way to victory. First, McCain tried to renew his appeal
to Republicans, linking himself to Ronald Reagan and imploring,
``Don't fear this campaign, my fellow Republicans _ join it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, he tacked again, taking a huge gamble with a
blistering speech that assailed two leaders of the Christian right,
Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, as ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was intended to energize moderates and independents
across the Northeast and the West Coast, but it gave the Republican
Party's social conservatives new incentive to vote against McCain.
It also left some of his supporters in the Christian right, like
Gary Bauer, in a terrible position. Terry Haskins, one of McCain's
co-chairmen in South Carolina, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the senator began attacking Bush over the
revelation that big financial backers of Bush had purchased $2.5
million worth of attack ads against him. McCain accused Bush of
running a ``shameful campaign'' and of taking the same path that
had led to President Clinton's fund-raising abuses four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's cronies in Texas are doing exactly what
President Clinton and Al Gore did in 1996,'' he thundered Sunday to
a crowd in Buffalo. ``It's a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides keep insisting that the senator won Michigan when
few thought a rebound from his South Carolina defeat was possible.
And the candidate himself has veered from steely optimism to black
humor. Asked what he might do if he lost the nomination, the former
prisoner of war said he was ``thinking about going back to Hanoi.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if McCain survives on Tuesday, the following Tuesday brings
primaries in Bush's home state of Texas and in Florida, where
Bush's brother Jeb is governor. Beyond trying to win some delegates
in Florida, McCain's aides say they would seek to minimize the
importance of that primary and turn their attention to Illinois,
which votes on March 21, and is another open contest not limited to
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The confounding problem for McCain is the dynamic that started
setting in in South Carolina and was firmly established y when he
lost Virginia, North Dakota and Washington state last week. The
senator has not been able to rally a majority of Republicans in any
state, and instead has become the candidate of a third force in
politics made up of moderate Republicans, independents and
conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McCain still draws huge crowds. More than 1,000 people poured
into a town hall meeting in Syracuse to see him late Saturday
afternoon, and more than 2,000 came to see him in Cleveland on
Sunday. But some of the questions from the audience on Saturday
captured the peculiar problem facing this son of Arizona who still
insists that he is a ``proud Reagan conservative.''.
</P>
<P>
   One woman told him she wanted him to be president. Then she
started to cry as she said that Reagan had cut disability benefits
and brought wrenching pain to her family and disabled father.
Sobbing, she implored McCain, ``I wish you wouldn't have to lump
yourself in with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Whole sections of the audience applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later another woman rose and confessed she was a
registered Democrat. She begged the senator to win the Republican
nomination because he was the man she wanted to vote for in
November. She also said she was nervous, being surrounded by so
many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have any Republican friends?'' McCain asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ex-husband,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This is the conundrum that has sent the McCain campaign on its
starkly different tacks over the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   His aides still insist that his speech attacking Robertson and
Falwell was not a mistake, but that it was a moment when the
seat-of-the-pants nature of their campaign _ sometimes its strength
_ worked against them. McCain did not do enough beforehand to lay
the groundwork for the speech, they say. Nor did he make clear
enough that he saw a distinction between the Christian right
leaders and rank-and-file social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   He compounded the problem the next day when, in talking to
reporters on his bus, called the two men ``forces of evil.'' With
his campaign in turmoil he apologized and said he had been joking.
</P>
<P>
   Because the McCain staff is small and made up of people who
enjoy rocking the Republican establishment, it has largely been a
cohesive, even playful group. But last week, the divisions and
backbiting that are usually signs of a losing campaign began to
show.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain decided to skip a debate in California, his
communications director, Daniel Schnur, publicly denounced the
decision as a mistake. Other senior aides told reporters that
Schnur had been fired. McCain himself summoned Schnur and told him
he was not, but he was clearly isolated within the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's revelation that two big campaign contributors to
Bush had spent $2.5 million for attack advertisements against the
senator has brought McCain full circle to his original theme of
cleaning up the campaign finance system. Pointing to the
advertisements, McCain told a crowd in Buffalo: It's not the kind
of politics we will accept in New York, Ohio and California. Go
back. Go back to Texas with your dirty money.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain promised Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that he would
support Bush should he become the Republican nominee, but he added
a proviso. ``I expect Governor Bush to change,'' he said. ``I
expect him to run a different kind of campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked on his campaign bus Saturday whether he still considered
the governor a friend, he lapsed into a long and telling silence,
then spat out, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   A little later he volunteered: ``I didn't say I'd talk to him.
There are all kinds of friends in this world.''

CUSTODY CASE LIKE ELIAN'S GETS MUCH FASTER RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ On the distant edges of the storm that has whipped
around Elian Gonzalez, a similar child-custody case here has been,
at least compared with the Elian situation, quietly and quickly
decided.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases the mothers of the children left a foreign country
for sanctuary in the United States, allegedly without the fathers'
knowledge. And in both cases the fathers have demanded their sons'
return.
</P>
<P>
   One child, 2-year-old Khalil Shanti of Jordan, has been ordered
home. The other, 6-year-old Elian of Cuba, remains here.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, say experts on immigration and Miami politics,
is one of flags, passions and power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate Castro, and we don't hate King Abdullah,'' said David
Abraham, a professor of immigration law at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found floating off the beaches of Fort Lauderdale on
an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day. His mother drowned, along with
10 others, trying to come to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil came to the United States from Amman, Jordan, because his
mother claimed that his father had abused her, and she wanted her
son to grow up in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``A living mother's case should be stronger than a deceased
mother's case,'' Abraham said. ``It is that plain and simple. The
Gonzalez case was only put into question because of the reluctance
of the federal government to deal with Cuba as it deals with Jordan
or any other country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has opened the door to endless mischief in the Gonzalez
case,'' he said, ``and the delay will hurt Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by Elian's father to take him back to the island _
backed by Castro and opposed by the politically powerful Cuban
American National Foundation in Miami _ set off parades, traffic
jams and slowdowns, court hearings, a federal lawsuit and political
meddling on both sides of the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   More than three months later, after many news conferences and
the construction of a tent city for the news media just outside the
boy's house, Elian is still here.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Khalil Shanti, his future has apparently been
decided by one barely publicized family court hearing and eight
hours of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Few people in Miami fly the Jordanian flag from their car's
radio antenna, and no one here, it seems, is willing to lie down in
front of traffic to prevent Khalil's return to Amman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cubans have a different status in this country than everybody
else,'' said Richard Marx, a lawyer representing Maria Eugenia
Pereira, Khalil's mother.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, there arose a question of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   In a custody hearing in Miami on Tuesday, Circuit Judge Henry
Harnage said that the question of Khalil's custody was not within
the jurisdiction of any U.S. court.
</P>
<P>
   His custody must be decided in Jordan, where the child was born
and spent most of his life, Harnage ruled, and then he ordered the
child returned to Jordan within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Pereira said she worried that in Jordan, a male-dominated
society, she has little chance of keeping her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very afraid,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has filed a motion to stay his order while her lawyers
appeal the ruling. But at least, said the child's father, Ibrahim
Shanti, there has been a clear, simple decision.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the day after Khalil's case was decided in a Miami
courtroom, Elian's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, wept before a
Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, pleading with the members
of the committee to find a way to keep Elian in Miami, where he has
lived with his relatives since he was fished from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a hearing on a federal lawsuit intended to block the
boy's return to Cuba is scheduled for Thursday in U.S. District
Court in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has argued that it
should decide the issue, and in January ruled that Elian should
rejoin his father in Cuba. According to the INS, only Elian's
father can speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   But here, where Cuban Americans dominate the political
landscape, everyone from Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican U.S.
representative for Miami, to leaders of the city's many anti-Castro
groups, have swung their weight behind the effort to keep the boy
here. Presidential candidates, who have always courted the Cuban
vote here, have insisted that the boy should stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Khalil case is different in some other ways. Both parents
are U.S. citizens, as is the boy. Shanti, a clothing retailer, met
his wife, Pereira, who is from Puerto Rico, when he was in college
at Barry University in Miami in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He went back to Jordan to work in the family business and she
stayed to go to school at the University of Miami. They married in
1995, in Miami, and went to Jordan to live.
</P>
<P>
   She told the judge that her husband hit her and mistreated her,
and in July she brought the child here for a visit and decided to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Shanti, who said he had never abused his wife in any way, came
to Miami in December to fight for his child, and their lawyers
presented their arguments in the family court hearing last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got out of Jordan because it wasn't safe for her or her
child,'' said Marx, Pereira's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Shanti's lawyer, Elizabeth Baker, said the mother tried to paint
her client as something he was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a 20th-century dad,'' Baker said. ``He was a very
involved father who did everything to help his wife out. He changed
diapers, fed him, played with him, helped watch over him.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanti said he was afraid his wife would try to do with his son
what others have done with Elian. She marched this week in front of
the courthouse carrying a protest sign, and was joined by 10
friends and supporters.
</P>
<P>
   She went to Ros-Lehtinen for help, and got it. The congresswoman
said the community should come out in support of her battle to keep
her child.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little chance of a public outcry one way or another
in an American city where many people consider themselves Cubans
first, and no other issue carries such heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no on-going Cold War with Jordan,'' Abraham said.

PRESIDENT-ELECT DEPLORES PINOCHET WELCOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ The president-elect, Ricardo Lagos, has
harshly criticized the hero's welcome staged by the armed forces
for Gen. Augusto Pinochet's return to Chile last Friday, kindling a
controversy that is testing Lagos' relationship with the
still-powerful military less than a week before he takes power.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Pinochet being welcomed by top army commanders and
a large phalanx of elite special forces wearing black berets and
full combat gear disturbed many Chileans, reopening old worries
about the military's influence and starting a new debate about
whether the former dictator will attend Lagos' inauguration next
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   As the first Socialist to govern Chile since Salvador Allende
was overthrown in a 1973 military coup, Lagos was careful during
and since the presidential campaign to characterize his relations
with the top military brass as respectful and positive. But on
Saturday, during a beach retreat with his future ministers, he told
reporters that ``the country suffered'' from the welcome accorded
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous effort will be made to demonstrate to the world
that this is a democratic country, where authority is chosen by the
people and where the armed forces are disciplined and obedient,''
Lagos said.
</P>
<P>
   They were among the most pointed words a civilian leader has
uttered toward the military since civilian government replaced the
Pinochet dictatorship in 1990 under a constitution that continues
to give the armed forces independent powers over promotions, the
military budget and representation in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos' comments were published as new details emerged about the
ceremony staged for Pinochet, who returned after 16 months of house
arrest outside London under a Spanish warrant. The British home
secretary, Jack Straw, released the former dictator, ruling that he
was not physically or mentally fit to stand trial in Spain on
charges he committed gross human rights abuses during his 17-year
rule.
</P>
<P>
   President Eduardo Frei, a Christian Democrat, was reportedly
infuriated Friday morning when he learned of the military's plans
to welcome Pinochet with speeches and marches in a spectacle that
would be broadcast across the world. He called Gen. Ricardo
Izurieta, the army commander, to complain _ after which the
military ordered hundreds of journalists to leave the arrival area,
saying they were under civilian orders to do so.
</P>
<P>
   After top civilian officials denied that the government had
sought to close the ceremony, journalists were allowed to return.
And in a concession to Frei, neither Izurieta nor anyone else
delivered a speech at the ceremony. Still, the image of Pinochet
smiling, waving his cane to acknowledge his supporters and walking
on his own to a helicopter raised complaints among Cabinet
ministers that he was making a mockery of months of government
efforts to release him on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Several influential legislators in Lagos' Socialist-Christian
Democratic coalition have said they will formally query the Defense
Ministry this week for an explanation as to who decided that the
top commanders of the armed forces would welcome Pinochet and who
gave the initial order to lock out the press.
</P>
<P>
   It is virtually unimaginable that the 84-year-old former
dictator will return to a position of influence. But, by embracing
him, the military seems to want to assure that its own political
position is not unduly damaged by the continuing fallout from
Pinochet's humiliating arrest in London.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's spectacle has jeopardized negotiations between human
rights lawyers and the military over ways to locate hundreds of
political dissidents still missing and believed to have been seized
by the military. Negotiators were to sign a joint statement of
principles this week designed to give the talks renewed momentum
under the incoming government. Now, completion of the document _
more than 90 percent written _ is very much in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Salazar, one of the human rights lawyers involved in the
talks, said the triumphal arrival for Pinochet put the military's
true intentions in a different light. ``The image of the black
berets is a message to the judges that Pinochet is untouchable in
Chile,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet faces 60 criminal complaints of kidnapping, murder and
torture in the Chilean courts, but he continues to have legislative
immunity as a senator. Analysts believe it will take months if not
years of appeals before he will ever stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet spent the better part of his first day in Chile in the
hospital for a medical checkup, then retreated to his Santiago
residence for a quiet weekend, receiving a priest who celebrated
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is he is very tired and he has not spoken much,''
Marco Antonio Pinochet, one of the former dictator's sons, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this low profile, politicians and analysts speculated
over whether Pinochet would attend Lagos' inauguration as a sign
that he intends to continue participating in politics. Aides to
Lagos have said he is not invited. Socialists in Congress said they
were considering ways to protest Pinochet's presence if he
exercises what his conservative supporters and some family members
have argued is his right as a senator to come anyway.

CALIFORNIA MAY GET NATION'S STRICTEST YOUTH CRIME LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When voters in California enter the polling
booths on Tuesday to choose presidential candidates, they will also
decide whether to make radical changes in the law that would be
likely to make this the strictest, most conservative state in the
nation on juvenile crime and punishment.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a ballot initiative sponsored by Pete Wilson, the
former governor who also sponsored the three-strikes-you're-out law
that made the penalty for a third felony conviction _ even for
stealing a slice of pizza _ a minimum of 25 years to life in
prison. Under the initiative, which according to the latest polls
is likely to pass, teen-agers arrested for even minor crimes would
be stripped of many protections currently afforded in juvenile
court and, if convicted, would face many of the same penalties as
adult felons.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, known as the Gang Violence and Juvenile Crime
Prevention Act of 1998, or Proposition 21, would fundamentally
shift the power in many cases from judges to prosecutors;
prosecutors, for example, would no longer have to go before a judge
before deciding whether to charge a juvenile 14 or older as an
adult. It would also emphasize automatic sentencing for certain
offenses and longer sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping changes would come at a time when juvenile crime,
including gang violence, is declining both here and nationally, but
also at a time of continued school shootings, including an incident
last week in Michigan in which a 6-year-old shot and killed a
fellow student of the same age.
</P>
<P>
   The changes include expanding penalties so that youths 14 and
over who are convicted of felonies as adults would automatically be
put in adult prisons; mandating automatic six-month prison terms
for gang members and former gang members convicted of offenses like
under-age drinking and truancy; allowing the release of the names
of juvenile suspects, even before they are formally charged with a
crime; requiring convicted gang members to register with local law
enforcement agencies, and making vandalism resulting in more than
$400 in damage a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 21 has united high school students in opposition
across the state, leading to dozens of rallies and marches in
recent days. But proponents of the measure, including Gov. Gray
Davis, sheriffs' organizations, victims' rights groups and
virtually every district attorney in the state, say Proposition 21
is intended for the small percentage of violent, predatory
criminals who happen to be youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we created the juvenile justice system it was for truants
and kids who got in trouble for stealing bikes,'' said Grover
Trask, the district attorney of Riverside, Calif., and president of
the California District Attorneys Association. He said that out of
76,000 juvenile arrests in the past year in Calif., only a little
more than 2,000 fell within the violent category. Despite a decline
in crime in recent years, he added, the overall trend is still
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last decade, with the insurgence of the gangs that
we've seen and an increase in guns and violence _ I mean,
carjacking wasn't even part of our nomenclature until recently _
we've spent tremendous resources in the juvenile system trying to
figure out what to do with these offenders,'' Trask said.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the initiative, including groups representing
judges and probation officers, as well as youth advocacy and
juvenile justice research organizations, say the ballot measure is
at best unnecessary, since the great majority of juveniles charged
with violent crimes _ more than 80 percent _ are already tried as
adults.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, the opponents say, by eliminating intervention
programs like informal probation, which refers youths to treatment
programs and other community-based alternatives to prison, and
throwing more youths in prison for longer periods, the measure
would sacrifice the lives of young offenders so that politicians
could brag about being tough on crime.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 21 would cost more than $1 billion in construction
costs and $330 million a year to carry out, according to the
state's legislative analyst, or $1.3 billion for construction and
$600 million in annual expenses, according to the National Council
on Crime and Delinquency, which opposes the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if they've taken everything that doesn't work
and put it into a package,'' said Barry Krisberg, president of the
council, a research group based in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies have shown repeatedly that trying juveniles as adults
increases recidivism,'' Krisberg said. ``These studies have been
done in Florida, New Jersey, Utah, Minnesota _ so there's a body of
knowledge out there pointing out that this is not the way to go.
Relative to public safety, 21 will yield no benefit. No study has
ever concluded that there is a positive impact from trying
juveniles as adults.''
</P>
<P>
   The Task Force on Juvenile Crime and the Juvenile Justice
Response, a bipartisan commission convened in 1995 by the state
legislature, concluded that meting out harsher punishment was
ineffective. Instead, the commission found, the vast majority of
studies point to an investment in violence prevention programs,
public education, drug rehabilitation and child care as a way to
deter juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But to its sponsors, like Wilson, Proposition 21 includes both
education and rehabilitation programs directed at nonviolent
juvenile offenders and the empowerment of district attorneys to
directly charge juveniles as adults in cases of extreme violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective of the proposition is to focus the juvenile
justice system's resources on those who can be saved while
protecting the public from members of vicious street gangs who are
both willing and capable of random, senseless violence,'' Wilson
said in a recent op-ed piece in The San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting the power of deciding if youths should be tried as
adults from judges to district attorneys would also streamline the
system, saving resources that could be returned to the juvenile
system for intervention programs, Trask of the district attorneys
association said. He said at least 30 states already use a
combination of methods to decide whether to try youths as adults,
including laws specifying when a youth is to be tried as an adult
and allowing district attorneys to determine when to try a youth in
adult court.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the measure say it will surely lead to a racial
disparity in its application. Kathryn Dresslar, senior policy
advocate at the Children's Advocacy Institute at the University of
San Diego, said that for the same offenses, 88 out of 1,000 Latino
juveniles, 83.7 of 1,000 Asians and 72 out of 1,000
African-Americans are tried as adults, compared with just 37 out of
1,000 whites.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, citing a study by Columbia University,
the consequences are dire for juveniles jailed with adults: they
are five times as likely to be raped, twice as likely to be beaten
and eight times as likely to commit suicide than adults in the
adult prison system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no support for the measure from people who actually
understand this,'' Dresslar said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Field Poll suggests that sentiment on Proposition 21
is directly related to whether voters see a short or long version
of the wording that will appear on the ballot
</P>
<P>
   Response to the short-form wording, which states that
``Proposition 21 provides changes for juvenile felonies _
increasing penalties, changing trial procedures and required
reporting,'' is 47 percent to 30 percent on the ``no'' side. The
long-form wording, which describes the initiative as increasing
punishment for ``gang-related felonies such as home invasion
robbery, carjacking, witness intimidations and drive-by
shootings,'' is favored by 55 percent and opposed by 32 percent,
with 13 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The short description of the initiative will appear on the
ballot in seven counties representing less than 10 percent of
California's registered voters.

U.S. WORRIED ABOUT TENSION ON KOSOVO BORDER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Sunday that the United States is ``very concerned''
about growing tensions in the Presevo valley, the area of Serbia on
the boundary with eastern Kosovo, and that she had spoken to Kosovo
Albanian leaders to urge moderation.
</P>
<P>
   She also urged the Yugoslav government in Belgrade not to
interfere in the area.
</P>
<P>
   An offshoot of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebel military
force, has been training just over the boundary in Serbia,
apparently trying to unite the largely Albanian population in the
Presevo valley with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important that extremists on both sides not be
allowed to disrupt the situation further,'' Albright said after
meeting with the Czech president, Vaclav Havel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been concerned about some activities of the Albanians,
and I spoke to their leadership, and we'll continue to do so,
because we want to work with moderate forces in Kosovo,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that ``the only government involved in disrupting
activities is the one in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright also said that she had spoken Sunday with Bernard
Kouchner, who heads the U.N. administration in Kosovo, and she said
that she and President Clinton were working hard on trying to help
him with ``the most important problems he has'' _ securing money
for day-to-day administration and getting Western governments to
provide the police officers that they have promised.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A half-dozen U.S. insurance companies have begun exploiting a
loophole in federal tax law. By simply moving their headquarters to
Bermuda or being acquired by a Bermuda insurer, they no longer have
to pay income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   If all U.S. property and casualty insurers followed suit, they
could shelter $40 billion a year based on recent profits, avoiding
$7 billion in taxes annually, Treasury officials estimated Sunday.
The Treasury would be deprived of 4 cents of every dollar in income
taxes now collected from corporations of all kinds. State
governments are losing money, too.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of taking advantage of the loophole, four of the
biggest U.S. insurers are trying to demolish this tax shelter. The
insurers _ Chubb, Hartford, Kemper and Liberty Mutual _ realize
that it would be enormously expensive for older companies like
theirs to make use of the shelter, because of other tax
requirements, so they have gone to Congress to turn in their
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that while legal, the arrangement threatens to
reduce drastically the government's revenues. They also say it
discriminates against any property and casualty insurer that
continues to maintain its headquarters in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of fairness,'' said Robert A. Marzocchi, the
chief tax executive at Chubb. ``We can't compete with companies
that are not paying their share of taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The loophole being exploited is the ability to send premiums
collected from customers to a corporate parent in Bermuda and treat
the transfer as a business expense, even though money is simply
being shifted from one part of the company to another.
</P>
<P>
   Companies taking advantage of the Bermuda tax shelter can use
the savings to offer lower prices to customers or keep prices
steady and earn higher profits for shareholders. But the companies
based in the United States, if forced to cut prices to compete,
would see their profits decline.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the U.S. companies were not undercut on price, the tax
advantage would help the Bermuda companies build stronger balance
sheets that would probably be reflected in higher share prices.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest insurers using this tactic is ACE Group of
Cos., a Bermuda company that in the last year has acquired two U.S.
insurers. Others are a New York company called Capital Re and a
Philadelphia company formed from what was once the
property-casualty division of Cigna.
</P>
<P>
   ACE said in a statement that it was abiding by ``longstanding,
well-established international tax rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a global company,'' ACE said, ``we comply fully with the
requirements of all the countries in which we do business,
including the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department, which oversees tax policy, and members
of Congress learned about the practice when representatives of the
four big companies went to Capitol Hill three weeks ago to
complain.
</P>
<P>
   The tax counsel for Democrats on the House Ways and Means
Committee, John Buckley, said he was stunned to see a loophole
that, while legal, was so blatant and, unlike the arcane
transactions in most tax shelters, so easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
   The Bermuda tax shelter differs from those which Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers denounced last week in issuing
regulations designed to shut them down. Summers' attack was focused
on the rapid spread of sham transactions by corporations to evade
taxes, while the Bermuda tax shelter is a legal loophole that had
been unused until last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bermuda tax shelter is unique to the property and casualty
insurance business, which took in an estimated $287 billion in
premiums last year to cover homeowners, drivers, corporations and
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Typically these insurers make little or no profit on the
coverage they provide, because the cost of paying claims and
running the company generally equals or exceeds the amount of money
collected from customers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, their profits come from investing the premiums their
customers pay from the time they are collected until they are paid
out in claims.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States these investment earnings are subject to
the 35 percent corporate income tax and about 5 percent in state
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Bermuda does not tax corporate profits. By moving its
headquarters there, an insurer can put the investment income on the
books of its Bermuda offices, beyond the reach of the Internal
Revenue Service. The unprofitable part of the business is kept in
the United States. So not only can the insurer avoid taxes on its
profits but its U.S. unit may actually collect tax refunds by
reporting losses.
</P>
<P>
   There are other countries that do not tax corporate profits. But
Bermuda has become the haven of choice for insurance companies in
recent years because of light regulation and because of its growing
pool of insurance experts.
</P>
<P>
   For years, U.S. insurers ignored the tax advantages enjoyed by
Bermuda companies, because those companies did not compete with
them and in fact complemented their own business. The Bermuda
companies offered the U.S. insurers reinsurance _ insurance on
insurance _ to lower their liability in the event of catastrophes
like big hurricanes. The Bermuda companies also sold large
liability policies directly to U.S. corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Both the reinsurance and large liability coverage typically
kicked in at high levels, often after claims exceeded $100 million.
The U.S. insurers were happy to give up the big-ticket coverage,
because it would have required them to set aside huge reserves on
which they would have had to pay taxes, making the business less
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   But Bermuda companies began to appear threatening to the U.S.
insurers early last year, when ACE, a young and fast-growing
company, bought the property-casualty business of venerable Cigna
Corp. in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cigna acquisition, a Bermuda company was for the first
time competing directly in the primary business of the big U.S.
insurers: selling all kinds of coverage to U.S. corporations,
taking responsibility for losses as low as a few thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This was the bread and butter of the U.S. insurers, and now the
U.S. companies have to compete with an insurer that does not have
to pay income taxes. ACE is not required to disclose its tax
savings from the deal until later this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Cigna transaction, X.L. Capital Ltd., another
big Bermuda insurance company, bought a small Connecticut reinsurer
called Nac Re. The change in Nac Re's revenues potentially subject
to U.S. taxes was dramatic. In the first nine months of last year,
X.L. Capital's new U.S. subsidiary reported an 82 percent drop in
revenues from the corresponding period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Giordano, X.L.'s general counsel, acknowledged the decline
in premium revenue reported by the company's new U.S. subsidiary.
But he said that lower premium revenue does not translate directly
into tax savings and that it is unclear what savings, if any, will
result from the purchase of Nac Re.
</P>
<P>
   He accused critics of ``distorting the numbers'' reported by Nac
Re ``for their own purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a protectionist effort by four American companies,''
Giordano said. ``We're just arguing to continue to have the ability
to run our business by complying with the laws that are on the
books today.''
</P>
<P>
   Within months of the Nac Re purchase by X.L., Everest
Reinsurance Holdings and PX Re, both New Jersey companies,
announced plans to move their headquarters to Bermuda. So did
Trenwick Group of Connecticut and White Mountain Insurance Group of
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with trade publications, the companies that moved
their headquarters to Bermuda all cited untaxed profits as a prime
reason for the move.
</P>
<P>
   The big U.S. companies are wary of moving to Bermuda, because
they would face whopping initial expenses beyond setting up new
offices.
</P>
<P>
   When a U.S. company reorganizes as a Bermuda company, the change
is treated for tax purposes as a sale. So the company or its
shareholders must pay taxes on the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   This makes the Bermuda tax shelter more attractive to new
companies than to companies that have been in business for decades,
like Hartford and Chubb. The new companies have probably
appreciated less in value than the old ones, so their capital-gains
taxes on such transactions would be lower.
</P>
<P>
   The four big companies want Congress to change the law so if a
Bermuda company is within the same corporate family as the U.S.
insurer, the company must pay U.S. income taxes. Bermuda companies
that merely sell reinsurance to independent U.S. firms would not be
affected by this proposed change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're mainly concerned about a level playing field,'' said
William Malchodi, Hartford's senior tax executive. ``We're
concerned that companies could use this tax advantage to cut their
prices.''

A WHITE HOUSE ADVISER MOVES FROM HARDBALL TO HOOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Conn.)  (mk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton was scheduled to throw out the
first pitch at a Baltimore Orioles game a couple of years ago and
his staff was nervous that he would embarrass himself by dribbling
the ball in front of home plate or heaving it over the catcher's
head.
</P>
<P>
   Come on out on the South Lawn for a few practice throws, they
urged him. But Clinton, your more-than-typical male, refused. I can
throw the ball 60 feet, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Sosnik, the president's fearless senior adviser, spoke up.
``Need I remind you, sir, that in high school you were in the
band?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took the practice tosses, and America's pastime was safe
once again.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six years, on matters small and large, Sosnik has
been one of the most influential members of the president's staff,
and one of the least known to the public. He left the White House
last week for a senior position with the National Basketball
Association in his typically quiet way, with no public ceremony or
presidential proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   But at a gathering 10 days ago (held, fittingly, in the White
House gym, where Sosnik spent a part of most mornings on a
Stairmaster), Clinton and other aides mourned the loss of Sosnik's
discretion and casual charm. The entire senior staff wore blue
jeans and gray sweatshirts to work that day, mimicking Sosnik's
typical West Wing attire.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the chief of staff, told the (apocryphal) story of
a recent Oval Office meeting involving the president, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader. After one tense exchange, Arafat turned to Sosnik, who was
slouched in his customary position on the couch, and said, ``Could
you please sit up and make some room for me?''
</P>
<P>
   In Sosnik's years at the White House, his titles have included
political director, counselor to the president and senior adviser
for policy and strategy. But those titles do not begin to capture
his role _ or his Huck Finn personality.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled constantly with the president, playing hearts for
hours in Air Force One and, unlike the president's other card
partners, gloating openly when he won. He was the personal and
professional counselor to much of the West Wing staff, an unlikely
role for a 43-year-old wise guy who prefers the company of
reporters to that of politicians. He is one of the Democratic
Party's most astute analysts, an expert reader of polls and pols.
He was a fount of levity in a place that has seen more than its
share of grim days.
</P>
<P>
   One of his jobs was to deliver bad news to the president, a task
shared with several others. Clinton has noted that he appreciated
the candor with which Sosnik brought him ill tidings _ but he
wished Sosnik didn't seem to enjoy it so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say anything you want to him, as long as you can back
it up,'' Sosnik said in a telephone interview from India, a stop on
a round-the-world odyssey between jobs. ``If you can't back it up,
he'll kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosnik said part of his job was to be Clinton's ``punching bag''
when things got dicey, but quickly added that Clinton's reputed
volcanic temper was exaggerated. ``He is a human being and he has
been under tremendous frustration and pressure and I was the one
who participated in some of those `discussions' when he was
unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosnik grew up in Winston-Salem, N.C. His father was a furniture
dealer and his mother was a radio commentator. He jumped into
politics in 1980, the year after he graduated from Duke University,
serving as driver for Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. Dodd later
joked that he campaigned a lot in Rhode Island and Massachusetts
because Sosnik was forever getting lost.
</P>
<P>
   He left politics a few years later and bummed around the world,
meeting his future wife, Fabiana Jorge, in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
in 1987. She now works at the Washington law firm Verner, Liipfert,
Bernhard, McPherson &AMP; Hand, drumming up business in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Sosnik returned to politics in 1988, working on Michael S.
Dukakis' presidential campaign and later at the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee. He became Dodd's chief of staff
in 1991, then moved to the White House in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Few Clinton White House officials have had the license Sosnik
had to speak truth to the president, a privilege earned over
several years of giving sound advice.
</P>
<P>
   Sosnik also earned the trust of many staff members who refused
to speak to one another. He served as courier between Harold M.
Ickes and Dick Morris, bitter enemies who co-directed Clinton's
1996 re-election campaign. He was the liaison between Clinton's
lawyers and his political advisers during the Lewinsky scandal. He
rescued Michael D. McCurry, the former press secretary, from the
wrath of the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton after he made an
off-color remark about the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Sosnik's participation in the aggressive fund-raising of the
1996 campaign earned him several subpoenas and large legal bills,
but he does not appear to be in any legal jeopardy now. He was
never called before the federal grand jury that investigated the
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the grease in the joints of the White House that kept
metal from rubbing on metal,'' Podesta said. ``At times of high
tension or deep conflict, his laugh and sense of humor and ability
to drop in a one-liner always lightened the place up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That said,'' Podesta added, ``he's got a totally lousy
fadeaway jump shot.''

MENDOZA ROLLS TO WIN, MAKES IT FOUR STRAIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Don't ever underestimate the value of experience.
</P>
<P>
   That lesson - which should already be drummed into our heads -
was provided by wily Felix Trinidad when he disassembled David Reid
to win the WBA junior middleweight title here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reid has the physical tools to compete with Trinidad. He proved
that in the first six rounds of the fight, after which he led by
two points on all cards.
</P>
<P>
   He also has the courage. That he was standing on his feet at the
final bell is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   However, with only 14 fights worth of experience, he lost his
way at the two key junctions of the fight and squandered any chance
to win as a result.
</P>
<P>
   One, he failed to follow up after he put Trinidad down with a
straight right in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   A more experienced fighter or perhaps one with a more aggressive
nature would've delivered a flurry of hard punches at least until
it was clear Trinidad had recovered. Reid, overly cautious, wasted
a rare opportunity by standing back and admiring his work.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, Reid fell apart after the resounding left hook
Trinidad landed in the seventh round.
</P>
<P>
   The young Philadelphia fighter, who staggered to the ropes and
then fell, appeared to be hurt physically and psychologically. In
other words, he lost his legs and his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   A more experienced fighter would've understood that all who step
into the ring are faced with such moments. The idea is to do what
it takes to survive, clear your head and get back to the game plan.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad is the perfect example. He knows he can recover from a
knockdown and win convincingly. He's done it many times - and he
did it again against Reid.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he said, he told himself as he sat on the canvas:
``When I get up, it's going to be all over for David Reid.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Mitchell, Reid's trainer, admitted that such composure
gleaned from many years in the ring often is the difference in a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For six rounds, we weren't outclassed. And then the experience
set in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the type of brutal beating from which it's
difficult to bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Reid will fight again. However, his confidence - a
tremendously invaluable commodity in this business - had to be
damaged. Only time will tell when or if it will return to its
pre-Trinidad level.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it's clear that promoter Dan Goossen and others
who guide Reid's career made a terrible mistake: They pushed him
too hard, too fast.
</P>
<P>
   The guy won a gold medal in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. He won a
world championship by outpointing tough, but limited Laurent
Boudouani in only his 12th fight. His future seemed to be
limitless.
</P>
<P>
   A year or two from now, after another six, seven fights, he
might've been ready to face the likes of Felix Trinidad. On Friday,
he wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, those who guide the careers of other talented young
fighters were watching.
</P>
<P>
   Big statement: Trinidad regained any respect he might've lost in
his disappointing performance against Oscar De La Hoya in
September.
</P>
<P>
   He's an efficient boxer with considerable power. And, obviously
more comfortable at 154 pounds than 147, he even seemed to be
quicker than he was against De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   However, he still seems to have trouble when his opponent moves
well. Reid, even with his limited experience, was winning halfway
through the fight because of his movement.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad will always have trouble with a fighter like De La
Hoya, one who can move well, has quick hands and has enough power
to hurt an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya-Trinidad: Don't expect to see a rematch between De La
Hoya and Trinidad this year.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, committed to fighting Shane Mosley in June,
according to Bob Arum, his promoter, is also committed to remaining
at 147 pounds for at least a year. Meanwhile, Trinidad, who looked
comfortable at 154 in his victory over Reid, won't go back down to
the welterweight limit.
</P>
<P>
   A ``catch weight'' of around 150 is possible, but unlikely.
Neither side seems willing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the money - $20 million each - is a compelling
incentive. However, both fighters can make plenty against other
big-name opponents while they wait for De La Hoya to move up to
154.
</P>
<P>
   Arum compared the rivalry to that of Sugar Ray Leonard and
Thomas Hearns, who fought in 1981 and then not again until 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He said the fighters made more money in the second fight.
However, it had lost much of its significance six years after the
fact.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope De La Hoya and Trinidad don't wait that long.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead: Trinidad actually has more compelling options
than De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   The Puerto Rican could face the winner of the April 15 Fernando
Vargas-Ike Quartey bout and there's talk that middleweight champ
Bernand Hopkins might move down to junior middleweight to get in on
the action.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is talking about fighting Vernon Forrest, Shannan
Taylor and Arturo Gatti if he fights and beats Mosley in June.
</P>
<P>
   Staples: Arum, who has yet to decide whether De La Hoya and
Mosley will fight at Staples Center or Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas,
is scheduled to meet with Staples Center officials today.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said L.A. is the ``front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens here (in Las Vegas), it will be written about as
a good fight,'' he said. ``If it happens in L.A., with both
fighters from L.A., it will be more of an event.'' De La Hoya and
Mosley have yet to sign for the fight but Arum said a formal
announcement could come as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Interested bystander: Vargas, who was in Las Vegas for the
fight, said Reid lost his best chance to beat Trinidad in the third
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't really take a lot for (Trinidad) to get hurt,'' he
said. ``I don't think (Reid) capitalized on that. I think he was
intimidated by Trinidad's presence more than anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he wanted to throw, I thought he was connecting good and
that any moment Trinidad could go.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas is an early 2-1 favorite to beat Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   Regrets: Johnny Tapia had to be watching Paulie Ayala's title
defense against Johnny Bredahl on Saturday and wondering: How did
that guy beat me?
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, who last year handed Tapia his first defeat and was named
The Ring's magazine's Fighter of the Year as a result, looked
ordinary against Bredahl, an active but weak-punching European
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala has good but not great boxing skills and is tough.
However, he's easy to hit and he has no power.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong call: Christy Martin's victory over Belinda Laracuente on
the Trinidad-Reid undercard was the latest shameful example of a
house fighter receiving an undeserved decision.
</P>
<P>
   Laracuente, a skillful boxer, made Martin look foolish and won
at least five of eight rounds. Still, Martin was awarded a majority
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Martin fights for promoter Don King.
</P>
<P>
   More Martin: We might've seen Martin vs. Lucia Rijker for the
first and last time.
</P>
<P>
   At a public workout last week in L.A. to promote the
Trinidad-Reid card, Rijker confronted Martin about disparaging
comments Martin had made about her. Martin pushed her and Rijker
decked her with a left hook. Moments later, Martin went after
Rijker and was nailed with another punch.
</P>
<P>
   Score it two 10-8 rounds for Rijker. However, she might lose in
the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to reward that kind of behavior,'' King said.
``I'm not interested in a (Martin) fight with Lucia Rijker.''
</P>
<P>
   Rijker, recognized as far superior to Martin in ability, has
been trying to lure Martin into the ring for years.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Bridget Riley of Burbank is scheduled to fight
April 13 at the Pond. Her opponent has yet to be determined....
</P>
<P>
   Shibata Flores, the WBA's No. 3-ranked junior middleweight who
has fought many times in the L.A. area, will face Paul Vaden on the
Vargas-Quartey undercard.

 &HT;    Jeff Burton soaks up another easy win
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Jeff Burton, NASCAR's ``Rain Man'', hit the jackpot
again at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Burton took the checkered flag at the rain-shortened
CarsDirect.com 400 on Sunday. He followed by Tony Stewart and Roush
Racing teammate Mark Martin at the Winston Cup event, which was
called after 148 of 267 laps.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, Burton and a paired fan, Joyce Williams of Texas,
were each given a $1 million bonus as part of the Winston No Bull 5
promotion. Las Vegas, the gambling capital of the world, was the
perfect setting for Burton winning for the third time in the last
five No Bull races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great weekend for us, no doubt,'' Burton said. ``The
rain certainly made it easier for us, but we were in a good
situation regardless. The fastest car won the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, it was third rain-shortened race in row that Burton
has won, dating back to his sweep of the Darlington races from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take (the wins) any way we can get them,'' Burton said
with a grin. ``If we keep winning races like this, we'll hand out
umbrellas or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart, who had his best performance of the season, can't
figure out Burton's string of fortune in inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Burton) just has got that luck,'' Stewart said. ``Whatever's
he is doing I'm going to go rub on him, touch him rub his head or
do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than the winner, Bill Elliott had the most impressive
performance of the day. He struggled mightily in qualifying,
starting Sunday's event all the way back at the 37th position. He
ended up at fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who will announce his switch from Ford to Dodge for the
2001 season at Atlanta Motor Speedway this week, already has more
top 5 finishes (2) through only three races than he did all of last
year (1). He has sky-rocketed to sixth in the Winston Cup points
standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I was lucky,'' Elliott said. ``I thought if we could
finish in the top 20, I'd be tickled to death. I know I was very
discouraged when I left this place on Friday (after qualifying).''
</P>
<P>
   Burton has owned the 1.5-mile oval over the last two seasons,
sweeping the Busch and Winston Cup races each year. Sunday's
outcome was the result of a minor gamble by crew chief Frank
Stoddard.
</P>
<P>
   Stoddard, who had been observing the weather forecast throughout
the day, ordered Burton to pit earlier than normal as the rain
clouds approached. At lap 136, Burton passed Martin and held on to
the lead for the final 13 laps.

REID LEARNS LESSON THE HARD WAY

   Trinidad is the perfect example. He knows he can recover from a
knockdown and win convincingly. He's done it many times - and he
did it again against Reid.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he said, he told himself as he sat on the canvas:
``When I get up, it's going to be all over for David Reid.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Mitchell, Reid's trainer, admitted that such composure
gleaned from many years in the ring often is the difference in a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For six rounds, we weren't outclassed. And then the experience
set in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the type of brutal beating from which it's
difficult to bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Reid will fight again. However, his confidence - a
tremendously invaluable commodity in this business - had to be
damaged. Only time will tell when or if it will return to its
pre-Trinidad level.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it's clear that promoter Dan Goossen and others
who guide Reid's career made a terrible mistake: They pushed him
too hard, too fast.
</P>
<P>
   The guy won a gold medal in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. He won a
world championship by outpointing tough, but limited Laurent
Boudouani in only his 12th fight. His future seemed to be
limitless.
</P>
<P>
   A year or two from now, after another six, seven fights, he
might've been ready to face the likes of Felix Trinidad. On Friday,
he wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, those who guide the careers of other talented young
fighters were watching.
</P>
<P>
   Big statement: Trinidad regained any respect he might've lost in
his disappointing performance against Oscar De La Hoya in
September.
</P>
<P>
   He's an efficient boxer with considerable power. And, obviously
more comfortable at 154 pounds than 147, he even seemed to be
quicker than he was against De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   However, he still seems to have trouble when his opponent moves
well. Reid, even with his limited experience, was winning halfway
through the fight because of his movement.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad will always have trouble with a fighter like De La
Hoya, one who can move well, has quick hands and has enough power
to hurt an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya-Trinidad: Don't expect to see a rematch between De La
Hoya and Trinidad this year.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, committed to fighting Shane Mosley in June,
according to Bob Arum, his promoter, is also committed to remaining
at 147 pounds for at least a year. Meanwhile, Trinidad, who looked
comfortable at 154 in his victory over Reid, won't go back down to
the welterweight limit.
</P>
<P>
   A ``catch weight'' of around 150 is possible, but unlikely.
Neither side seems willing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the money - $20 million each - is a compelling
incentive. However, both fighters can make plenty against other
big-name opponents while they wait for De La Hoya to move up to
154.
</P>
<P>
   Arum compared the rivalry to that of Sugar Ray Leonard and
Thomas Hearns, who fought in 1981 and then not again until 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He said the fighters made more money in the second fight.
However, it had lost much of its significance six years after the
fact.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope De La Hoya and Trinidad don't wait that long.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead: Trinidad actually has more compelling options
than De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   The Puerto Rican could face the winner of the April 15 Fernando
Vargas-Ike Quartey bout and there's talk that middleweight champ
Bernand Hopkins might move down to junior middleweight to get in on
the action.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is talking about fighting Vernon Forrest, Shannan
Taylor and Arturo Gatti if he fights and beats Mosley in June.
</P>
<P>
   Staples: Arum, who has yet to decide whether De La Hoya and
Mosley will fight at Staples Center or Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas,
is scheduled to meet with Staples Center officials today.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said L.A. is the ``front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens here (in Las Vegas), it will be written about as
a good fight,'' he said. ``If it happens in L.A., with both
fighters from L.A., it will be more of an event.'' De La Hoya and
Mosley have yet to sign for the fight but Arum said a formal
announcement could come as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Interested bystander: Vargas, who was in Las Vegas for the
fight, said Reid lost his best chance to beat Trinidad in the third
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't really take a lot for (Trinidad) to get hurt,'' he
said. ``I don't think (Reid) capitalized on that. I think he was
intimidated by Trinidad's presence more than anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he wanted to throw, I thought he was connecting good and
that any moment Trinidad could go.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas is an early 2-1 favorite to beat Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   Regrets: Johnny Tapia had to be watching Paulie Ayala's title
defense against Johnny Bredahl on Saturday and wondering: How did
that guy beat me?
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, who last year handed Tapia his first defeat and was named
The Ring's magazine's Fighter of the Year as a result, looked
ordinary against Bredahl, an active but weak-punching European
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala has good but not great boxing skills and is tough.
However, he's easy to hit and he has no power.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong call: Christy Martin's victory over Belinda Laracuente on
the Trinidad-Reid undercard was the latest shameful example of a
house fighter receiving an undeserved decision.
</P>
<P>
   Laracuente, a skillful boxer, made Martin look foolish and won
at least five of eight rounds. Still, Martin was awarded a majority
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Martin fights for promoter Don King.
</P>
<P>
   More Martin: We might've seen Martin vs. Lucia Rijker for the
first and last time.
</P>
<P>
   At a public workout last week in L.A. to promote the
Trinidad-Reid card, Rijker confronted Martin about disparaging
comments Martin had made about her. Martin pushed her and Rijker
decked her with a left hook. Moments later, Martin went after
Rijker and was nailed with another punch.
</P>
<P>
   Score it two 10-8 rounds for Rijker. However, she might lose in
the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to reward that kind of behavior,'' King said.
``I'm not interested in a (Martin) fight with Lucia Rijker.''
</P>
<P>
   Rijker, recognized as far superior to Martin in ability, has
been trying to lure Martin into the ring for years.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Bridget Riley of Burbank is scheduled to fight
April 13 at the Pond. Her opponent has yet to be determined....
</P>
<P>
   Shibata Flores, the WBA's No. 3-ranked junior middleweight who
has fought many times in the L.A. area, will face Paul Vaden on the
Vargas-Quartey undercard.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Al Gore sat at a makeshift desk in the
holding area _ the band room at William M. Raines High School _ a
few minutes before he was to address the student body, and
autographed a stack of photographs while whispering to a staff
member over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally he questioned the aides standing around him about
various logistical matters _ not too sharply, but without wasting a
lot of words like ``please'' and ``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be doing a couple more tasks,'' joked Sen. Bob
Graham of Florida, who was joining the campaign for part of the
day. Gore warmed right up, turned his attention to his guest and
chatted about raising cattle, until someone announced, ``Sir, ready
when you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, while waiting briefly outside the school gym, listening to
the band playing and the students clapping, the vice president
broke into a little dance, shuffling his feet and flailing his arms
in a goofy soft-shoe that his staff says he often does to loosen up
before a speech. This time he got so carried away that he missed
his cue, and Graham had to give him a push: ``It's show time!''
</P>
<P>
   Like all presidential candidates, Gore accomplishes most of the
work of running for office offstage, out of the public view. He
spends far less time giving speeches or debating his Democratic
rival, Bill Bradley, than he does on the phone massaging
supporters. Or going over the details that are only minor when you
get them right. Or, even as vice president, just waiting.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, Gore allowed a reporter to watch the way he and
his aides spent a few of the hours between campaign events.
Probably no candidate could be completely unguarded in that
situation, yet the vice president came across as both more brusque
at some moments and more playful at others than the Al Gore who
shows up for rallies and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he granted such access, a few days before Super
Tuesday, speaks to a new confidence, a growing sense that, as he
said, ``I'm in the groove now.'' And the exercise did offer at
least a glimpse of a man who, after a couple of years in which he
was repeatedly counted out, suddenly seems to be trying very hard
to keep from laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer his staff members, with their infighting, were
making more headlines than the candidate. Now they seemed good
company for one another, and a few minutes into Gore's stump speech
to the students at Raines High, they started drifting back to the
holding room to return phone calls and trade one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign manager, Donna Brazile, was lining up surrogates to
campaign for Gore in the states that have elections on Tuesday, and
another senior adviser, Michael Feldman, was pretending to lobby
her for a new assignment: ``Need any surrogates in Hawaii? I'm big
there,'' he told her, while simultaneously talking on the phone to
a colleague in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we're live! Fox and CNN are both live'' with the speech
that the boss was giving across the hall, he reported to Brazile.
``It looks great,'' Feldman told his friend on the phone. ``How's
it look on TV?''
</P>
<P>
   After the event, Gore had just a few minutes to tape a telephone
call that was to go to households across the country just before
the elections on Tuesday, but he did not seem thrilled with the
copy: ``They're writing 45-second scripts and telling me to hold it
to 30 seconds!'' he complained. Then, just as he started to tape, a
message blasted over the school's public address system. Deep sigh,
and then, finally, success.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, let's go, let's go,'' he said to no one in particular.
``And where's the makeup lady? We're going to have to download that
e-mail and I'll take it in the car while I'm doing calls.''
</P>
<P>
   From there he ran to another classroom to do several television
interviews, ``beginning with the most important market in the
country, Portland, Maine,'' joked Gore's press secretary, Chris
Lehane, who is from there. Most of the interviews were by
satellite, and most interviewers asked the same questions.
</P>
<P>
   On the sentencing of his friend and longtime fund-raiser, Maria
Hsia, for arranging illegal donations to the Democratic Party in
1996: ``The jury has spoken. It's a sad time for her. I support
campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   On the return of John Rocker to the Atlanta Braves: ``I didn't
see his statement yesterday. But people make mistakes and if they
go about it in the right way they can seek redemption.''
</P>
<P>
   And invariably, whether he is feeling confident that Bill
Bradley will be nothing but a memory by Tuesday night: ``I'm not
taking a single vote for granted,'' he said. ``The pollsters don't
decide the outcome. The people do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back to Air Force II, where Gore sometimes lifts
weights and does situps in his office. And on to Atlanta where,
just before stepping down to meet the receiving line of dignitaries
and a group of supporters, he got a quick briefing from his staff.
</P>
<P>
   First, pre-emptively addressing the fact that the landing was 10
minutes late _ Gore is a stickler for punctuality _ trip director
David Morehouse noted, ``We're virtually on time.'' And Lehane
seconded it: ``We're within the window.'' Another aide, Wendy New,
tried to surreptitiously peek out the window to report on who was
there.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, was glancing at his briefing papers and
laughing: ``I see someone sitting next to me tonight at dinner is
deaf in one ear so I have to talk louder,'' he said. ``But it
doesn't say which ear or which side of me he's sitting on. Now
that's the difference between attention to detail and skimming the
surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else laughed, but later Brazile said: ``You see how he
needles us? I guarantee you, before dinner he will know which side
and which ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Then on to a reception and another round of television
interviews, at which he again said that it was a sad day for Maria
Hsia, that he was not the general manager of the Braves so would
not be drawn into that hypothetical situation. And repeatedly _
twice to the same interviewer, in fact, _ he said he was not taking
a single vote for granted.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more than fair, however, to say Gore was not in a
mood that suggested he expected to to lose. That evening he was
stuck for a couple of hours in a holding room at Atlanta's Hyatt
Regency, waiting to speak at the Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``See the luxury,'' he said of the space, which was actually a
corner of a hallway with curtains drawn across each end.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While he waited, he whistled, clapped out the rhythm of a school
cheer he had heard that morning at Raines, and greeted the friends
who stopped with bear hugs.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed disappointed when a Secret Service agent told him that
he could not work the room. ``Would that be crazy to try and mingle
a little?'' Gore asked. ``Yes sir,'' the agent told him. ``Too
disruptive?'' Gore asked. ``Yes sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Periodically he would look at his speech and retool it yet
again, at one point removing an anecdote about the governor's wife
shopping at Kmart. ``It seems silly,'' he told New.
</P>
<P>
   ``That story was in all the papers down here,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if it's been in all the papers and they've all heard
it,'' Gore said, ``why would I want to say it?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even when it looked as though his spot on the program might
make him so late that he would not get to Boston until early
morning, he told an aide, ``Tell the governor I'm cool.''
</P>
<P>
   And he kept himself amused, laughing like a child while plotting
a practical joke that he still hopes to spring on his well-liked
press secretary, Lehane. (It was the only time that Gore insisted
on going off the record.)
</P>
<P>
   One more time that day he was asked that same question about how
he felt. And while leaving no doubt that he was still not taking a
single vote for granted, he did say this: ``I'm in the groove. Like
the other day I called Jerry Brown just to check in, and he said,
`I want to endorse you,' and then I called the mayor of San Jose,
and he said, `I want to endorse you,' so we ended up having this
great event in San Francisco with the three mayors of the three
biggest cities in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I went to Washington, where Bradley had decided to make
his stand, and out of the blue when I was in Seattle this family
asked me for help with a medical problem and I got a chance to do a
good deed,'' he said, referring to his intervention on behalf of a
6-month-old boy born with severe brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   After Gore made the case public, the insurance company, Aetna
Inc., reversed a decision denying coverage, and the boy's father
rejoiced that the vice president had saved his son's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to describe,'' Gore said, ``but I can feel that
things are just clicking, you know? I can feel it. And it's kind of
like that old saying, `The harder I work, the luckier I get.'''

MENDOZA ROLLS TO WIN, MAKES IT FOUR STRAIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Saul Mendoza grew up in Mexico and now resides in
the small Georgia town of Snellville, but for one day every year,
he becomes an adopted citizen of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I race on the street, I hear people yelling out in
Spanish, `Go Mendoza!' and I think, `That's cool,''' said Mendoza,
who won the men's wheelchair competition Sunday in the Los Angeles
Marathon for the fourth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are a lot of Hispanics out there, and I guess now
they know who I am. That always gives me a little kick and some
extra motivation to keep going strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, 33, didn't need much extra ``kick'' on Sunday. He
pulled away from his rival, Heinz Frei of Switzerland, with a push
in the third mile, and was never seriously challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Frei was forced to withdraw after the 17th mile because of
undisclosed medical reasons, and Mendoza went on to victory in one
hour, 42 minutes and 33 seconds. Second-place finisher Joel Jeannot
of France finished in 1:44:24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heinz and I were pushing together for the first three miles,
but I felt very strong so I just decided to go,'' Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza and Frei battle all over the world, but Mendoza seems to
have a lock on Los Angeles. He competed in 1991, '94 and '96
without winning, but began his amazing streak in '97, making Los
Angeles the highlight of his global tour.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, bound to a wheelchair after a bout with polio in his
childhood, is just now entering what is considered a wheelchair
racer's prime, his mid-30s. Mendoza counts second-place finishes in
Boston and Chicago among his top races, but keeps Los Angeles at
the top of his list of favorites for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I love the course,'' Mendoza said. ``The course
has a lot of hills, and that's when I race my best, on that kind of
course. This is also one of the toughest courses in the world, and
it's at the beginning of our season. Everybody always wants to do
good here, to get a good start to his season.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza couldn't have started any better, though the weather did
complicate his effort. For a wheelchair racer, navigating hills and
turns at speeds of up to 25 mph is tricky by itself. Slippery
conditions makes the event downright dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, Mendoza used a special, extra-strong glue on his
gloves to help him maintain a good grip for steering and speed. The
weather, however, didn't change Mendoza's strategy very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't bother me very much, because I had a good grip all
day,'' Mendoza said. ``You have to be really careful when you're
coming downhill and you have to make a turn, because it's easy to
lose control, but I felt great all day. Plus, everybody has to deal
with the conditions, it's not only me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said he typically doesn't like to lead the entire race.
Following closely behind the leader, also known as drafting, allows
a racer to avoid the brunt of the wind and conditions, but in this
case it didn't help much. Mendoza pulled away early and never
looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really want to draft, because if you follow somebody
in conditions like this, you get all the rain and stuff in your
face from his wheels,'' Mendoza said. ``I felt good running in
front, because I had a big lead and I felt comfortable. ``I was a
little confused because Heinz wasn't racing close to me at all, but
that motivated me to make the lead even bigger. I just wanted to
concentrate and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   A return to Los Angeles in 2001 is likely for Mendoza. A fifth
consecutive victory would only add to his legend, even if it would
put off retirement another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm supposed to be in my best years for racing, but I
think about retiring sometimes, so I can rest,'' Mendoza said.
``But if I keep racing good and winning, why should I stop?''

THE POWER BROKER: THE MAN BEHIND THE MCCAIN ATTACK ADS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sam Wyly, the wealthy Dallas investor, has spent
a lot of money in recent years on two goals that suddenly converged
last week: Boosting the political career of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas and improving the fortunes of his Vermont-based power
company.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly, a major figure in the cozy world of Texas business and
Republican politics for more than three decades, last week admitted
paying $2.5 million for televised advertisements attacking the
environmental record of Sen. John McCain, who is battling Bush for
the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials deny playing any role in the advertisements,
which Wyly said were produced solely by him and his son. But the
flap, coming just before the primaries that could decide the
nomination, has focused attention on a central member of the
wealthy group of Texas businessmen who have played a large role
bankrolling Bush's 7-year political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the elite,'' said Craig McDonald, director of
Texans for Public Justice, a nonprofit group in Austin that tracks
money in Texas politics. ``He's one of the movers and shakers. He's
very big money in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said donations by Wyly and his brother, Charles, to
both of Bush's campaigns for governor totaled about $210,000,
putting them behind only Enron Corp. and members of the Bass
family, the Fort Worth billionaires, as the largest source of
Bush's money for those races.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly, in an interview on Friday, said he ``of course'' hoped
that the advertisements would aid Bush's chances against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see all the congressmen and senators and
everybody who's running for everything talking about clean air,''
Wyly said. ``We have a mission for clean air through clean energy.
We're just getting started. This won't be the only primary or the
only election we'll be bringing our issue to.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the $2.5 million advertising buy, which is paying
for advertisements that run through Tuesday, may be expanded.
``We're thinking about doing more and doing it nationwide, but we
haven't made a decision on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Smith, a longtime environmental activist at the Texas
statehouse, said he met Wyly last spring while lawmakers in Austin
debated a bill that would open the Texas electric utility industry
to competition, which could help Greenmountain.com, a South
Burlington, Vt., concern that Wyly's family has invested in, by
allowing customers to buy renewable energy in the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the Texas director of Ralph Nader's group, Public
Citizen, was concerned that provisions requiring certain coal-fired
power plants to reduce their pollution might be left out of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly ``allowed that he was a major donor to both the older and
younger Bushes, and he asked how he could help.'' Smith told him to
go lobby the governor, which he said Wyly did. Eventually, the bill
passed with the provision. ``Wyly was helpful, though I'm not sure
he was pivotal. But he certainly got the governor's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was impressed with Wyly, who he said appeared to
be seriously committed to environmental causes. But he added that
many environmentalists had doubts about how environmentally
friendly Wyly's energy company actually is, and that they have also
been critical of Bush's environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   Further, he said, the episode ``is a crystalline example of what
donors get from Bush for their contributions _ an opportunity to
make their pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wolens, the Democratic legislator who wrote the House
version of the bill, said he met with Wyly for almost three hours
last year, but that Wyly never sought to influence him on specific
provisions of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was obsessed with talking about the environment. I just
wasn't expecting it from a Republican,'' said Wolens, who said he
was surprised by Wyly's views on a number of issues, including
support for abortion rights. ``There was nothing right wing about
the man at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials confirm that Wyly met with Bush to lobby him, but
they said the power-plant provisions had Bush's support anyway. Dan
Bartlett, a Bush spokesman, added that Bush ``met with all kinds of
people'' on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his brother, the 65-year-old Wyly oversees a family
fortune that some estimate at $1 billion, made through computer
services, oil and mining, steakhouses, retailing, e-commerce, and a
large hedge fund that invests money for institutions and wealthy
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wyly's early years are reminiscent of another
politically active Dallas computer services executive, Ross Perot.
Wyly founded University Computing in 1963, using mainframes at
Southern Methodist University to do jobs for customers. By the
Nixon administration, the brothers had become very large Republican
campaign donors, and President Nixon appointed Sam Wyly chairman of
a federal panel charged with improving business opportunities for
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Wyly suffered several setbacks, including the
failure of an expensive plan to build a data transmission network
to compete against what was then called American Telephone &AMP;
Telegraph, and a scrape in 1979 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which had accused him of violating securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   But more recently he has enjoyed some big successes. One is the
Dallas-based hedge fund he founded, Maverick Capital, which has
grown into one of the largest in the country, with $4 billion under
management. And just last month, two of his publicly traded
companies, Sterling Commerce and Sterling Software, were sold for
$3.9 billion each to separate buyers. Lately, he has focused
attention on GreenMountain.com. The Wyly family has invested more
than $100 million in the firm, and Wyly is chairman.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Long a top donor to Bush and other Texas Republicans, Wyly has
other close ties to the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   James B. Francis Jr., a close friend and informal adviser to
Bush, has in the past worked as a political adviser to Wyly,
counseling him in 1997 on a proposal in the Texas Legislature _
which both Wyly and Bush opposed _ that would have caused certain
investment partnerships to pay the state equivalent of a business
income tax. The proposal failed.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Francis allowed a Dallas lawyer and political
consultant who had worked for Wyly, Jeb Hensarling, to share office
space, and the two even formed a partnership, F-H &AMP; Associates,
that did work for the Wyly family. Hensarling, who helped Wyly put
the commercials on the air last week, did not return a telephone
call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam is a longtime Republican activist going back into the
'60s,'' said Francis, who is head of the ``Pioneers,'' people who
have raised at least $100,000 for Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, in an interview Sunday, said he had not talked to
either Wyly brother in a few months. ``Sam is a damn passionate
man. I bet he said, `I want to help Bush,' and Jeb, who works for
him, said, `You can do an independent expenditure,' and off they
went. That's total speculation, but I bet that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The environmental advertisements have given McCain, who has
accused Bush ``cronies'' of evading federal campaign finance laws,
an issue that he says exemplifies everything he has fought against
as he has tried to reform campaign finance laws. McCain says it is
ludicrous to believe that the Bush camp had no role in, or
knowledge of, the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a Bush spokesman, referring to McCain's campaign
bus, said Sunday, ``The closer the Straight Talk Express gets to
the garage, the more junk they throw at us from its window.''

CHINA'S PRIME MINISTER CONDEMNS CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Prime Minister Zhu Rongji issued an emotional
condemnation of official corruption on Sunday as he opened the
annual 11-day session of China's Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In a 90-minute speech, Zhu drew applause for his remarks about
corruption, which is widespread and threatens to undermine the
party's authority. He repeatedly came back to this theme, for good
reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament's own vice chairman is not attending the meeting,
because he is under investigation on accusations of taking bribes.
The former vice governor of Jiangxi province was recently sentenced
to death for corruption and faces execution soon.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu himself has spearheaded a major investigation into a $10
billion smuggling and corruption ring in Fujian province that has
implicated a number of senior officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leading cadres should stay clean and honest and
self-disciplined and be sure their relatives and office staff do
the same,'' he said, noting that corrupt officials must be
``severely punished.''
</P>
<P>
   His speech also highlighted economic progress and drew the
biggest round of applause from the 2,900 delegates when he spoke
briefly of the government's hope for a peaceful reunification with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks on Sunday conspicuously omitted the military threats
that the Chinese government has made in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Although he emphasized that China ``would not sit idly by'' as
Taiwan moved toward independence, he said that to bring about
reunification the government is ``willing to conduct cross-straits
dialogue and negotiations on any matter.'' He later added, ``We
place our hopes on the Taiwan authorities and even more on the
people of Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese government white paper released two weeks ago said
that China could attack Taiwan if the island nation _ the refuge of
the Chinese nationalists after the communists won control of the
mainland in 1949 _ indefinitely postponed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the speech on Sunday offered a mix of economic
statistics, assertions and plans for the future, little of which
was new, and it was flat compared with Zhu's usual performances.
</P>
<P>
   He said, for example, that China's government bureaus and its
military have now divested themselves of all side businesses, as
the government had demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, China's lead economic planner, made clear that the
government intended to continue its policy of economic
liberalization and remained committed to China's entry into the
World Trade Organization. That goal has been at least partly
compromised by China's threatening comments about Taiwan in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Congress must grant China permanent normal trade status
to clear the way for the World Trade Organization membership.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu also emphasized that as China moves toward a more
market-driven economy, the country has to provide a better safety
net _ including health insurance and pensions _ for China's poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must work to create the necessary conditions for the
transition to a sound social security system,'' he said, noting
that decent social services are necessary to ``maintain social
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu made little mention of the most sensitive challenge that the
Chinese government faced in the last year: its continuing battle
against the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement, which the
government has denounced as a dangerous cult. He merely listed
taking ``decisive measures against the Falun Gong cult'' as one of
the government's achievements.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The once popular movement has clearly been severely crippled by
a harsh government crackdown that began last summer, which has led
to thousands of detentions and hundreds of criminal cases. But on
Sunday _ as on many days _ small numbers of Falun Gong members were
arrested protesting in and around Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   The square itself was closed Sunday, serving as a parking lot
for delegates to the Parliament, which meets in a building next
door. Still, more than a dozen members were arrested as they tried
to unfurl a banner under the nearby portrait of Mao Zedong.

PAKISTANIS, EAGER FOR CHANGE, ARE LEFT FRUSTRATED AFTER COUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ The euphoria that greeted a military coup
here almost five months ago _ and the hope that a no-nonsense
general could quickly turn this corrupt, virtually bankrupt country
around _ have given way to a weary sense that little has changed,
and to fears that Pakistan could be drifting toward more war with
India.
</P>
<P>
   While it is still early to judge the record of the new
government, the White House has little else to go on as it agonizes
over whether President Clinton should use his visit to India this
month _ the first to this region by an American president in 22
years _ to call also on Pakistan's military rulers and give them
the stamp of legitimacy they seek.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, has not
done the things that the American government considers most
important. He has not spelled out a plan for restoring democracy.
He has not cracked down on an Islamic fundamentalist group that the
United States has put on its list of terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   And in a decision that is a telling commentary on the general's
cautious style of governance, he has not signed the nuclear test
ban treaty. His foreign minister, Abdul Sattar, has spoken out in
favor it, but the new government has chosen not to sign for fear
that doing so would rile Islamic political parties.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Sattar asked why the new government should pay
the political price for signing when the U.S. Senate has voted
against the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantages of signing are unclear, and the disadvantages
of political opposition at home are concrete,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These rationales for inaction or for delaying action have
frustrated people who thought the military government would rule
with the swift decisiveness with which it overthrew Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   While Musharraf casts himself as the antithesis of a politician,
his government has been careful to look after certain
constituencies. While it has arrested 90 people, including
businessmen, on charges of defaulting on bank loans, it has not
gone after sitting military officers or judges on corruption
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Officials note that the military and the judiciary have their
own accountability systems. But it appears that the military has no
appetite for investigations of its own and does not want to
alienate judges who are hearing cases that challenge the
constitutionality of the army takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also been cautious in economic policy.
Musharraf said his government would tax the agricultural incomes of
feudal landlords who have always escaped payment and would broaden
the sales tax to cover retail shopkeepers. But rather than doing it
right away, his finance minister, Shaukat Aziz, formerly a senior
executive with Citibank, said he has used the last few months to
develop the new tax system and to build greater acceptance among
those who will be taxed come July, when the new budget year begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are changing the culture in a society where nobody likes
to pay taxes and where tax avoidance is the name of the game,''
Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
   In the political sphere, the government says it will take a
first step back toward democracy with local elections to be held by
the end of the year, but it offers no timetable for national
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talking about devolution of power to the local bodies
when we don't have a Parliament,'' said Asma Jehangir, a lawyer and
human rights leader whose father was a member of Parliament who
spent four years in prison under two previous military governments.
``It's a joke. How can you have freedom at the lower level when
there's not freedom anywhere?''
</P>
<P>
   The impatience with the slow pace of change is tangible not only
among the intelligentsia, but among the poor. People who cheered
the general's promise that he would do what Sharif never managed _
to tax the rich, punish the corrupt, revive the economy and build
``real'' democracy _ now say there is little difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of wheat flour has gone up, not down,'' said Lal
Muhammad, who ekes out a living selling wrinkled second-hand
sweaters on the streets of Peshawar. ``The lives of poor people
remain the same. I don't see any difference between Musharraf and
Nawaz Sharif.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Halim, a tailor in Peshawar who had skipped breakfast and
lunch so his wife and six children could eat, was just as hard
boiled. ``This is the fourth general who has come, and we haven't
seen a better life yet,'' he said. Still, despite his
disillusionment, he hopes Clinton comes. ``Maybe he can stop war
between India and Pakistan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Halim's sense of foreboding is shared by some academics and
diplomats who had hoped the general's early conciliatory gestures
to India presaged a broader peacemaking strategy. But in recent
months, experts say, Pakistan has backed the increasingly frequent
and deadly attacks by militants on Indian forces in Kashmir, the
majority-Muslim territory that both countries claim in a
half-century-old dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they don't have a hope in hell of liberating
Kashmir,'' said Pervaiz Hoodbhoy, a nuclear physicist at
Quaid-I-Azam University in Islamabad. ``They live in a fantasy
world. They think they're inflicting such grievous damage on the
Indians when the truth is the opposite. It's Pakistan which is
bleeding.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week, the Indian government _ citing as justification its
10-week war with Pakistan last summer in Kashmir _ proposed a 28
percent rise in military spending, a $3 billion increase that is
itself more than Pakistan's entire military budget.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, which already spends more than a quarter of its budget
on the military and almost half on debt service, can ill afford to
go deeper in hock to try to match India's military and economic
might.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it should have seemed inevitable that Musharraf _
a soldier, not a schooled statesman _ would disappoint. Pakistan's
entrenched problems are not amenable to quick fixes. So his men are
pleading for time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had completely unrealistic expectations,'' said Javed
Jabbar, who advises the general on national affairs. ``They thought
there was a magic wand.''

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ It was a jarring, sad sight, the first time Trey
Hillman spotted D'Angelo Jimenez, a familiar face, except it was
encased in a halo brace and screws were embedded in his head and
neck.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez was crossing the street at the Yankees' spring complex
when Hillman, his manager last season at Columbus, called out to
his former shortstop and raced over to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I'd spoke to him since the accident,''
Hillman said, ``and what I wanted to know was how he was dealing
with it, mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so lucky,'' Jimenez told Hillman, who was immediately
convinced that Jimenez was surviving quite well, considering the
fracture of the second vertebra and the overwhelming odds that his
season was over.
</P>
<P>
   It was going to be his first full year in the major leagues, as
the Yankees' utility infielder, but then came a fateful drive on
Jan. 24 and an ill-advised turn, and the next thing Jimenez knew,
his career had taken a wrong turn, too.
</P>
<P>
   He never did remember the details, how his Acura Integra smacked
into a small bus. Jimenez had apparently been trying to pass on the
Duante Highway, connecting Santo Domingo with the northern part of
the Dominican Republic. His friend in the passenger seat had told
him the lane was clear, and he steered into the other vehicle, lost
control, flipped over.
</P>
<P>
   A second friend trailing in another car helped remove him from
the wreckage, through the shattered windshield. He was dazed, but
the doctors at the local hospital found no apparent damage. They
told Jimenez's friend to take him home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend said, `You're OK, let's go,''' Jimenez said. ``I
stood up and my left arm was, like, numb.''
</P>
<P>
   He contacted the Yankees. They flew him to Tampa, where his
injury was diagnosed at St. Joseph's Hospital. Jimenez's name,
penciled in as the replacement for Luis Sojo, was _ for this season
_ erased. Jimenez, at 22, became yet another reminder of the
strange and devastating terms of vulnerability that have enveloped
these Yankees the last few years, even as they dominated their
sport.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner's team used to be the home office for
controversy; now it deals more with calamity, and we don't mean the
0-4 exhibition start (after Sunday's 6-2 loss to Houston) that has
to have the Boss talking to himself _ for the time being, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   If it hasn't been Joe Torre's cancer, it has been Darryl
Strawberry's drug use, or illness and death within the players'
families or in the Yankees' extended family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could've been paralyzed, or dead,'' Jimenez said, knowing
that only centimeters kept him from becoming another tragic twist
of Yankee fate.
</P>
<P>
   He is still a startling sight, sitting stiffly in the clubhouse
at Legends Field, as the players all around him dress and enjoy the
lightness and chatter of early spring. Jimenez said he feels
fortunate if he gets a full night's sleep. He can't exercise,
because he is not supposed to sweat. So as much as he can, he
avoids the cloudless Florida sky, waiting for the halo to come off
sometime this month, for the doctors' permission to get on with his
life.
</P>
<P>
   They have all but assured him of a full recovery, he said. Trey
Hillman, basing his prognosis purely on intuition, said, ``If it's
medically possible, D'Angelo Jimenez will bounce back from this.''
</P>
<P>
   He has known Jimenez since his second year in the Yankees'
organization, making the managerial climb through the minors along
with the 6-foot, 194-pound shortstop who hit .327 last season in
Class AAA and earned a September showcase in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Hillman shook Jimenez's hand on the day he left Columbus, and
told him he was ready after working so hard on versatility,
improving his defense at second and third base. What Jimenez has
always had going for him beyond physical skills, Hillman said, were
the pure instincts of a ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfazed,'' was the word Hillman volunteered. ``He knows how to
play, so I wasn't surprised that he went up to the majors and did
what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight base hits in 20 at-bats and the smooth fielding did
not foretell anything more than a spot on Torre's bench this
season. A ticket is a ticket, though; that was all Jimenez wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a soft spot when it comes to D'Angelo, because I have
seen how hard he's worked,'' Hillman said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained how difficult it was not to have a special
affection for a young Dominican who has social and cultural
challenges that can obscure his fundamental ability if they go
unmet. A 37-year-old Texan, Hillman said he has never been to the
Dominican Republic, but when he heard the news, he could imagine
the accident scene in the Dominican, and then picture the shock and
sadness on Jimenez's face when the doctors in Tampa gave him the
debilitating news.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hillman looked up one recent day and there Jimenez was, in
that awful brace, crossing the street, but soon telling him, ``I
think I can play in July or August.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Angelo Jimenez, he realized, didn't think of himself as the
latest in a run of Yankee misfortune. In that moment of impact,
when he realized what might have been, he actually considered
himself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.

   MORENO VALLEY, Calif. _ Allen Pennington, a personnel worker in
this bedroom community of strip malls and independent-minded
voters, said Saturday that he had been set to vote for Sen. John
McCain but switched his allegiance to Gov. George W. Bush after
what he considered McCain's intemperate denunciation of the
religious conservative leaders Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry
Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't vote for him now, no matter what,'' said Pennington,
55, who considered himself a religious conservative. ``He lost my
vote right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, John Drew, who runs a vacuum cleaner business,
emerged from the same grocery store and announced that he would
back McCain, in no small part because the senator had the gumption
to take on Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have the initiative to get things done,'' said Drew,
36. ``If a crisis came, he'd be able to handle it better. If George
Bush were out here giving free TV's, I still wouldn't show up. He's
just not appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from dozens of interviews with voters in this sprawl of
stucco houses 78 miles east of Los Angeles _ an area known for
lurching to Democrats one year and to Republicans the next _ the
one White House contender who is rousing voters' passions, for
better or for worse, is McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiments toward the Arizona senator will be crucial on Tuesday
in California as McCain tries to top Bush in the popular vote.
Independent-thinking voters with no deep political roots, like ones
in this fast-growing region, may determine the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Republican vote in California gets the party's
delegates, and polls show Bush is far ahead on that score.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, McCain and Vice President Al Gore are locked in a
struggle for the popular vote which, though nonbinding, would allow
the victor to contend that he would make the most potent candidate
in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Given that McCain was far more of a lightning rod in the
interviews than any of the others, the outcome could come down to
one question: whether voters admire McCain's audaciousness _ or are
put off by it.
</P>
<P>
   For some voters, McCain's fierce jabs at religious conservatives
and his willingness to attack his own party is refreshing. Yet a
surprisingly large number of those interviewed said they had become
unnerved by McCain's apparent rashness, and some feared that his
conduct was not becoming of the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   This much is clear: The unexpectedly competitive, and rancorous,
race between Bush and McCain has awakened many voters.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in Moreno Valley before the 1998 midterm
elections, voters did not seem particularly exercised about
anything. And in the presidential campaign four years ago, they
were deeply unenthusiastic about the choice between President
Clinton and Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, even many Democrats said they were intrigued by
McCain, a surprise given that the senator's voting record resembles
that of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-S.C. It has led to some unlikely
possibilities: Some lifelong Democratic voters said they were
considering backing Gore or McCain, or Bill Bradley or McCain.
</P>
<P>
   There was also evidence that with Gore emerging as a more potent
Democratic candidate, some voters who had considered crossing party
lines and siding with McCain may stick with the vice president. The
McCain camp had been counting on Democrats to flood to their side,
as they have elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   As she chaperoned Girl Scouts selling cookies, Sheila Valles
toyed with backing Bush or McCain and then seemed to end up in the
Gore camp. ``I think it's going to be Al Gore,'' she said. ``I like
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Many voters here said that as much as they were drawn to McCain,
they have had second thoughts, not only because of his
shoot-from-the-hip manner but because of other episodes, such as
his initial denial that his campaign was behind telephone calls
that portrayed Bush as anti-Catholic. This was true even among
voters who did not know enough about McCain to pronounce his name
correctly: One man called him ``McClain''; another called him
``Cane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's bad mouthing too much _ too much smack,'' said
Ismael Hernandez, 36, a press-room supervisor who favors Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lomelli, 48, a graphics designer who also is backing Bush,
said of McCain: ``He's a little too blunt; he needs to think more
about what he says before he says it.'' Lomelli said, though, that
he had no objection to McCain's scolding of Robertson because the
television preacher ``is too right for me, even though I'm to the
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Lomelli said he was troubled that so many Democrats seemed to
like McCain. ``When people to the left start voting for him,'' he
said, ``that tells me something.''
</P>
<P>
   Even many voters who sided with Bush did not sound devoted. They
spoke of his father, the former president, or of the governor's
accomplishments in Texas. But they became more animated talking
about McCain, even if they did not support him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like the stands that he has made,'' Linda Randall, 49,
a homemaker, said of Bush, struggling to explain why she supported
him. Asked about McCain, she grew indignant: ``Sometimes I think he
might say the wrong thing. Just anything. Once he said something
about an ethnic group being in a POW camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Cuthbert, 40, a grocery store inspector, said he was leaning
to Bush because ``he will work the political system better than
McCain _ you have to be able to play ball to get a lot of your
policies across.''
</P>
<P>
   Others spoke admiringly of McCain and his demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks his mind and gets angry once in a while,'' said
Steve Urak, 42, who runs delivery operations for a local newspaper
and backs McCain. Asked about the senator's comments about the
religious right, he waved his hand and said: ``That's all
irrelevant to me. Pat Robertson's a fanatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Odle, a kindergarten teacher, said McCain was ``interested
in giving the government back to the people.'' As for Bush, she
said, ``I was disheartened by the way he came out assuming the
presidency would be his.''
</P>
<P>
   While his face pops up on television commercials here, Bradley
seems to have staggered off the political map, at least in Moreno
Valley. Not many people mentioned him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like Bradley knows he can't win, but he doesn't want
to let his supporters down, so he's keeping on,'' said Sandy
Sanders, 66, a retired nurse who favors Gore. ``But his voice just
doesn't have the strength it once had.''
</P>
<P>
   Loren Newkirk, 62, a music teacher, said he preferred Bradley
but decided to write in for Ralph Nader. ``If it was close, I might
have considered voting for Bradley.''

FRESHMEN KEY FOR JAYHAWKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Reflecting on a spirited little episode that
ended happily for the home forces, Kansas coach Roy Williams was
moved to say a few words yesterday about the hero of the hour,
forward Drew Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Williams said of his unpredictable freshman, ``I
love that guy so much I could choke him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the waning seconds of a nerve-jangling battle in front of
16,300 at Allen Fieldhouse, it almost seemed as if Missouri's Jeff
Hafer was attempting to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   After being leveled on a layup attempt by Hafer _ who was called
for an intentional foul _ Gooden sank two free throws with 12.9
seconds remaining to catapult the Jayhawks (22-8, 11-5 Big 12) to
an 83-82 triumph over the Tigers (17-11, 10-6) and into the
fifth-seed position in the Big 12 Conference tournament next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who wiped out a 14-point deficit before falling
short, will go to Kansas City as the sixth seed.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, avenging an 81-59 loss to Missouri earlier in the
season, was keyed by three freshmen _ Gooden (20 points, 13
rebounds), Nick Collison (14 points) and Kirk Hinrich (11) _ and
Williams spoke fondly of them afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young bloods stepped up and played a game for us today,''
he said, also noting that senior Nick Bradford (15 points, 8
rebounds) ``was really something all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   But the big moment belonged to Gooden, whose two free throws
pushed Kansas into an 81-80 lead, with possession of the ball. With
7.6 seconds left, Hafer fouled out, and Hinrich converted twice to
push the lead to three. After Keyon Dooling missed a desperate
3-point attempt, Clarence Gilbert gave Missouri two meaningless
points with a short put back at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to hurt anyone,'' said Hafer, who drew another
intentional foul on Kansas shooter Kenny Gregory in the first half,
but also revived the Tigers with four clutch 3-pointers in the late
stages. ``I was just trying to keep him from shooting the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely trying to foul him. But the way it happened
turned out to be not a very good play on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   Admitting sheepishly that he was actually in the wrong place on
the play, Gooden said he was glad of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to be over on the other side,'' he said. ``But
when I got the ball I just went for the basket. I knew it was a
hard foul, but I didn't know at first that the ref called it
intentional. I just went to the line saying, `One shot at a time,'
and blocked out everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising to the occasion on Senior Day, Bradford held the Tigers
at bay with seven consecutive points during one stretch, only to
watch Missouri _ led by Gilbert (18 points), Dooling (13), Hafer
(14) and Kareem Rush (20), said, ``This was especially sweet
because it was Missouri, and especially after what they did to us
at their place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't let them come in there and beat us again.''

DARKHORSE EMERGES IN THIRD-BASE COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ On another perfect, warm Florida afternoon,
Rangers manager Johnny Oates threw a little cold water on the Tom
Evans-is-the-man movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably our MVP over the first three games,'' Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   The point is taken. It's only three games into the spring _
three games the Rangers have lost after a 5-2 defeat against the
Cincinnati Reds at Ed Smith Stadium yesterday _ and no one grabs a
starting spot this soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the first three games at least proved that Evans is a major
factor in the competition for the third-base job.
</P>
<P>
   Evans hit a mammoth home run off a Denny Neagle changeup in the
fifth inning, his third of the spring. He missed a hit in the
second inning only because Reds shortstop Barry Larkin was moving
toward second base with Gabe Kapler running and was in position to
field a sharp grounder toward the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing a lot of things well,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans is 4-for-6 with the three home runs and four runs batted
in. Mike Lamb, his competition for the job, was hitless in two
at-bats yesterday and is 1-for-7. If the regular season started
today, Evans would have to get serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But the regular season doesn't start for another four weeks, and
Lamb isn't looking that far down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a mistake,'' he said. ``If you start looking ahead,
you're going to forget about the present and that's what really
counts. The future will take care of itself if you take care of the
present.''
</P>
<P>
   For the present, Evans is content to have a chance to win the
job.
</P>
<P>
   He never had that during his seven years with the Toronto Blue
Jays organization. He was considered a top prospect, but when the
position was open in 1998, shoulder and hand injuries kept him from
grabbing it.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was healthy, the Blue Jays had signed Tony
Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make it sound like Mike's not a good player,
but obviously there is more of a chance for me this year,'' Evans
said. ``The Blue Jays had Tony Fernandez at third base, and the guy
hits .330 every year. It's tough to come in and beat a guy like
that out, who's been in the big leagues for 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers claimed Evans on waivers last April. He spent the
entire season at Triple-A Oklahoma, and batted .280 with 12 home
runs and 68 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   He became a minor-league free agent at the end of the season,
but decided to re-sign with the Rangers when incumbent third
baseman Todd Zeile departed as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of what you look at as a free agent,'' he said.
``I thought this was the best fit for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was assumed that Lamb was the front-runner entering
camp. He batted .324 with 21 home runs and 100 RBI at Double-A
Tulsa, and backed that up by hitting .343 in the prospect-laden
Arizona Fall League.
</P>
<P>
   Oates, though, said Evans entered camp even with Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was an option before we started spring training,''
Oates said. ``There's a reason Tom Evans was brought to camp.
There's a reason he was claimed last year.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't claimed because of his power. He never hit more than
17 home runs in a season in the minors. But he homered in an
intrasquad game, hit two in the exhibition opener against the
Minnesota Twins on Friday, and blasted another one yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Evans credits hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo for the new-found
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working with Rudy a lot, and I really like the way
he works with me,'' Evans said. ``That's a key for a hitting coach.
Everybody's different, everyone's unique and you've got to connect
with them and find out what makes sense to them. He makes sense to
me. What he tries to relay in words makes sense in my thought
process. I'm able to work on it with him.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the work is paying off. But as the manager pointed out,
it's only three games. Lamb has plenty of time to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't make a decision on the first three games,'' Oates
said. ``We'll let them play the majority of the games, and make
that decision in two or three weeks.''

AYALA FINDS FLAWS IN LATEST TRIUMPH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Paulie Ayala knows his performance during the second
defense of his World Boxing Association bantamweight title Saturday
night left him open to the critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm my worst critic,'' said Fort Worth's Ayala, who retained
his title after a frustrating 12-round majority decision against
European champion Johnny Bredahl at the Mandalay Bay Events Center.
``I'm not really disappointed. But styles make fights, and that's
why I stay in the gym all the time, to correct things.''
</P>
<P>
   A 17-1 underdog fighting in the United States for the first
time, Bredahl exposed some flaws Team Ayala will want to address
when they return to workouts at the Boxing Management Inc. gym in
Fort Worth. Promoter Bob Arum said the earliest Ayala, who suffered
a cut in the right eyelid, would fight again was mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   ``He \RBredahl\S made me look awkward, as far as \Rnot being\S
able to land all my combinations,'' said Ayala, now 30-1 with 12
knockouts. ``I was able to land one or two, and he would move and
I'd have to set up and start all over again. He was a pretty slick
fighter. I was trying. But he was slick.''
</P>
<P>
   Bredahl, the WBA's No. 4-ranked contender, also was not the same
fighter Ayala and co-trainers Henry Mendez and Paul Reyes had
studied on six videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fights Paulie had seen were from about five years ago,''
said Bredahl, a resident of Copenhagen, Denmark, who has reinvented
himself after reuniting with trainer Kjeld Krough. ``I've got more
down on my feet and stand still when I'm hitting. I'm not that type
who's flying around like a butterfly anymore. I'm taking the fight
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bredahl also continued to dismiss Ayala as a big puncher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he had a `power punch,' '' said Bredahl, who
nevertheless was black and blue under both eyes and on the nose
after the fight. ``I could knock him out, and he knows I had him
shaken a lot of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala confirmed that Bredahl, 45-2 with 23 KOs, had been more of
a runner in the fights he and sparring partner Ruben Nevarez had
studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a lot more aggressive \RSaturday\S. But that's no
excuse,'' Ayala said. ``He was trying to nitpick and peck away. He
hit a lot of arms and elbows and caught me a couple of times, but
that's when I was exchanging also. I was able to adapt enough to
score more solid blows. I know I won and won unanimously. The
significant part of the fight was the knockdown. Being able to land
better shots and combinations, that didn't happen. But that's
things I can work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges Chuck Giampa and Al Siciliano, both of Las Vegas, scored
the fight for Ayala under the 10-point ``must'' system. Siciliano's
margin of 116-111 was the widest for Ayala, who prevailed 115-113
on Giampa's card. Judge Guillermo Perez of Panama, meanwhile,
scored it a 114-114 deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was, in fact, tied twice in the last five rounds.
Giampa and Perez each had it 76-76 after eight rounds and 95-95
after 10. Ayala won the 11th and 12th on Giampa's card to emerge
with a two-point margin. But Ayala split the final two rounds _ the
championship rounds _ on Perez's card to create the deadlock and
prevent a unanimous decision.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala said he received a stern warning from his cornermen before
the 12th round.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I needed to be more aggressive and try to land at
least three and four combinations, instead of one and two, which I
was mainly doing,'' said Ayala, 29. ``I thought I was ahead,
landing the more solid blows.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendez was not totally convinced the judges were seeing it that
way. And he put part of the blame on Ayala, whom he said had become
preoccupied with head hunting and throwing lead rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he \RBredahl\S was going to Paulie's left, our object was
to throw the lead left at him, because he was going right into
it,'' Mendez said. ``And then when he was going to Paulie's right,
Paulie was supposed to be throwing the punch to the body. But he
was throwing it to the head. I told him in the corner if he's going
to throw that lead right, then throw the left behind it, because
one of 'em is going to hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the contentious outcome, Ayala said he was willing to talk
rematch with Bredahl. Arum said he would be amenable to a date in
Copenhagen if the money was right and the officials neutral. But
Arum also said he was not totally convinced a rematch makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Paulie ahead by eight points. I didn't think it was a
close fight,'' Arum said. ``This was an awkward freaking guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum said Ayala, who earned a career-best $150,000 here, could
wind up on the bill of the Oscar De La Hoya-Shane Mosley card
tentatively scheduled for the Staples Center in Los Angeles on June
17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another possibility is to have Paulie fight in June in
Japan,'' said Arum, without naming, or spelling, an opponent.
``They \Rthe Japanese\S are offering a lot of money, and I'd like
to get him at least $200,000.'' / nn

STRUGGLING KNICKS LOSE TO JAZZ, 88-79 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was just a simple pass into the post, a harmless
feed from Latrell Sprewell to Allan Houston, and another moment
when the haze that has been hovering over the Knicks since the
All-Star Game break took on the acidic odor of an electrical short.
</P>
<P>
   Another circuit had just blown. Another overload to blame.
Sunday only provided amplified evidence of a Knicks team that
appears mentally frayed and physically worn by the extra minutes
and shrinking rotation caused by the absence of the injured Marcus
Camby and Charlie Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Why else would Houston go up to field the ball from Sprewell and
send a touch pass right back to ... a vacant spot? In the groggy,
slurred way they played in their 88-79 loss to the Utah Jazz, the
Knicks were like a phonograph in need of a swift crank. While they
slogged through the day, the sage Jazz players leaned on their
mapmaker's precision and methodical execution.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the unflappable combination of Karl Malone and John
Stockton turned each desperate run by the Knicks into a chase as
futile as Wile E. Coyote's pursuit of the Road Runner. From the
start, too many Knick plans went poof in the dead air of Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally concerned,'' said Houston, who finished with 20
points on 6-of-15 shooting from the field. ``It's a funk. If you
don't get out of it, you can really slip.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see it already. A Knicks team that seemed so invincible
at the start of February has fallen to 6-5 since the All-Star Game
break. A Knicks team that was unshakable in its confidence is
starting to wonder if it can snap to without Camby and Ward on the
floor. Ward could be back by Tuesday. But Camby? No one knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we lose, I feel an extra hurt inside because I want
to play,'' said Camby, who had a satisfying meeting Sunday with
Norman Scott, the team physician, to clarify the confusion Camby
had over his slow-to-heal knee injury. ``It just hurts me more when
we take a loss like this.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no timetable for Camby's return, no target date for him
to provide the kind of caffeine boost his team needs. On Sunday the
Knicks' burnout was evident on the stat sheet. Kurt Thomas was only
a minor nuisance for the bulky Malone (30 points), Stockton had as
many assists (12) as the Knicks did, and the league's worst
rebounding team continued on its current path as the Jazz beat New
York on the boards, 46-31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the bodies,'' said coach Jeff Van Gundy, who has
resisted the notion that his players are worn from his seven-man
rotation, and who squeezed 39 minutes out of Patrick Ewing and
43-plus out of Houston and Sprewell on Sunday. ``It's finding
productive bodies, and bodies that make the team function well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at home, and we didn't do anything much on Saturday,
so we were rested. But certainly, at the start, we were very
lethargic.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first half, the Knicks had scored just 30
points, were shooting 31.6 percent from the field, had trailed by
as many as 10 points and had turned the ball over eight times in
the first nine minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I came out and felt real sluggish,'' said Ewing (18
points), who started the game 1 for 6 with Olden Polynice in his
face. ``I don't know the reason, but I couldn't get into a groove.
My legs felt heavy in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a halftime break, a chance to throw back a stiff
shot of Gatorade and return with fire. That has been the Knicks'
pattern lately. In their previous two home games, they fell behind
by double digits but unearthed a comeback. In the fourth quarter
Sunday, after trailing by as many as 15 in the third, they tried
that trick again _ twice. A 9-0 run by the Knicks _ ignited by a
steal apiece by Sprewell and Chris Childs _ cut the Jazz lead to
62-59 with 10 minutes 35 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Houston inexplicably left Jeff Hornacek alone for an
18-footer, Armon Gilliam was given room by Ewing on a 14-footer,
Hornacek hit a runner around Houston, and Malone popped from 18
feet. In the three minutes it took for the Jazz to go on an 8-0
run, the Knicks missed three consecutive jumpers and lost three
offensive rebounds to Greg Ostertag.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had one more chance. After the Jazz went up by 14
with three minutes left, the Knicks scrambled to cut it to six on a
3-pointer from Larry Johnson with 1:28 left.
</P>
<P>
   But once more, a mindless play by the Knicks was costly. Before
the Jazz inbounded the ball, Childs bumped Stockton at the
baseline. Since the away-from-the-ball foul occurred in the final
two minutes of the game, the Jazz got a free throw and the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible call,'' Childs said. ``That was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz parlayed the foul into three quick points: the free
throw by Hornacek and a clutch runner by Malone at the end of the
shot clock. Nine-point lead. That was all the Jazz needed to win
for the ninth time in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Jeff said, we wait to play,'' said Johnson, who was
1 of 7 for 6 points. ``Something is wrong. We have injuries, but
we've still got enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do something different. I think we have to focus
on doing everything the hardest we can do it. That means in
practice you have to overexaggerate everything. If you're in a
shooting drill, act like there's someone on you. Just
overexaggerate everything. We've got to do something to snap
ourselves out of this.''

CEBALLOS BLAMES FATIGUE FOR `SLUMP'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Cedric Ceballos blamed fatigue on his
recent shooting slump. Or, better yet, Ceballos doesn't even refer
to shooting 5-of-26 from the field during a two-game span as a
slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't in a slump; I was just tired,'' Ceballos said. ``I
shot some commercials and some press things that I had to do with
the community that I shouldn't have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should have rested. Sometimes you can overcome those
things; sometimes you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos made 13 of 19 field goals and scored a game-high 33
points Saturday in a 110-96 loss to the Phoenix Suns. He hopes he
still has the hot hand when the Mavericks meet the Sacramento Kings
at 9:30 tonight at ARCO Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to win in Sacramento, but we can do it if we play
together,'' Ceballos said. ``They have a lot of All-Stars on their
squad, so we have to compete and try to put ourselves in position
to win.''
Nelson returns Mavericks coach Don Nelson is expected back for
tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson missed the past two games because of the flu. His son,
assistant coach Donnie Nelson, coached the Mavericks during losses
to New Jersey and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rare occasion when he misses a game, whether he played
or coached, due to an illness,'' Donnie Nelson said. ``So he's
really sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been down and out for three days. Cold sweats. ... He's
got it bad.''
Nothing special Donnie Nelson said he didn't get any special
feeling coaching against the Phoenix Suns on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was an assistant coach with the Suns before coming to the
Mavericks on Jan. 2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the ball goes up, it doesn't matter what arena or what
city I'm in,'' Nelson said. ``Everything gets blocked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy we had a good showing. I'm not happy about the
results. I'll never be happy with losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is happy to be getting an ``audition'' as an NBA coach,
although it is at the expense of his dad. He just wishes he had two
wins under his belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The energy was good,'' he said of the loss to the Suns. ``I
thought our game plan was pretty solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the effort. I'm not happy with the outcome.''

BUDDIES TOO FAST FOR BOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thousands of miles away from his home in Kenya,
Simon Bor felt anything but lonely as he attempted in vain to
defend his title in the Los Angeles Marathon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bor's countrymen formed a pack that ran together for
a majority of the race, and for the first 18 miles, Bor trailed his
younger brother, Noah, designated as one of the two race rabbits
charged with setting a quick pace.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, Noah Bor seemed to set too quick of a pace.
Once Noah Bor dropped out after the 18-mile mark, his brother
couldn't maintain his former quick pace and finished fourth in 2
hours, 20 minutes and 12 seconds, nearly 11 minutes slower than his
winning time in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On a low: Maria Portilla Cruz, the third-place finisher in the
women's competition, typically trains in Peru at an elevation of
approximately 10,000 feet, but height wasn't the only factor Cruz
had to adjust to.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my first marathon at sea level, but little did I know
that it would also be my first marathon below sea level,'' Cruz
said through an interpreter, commenting on the horrible conditions
that faced the runners.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, 24, who also trains in Albuquerque, New Mexico, finished
the Hunacayo Marathon in Peru last year in a first-place time of
2:38:08, and prepared for Los Angeles by competing in the Las Vegas
Half-Marathon last month, which she won in 1:12:52.
</P>
<P>
   Big numbers: A record 23,000 participants registered for the
marathon, and for the first time organizers had to reject potential
runners. The weather was expected to reduce the number of actual
starters, but official figures of starters and finishers were not
available.
</P>
<P>
   Local stars: Several area runners of both genders finished in
the top 50.
</P>
<P>
   Federico Yax of Winnetka finished 27th in the men's race in
2:37:13, followed just 39 seconds later by Martin Garcia of Sylmar.
Robert Leonardo of Sylmar finished 37th in 2:42:02, while Jesus
Mercado Cruz of Palmdale finished 47th in 2:45:10.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's race, Connie Lopez of Glendale finished 11th in
3:06:05, followed in 15th and 16th by Marie Romero of La Canada
Flintridge (3:10:30) and Katharine Budman of Glendale (3:11:08).
Donna Watts of Westlake Village finished 33rd in 3:21:55, followed
by No. 40 Kerstin Nisel (Northridge, 3:25:04), No. 44 Stacia
Spangler (Westlake Village, 3:26:26), No. 46 Diana Rush (Thousand
Oaks, 3:27:02) and No. 47 Rebecca Freebury (Malibu, 3:27:22).
</P>
<P>
   Marco Ortiz of Los Angeles was the top American male finisher in
2:27:28, good for 11th, while three American women finished in the
top 10, led by Judy Maguire (2:58:21) of Clearwater, Fla., in
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   On course: Despite the inclement weather, participants were
cheered on by a large number of fans, described as similar in
number to previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very different to what I am accustomed to (in Peru).''
Cruz said. ``It really adds to the energy level, running in front
of all these people really energizes you. Seeing all those people
at every turn gives you a warm and pleasant feeling.''

YOUNG RELIEVER SHOWS STUFF _ GOOD AND BAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Reliever Francisco Cordero, one of the key
players the Rangers obtained from the Detroit Tigers in the Juan
Gonzalez trade, showed yesterday both why he might need more
minor-league seasoning and why the Rangers think so highly of him.
</P>
<P>
   Both the good and the bad were on display as Cordero needed 25
pitches to work the fifth inning of the Rangers' 5-2 loss against
the Cincinnati Reds at Ed Smith Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, a 22-year-old, hard-throwing right-hander, allowed a
run on three walks and a bloop single. After a visit to the mound
by pitching coach Dick Bosman, Cordero got out of inning by
striking out Dmitri Young.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero throws his fastball in the high 90s. That's the pitch he
used to strike out Young, and that's the pitch that made him
attractive to the Rangers in the trade. It's the pitch that labels
him as a future closer.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't always know where it's going. He walked 18
batters in 19 innings with the Tigers last year. That's why he
might need more minor-league seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got good stuff, but there's more to pitching here than
heat,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``He's got a good arm, but he
needs to learn how to pitch.''
Greer almost ready Left fielder Rusty Greer, out since Thursday
because of inflammation around his right ankle, could make his
spring debut today against the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Even though yesterday was only the third game of the spring,
Greer said he doesn't want to miss any more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early, but you have to work on your timing and things
like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever John Wetteland, out because of a strained right calf
muscle, remains day-to-day. He has been playing catch on flat
ground.
Venafro not progressing Continued soreness from a strained ligament
in his left middle finger is preventing Mike Venafro from throwing,
and the left-handed reliever is beginning to doubt whether he'll be
ready for Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize I can wish all I want, but it's just going to happen
in its own time,'' Venafro said. ``My mindset was always to get
ready for Opening Day. Now, it's just getting it healthy. You've
got to think long term. We want to get to the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Venafro's injury could create an opportunity for Doug Davis to
claim a left-handed relief job alongside Mike Munoz.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who was 11-4 with a 2.72 earned-run average between
Double-A Tulsa and Triple-A Oklahoma last year, made 69 of his 73
appearances in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   But he's 24 years old with 420 2/3 minor-league innings, so the
club isn't concerned about keeping him as a starter in the minors
for his development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I need him in, he'll be here,'' Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis pitched two scoreless innings against the Reds on
Saturday. Matt Perisho also would be a candidate if he doesn't win
a spot in the rotation, and Corey Lee also is in the mix.
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Boston Red Sox ace and American League Cy Young award winner
Pedro Martinez is scheduled to make his spring debut today against
the Rangers at Port Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez lost his bat on two consecutive pitches in the
fourth inning. The first one hit the tarp past the Rangers' dugout
down the left-field line. The second one sailed over the tarp and
into the stands, hitting a girl in the arm. The fans treated
Rodriguez to some sarcastic applause when he held on to it on his
next swing.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. isn't packing in the fans at Ed Smith Stadium.
The Reds failed to sell out their home opener Friday, and
attendance yesterday was 4,094. By contrast, the Rangers drew 5,015
for their opener at Charlotte County Stadium on Saturday.

KENYA'S MBITHI WINS L.A. MARATHON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The 15th Los Angeles Marathon was less a road race
than a lesson in survival.
</P>
<P>
   The heavens opened Sunday - rain pouring throughout the morning
-leaving this the first L.A. Marathon that almost seemed to have
more participants than spectators.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the last shivering runner crossed the finish line in
downtown Los Angeles, there was an upset winner in the men's
division, expected winners in the women's and wheelchair divisions,
and a lot of really wet people.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,000 runners braved the pelting rain and wind - some
covered in plastic parkas, some in trash-can liners, some even
holding umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   There was no surprise that the fastest of them all was a Kenyan,
just which Kenyan.
</P>
<P>
   Unheralded Benson Mutisya Mbithi, running in just his second
marathon, broke away from a small group at the 18th mile - and then
to the amazement of everyone - just kept going.
</P>
<P>
   Given the conditions, Mbithi ran a very respectable 2:11:55,
almost a full five minutes ahead of fellow Kenyan Mark Yatich at
2:16:43.
</P>
<P>
   In no upset, Kenyans actually captured the first five spots.
Peter Ndirangu was third at 2:17:41, and last year's winner, Simon
Bor, was fourth in 2:20:12. Bor ran a course-record 2:09:25 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The top American male to finish was Marco Ortiz of Los Angeles,
who took eleventh.
</P>
<P>
   If suspense was lacking for the men, it had to seem like heavy
drama compared to the women's race.
</P>
<P>
   Estonia's Jane Salumae dominated, leading by 1 minutes just six
miles into the race, and was never threatened. She won in 2:33:33,
with Romania's Nuta Olaru taking second in 2:35:14 and Peru's Maria
Portilla Cruz finishing third, 10 seconds back.
</P>
<P>
   The day's biggest winners might have been the umbrella salesmen,
though Saul Mendoza and Jean Driscoll were again impressive in
repeating their titles in the wheelchair division. For Mexico's
Mendoza, it was his fourth consecutive victory here.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you rolled, ran, jogged or walked to the finish, you
still had to endure elements that would have looked more familiar
to Captain Bligh than Joan Benoit. Runners had to leap over
puddles, mini-streams, and at times, run into the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was so strong in some places, it looked like you were
running standing still,'' Salumae said.
</P>
<P>
   It was 49 degrees and raining when runners approached the start
line under dark skies along Figueroa Street. The sun did not come
out until four hours later ... when the elite runners were long
finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It rained so hard at times, it actually hurt,'' said Bill
Burke, president of the L.A. Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   A group of five Kenyans quickly broke from the mediocre pack,
including rabbits Godfrey Kiprotich and Noah Bor, the brother of
Simon, who led early. They may have have set too fast a pace for
the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Mbithi waited behind the leaders, but at the 18th mile he
embraced the hills and made his move. Quickly the 22-year-old led
by 200 yards, and soon the camera couldn't find the trailing
runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was feeling very strong, so he went,'' said Federico Rosa,
his co-coach and agent. ``But I was worried he took the lead too
early.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbithi, however inexperienced, felt confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move I took, nobody could recover,'' Mbithi said.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow Kenyans, though, figured he would be run down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Benson made his move, I didn't think he would win,''
Yatich said. ``I was still thinking Ndirangu would make a move.''
</P>
<P>
   But all anyone could do was watch Mbithi do everything but
sprint to the $35,000 title. Like Salumae, he won the prize money
and a new Honda Accord.
</P>
<P>
   Salumae had been training in San Diego the past two months to
avoid these very kinds of conditions, common in Estonia in the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this kind of weather, but then I go to the
treadmill,'' she said. ``It was really horrible out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Salumae, the only female runner entered to have run under 2:30,
said she wasn't concerned she had gone out too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was really nobody out there who can run that fast,'' she
said. `I was ready for this. I had a lot of power left.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, however, was expecting a bitter challenge from
world-record holder Heinz Frei of Switzerland. Frei almost overtook
Mendoza at the finish line last year, but this time Mendoza jumped
out to a big lead at the third mile and Frei never would be a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Frei quit at the 17th mile; organizers were unable to learn if
he developed a flat tire, as he had in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for him to catch me, but when we got to the
hills I just made my lead bigger and bigger,'' Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.'s Driscoll won by an impressive 16 minutes in the
women's wheelchair division. Race representatives said she became
nauseated afterward, and she did not attend the postrace news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   No one was feeling too strong by day's end.

COMMENTARY: TURNOUT WILL DECIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cringing in the spotlight placed on his
university's racism by John McCain, Bob Jones III has just
announced a reversal of his dating policy: henceforth, a white
student can buy a soda for an Asian student without being expelled.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for tangible results from McCain, the real reformer?
One day the extremist who provided the Bush campaign launchpad may
even stop teaching _ as he still does today _ that Catholicism is a
``frightening cult.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in California, Ohio and New York, ``Wyly Coyote''
struck with a last-minute TV smear. Two of George W. Bush's biggest
Texas fat cats and overnight guests, the Wyly brothers, secretly
put up $2.5 million in soft money to mislead voters about McCain's
clean-air record. Bush professes total ignorance of his cronies'
pollution of the airwaves _ but never tells them to stop.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for proof positive of the need for McCain's campaign
finance reform? When financiers who make millions running
University of Texas investments deliver a last-minute low blow from
ambush, they make the case for stopping such hidden money's
corruption of our politics.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, when informed that suburban Republican women
were unimpressed by orders from the Pataki machine to support the
bosses' choice, Bush approved what hardball connoisseurs will
remember as his ``breast cancer deception.''
</P>
<P>
   In that too-cute trick, Bush staged an event and had a woman cut
a spot that all but implied McCain was soft on cancer. The
falsification of McCain's long record supporting breast cancer
research relied on the sly selection of a couple of principled
McCain votes against unexamined, uncompetitive federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   When informed that McCain's sister, a breast cancer victim
herself, called such a cruel charge ``absurd,'' Bush showed the
same insensitivity he displayed toward David Letterman's heart
operation. ``All the more reason to remind him,'' he shot back _
causing Long Island Republican Rep. Peter King to marvel at the
Texan's ``heart of stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Every political pro knows that Bush's callous exploitation of
women's concern about breast cancer is a card off the bottom of the
deck, but worried people bombarded with that official campaign spot
might be fooled.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, environmentalists know that while pollution in Bush's
Houston and Dallas has worsened, McCain's clean-air record is sound
_ but many viewers of Wyly Coyote's $2.5 million mudslinging ad
campaign will be deceived.
</P>
<P>
   What does this pattern of soft-money deception and hard-money
half-truth tell us about the Bush campaign?
</P>
<P>
   It tells us, first, that it is sore about being caught and
exposed as beholden to Pat Robertson and other ``agents of
intolerance'' for its salvation. Bush reacted to the public
reaction against the extremists by showing high dudgeon at being
held responsible for his chosen bedfellows. As a result, he
hardened his attitude of ``anything it takes to win the
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   That is sad for Republicans to see. Many of us had hoped that
lively primary competition would awaken a complacent candidacy and
prepare whoever won for one-on-one debates with the formidable Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Surely it woke up Bush and improved his style in crowds. But as
the Wyly Coyote and breast cancer tricks show, early adversity
toughened rather than strengthened his strategy, losing independent
voters. He has shied away from the necessary one-on-one debate
preparation, lately using Alan Keyes as his buffer, on Sunday
ducking the longstanding invitation of ``Meet the Press'' to debate
his chief opponent only.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, by mounting the soft-money tiger, Bush _ if he becomes
the candidate _ gives cover to the sort of smashmouth campaign that
the Democrats perfected in stealing the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Envision Al Gore, hand reverently over his heart, swearing no
knowledge of his supporters' huge buys of late-campaign blasts.
Democrats are gleeful at the prospect of ameliorating Gore's
Buddhist temple scandal by exposing the soft-money chicanery of the
Bush fat cats and religious extremists. Such an ``everybody does
it'' defense would collapse against McCain's withering attack and
reformist credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout's the key. The popular vote in California may again
confound the pollsters.

GORE CRITICIZES BUSH'S USE OF `SPECIAL INTERESTS' MONEY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRANSTON, R.I. _ Turning his sights on the Republicans, Vice
President Al Gore criticized Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on
campaign finance issues Sunday, saying he was flooding the campaign
with soft money and suggested that if Bush wins the Republican
nomination, he might not have won it fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Governor Bush defeats John McCain in some of these contests
on Tuesday, this will raise serious questions about whether he did
so fair and square,'' Gore said as he spoke at a senior citizens
forum here.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who holds a wide lead in polls over former Sen. Bill
Bradley in virtually every state where Democrats will vote on
Tuesday, was responding to reports that Bush's supporters were
spending millions of unrestricted dollars on ads attacking McCain
on environmental issues. The ads are running in New York,
California and Ohio, the three states with the biggest number of
delegates at stake in the Super Tuesday contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of the four candidates have endorsed campaign finance
reform,'' Gore said, in one of his hardest-hitting statements in
days. ``Governor Bush has not. And now we see the one candidate who
has not called for a ban on soft money using soft money in this
contest that will take place on Tuesday. We knew that Governor Bush
was in the hip pocket of the special interests; now we find what a
deep pocket that is _ $2.5 million all of a sudden flooding into
these contests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that it's wrong to flood soft money in these
contests,'' Gore added. ``I stand with Bill Bradley, with John
McCain and with the vast majority of the American people in saying
it is time to have meaningful campaign finance reform in law and a
higher standard in this campaign to get rid of the kind of
practices that we're seeing in the Republican contest from Governor
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to suggest that candidates who receive substantial
campaign contributions from special interests were likely to be
influenced by them. He said special interest contributions, such as
those from pharmaceutical companies, could make a candidate less
likely to vote for cheaper generic drugs. Similarly, he said, those
special interests could make a candidate ``less likely to show the
courage to say we want to get the pollution out of our environment
and have clean air and clean water and take on the problem of
global warming.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself has been vulnerable on the issue of campaign
finance, having been criticized for his fund-raising tactics in the
1996 campaign. Moreover, a longtime political fund-raiser for Gore,
Maria Hsia, was convicted on Thursday of five felony counts for her
role in arranging more than $100,000 in illegal donations to the
Democratic Party and its candidates in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   With media reports over the weekend of the role of special
interest money in the Bush campaign, Gore aides said, this was a
perfect opportunity for the vice president to turn the attention
away from his own problems and highlight those of his likely
Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made the remarks as he and Bradley concentrated on the East
Coast as they sprinted toward primaries and caucuses in 16 states
that Bradley says will be the decisive moment for his struggling
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In appearances in Buffalo, Maryland and Cleveland, as well as on
talk shows on national television, Bradley tried to rally his
supporters, refusing to give up hope for his campaign despite
trailing Gore by wide margins in polls in almost every state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with Vince Lombardi,'' he said, referring to the
former pro football coach in a live interview on ESPN Radio from
the ESPN Zone restaurant in Baltimore. ``There is no second place.
There is only first place.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Bradley continued to preach optimism, some of his
aides said they have begun making preparations for his exit from
the race soon after Tuesday's vote, working on a concession speech
and discussing the proper time and place to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on those preparations, Eric Hauser, Bradley's
campaign spokesman, said, ``The campaign and candidate are focused
on one thing, and that is doing well on Tuesday in as many places
as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Things look so bleak for Bradley in California that one of his
California campaign coordinators was traveling with him on the East
Coast on Sunday. And his advance staff was making only tentative
plans beyond Tuesday. Bradley plans to follow the results of
Tuesday's primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press'' Sunday morning, Bradley said he
would support Gore if the vice president became the Democratic
Party's nominee. But he said that he would not be Gore's running
mate under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   And asked whether Gore had run an honorable campaign, Bradley
carefully hedged his answer. ``He's said a number of things that
are untrue about his own record and about mine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think things in the last week or so have calmed
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said, ``I'm not prepared to say that defeat is on
the horizon.'' But when he was asked whether he was prepared to
lose, he said, ``I have no doubt I'll be able to deal with whatever
is out there. Because I know why I did this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters on a flight to Rhode Island Sunday afternoon
that he had softened his approach to Bradley in recent days because
Bradley had gotten softer on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that his tone changed in the last several days with
far less of the attack that had become commonplace,'' Gore said.
``And I wanted to reciprocate.''

SENATOR OPPOSES GRANTS FOR INDIAN TOBACCO STORES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Nev., Okla.)  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Department of Housing and Urban Development has
spent $4.2 million to subsidize the construction of at least six
discount cigarette stores on Indian reservations since 1996,
raising criticism from a Republican senator and an anti-tobacco
group.
</P>
<P>
   The stores, called smoke shops, sell tax-free cigarettes and
other tobacco products at discount prices, an arrangement the
critics say the government should not subsidize.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., chairman of the Senate
subcommittee that oversees financing for HUD, has called for the
agency to end grants for the stores.
</P>
<P>
   The grants are part of the Indian Community Development Block
Grant program, established in 1977, which sets aside 1 percent of
the annual appropriation for urban development grants to the states
to support development projects on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Bond's office said it found that the agency had paid for the
construction of six of the stores in Nevada and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the grants were given to help with construction,
land acquisition and the like, without regard to the kind of
business.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Bond in February, Hal C. DeCell III, an assistant
secretary at the agency, said the agency opposes cutting off the
money, which he called important to economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there are serious policy, programmatic and legal
constraints against such an action,'' DeCell said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the agency, David Egner, said in an interview
that it does not have the authority to ban legal products that are
sold in the facilities chosen for the grants. ``Federal block grant
programs are designed to give local governments, not Washington,
control over how to best spend federal funds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the program said it was well within the agency's
authority to refuse money for the stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my hope that HUD would know the difference between
right and wrong and voluntarily end its funding of high volume
sales and discount cigarettes,'' Bond said in a statement released
by his office. ``It now appears we may need to legislate a
common-sense solution for HUD.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the White House calling for an end to grants for
the stores, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids,
Matthew L. Myers, said, ``There is a massive difference between not
banning cigarette sales and actively encouraging them.''
</P>
<P>
   Egner, the agency spokesman, said, ``If Congress takes action in
our budget, and restricts us from doing this funding, then we would
obey that restriction.''
</P>
<P>
   But that would provoke opposition from the National Congress of
American Indians, a group that represents hundreds of tribes and
favors the program.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the group, Ron Allen, said, ``We will do two
things, we will make it very clear to the White House that in no
way should they sign off on a bill that has that kind of
discrimination measure in it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing we'll do is go to the Hill, because we have a
lot of friends there, and we'll get our friends to make this as
controversial as possible,'' Allen said.

<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. _ Gov. George W. Bush flew back west Sunday for
the last two days of the fight for California's 162 Republican
presidential delegates, promising that as president he would cut
taxes and improve the nation's education.
</P>
<P>
   In stops here and earlier in Stockton and Oakland, Bush stuck to
familiar themes as he sought to lock up a primary victory already
foreseen by all public polls here. Fighting a sore throat, he
seemed weary and kept his remarks brief.
</P>
<P>
   His emphasis on the twin issues of tax cuts and taking federal
money away from failing public school districts served not only to
distinguish him from Sen. John McCain, his Republican rival for the
nomination, who also returned to the state Sunday, but also from
Vice President Al Gore, whom he said he expected to face in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxes are the highest they have been since World War II,'' he
told an enthusiastic crowd in Oakland. He said later he was
referring to taxes as a percentage of the gross domestic product.
By some other measures taxes have been higher in recent years than
they are today.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his proposal to reduce federal taxes by $483 billion
dollars over 5 years was not only fair to taxpayers, giving them
money the government did not need, but also, ``by giving people
their money back, it is an insurance policy against an economic
downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   As he often does, Bush spoke with the most emotion when he
discussed education. ``Every child ought to have a first-rate
education,'' he said. ``There are no second-rate children. There
are no second-rate dreams.'' If elected, he would ``expect the
highest and the best for every child, like we done in the state of
Texas,'' he said, affecting a Texas drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating at a news conference later, Bush said his proposal
to take federal Title I money _ a program designed to help schools
with poor children _ away from failing school districts had been
unfairly attacked by people like Gore who said it would hurt the
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude, he said, reflected ``the soft bigotry of low
expectations'' and the belief that ``certain children can't
learn.'' Federal money, he insisted, should no longer subsidize
``mediocrity or failure.''
</P>
<P>
   He was barely into his education pitch when half a dozen
protesters briefly drowned him out. The protesters, opponents of
capital punishment, shouted, ``Stop the executions _ moratorium
now!'' and ``Murderer!'' They were hustled out by security guards,
and as they left the auditorium they passed another group, silent
McCain supporters holding picket signs with slogans like ``Not
ready for prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's weariness showed in occasional verbal slips. Once while
discussing terrorism and various foreign threats, he promised to
``use our technology to enhance uncertainties abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   And when a German correspondent asked him what he thought about
the dispute over who should be the next head of the International
Monetary Fund, he said, ``I think I will reserve judgment on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, a bigger crowd of perhaps 3,000 people gathered in a
hangar at the Stockton airport. After a band played ``Taking Care
of Business,'' Bush, in that agricultural center, turned his
attention to farm issues, calling for aggressive presidential
efforts to open foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   However, he fumbled his phrasings and actually said he wanted to
be a president who will ``knock down barriers and tariffs so our
farmers and ranchers have a chance to sell their home-grown
products all across America.'' Tariffs between states were
prohibited by the framers of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   He also returned to the tax issue, telling a cheering audience:
``The surplus isn't government's money. The surplus is the people's
money.''

HE'S CROSSING THE PACIFIC, STEP BY STEP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Australia)  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OFF MARINA DEL REY, Calif. _ Remy Bricka is a pleasant man who
brings to mind a cheerful uncle who would drop $5 where a kid could
find it. ``He seems like such a normal guy'' is how Alice Leahey, a
vice commodore at the California Yacht Club, put it.
</P>
<P>
   Bricka's unassuming disposition makes his current endeavor seem
all the more audacious. He is walking across the Pacific Ocean,
from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia, with nothing more than a
pair of canoelike skis, a double-sided paddle and a catamaran tied
to his waist and towed behind him, where he stores provisions and
sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   That is a distance of about 7,800 miles, and he expects his
journey to take about six months, provided he walks 14 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this life I have flesh and bone,'' he said Sunday by way of
explanation when asked why he was doing this. ``I know our time
goes very quickly. In eternity, our time is one second. In this one
second, I will use my time to realize my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Bricka arrived in Los Angeles with no notice or fanfare about
two weeks ago from the Alsace region of France, where he has a wife
and daughter and works as an entertainer _ actually an ``homme
orchestre,'' or one-man band.
</P>
<P>
   A few people, including Bricka himself, see his plan as a
testament to human determination, while others see it as quixotic
at best, foolhardy and dangerous at worst. Some see it as a mixture
of all three, and in the crowd of about 40 well-wishers who came to
the California Yacht Club to see him off Sunday, it was uttered
more than once in a baffled, astonished tone: ``He's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Bricka's second adventure across the high seas. For 40
days in 1988 he walked across the Atlantic Ocean from the Canary
Islands to Trinidad. That feat landed him in the Guinness Book of
World Records for longest distance walked across water, 3,502
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Bricka, 50, wrote a book about the experience, ``L'Homme Qui
Marche sur L'Eau'' _ the man who walks on water _ which was
published by a French company in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   This time his trip will be documented on the Web site of the
Alsatian sauerkraut company that is sponsoring it,
www.stoeffler.com, with Webcam images updated each day and
satellite transmissions of his location. Bricka took 22 pounds of
kraut with him.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in the Pacific will be far more challenging than they
were in the Atlantic, especially at this time of year. Storms will
make conditions extremely rough, with heavy currents, winds of up
to 60 mph and swells commonly reaching 12 feet and higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people are lost at sea every year because of this
foolishness,'' said Roger Lukas, an oceanographer at the University
of Hawaii. ``This guy sounds like an excellent candidate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bricka said goodbye to his wife and daughter in France, he said,
because it was less emotional than bringing them with him and
saying goodbye here.
</P>
<P>
   So he spent Sunday morning preparing for his trip, packing
tomatoes, crackers, oranges and energy bars and readying his gear.
He offered a ``merci beaucoup'' to those gathered around him at the
dock, lowered his skis into the water, stepped into them and set
off. Working against the wind, he first towed his rig behind him
and then had friends on a boat tow it until he got out of the
harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he reclaimed it and set off paddling for the horizon,
looking very, very small against the pitching vastness of the
Pacific.

BLOCKING OUT THE FANS' SIREN SONG AND LISTENING TO YOUR BODY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By dusk Sunday the Knicks were fading, too. The
veteran Utah Jazz was giving and going, picking and rolling and
generally running the slumping home team in circles.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had no energy, no spark. That's because the spark and
energy was on the bench wearing a sharp steel-gray suit with a
black shirt and black tie. Marcus Camby, the Knicks' 6-foot-11
X-factor, was on the sideline with a knee injury, watching his team
take it on the chin for a second straight game, this time in an
88-79 loss to the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we lose I feel extra hurt inside because I want to
play,'' Camby said. ``It's just hurting me more when we take L's
like this. I just want to be out there as quickly as possible to
try to turn this thing around.''
</P>
<P>
   The impetuous Camby wants to help. But the knee he injured on
Feb. 6 is not healing quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The fans are calling out: ``Come on, Marcus.'' ``When are you
coming back, Marcus.''
</P>
<P>
   Intoxicating stuff for a budding 24-year-old star whose
imprimatur is jumping like a thunderbolt and energizing the team.
But after Sunday's game some of the older Jazz players had advice
for their young adversary: Slow down, Marcus. The league will be
here; the Knicks will be here. Your knees might not.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz's veteran forward Armon Gilliam said: ``There's been
one case after another where the team doctor will say one thing and
give you one impression and later on, after you still have
complications and problems, you go to another doctor and you find
out something totally different was going on. You feel betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday Camby disregarded Dr. Norman Scott's advice to
take a few more days rest. He rushed back to practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks didn't stop him; Coach Jeff Van Gundy didn't refuse
to allow him to practice. He wanted to take a peek at Camby's
condition, too. Camby practiced, attempted a leap or two and felt
pain. His knee swelled.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's loss in Atlanta, Camby let loose: ``It's been
misdiagnosed from the beginning. From when it first happened until
now, it's definitely been strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott first diagnosed a partial tear of Camby's anterior
cruciate ligament. He performed exploratory arthroscopic surgery
and determined that the injury was a strain.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime Sunday, Scott assured the media: ``There was no
misdiagnosis. Marcus is recovering very nicely from his injured
anterior cruciate ligament. He practiced once and he's going to
practice again tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott continued: ``I would trust that the majority of his
rehabilitation is completed. With a ligament injury we are going to
err on the side of being cautious. It's a significant injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he was not upset with Camby for his comments.
``Marcus is a young, aggressive, enthusiastic competitor,'' Scott
said. ``Right now he is extremely frustrated. I've been doing this
22 years; I've seen this many times. That's OK. I'd rather have a
person wanting to come back and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby agreed Sunday that the air had been cleared. He said he
originally thought the problem may have been Scott's surgery, not
the injury the surgery was supposed to repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the surgery, it's actually the injury that's taking
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what the Knicks told him.
</P>
<P>
   Last November Camby injured his left knee and was leery about
coming back too soon. Scott's diagnosis was tendinitis and told
Camby he could play with pain and not suffer any further damage.
But Camby said Patrick Ewing told him to be wary of such advice.
Ewing said that Scott told him in October of last season that he
could play with Achilles tendinitis and not risk further injury.
But the tendon tore during the Eastern Conference finals against
Indiana in June.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of doctor-player relationships has become difficult
enough that the National Basketball Association Players Association
has established a panel of doctors for players to consult for a
second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   That idea evolved from a case involving Charles Smith, the
former Knick. In 1996 he filed a grievance with the NBA, contending
that the team and its doctors withheld information about the
severity of his knee injury. Smith claimed he did further damage to
his knee because he was not fully informed. Scott performed
arthroscopic surgery on Smith's knees twice. Smith frequently flew
to Los Angeles for a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just one story out of probably 200 I can name,'' Gilliam
said. ``Everybody's got a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy defended the Knicks' medical staff: ``I know Dr. Scott
has the player's best interests in mind at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gilliam countered: ``Unfortunately, it's hard to trust the
team doctor because they're more beholden to the team than the
players. At this point I get second and third opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam added: ``You have to be concerned enough about your own
well-being that you're going to take the extra step and do some
research of your own to make sure you're getting the absolute best
advice and best diagnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam said his advice to Camby was simple: slow down, Marcus.

   CHIBUTO, Mozambique _ The truck driver hauls the water tanks
into the dusty refugee camp, and the thirsty wait with chipped mugs
and cupped hands.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday morning, there were 5,500 people and not much more
than 75 gallons for them to drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, it's all finished,'' said Arminda Jaime Vombe,
a camp coordinator, shaking her head no, no, no at a weary woman
holding out a plastic cup. Vombe is getting used to saying no.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in this refuge for the survivors of this country's
calamitous floods, there are thousands of homeless families, but
only six tents and two latrines. There are first-aid workers, but
no medicines, and illnesses are beginning to spread. There is a
hospital nearby, but it has no electricity. The nurses comfort
their patients by candlelight.
</P>
<P>
   Vombe does not weep when she tells the sick to walk the mile to
the hospital because the camp has no car, or when she sees the Red
Cross workers struggle to carry them there. But she sagged when an
old man vomited in the red dirt, his bony body shuddering in the
midday heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask us for food, but there's not enough,'' she said,
watching the man helplessly. ``People arrive sick, but we don't
have medicine. They were saved from the water, but they don't have
a place to stay and we don't have much to offer them.''
</P>
<P>
   The flood waters are subsiding here, but the government's
struggle to provide for the victims is just getting under way. The
United Nations says that 250,000 people now live in 64 camps around
the country, and most of them need food, clean water, medicine and
tents. Another 250,000 remain in devastated villages, but they also
need help.
</P>
<P>
   Relief agencies say a shortage of helicopters has made it
impossible to deliver enough food and supplies. But Ross Mountain,
the United Nations' special envoy to Mozambique, said the emergency
food effort had become ``the top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, the desperation for food is becoming painfully
evident. In the town of Chokwe, some people rioted recently when it
became clear there was not enough emergency food to go around, and
relief agencies have temporarily halted deliveries there.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers fear that the situation may worsen if heavy rains
return to the region Monday evening, as forecast by the South
African Weather Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In this camp, known as Wenela, the survivors sleep on black
plastic bags or dusty canvas cloths and scramble to line up when
the water arrives. It is enough to make some wonder whether the
gods are playing a cruel joke, first drenching their country in
water and then leaving its people without enough to drink.
</P>
<P>
   Jacinto Ignacio Chilaule wonders. In his dreams, the angels
point to a beautiful place. ``They show me good things,'' said
Chilaule, 36, who has been in the camp for three days now. ``They
tell me, `If you get there, you're going to be OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   But then he wakes up and he is lying on the ground and he
remembers that he cannot feed his four children. ``I used to have a
kettle,'' said Chilaule, who manages to keep his only shirt and
pair of trousers neat. ``I used to have three cows, goats,
chickens, a house and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream makes me happy, but when I wake up, I'm sad. There
are too many people here. And the way we are living is
deteriorating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wenela camp opened last week, shortly after severe floods
swept the country, leaving hundreds dead and nearly a million
without homes or livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   Workers say there are only 10 plates for every 200 or 300
people. One group of 600 _ the homeless have been separated by
their hometowns _ tries to make do with a single metal cooking pot.
Some women stir porridge over smoky fires with tree branches
because the camp has run out of spoons.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the shortage of water, some people in the camp now
walk 11 miles to the closest river, which is muddy and unclean. The
Red Cross urges women to boil the water before drinking, but there
are barely enough pots for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of latrines also presents potential health risks.
Teresinha Xochua Nhone, a first-aid worker for the Red Cross, said
that too many people find themselves forced to urinate and defecate
in the camp, where they eat and sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, she was digging holes with a green shovel to bury litter
and waste. ``We're trying to keep the place clean so we don't have
infections,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But illnesses are already spreading. Esperanza Zita, who keeps
the camp statistics for the Red Cross, pulled out a spiral notebook
with carefully tallied figures in blue ink.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two days, she said, more than 500 people have been
sent to the local hospital, suffering from malaria, diarrhea and
conjunctivitis. Last week, a woman died, although no one knows the
precise cause.
</P>
<P>
   Zita says she will continue working with the camp's sick, even
though she knows she may put her own health at risk. ``We have the
courage,'' she said. ``We have the heart. But we need the
supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Sunday night, South African military
officials, who led the rescue mission here, described how their
emphasis was shifting to delivering food and supplies. ``That's a
major priority and a major headache, getting the food, medical
supplies and clean water,'' said Mountain, of the United Nations.
``That's the top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Julieta Tovela, 43, hopes that is true. She arrived in the camp
on Saturday; Sunday afternoon, she had still had nothing to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I prayed last night, I prayed that God would give me the
things I lost,'' said Tovela, who no longer has a house or a
village. ``I lost so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Carlos Tivane, 22, had been stranded in a tree with her
sister and two children for four days when she was rescued on
Tuesday. Sunday afternoon, she stopped a stranger to beg for water.
``We haven't had anything today, not even water,'' Tivane said.
``Yesterday, we had porridge, but we gave most of it to the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was grateful to the South African soldiers who
plucked her from the branches. But when she looks in her baby's
eyes, she cannot help but feel that their journey to safety has
only begun. ``I'm happy the helicopter came to save us,'' she said,
``but we're still hungry.''

COMMENTARY: WHY THIS MAN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bruce Barket, a straight-arrow defense lawyer and
former Nassau County prosecutor, agreed to defend Antowine Butts in
a double homicide case because the Brooklyn district attorney,
Charles Hynes, was thinking about seeking the death penalty against
Butts. Barket has a private practice, but at times takes on capital
cases through the state's capital defender's office.
</P>
<P>
   When Hynes decided to forgo the death penalty, seeking instead a
sentence of life without parole, Barket decided to stay with the
case because he was convinced that Butts was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been convinced of his innocence, literally, since the
day I met him,'' said Barket. ``The witnesses that the prosecution
ended up putting before the jury were a disgrace. One person was an
all-but-acknowledged accomplice to whoever did the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime was the cold-blooded murder of a grocery-store owner
and his young employee in December 1997. Butts spent two years in
jail, based largely on the accusation of a crackhead and chronic
criminal named Martin Mitchell. When the case was finally tried
last month, a jury gave short shrift to the prosecution's pathetic
effort, and quickly acquitted Butts.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious question that hovered over the case was why Mitchell
wasn't charged with anything. He admitted he was at a meeting at
which the murder of the store owner was planned, and he was outside
the store when the killings occurred.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the trial transcript suggests an answer. Out of the
presence of the jury, Barket told the judge, Alan D. Marrus, that
Mitchell had said, in a tape-recorded interview with Barket, that
he had been threatened and intimidated by the police, and ended up
making false accusations against Butts.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said, according to Barket, that he knew when he picked
Butts out of a lineup that he was fingering the wrong man. But he
said the cops had threatened him, telling him that he would be
locked up himself if he didn't give them information about the
murders.
</P>
<P>
   Barket told me, in an interview last week, that he sat down with
Mitchell in early February, turned on a tape recorder and asked him
what had really happened. ``I said to him,'' said Barket, ```If I
showed you a picture of my client, could you tell me if he's the
murderer?' He says, `Sure.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barket showed Mitchell a photo of Antowine Butts. Then,
according to Barket, the following exchange occurred: ``I say, `Do
you recognize him?' and he goes, `Oh yeah, that's him.' I say,
`Excuse me?' He goes, `That's the kid from the lineup.' I said,
`OK, is that also the kid from the murder?' He goes: `No. That was
somebody else.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, Mitchell said he couldn't remember whether, under
police questioning, he had identified anyone as the masked man who
shot the two people in the store. He said that when the crime
occurred, he was drunk from alcohol and stoned on crack and
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he had identified Butts. And the district attorney's
office used that identification as the cornerstone of its case
against Butts.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office continues to insist that Mitchell
was telling the truth the first time around and denies that he was
ever intimidated by investigators. Dennis Hawkins, Hynes' deputy,
said prosecutors believe Mitchell changed his story because he was
intimidated by Butts.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that there ``are other suspects in this case.''
He declined to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   One can't help but wonder who those suspects are and what Hynes
and the Police Department are doing to capture them. The guess here
is not much.
</P>
<P>
   Butts, who has had only one brush with the law, a single
instance of turnstile jumping, has insisted throughout that he was
at home taking care of his three children when the murders
occurred. There are telephone records that support his alibi.
</P>
<P>
   But the district attorney's office, for reasons that are
difficult to fathom, chose to believe Mitchell, the crackhead with
a string of serious crimes in his past.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Antowine Butts was charged with first-degree murder
and Martin Mitchell, who told investigators what they wanted to
hear, was given a free pass, courtesy of the Brooklyn district
attorney's office.

IT'S ALL IMAGE, EXCEPT WITH KARL MALONE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Olden Polynice fastened his iridescent blue tie to his starched
white shirt, eventually slipping into a pressed coat to complete
the ensemble. This is how most National Basketball Association
players dress. Immaculately tailored, they often look as if they
were going to a seminal board meeting after the game.
</P>
<P>
   And here comes Karl Malone. Clump. Clump. Clump. Denim jeans.
Brown leather boots. Faded T-shirt and baseball cap. You wonder if
his tractor is double-parked on 33rd Street or whether Madison
Square Garden has added a feed-and-fertilizer show to the weekend
docket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't dress like that,'' Malone said, pointing to Polynice,
his Utah Jazz teammate. ``That might be how everybody else dresses,
but that's not me. I would never feel comfortable spending that
kind of money on clothes. A hunting trip, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical Malone story: In the summer of 1998, he retreated to his
Arkansas ranch to work out with his brothers after the Jazz fell to
Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in Game 6 of the NBA finals.
Pumping weights outdoors in 95-degree heat, Malone sat perspiring
profusely when one of his concerned brothers asked, ``Are you
afraid you're doing too much?''
</P>
<P>
   Malone glared at him incredulously. ``I'm afraid I'm not doing
enough.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are few originals left in the NBA. At age 36, one of them
dropped 30 points on the Knicks on Sunday afternoon _ most accrued
by employing step-back jump shots. Malone also threw up a sky hook
in the fourth quarter, and it went in. With the Jazz trying to put
the game away, he lofted a soft finger roll from about 5 feet that
touched only net. Physically, he and John Stockton were too strong,
and savvy, the main reason Utah held off the Knicks, 88-79.
</P>
<P>
   In body and spirit, Malone keeps on going. Scott Layden, the
Knicks' general manager, who left Utah last summer after almost a
two-decade relationship with the Jazz, recently likened Malone and
Stockton to Cal Ripken Jr. The thinking was that the two Jazz
players should be celebrated for their consistency and longevity in
much the same way Ripken was a few years ago when he broke Lou
Gehrig's record for consecutive games played; that America should
one day warm to Karl and John as it has to Cal.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't happen. Baseball is big on nostalgia, able to
market its past as well its future. Sad but true: The NBA would
rather give an unprepared 19-year-old keys to the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody always wants to usher out the old breed and
in with the new, and people get on that bandwagon,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finish this game, for all the guys who like Karl
Malone, great. For all the people that didn't, great. I'm not going
to lose any sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone's lack of national appeal is hardly the league's fault.
He has routinely gone against the grain, from voicing concerns
about playing against an HIV-positive player when Magic Johnson
tried to return to the NBA the first time, to alienating his own
fans by asking out of Utah nearly every time his thin skin was
pricked by criticism.
</P>
<P>
   He once poked fun at his peers' sudden obsession with golf,
saying: ``The only reason they took it up is because Michael Jordan
started playing. Half of 'em can't even play.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a league of players so often consumed with image and
corporate concerns, it is still refreshing to see someone say what
he feels, irrespective of the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago the filmmaker Spike Lee noticed Malone on
television wearing an FBI cap, a cherished gift Malone had received
from a woman who worked at the bureau in Portland, Ore. Lee, a
Knick fan, sent a box of ``Malcolm X'' hats to Malone soon after
his movie began to receive critical acclaim. The letter
accompanying the package urged Malone not to wear the FBI hat.
``Basically, it said: `I respect you as a player and a person and I
always have. But, my brother, if you only knew what the FBI did to
us a number of years ago, you wouldn't be wearing that hat,'''
Malone said in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Malone contacted Lee's publicist and sent a fax back, in effect,
saying, no thank you. ``It wasn't a disrespect thing,'' Malone
said. ``Because I like him and his movies. But I'm not going to let
anybody influence me in something I don't believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   He listens to country music. He drives a Harley-Davidson. He
wonders why many NBA players are consumed with being chauffeured
around in limousines instead of merely driving to work themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Standing there in his jeans and baseball cap Sunday afternoon,
you realize Karl Malone is not changing for anyone anytime soon;
that true originals from the West don't believe in spending money
on iridescent blue ties.

SOME PRIMARY VOTERS EXPRESS DOUBTS ON MCCAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. _ Among Republicans in this most
Republican of California coastal towns, there's a feeling that
something's not quite right about John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Lynda Ward, for example, was never terribly comfortable with the
Arizona senator. So last week, she cast an absentee ballot for
Texas Governor George W. Bush, whom she described as ``nice, kind,
family-oriented and moral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, McCain sounded liberal,'' said Ward, a real
estate properties manager. ``Then he said he's a Reagan Republican,
but I don't think he really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite McCain's 18-year voting record as a fiscal and social
conservative in Congress, his Republican problem is widespread in
California, as it is nationally. While he succeeds among
independents and Democrats, he has struggled within his party.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, when voters here go to the polls, McCain is expected to
lose the Republican primary to Bush by a wide margin. Recent polls
show McCain trailing Bush among California's 5 million Republicans
by as many as 20 points. And only Republican voters will determine
who wins the 162 delegates at stake, one-sixth of the total
necessary to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's trouble with Republicans seems born of many sources,
interviews with voters and political observers suggest. As a
newcomer to the national scene, McCain is being judged on
fragmentary perceptions of his record and character. First
impressions thus become crucial; early doubts, hard to shake.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, to some Republicans, McCain's combative stump style can be
off-putting. (To Ward, he seems ``mean.'') To others, he seems less
reliably conservative than Bush. His reformist calls to throw open
the doors of the Republican party to new constituencies have been
greeted by many with puzzlement or wariness.
</P>
<P>
   It seems odd, some say, that so many Republican leaders,
particularly in Congress, view him with distaste. And his message
of fiscal responsibility seems to have been largely lost in the
mix.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that McCain has been unable to reach people like
William and Carol Young, both Republicans and both planning to vote
for Bush. William Young, a retired auto-parts dealer, did not like
McCain's attack on the Christian right nor does he perceive McCain
to be conservative enough.
</P>
<P>
   And Carol Young, an appraiser, questions McCain's temperament
and the effect that 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam had
on him emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shoots from the hip without thinking, and we don't need a
man like that,'' she said. ``He needs to know what he says has a
lot of ramifications, and he needs to be more careful.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who also voted for former president Bush, say they
have confidence in the younger Bush. ``I think he's better
prepared,'' said William Young. Added his wife: ``He comes from an
established political family. He knows the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's lag among Republicans has not gone unnoticed by his
campaign, of course. Bill McInturff, McCain's pollster, compares it
to a brand marketing problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush brand is a generation old and the McCain brand is
about four weeks old,'' McInturff said. That's not a problem for
independents or Democrats who were never attached to the ``Bush
brand'' in the first place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for Republicans, ``You're asking them if they want Bud, Bud
Lite, or a whole new beer,'' he said. ``It's easier to get them to
transfer from Bud to Bud Lite than to try a whole different beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in New Hampshire and Arizona has McCain been able to win a
majority of Republican support. But he spent about a year
traversing the Granite State, letting voters get to know him, and
in his home state of Arizona, voters already know him and his
record well. In Michigan, the only other state McCain has won,
Republicans supported Bush by 66 percent to 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In other states that have held primaries, South Carolina,
Virginia, and Washington state, McCain lost the Republican vote by
more than 40 percent each time.
</P>
<P>
   McCain officials are hoping that the senator's final venture
into California Monday will soothe concerns among GOP voters and
give him the boost he needs for Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If California Republicans go to vote on Tuesday knowing that
John McCain wants to save Social Security, cut government spending,
ban Internet taxes, and run a school-voucher program that doesn't
take money from the public schools, we'll win,'' said Dan Schnur,
McCain's communications director and a veteran California
strategist.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain hasn't been talking much about those things during
the past week as he grappled with attacks from the Bush campaign
and lashed out at the Rev. Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry
Falwell, Christian conservative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was especially hurtful to him is that he's gone off
message the past few days,'' said John J. Pitney Jr., a government
professor at Claremont McKenna College here. ``Instead of sticking
to reform, he's gone off on his Captain Queeg routine, arguing that
the religious right has stolen his strawberries.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Spillane, a Republican political consultant in Sacramento,
said Republican voters want to hear about managing federal
spending, cutting pork barrel projects, and improving education.
They don't want to hear about campaign finance reform or the
Christian right, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republican voters are suspicious of him,'' Spillane said.
``They don't like that the media likes him, and they don't like
that Democrats and independents like him, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Orange County, traditionally a conservative bastion,
there is a Republican civil war for control of the Central
Committee, which oversees county government. It is old guard vs.
new, arch conservative vs. moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Brewer, the only California assemblywoman to endorse
McCain, thinks this quiet revolution, as she puts it, will help him
at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's coming from behind,'' conceded Brewer, who
represents this white, wealthy, conservative town. ``He's up
against the old establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   But even younger Republicans seem to be skeptical of McCain.
Mark Nelson, the father of two toddlers, says he is voting for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be difficult for McCain to get things done in
the White House,'' said Nelson, a manager at Chevron. ``Not enough
members of Congress seem to respect him.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ When the final horn sounded Sunday afternoon, St. Johns'
Bootsy Thornton retreated to the safety of the bench and sat alone
as the Miami students stampeded the floor to celebrate a 74-70
overtime victory and a piece of the Big East Conference
regular-season championship.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton had been run over enough by the Hurricanes. The same
was true for St. John's in a 45-minute slam dance complete with
jersey tugs, hip checks and hammerlocks that left the Red Storm
seeded third in the conference tournament, which begins Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Unranked Miami emerged with its first title since 1965, when
Rick Barry led the Hurricanes to the Florida Intercollegiate
Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six minutes of regulation and in overtime, the game
resembled a shirts-and-skins match. There were bone-jarring fouls
and many trips to the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was aggressive out there,'' said Lavor Postell, who led St.
John's with 16 points. ``The refs let us play. There were missed
calls on both ends of the court, so I can't complain. They just
outhustled us.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before Mario Bland, a 6-foot-6, 265-pound senior playing
his last game at home, made a jumper from the foul line with 2.6
seconds left in regulation to tie the score, 62-62, the Hurricanes
showed themselves masters of the mosh pit. Miami outrebounded the
Red Storm, 45-36.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to be a war because guys like Anthony
Glover and Postell are hard-nosed warriors,'' said Bland, whose 19
points helped lead the Hurricanes (20-9, 13-3 Big East).
</P>
<P>
   In tying Syracuse for the Big East regular-season title, Miami
will be seeded second in the conference tournament at Madison
Square Garden. St. John's could have tied Syracuse for the title
and earned the top seeding with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th-ranked Red Storm (21-7, 12-4) seemed intimidated by the
Hurricanes and the noisy crowd of 7,158 at Miami Arena.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's, which had an eight-game winning streak on the line,
had the services of Erick Barkley, who was coming back from a
one-game suspension for accepting aide from Riverside Church for
prep school tuition aid. It didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm's troubles at the foul line in regulation extended
into overtime. St. John's, which was 19 of 28, missed four foul
shots in the final 10 minutes of regulation, two of them on the
front end of one-and-one situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be a championship team and not make free throws,''
said Dermon Player, St. John's assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm's free-throw problems helped Miami trim a 7-point
deficit to 1 and set up a strange call. With 35 seconds left and
the Red Storm ahead by 61-60, Postell drove left into the lane,
vaulted over Hemsley and hit a 12-foot shot that was accompanied by
whistles _ two of them. Referee John Cahill, stationed at the top
of the key, called charging; his colleague Will Bush, standing on
the baseline, ruled that basket was good, called holding on Hemsley
and awarded a free throw.
</P>
<P>
   After a midcourt meeting, the officials waved off the basket,
issued fouls to both Postell and Hemsley and gave the ball to St.
John's. After the game, Cahill said it was a ``simple double
foul.'' St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis called it creative, and said
the ruling would go ``down in the books.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Red Storm could have gone up by 63-60 when Barkley
went to the foul line for two free throws with 14 seconds left. But
the sophomore, who had not practiced since last Monday, the day
before his one-game suspension, missed the first foul shot before
hitting the second one and leaving the door open for Bland.
</P>
<P>
   ``My timing was off,'' said Barkley, who scored 15 points on
5-of-15 shooting. He denied, however, that the Hurricane fans _ who
rattled keys in reference to the car-swapping incident that cost
him a two-game suspension last month and waved money to taunt him
over the the tuition-aid suspension _ affected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they try to bring up the past, it's kind of silly,'' he
said. ``But it's part of life. It makes me stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, Barkley hit a 3-pointer to tie the score, 67-67,
with 2:02 left and St. John's was poised to make one last push for
the conference tournament's top seeding.
</P>
<P>
   With 28 seconds left and Miami leading, 71-69, Thornton had a
chance to tie the score with two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   But he missed his first attempt, and after Miami's Elton Tyler
blocked Barkley's final drive to the basket, the Red Storm was
forced to settle for a a game Thursday with either Villanova or
Pittsburgh. Those teams play in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, who scored 11 points on 4-of-12 shooting and turned
the ball over three times, watched the Miami faithful storm the
court before eventually finding shelter on the team's bus.

TWO NEW YORKERS LEAD THE CHEERS FOR BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an advertisement broadcast only in New York,
former Sen. Bill Bradley's campaign has teamed up two
quintessential New Yorkers, former Mayor Ed Koch and Spike Lee, a
film director and a renowned Knicks fan, who are endorsing
Bradley's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   The two men try to top each other with assertions about what a
great guy Bill Bradley is _ a point punctuated when Lee takes a
faux jump shot that seems to remind any voter who has forgotten it
that among Bradley's achievements is his professional basketball
career with the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN Koch and Lee are seated beside each other in what
appears to be a cafe at a busy city intersection. Lee is wearing a
black leather jacket while Koch has on a coat and tie. Through the
large windows behind them, people and traffic move in a hustling
tableau of city life. As in many of Bradley's campaign
advertisements, the camera bobs and weaves in the signature style
of a television series like ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' and the advertisement
has a musical score with a light rap beat playing behind a rhythmic
script.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT Lee opens the spot, saying, ``There are lots of
things Ed and I don't agree upon, but both of us want Bill
Bradley.'' Koch responds, ``I'm supporting Bill Bradley 'cause he
will protect Medicare.'' Lee: ``And put more teachers in the
classroom. When it come to being real, Bradley wins hands down.''
Koch: ``Gun control, education, Bradley has the edge.'' Lee: ``He
knows New York.'' Koch: ``Tax policy.'' Lee (making a motion with
his hands): ``Jump shot.'' Koch: ``Tough choice?'' Lee: ``Oh
yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY Since Lee and Koch do not mention Vice President Al
Gore and do not actually assert any facts _ and they merely allude
to issues like education, Medicare and gun control _ there is
little room to quibble with the fairness of the advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD The point of the advertisement is to highlight two
high-profile celebrity New Yorkers whose names are closely linked
to the city's political and cultural life. It also sets Bradley up
as a figure with appeal to both Jewish and black voters in New
York, where the two constituencies are especially important in
Democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign has used celebrities before, like Michael
Jordan, the former Chicago Bulls basketball star, to endorse him
and broaden his appeal. Koch, with his back-slapping gestures and
high-pitched laugh, plays hot to Lee's urbane cool. The point, of
course, is that Bradley is a virtual New Yorker and that if these
two put him in their league, so should everyone else.

<P>
   Medical experts say the most trustworthy Web sites are those run
by the federal government, like http://www.nih.gov, and by national
organizations like the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those sites, however, experts say there are guidelines
and even Web sites that can help individuals decide whether to
trust an electronic site.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association suggests checking the source of
the information and the financing for the site in judging its
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Warning signs include sites that seem to be promoting products
or that offer miraculous treatments or cures. The association also
says to check how often the information is updated and who reviews
it.
</P>
<P>
   Other advice comes from Dr. Ragnar Levi of the Swedish Council
on Technology Assessment in Health Care, who recently analyzed the
problem of determining the quality of information on Web sites.
Writing in the current issue of the magazine Skeptical Inquirer,
Levi notes that a Web site by the Health on the Net Foundation, a
nonprofit group in Geneva,
http://www.hon.ch/HONcode/HONcode(underscore)check.html, provides a
checklist of questions that can help people assess a site's
credibility.

   SHANTOU, China _ From a small storefront in an old section of
this neon-laced seaside city, Zheng Jie has a unique way to
quantify the effect of China's current antismuggling campaign: He
counts snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Zheng, a snake broker, sells an aphrodisiac made with venomous
snakes, as well as live black slithering ones that restaurants use
in expensive stews. Two years ago the store sold 600 snakes a day.
Now it is lucky to offload 60. Employees have dwindled to seven
from 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snakes are something that businessman eat at banquets, but
ordinary people can't often afford,'' he said. ``So of course the
antismuggling campaign affects us locals, because smuggling is how
business is done here.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of tolerance, China is waging a desperate war on the
smuggling and corruption that have long helped to enrich the
country's prosperous southern provinces at the expense of central
government coffers.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where government campaigns often amount to
background noise, this campaign _ expected to be a central theme of
China's parliamentary session _ has clearly hit its mark.
Nationally, tariff income was up 80 percent last year. In Shantou
itself, the increase was nearly 500 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the antismuggling campaign, designed to increase revenues
and to clean up the government's badly tarnished image, has already
proved to be an exceedingly delicate balancing act, because
important regional economies are intertwined with smuggling, and
also because zealous pursuit of the crime often, embarrassingly,
ends up at the Communist Party's own door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party has the determination and the ability and the means
to punish corruption and excise this malignant tumor,'' said Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji, in a recent antismuggling speech, hammering on
what is expected to be a central theme of China's annual
parliamentary session this month.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Shantou, where the smuggling of diesel oil, cars,
cell phones, videodisk players and much more has long underpinned
the economy, there is a vast ripple effect when police get tough
with smugglers: Lime-green luxury flats sit empty on Jinsha Road,
taxi drivers queue for hours to get a fare, factories that used
cheap smuggled cloth now teeter on the brink of bankruptcy.
``Without smuggling there is no economy here,'' said a taxi driver
named Gao.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, as investigations drag on, the number of
senior government officials involved seems to grow. In Shantou, the
customs chief and numerous local officials were replaced last year.
In Xiamen, the government's about-to-be completed investigation of
a $10 billion smuggling ring has implicated the city's deputy party
secretary, the head of its customs office and the provincial police
chief, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign and Chinese experts estimate that half of all
Chinese customs officials in some areas are involved in smuggling,
and add that the corruption extends far up the chain of command.
They question whether Zhu will be able and willing to excise a
malignant tumor that lies so close to the country's economic and
political heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government says that the top priority is to crack down on
smuggling and corruption, that if we don't take measures the
economy and the state will collapse,'' said a senior researcher at
a government research organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you take measures that are too stringent, you run the
risk that the party will collapse,'' he said. ``And if it comes to
implicating senior leaders, the priority is to protect the party,
not the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the antismuggling campaign has reflected Zhu's
serious and uncompromising style.
</P>
<P>
   Whole teams of central government investigators descended on
suspected smuggling ports and set up shop in local hotels. The
boats from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau that had previously docked
freely at the many jetties and harbors that dot the coastline were
suddenly impounded. Midlevel customs officials were led away from
their desks, never to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party knows that it has to maintain political corruption
at a low level. Otherwise the people will lose confidence in the
government and the party will lose its legitimacy,'' said Zhang
Xiaojin, a political science professor at People's University.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1949, the Communist Party won widespread support through
its attacks on the corruption of China's pre-Communist ruling
party, the Kuomintang. But corruption _ which in coastal China
generally amounts to collusion with smugglers _ has grown steadily
during China's period of economic reforms, as the government has
progressively loosened controls on business.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the smuggling operations uncovered by the
recent investigations, as well as the role of local officials, has
shocked the central leaders, government researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-week period in February 1999, the police in a small
port city called Lufeng seized 761 crates of cigarettes and 100
tons of diesel oil, reported Guangdong Province's Communist Party
newspaper, the Southern Daily.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to overstate the degree to which smuggling had
integrated itself into the southern coast's economic life _ a
reliance that is now mostly visible in relief, since smuggling has
been curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Chiwei Road that goes between Puning and Lufeng
in Guangdong was one 30-mile outdoor market, dotted with shacks
selling ``imported'' Suzuki motor scooters, Mercedes cars, bolts of
fabric and Sony television sets.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they are mostly shuttered and those remaining are
impossibly forlorn, selling snacks, bottled water and a few
battered second-hand goods, another sign of the region's hard
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is terrible,'' said Li Yanchang, sipping tea in dirty
pajamas in a stall devoid of both customers and products. ``Now to
sell imported goods you have to pay all sorts of taxes and fees. A
few are still coming in on boats, but I don't dare display them
because of the crackdown.''

PRESIDENT HELPS COMMEMORATE LANDMARK CIVIL RIGHTS EVENT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. _ President Clinton joined thousands of others
Sunday in retracing the footsteps of 600 people who were beaten 35
years ago on the Edmund Pettus Bridge when lawmen attacked them as
they tried to march from Selma to Montgomery to press for the right
of blacks to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by Coretta Scott King, the widow of the civil rights
leader, and US Representative John Lewis of Georgia, Clinton led
the marchers across the silver-colored structure as the Alabama
State Police and the Alabama National Guard saluted them, in a sign
of the progress the nation has made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five years ago, a single day in Selma became a seminal
moment in the history of our country,'' Clinton told the more than
10,000 people gathered under a brilliant afternoon sun at the foot
of the bridge, a symbol of the struggle for racial justice because
of that ``Bloody Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On this bridge, America's long march to freedom met a
roadblock of violent resistance. But the marchers, thank God, would
not take a detour on the road to freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was a freshman at Georgetown University when state
troopers and sheriff's deputies on foot and horseback swooped down
on the marchers when they reached the base of the bridge, swinging
nightsticks and bullwhips and firing tear gas at them. The event
provoked widespread public outrage when photographs were shown on
television and in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Martin Luther King Jr. led 1,500 blacks and
whites from around the nation in another unsuccessful effort to
march to Montgomery. A third attempt to march from Selma to
Montgomery was successful two weeks later, under the protection of
the Alabama National Guard. Those events helped lead to passage of
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, signed by President Lyndon B.
Johnson five months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been said that the Voting Rights Act was signed in ink
in Washington, but it first was signed in blood in Selma,'' Clinton
said. Quoting from the speech Johnson made to the nation a week
after Bloody Sunday, Clinton said: ``At times, history and fate
meet in a single time and a single place to shape a turning point
in man's unending search for freedom. So it was at Lexington and
Concord. So it was a century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week
in Selma, Alabama. Their cause must be our cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who called himself ``a son of the South, the old,
segregated South,'' has attempted to make civil rights a defining
issue, especially in the second term of his presidency, making many
symbolic gestures to help heal old wounds of racial injustice.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, he apologized to five elderly black men who were
subjects of the government's infamous four-decade Tuskegee syphilis
experiment. Months later, he personally opened the doors of Central
High School in Little Rock, Ark., for the nine black students who
integrated it in 1957. Last year, he gave the Congressional Gold
Medal to those same nine people and to Rosa Parks, whose refusal to
give up her bus seat was a signature moment in the drive to open up
public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who with Hosea Williams led the Bloody Sunday march and
was beaten on the head and hospitalized, said Sunday, ``The
president of the United States could not come here in 1965. But he
has come here today.'' Speaking directly to Clinton, Lewis said,
``You didn't have to come here today, but you did,'' to which the
president replied, ``I had to be here in Selma today.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Clinton said he and Jimmy Carter, both
Southerners, would not have been elected president had Selma never
happened. ``Those of you who marched 35 years ago set me free, too,
on Bloody Sunday. Free to know you; to work with you; to love you;
to raise my child to celebrate our differences and hallow our
common humanity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that while the nation has made much progress in
achieving racial justice, economic imbalance remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there are people in places, including neighborhoods
in Selma, that have not participated in our economic prosperity, we
have a bridge to cross,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who accompanied Clinton
on his trip here, said, ``America is divided into before Selma and
after Selma. The cotton curtain came down and redefined American
democracy. . . . It changed who was electable. It connected Mason
and Dixon.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If America was born in Philadelphia, America was
reborn in Selma.''
</P>
<P>
   The commemoration dovetailed with the push by Democrats and the
White House to encourage greater black voter participation on the
eve of the crucial primaries on Tuesday. Coretta Scott King said it
was ``critical we mobilize the largest turnout of African-American
voters in history.'' She added, ``This is the best way for us to
pay tribute to the spirit of Selma.''
</P>
<P>
   The somber and emotional commemoration of the 35th anniversary
of Bloody Sunday drew an array of civil rights leaders, including
Martin Luther King III, Dick Gregory, Julian Bond, Joseph Lowery,
and Andrew Young. Others in attendance included Ethel Kennedy,
widow of Robert F. Kennedy, who was US attorney general in 1965,
and Harris Wofford, a former senator from Pennsylvania who heads
the Americorps program and who marched in Selma.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton paid tribute to them and to those who lost their lives
in the struggle for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``As long as Americans are willing to hold hands, we
can walk with any wind; we can cross any bridge. Deep in my heart I
do believe we shall overcome.''

 SHANTOU, China: the crackdown.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Li said he used to make several major sales a day for the
equivalent of about $250, but now goes weeks without a sale. He
added that today there is less economic incentive for smugglers to
resist the ban, since Chinese consumers have become increasingly
willing to buy domestic products, whose quality has improved as
their prices have gone down. Domestic videodisk players cost less
than $100.
</P>
<P>
   Economic hardship has also trickled down to those who have
always made an honest living, affecting them in countless ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, people had lots more money to buy, now there's no
money around,'' said Shen Yuexun, sitting in his small deserted
store selling household wares and plastic goods in Lufeng, long
known as a smuggling haven. ``Migrant workers no longer come here
for jobs. People have left to look for work. Some of the really
rich have moved to Macau.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the small chairs and wash basins that are
the backbone of Shen's business are made at a local factory, which
has long used cheap smuggled plastic. After the smuggling
crackdown, the price of plastic increased sharply, he said, and he
has raised his prices about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They should be higher still, but ``if I push prices up I'll have
no business at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He has started to sew suits at home to bring in money and is
looking for other work, but has little hope for a local revival,
noting that the area has been so closely tied to smuggling that it
will be hard to attract legitimate investment, even with recent
changes in local political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In Lufeng, 11 of 20 township party secretaries were removed from
their jobs in 1999, according to the Southern Daily. The Guangdong
Party Committee on Discipline Inspection announced last month that
in 1999 it had penalized 4,505 officials for corruption last year
in 4,199 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really going after midlevel people,'' said an
official. ``People are being yanked away from their desk, and never
seen again.''
</P>
<P>
   On a larger scale, economists say the effect of the
antismuggling campaign can be gauged by the wild fluctuations in
prices and revenues associated with formerly smuggled goods over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the price of diesel oil rose by more than 20
percent in the second half of 1999, to about $350 a ton. According
to government statistics, imports shot up more than 20 percent, at
a time when economic growth was slowing, and imports were deemed
likely to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to believe that the vast majority of this reflects a
switch of goods from the black market to the white market,'' said a
western diplomat in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a number have decided to go legit,'' he said. ``They
had goods waiting to come in, and when they saw the crackdown was
not going to go away in three months like previous efforts, they
decided they couldn't wait any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for the first time in recent history, China's central
government revenues rose as a percentage of gross national product.
China had been the only country in the world where this percentage
was falling.
</P>
<P>
   Although some experts believe that money that once went into
officials' pockets may now be channeled into, say, hospitals or
schools, many Chinese _ and scholars in and out of China _ remain
somewhat skeptical that the government will be able to sustain the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When the wife of Beijing Party Secretary Jia Qingling was about
to be implicated in the Xiamen scandal in January, government Web
sites took the extraordinary step of issuing denials on her behalf,
even though the scandal has not been reported in the Chinese press;
most Chinese learned about it from Hong Kong-based Internet sites.
Many well-placed Chinese believe that Jia's wife, who used to run a
huge import-export company in Fujian, was spared because of her
husband's close ties to President Jiang Zemin. They remain
convinced that she was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, residents of coastal Guangdong laughed when they
recently heard that the deputy party chief of impoverished Jiangxi
Province had been sentenced to death for taking $600,000 in bribes.
``That would be just a little dessert for leaders here,'' a local
businessman said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it may be difficult to pursue each and every case in a
country where questionable business practices are so widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like me think that corruption is now very serious, even
worse than under the Nationalists,'' a researcher at a government
research center said, referring to China's pre-Communist
government. ``But it's going to be hard to pursue because nine out
of 10 top leaders have some close relative whose business dealings
might look OK on the surface but would prove illegal if someone
looked at them closely.''

FUND-RAISERS ARE SUMMONED IN TORRICELLI CAMPAIGN INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Refocusing a wide-ranging inquiry into the
finances of Sen. Robert Torricelli's 1996 election campaign,
federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas ordering some of New
Jersey's most prominent Democratic fund-raisers to testify before a
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents appeared in the offices of influential lawyers
and business executives across the state on Thursday with court
orders demanding that they turn over all correspondence with
Torricelli, his campaign and two related political committees, as
well as any checks, tallies, invoices or other records pertaining
to Torricelli's 1996 fund-raising operation.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Justice Department's campaign finance
task force is specifically seeking records of any instructions to
fund-raisers about how to solicit donations and any information
from the Torricelli campaign concerning federal rules limiting
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli's lawyer, Abbe D. Lowell, said in a statement Sunday
that he had contacted prosecutors in the federal task force and was
told ``that they are conducting interviews and requesting documents
from fewer than 15 prominent donors and fund-raisers in New
Jersey.'' He described the interviews as part of an effort by the
task force ``to conclude its work.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that no member of the senator's staff or campaign
had been contacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been assured again that Senator Torricelli is not the
focus of this inquiry,'' Lowell added.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have presented no evidence that Torricelli knew of
any fund-raising improprieties. And the senator's aides say it is
unreasonable to hold him responsible for the actions of a few
people among the 20,000 who contributed to his 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, word that the federal investigation had entered a
new phase sent tremors through New Jersey's Democratic
establishment. It comes at a critical time for the party, as
influential members are busy raising money for Vice President Al
Gore's presidential campaign and as Torricelli, who is the chairman
of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, is overseeing
fund-raising efforts on behalf of Democratic Senate candidates
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the subpoenas' focus on Torricelli 's 1996
fund-raising operation goes to the roots of Torricelli's influence
in state and national politics. He rose to his powerful job as head
of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee largely because of
the fund-raising prowess he showed in 1996, when he raised $9.2
million and soundly defeated Rep. Richard Zimmer, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Under Torricelli's leadership, Democrats have narrowed a
longstanding gap in fund-raising and now take in nearly as much as
Republicans in so-called soft money donations.
</P>
<P>
   Those who received subpoenas were ordered to appear before a
federal grand jury in Newark within the next month. One person who
was given a subpoena provided a copy to The New York Times, and
another person who received one corroborated the document's
authenticity. Both spoke on the condition that they not be
identified, noting that the subpoena includes a boldfaced,
underlined request by the U.S. attorney that the recipient not
disclose its existence to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raisers contacted by the FBI last week were told they
were not considered targets of the investigation, but merely
witnesses. Nonetheless, the experience was nerve-rattling, said one
worried fund-raiser whose office was visited by agents. ``All I did
was write checks and raise money,'' the person said.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli's 1996 campaign has become enmeshed in three separate
criminal investigations. Last week's subpoenas appear to be an
outgrowth of an inquiry by the campaign finance task force into
donations involving David Chang, a Fort Lee businessman and
longtime supporter of Torricelli. Michael Savage, an assistant U.S.
attorney who is prosecuting Chang, also signed the latest
subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, whose generosity to the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 was
rewarded with flights on Air Force One and an invitation to a White
House dinner honoring the Chinese premier, is suspected of making
$11,000 in illegal donations to Torricelli's campaign through his
lawyer, Berek Paul Don, the former chairman of the Bergen County
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Don pleaded guilty last May, saying he had made the illegal
contributions on Chang's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have charged Chang with obstruction of justice and
shredding business records subpoenaed by investigators. He and his
bookkeeper, Audrey Yu, who faces similar charges, are scheduled to
go on trial next month.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's lawyer, Michael Critchley, another prominent contributor
to Torricelli's 1996 campaign, did not respond to telephone
messages.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Chang cooperated with prosecutors investigating Rep.
Jay C. Kim, D-Calif., by admitting that he had made $12,000 in
illegal donations. The congressman eventually pleaded guilty to
campaign violations and was voted out of office.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Torricelli's 1996 campaign fund was linked to two other criminal
investigations involving major donors to the Clinton-Gore
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Penna, a New Jersey stockbroker who was a major Clinton
fund-raiser and flew with the president on Air Force One in 1997,
pleaded guilty to making $12,000 in illegal contributions to the
Clinton re-election fund in 1996 and $20,000 in illegal donations
to Torricelli's 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Penna also pleaded guilty in federal court to manipulating the
price of the pharmaceutical stock Compare Generiks, which defrauded
investors of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although Torricelli's blind trust made a one-day profit of
$50,000 in the stock in 1996, the authorities have not charged that
there was any connection between the investment and the illegal
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, federal prosecutors have also forced employees of
the computer company Future Tech to pay more than $1.2 million in
fines for making illegal contributions to the 1996 campaigns of
President Clinton and several other prominent Democrats, including
Torricelli.

(ATTN: ENGLAND)  
 ERNEST LOUGH, CHOIRBOY WHOSE VOICE ENDURED ON FAMOUS RECORDING,
DIES AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ernest Lough, whose pure, silvery treble voice when he was 15 is
preserved on one of history's most memorable classical recordings,
died on Feb. 22 at his home in Watford, England. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   His achievement came on March 27, 1927, when he recorded ``O,
for the Wings of a Dove,'' from Mendelssohn's ``Hear My Prayer''
with the Temple Church Choir, the choir of the Church of the Inner
Temple, in London. It was one of the first electric recordings
(older records were made by the acoustic process), and one of the
first made in a church, not a studio.
</P>
<P>
   The record sold 650,000 copies in the first six months,
according to EMI Records, and eventually sold more than 5 million.
Recorded by Gramophone Co., which became HMV, it has the rare
distinction of never being out of the catalog of available
recordings. Most of the proceeds went to the church where the
recording was made; Lough earned (PS)200.
</P>
<P>
   Compton Mackenzie, reviewing the recording in the magazine
Gramophone, wrote, ``Master Lough, after his first performance,
goes straight into the classic shelves and the company of singers
like Caruso.''
</P>
<P>
   The opera singer Dame Nellie Melba complained, ``That wretched
boy has achieved overnight what has taken me years.''
</P>
<P>
   Many remarked upon the youngster's unusually rich, even tone,
his control, his complete security of intonation and the truth of
his emotional feeling. The admiration grew as the remarkable
rendition exemplified the new miracle of records: that an instant
of sound might capture listeners' souls forever.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the young Lough's voice changed and he went beyond music
to adulthood and a career in advertising, bundles of comics and
sweets would be sent to him, usually by elderly ladies. There
seemed a need to view him as an eternal Peter Pan, and, 40 years
later, he was sometimes accused of lying when he introduced
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Others clung to a bizarre legend that he died while singing the
words ``and remain there forever at rest'' while making the
celebrated recording. Two elderly ladies at the Temple Church
happened to meet him a short while after he made the recording and
asked where they could contribute to his memorial fund. ``He died,
didn't you know?'' asked one.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he didn't,'' the boy replied. ``I'm Ernest Lough.''
</P>
<P>
   They, too, refused to believe him.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably known as Fluff, with which his last name rhymed,
Lough was born in London on Nov. 17, 1911. He sang in his local
parish church, but failed his audition for Southwark Cathedral. But
Dr. George Thalben-Ball, organist and choir director at Temple
Church, accepted him in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my voice had any special quality,'' Lough said
later, contradicting music lovers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the recording, Ernest was head boy, or lead
singer, of the choir. He made the recording because of three treble
soloists, ``it was judged that my voice was in the best condition
on the day of the recording,'' he said 60 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did four or five takes,'' he continued. ``One was discarded
because a child was whistling outside; another because the Temple
clock chimed. I wasn't aware I was making history. I was so small I
had to stand on a couple of Bibles so the single microphone could
pick up my voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nerve-racked. The trouble with wax is that, unlike a
modern recording, you cannot play it back and change bits.''
</P>
<P>
   The youth's first reaction was that it sounded ``rather nice,''
but he hoped that he would do better the next time. In fact, he had
to make another version six months after the record was issued
because the master copy wore out. Later there was a third
recording. Lough always liked the first one best.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two years that Lough sang in the choir, lines were
so long for Sunday services that tickets had to be issued. Some in
the congregation stood on their seats to catch a glimpse of the
angelic soloist.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Thalben-Ball and the rest of the Temple Choir, the
young Lough made more than a dozen recordings during the next two
years. His favorite was Mendelssohn's ``Elijah,'' which he made
early in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   This performance was done in extraordinary circumstances. After
the choir had finished recording another piece, engineers found
they had two unused 10-inch waxes left to record on. As the choir
had to go, Thalben-Ball turned to Ernest and asked if he knew
``Hear Ye Israel.'' He did not, but was able to learn it in a
half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   At 20, Lough took a job making tea and doing packaging in the
advertising department of HMV, which had made all his recordings.
In the marketing department there he met Ethel Charlton, whom he
married in 1938. She survives him.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II Lough served in the Fire Service, fighting
fires sparked by bombings. One night he was called out to his
beloved Temple Church, where, because of a water shortage, he had
to watch it burn to a charred skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he worked in advertising for Mather &AMP; Crowther,
which later became Ogilvy &AMP; Mather. His accounts included the
London Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   His three sons all became choristers and all survive him. He
sang with his oldest son, Peter, at the 1953 coronation of Queen
Elizabeth II. His other sons, Robin and Graham, sang at Temple
Church under the direction of Thalben-Ball. The younger sons sang
with their father at the rededication of Temple Church by the
archbishop of Canterbury in the presence of the queen in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Lough made several recordings as a baritone, but they neither
pleased him nor captured the imagination of others. But he always
insisted that he was glad when his voice changed, or ``just slid
down,'' in his own phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God,'' he remembered thinking. ``The pressure is off.''

IT'S MARATHON SPECTATORS WHO ARE NUTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From the dry patch of Hollywood Boulevard sidewalk
beneath the Pantages Theater marquee, the leader of Cosmic Jukebox
interrupted the band's steady, left-right-left rhythm to offer a
cheer for marathon stragglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it up for all those dummies out there running in the
rain!'' the singer screeched. The sparse gallery responded with
shouts and whistles and a few chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   But the young man at the microphone had it wrong. The people who
ran in this Los Angeles Marathon weren't dummies or fruitcakes.
</P>
<P>
   The lunatics were the people who stood on the curb in a downpour
on a sub-50-degrees day to watch the others run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The runners probably have the better part of the deal,''
admitted Roger Johnson, who'd flown out from North Carolina to see
his son Tim compete. ``At least they're moving and staying warm.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was leaning forward in his seat on the Metro Red Line
subway, his coiled umbrella dripping at his feet. He was on his way
back to Downtown Los Angeles after a morning at the fabled
intersection of Hollywood and Vine streets, watching the runners
begin the testing 20th mile of the 26-mile, 385-yard footrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `This is the Hollywood and Vine I'd heard so much
about?' '' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In a gilded age, Hollywood and Vine was the center of the
entertainment world, surrounded by Paramount, Fox, Warner Bros. and
Columbia movie studios, Capitol Records, ABC and CBS radio and the
Brown Derby restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Pantages and the Henry Fonda (formerly Music Box)
theaters stand for nostalgia on a three-block stretch that's home
to the Frolic Room bar, Le Sex Shoppe, the L. Ron Hubbard Life
Exhibition and Hollywood Tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   You expect to witness some odd behavior at Hollywood and Vine,
long a reliable monologue punchline. And you found it Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Majorie Kirk of Los Angeles stood a half-block east of Vine
along the Hollywood Walk of Fame - a couple of strides from the
stars of Pat Boone, Charles Coburn and Peggy Castle - her umbrella
insufficient to keep the slanting rain from matting her dark hair.
Most of the spectators had friends or relatives in the race. Not
her.
</P>
<P>
   She'd torn a course map out of the newspaper and ventured out
just to witness the spectacle, such as it was on a day like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get into physical fitness,'' Kirk said, ``and
this is inspiring me.''
</P>
<P>
   She stopped to belt out a ``You can do it!'' to one of the
23,000 runners she didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I yelled at the leader, he looked over at me,'' Kirk
said, 20 minutes after the elite men went by. ``I hope I didn't
distract him.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather didn't discourage her from coming out?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this kind of weather,'' Kirk said. ``It fills your
lungs up with such wonderful air.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowds could hardly be called crowds when men's winner
Benson Mutisya Mbithi of Kenya and other elites passed Hollywood
and Vine shortly after 10 a.m. A handful of diehards shivered at
the curb on each block. Shopkeepers peeked out from their doorways,
safe from the rain and chilly wind. A Russian man - older than rock
'n' roll - danced alone to the music, waiting to root on women's
winner Jane Salumae of Estonia.
</P>
<P>
   As the competitive marathoners moved on and the boulevard filled
up with recreational runners, the groups of friends and family
bearing placards (``Go Craig!'') swelled. By late morning, the
storm raged on and Cosmic Jukebox had packed up its instruments,
but the curb was filling up.
</P>
<P>
   A parking-lot attendant who'd been there a year ago on a sunny
marathon day said the throng actually appeared larger this time.
Presumably the advent of the subway had something to do with that.
You could go from Seventh and Figueroa streets - near the start and
finish downtown - to Hollywood and Vine in 20 minutes for $2.70
round-trip including a transfer.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder people took the train Sunday. It's a wonder they
came up from the comfort of underground.
</P>
<P>
   Hilda Kowalski of Marina del Rey took it to Wilshire Boulevard
and Western Avenue to cheer on her husband Jim in his ninth Los
Angeles Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a rocket scientist,'' Hilda said.
</P>
<P>
   Seems to me a rocket scientist should know better than to run
around in a rain-soaked T-shirt and shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's the ones who stood still who really made you wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us are nuts,'' said Pat McLaren, a UCLA
Associated Students employee who lives nearby in Hollywood. ``I
think the people who have the guts and energy to (race) deserve our
support.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren watched from near Louella Parsons' star, clutching an
umbrella, the rain soaking her hiking boots anyway. She said she
didn't know any of the runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a friend running a few years ago. I made a sign
supporting him,'' McLaren said. ``He said, `You know, I was about
to hit the wall, but seeing somebody with a sign for me made me go
on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, it's the runners who should have been carrying signs,
encouraging the foolhardy souls at the side of the marathon course
(``Stay Dry, Pat!'').
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to be out on a day like this, you might as well
run.

US PRESSES ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS AS MIDEAST PEACE HOPES FADE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sensing that a historic opportunity for Middle East
peace is slipping away, President Clinton has stepped up his
involvement in the stalled Israel-Syria negotiations, calling
leaders of both nations recently in hopes of a breakthrough in the
next few weeks, US officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many within the Clinton administration who say
they believe the odds for success are low. If there is no
Israel-Syria deal, the officials say, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak could unilaterally pull his troops from South Lebanon and
then turn inward and focus on domestic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Even those hopeful for a deal say it must happen soon, or the
next chance could be years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The few months ahead will be the most fateful months in the
Middle East for a long time,'' said a senior US official, speaking
on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright making
separate phone calls to Barak and Syrian President Hafez Assad, all
three sides are keenly cognizant that there is not much time left
to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has less than 10 months in office. Assad's health is
poor. And the Israeli Cabinet Sunday pushed up the deadline even
more with its vote backing Barak's promise to withdraw from Lebanon
by July. That means, according to military analysts, Barak must
give the order by the end of April in order to start the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak has created pressure on everyone with his deadlines,''
the US official said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no deal by April, Barak will be forced into a
choice: withdraw troops unilaterally or go back on his word and
risk a loss in credibility. Syria, which exercises much control
over Lebanese affairs, strongly opposes a unilateral withdrawal,
because it would deprive Damascus of its key bargaining chip with
Israel, and wants to coordinate the Israeli pullback with a peace
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game of chicken _ like a James Dean movie. Who's going
to blink first?'' said an Israeli official in Washington on the
fast-approaching deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Or will anyone blink? The US official said the ``main work'' in
preparing to renew the talks is ``happening now. We're trying to
find out from both sides what their views are, what's important to
them, and in a few weeks we will have that conversation with both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   But the positions of both sides are not great mysteries, not
after the weeklong talks that took place in January in
Shepherdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   While numerous technical issues need to be worked out on
security arrangements, the biggest stumbling block remains drawing
the future border between Israel and Syria. Or, to put it in
real-life terms for an average Israeli or Syrian, who will be able
to dip their toes into the waters of the Sea of Galilee's
northeastern shore?
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said Israelis will. Assad has said there is no deal
without Syrians on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   One or both sides must give, and the United States must find a
creative solution that does not seem like a retreat for either.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, there have been several reports out of the
Middle East that a summit looked likely. One report quoted Arab
diplomats saying that talks would restart in late March. And on
Friday, Israel's Channel One Television reported that Israel and
Syria were weeks away from a deal, under which the border would be
just east of the Sea of Galilee, giving the Israelis beach rights.
</P>
<P>
   But US and Israeli officials denied the specific reports.
</P>
<P>
   In the last seven years, since the day the historic Oslo peace
agreement was unveiled, Middle East political maneuvering has been
full of such leaks and full of forecasters whose view of the future
was inaccurate. When analysts in Washington and in Israel look
backward, even since the talks in Shepherdstown broke up seven
weeks ago, they see trends that add up to a difficult future for
the Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rough rocky road ahead,'' said Mark Heller, principal
research associate at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at
Tel Aviv University. ``I don't know what is in Barak's head. I
don't think anyone knows what's in his head.'' Then again, Heller
said, ``Barak could pull a rabbit out of a hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller, though, mostly sees a field of landmines for Barak:
deadlock with Syria, angry Palestinian leaders feeling pushed
aside, the possibility that a unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon
would lead to more violence, polls showing a majority of Israelis
opposed to the Syria deal, and three of the six parties in his
government supporting a bill last week requiring an absolute
majority of all eligible voters to approve a referendum on a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Atmospherics also have turned poisonous. Less than three weeks
after Shepherdstown, a Syrian government newspaper said Israel's
crimes against Arabs were as heinous as the Nazi Holocaust that
killed an estimated 6 million Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Then Barak's foreign minister, David Levy, threatened to make
Lebanon pay for Hezbollah attacks ``blood for blood, soul for soul,
child for child.'' Lebanese TV stations later aired an ad showing
Levy's speech and then cut to black-and-white footage from Adolf
Hitler's Nazi rallies. At the bottom of the screen were the words,
``Same speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, said a second US official, ``Barak could get a deal
done. But the emerging risk is that the Israeli public would reject
it. The opposition is all mobilized now. If he was going to make
concessions, why didn't he do it in December or January?''
</P>
<P>
   The day-to-day situation is also extraordinarily tenuous. A
major battlefield loss in South Lebanon could doom the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are more Israeli dead in Lebanon, you could probably
say it's the end of a Syrian deal for now,'' said the first US
official.
</P>
<P>
   Without a Syrian deal, Barak would likely turn to step up
discussions with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli and US
officials say. There is some talk about a meeting in Washington in
April with Arafat, but that assumes the Palestinians would agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real gulf of mistrust between the Israelis and
Palestinians now,'' said the first US official. ``The priority with
Syria is hurting and casting a shadow over the Israeli-Palestinian
talks. There's never been a frank discussion on an official level
on what a final settlement might look like.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides missed a February deadline to finish the interim
agreements on handing over West Bank land to the Palestinians and
establishing a framework for the final status talks. The deadline
for the most difficult issues _ Jerusalem, water, refugees, a
Palestinian state _ is Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about to confront a moment of truth on either peace
track,'' the first US official said. ``It may not go well, but it
may. There are too many variables now. No matter what, you're
talking about a real balancing act, a real test of skills for
Barak.''

CLASH OVER CHOICE OF U.S. COPTERS FOR COLOMBIA'S DRUG WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For most of the last three years, Clinton
administration officials battled tirelessly with Republicans in
Congress over what might be the right helicopters for Colombia's
fight against illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   When the Republicans sought six top-of-the-line helicopters for
the Colombian police, administration officials insisted that a
rebuilt version of the old Vietnam-era workhorse, the UH-1H Huey,
would do fine. They said that buying the more expensive aircraft,
which cost roughly five times as much, would throw the State
Department's drug-enforcement budget out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late December, White House officials confirmed a change
of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Going beyond their aides' most ambitious recommendation,
officials said, senior officials proposed immediately buying 30 of
the helicopters they had once rejected, the Sikorsky UH-60L
Blackhawk, at a cost of almost $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was Christmas not only for the much-criticized Colombian
military, which is to receive the aircraft, but also for United
Technologies Corp., the Connecticut-based conglomerate that makes
the Blackhawk and has been struggling with declining orders from
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the plan is drawing attention to the lobbying
efforts of United Technologies, a major military contractor and
political contributor, the political payoff for Democratic
legislators from the state, and the policy choices implied in the
$1.28 billion aid package that the White House has put forward for
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also illuminates the political dynamics of what
would be Washington's first large-scale involvement in a civil
conflict in Latin America since the Cold War, an initiative that
has brought unlikely alliances on every side.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a great relief package _ for the state of
Connecticut,'' said Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., a supporter of
rival helicopter companies. Ballenger is one of several Republicans
who have joined with some political liberals to urge the
administration to consider substituting some Blackhawks with the
cheaper Hueys it once championed.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the United States bought Colombia a handful of the
Blackhawks and dozens of the rebuilt Hueys, Ballenger said wryly,
``you'd still have $100 million or $200 million left over to buy
Democrats or Republicans or whatever you still needed'' to win
approval of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledged they had been the target
of a long lobbying campaign for Blackhawk sales to Colombia by
United Technologies and its supporters. A competing push was made
by Bell Helicopter Textron, the Texas subsidiary of Textron that
produces the so-called Huey II that has been considered as an
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials denied that politics influenced their
decision, saying they followed the advice of military and
intelligence experts. ``It is ferociously expensive,'' Gen. Barry
R. McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director, said of the
Blackhawk. But he added, ``It's a hugely capable piece of
machinery.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30 Blackhawks, along with a temporary fleet of 33 surplus
UH-1N helicopters, are intended to fly new, American-trained
battalions of the Colombian army into the coca-growing regions of
southern Colombia dominated by leftist guerrillas. There, the
soldiers are to beat back the traffickers and the rebels who
protect their operations.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that a lack of mobility has been one of the
Colombian military's biggest problems. It is also widely agreed
that the Blackhawk is a much better aircraft than the Huey II: It
can fly farther and faster, carry more troops and better withstand
groundfire. But the Blackhawks also pose some significant problems.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say it could take until late next year for all the
aircraft to be made; it may take almost that long for Colombian
pilots to be trained or retrained to fly them.
</P>
<P>
   The high cost of the Blackhawks _ $12.8 million each, according
to administration figures, as opposed to $1.8 million for Huey IIs
_ has also been brought into relief by the risk that the
insurgents, flush with drug money, could acquire surface-to-air
missiles to shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you can absolutely count on is that with the Blackhawks
or the beefed-up Hueys, the bad guys are going to acquire
surface-to-air missiles; helicopters will be shot down,'' said Gen.
Fred F. Woerner, retired, who commanded U.S. forces in Latin
America in the late 1980s. ``The question is, will we replace
them?''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, aircraft lobbyists and congressional
officials say the decision to buy the 30 Blackhawks was the
culmination of lobbying efforts and political struggles dating from
1996.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, sending Blackhawks to the well-respected Colombian
National Police had become almost an obsession for several powerful
Republican legislators. For the contractors, Colombia was prized
territory, a critical foothold in a rich and growing Latin American
market, analysts and industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although their helicopter campaigns cannot be broken out from
other concerns, both companies have given generously to
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 and 1998 election cycles, Textron and its employees
gave $551,816 to Republicans and $364,420 to Democrats, according
to statistics compiled by the Campaign Study Group, a nonpartisan
research company.
</P>
<P>
   United Technologies and its employees also focused on the
Republicans controlling Congress, donating $362,340 over the same
period. But the company was comparatively more generous to
Democrats, donating $347,200 over that period and giving them
almost twice what Textron gave in so-called ``soft money''
contributions in the current cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The two contractors also used less traditional means to make
their case.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, for instance, just before Republicans
forced through six Blackhawks for the Colombian police by adding
more than $100 million to the State Department budget, Textron
underwrote a discussion series called ``Is Colombia Going Down?''
at which the Washington office of the Council on Foreign Relations
brought business and government leaders together to focus on the
urgency of Colombia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies also appealed directly to Colombian officials,
people familiar with their efforts said, and encouraged the
Colombians to make their case to congressional leaders and
administration officials. The Colombian military, which has itself
already bought 25 Blackhawks and is now purchasing 14 more, was a
strong advocate for the best aircraft they could persuade the
United States to get them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that aides who drafted the Colombia
proposal last fall suggested three options: one with no Blackhawks,
and others with 45 or 60 Blackhawks in the latter years of the
plan, preferably after some progress by the Colombian army made the
huge expenditure more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   But just before Christmas, White House officials decided to
scale back the aid package to a year and a half of spending, seek
30 Blackhawks immediately, and cut financing for some development
programs by about half, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, the plan came under attack by some of the same
Republican legislators who once championed Blackhawks for the
Colombian police.
</P>
<P>
   Several would like to give some of the 30 Blackhawks to the
police _ a move favored by human rights groups that oppose helping
an army with a long history of abuses. Other Republicans, including
members of Congress loyal to Textron and U.S. Helicopter, which
also helps build the Huey II, argue for buying more of the less
expensive aircraft and directing the savings to other Colombian
needs, including strengthening the judiciary and weaning farmers
away from drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if peace breaks out?'' said Rep. Bill Delahunt, D-Mass.
``These helicopters won't even start coming out for 18 months after
the appropriation.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats have been more conspicuous recently for
their silence on the issue of military aid for Colombia. And while
many have been reluctant to oppose the aid for fear of appearing
``soft'' on the drug issue, few have been as reticent as the senior
legislators from Connecticut, Sen. Christopher Dodd and Rep. Sam
Gejdenson.
</P>
<P>
   Both have long been vigilant critics of military solutions to
civil conflicts in Latin America, and strong advocates of human
rights. But both have also been champions of United Technologies
and recipients of steady, substantial campaign contributions from
the company. Not surprising, their limited public role in the
Colombia debate _ until Dodd came out recently as one of the first
members of either party to endorse the administration's plan _ has
been felt sharply by advocacy groups that had counted them as
allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, we wish that Mr. Gejdenson and Mr. Dodd would
have been more helpful on this issue, especially given their
experience on Central America in the 1980s,'' said Carlos M.
Salinas, Amnesty International's Latin American affairs lobbyist in
Washington, who has criticized the package.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, both legislators strongly denied that prospective
Blackhawk sales had shaped their positions. Dodd acknowledged that
he had returned from Colombia just days before the aid plan was
made final in December and had told senior administration officials
he would support it. But he said he did so reluctantly, pushing for
more economic development aid, and he insisted that he never
pressed the officials to buy Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would support a Connecticut company; I wouldn't see that as
inconsistent in this case,'' Dodd said. ``I just didn't do it.''

RAINES TAKES A BIG STEP IN COMEBACK WITH YANKS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Words can be superfluous after 20 years of
marriage, and when Tim Raines stepped out of the Yankees' dugout
and into the on-deck circle in the second inning Sunday, he turned
to the stands and aimed a glance at Virginia Raines, his wife.
</P>
<P>
   That was all it took, he figured. No words. Just a glance, and
she would know how much this moment meant to him, to be competing
again, to be playing baseball, even with the incurable disease in
his system. In his first full-fledged game since doctors told him
he had lupus last summer, Raines ripped a single in his second
at-bat, and later added a double, in the Yankees' 6-2 loss to the
Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have lost all four of their exhibition games. They
have not held a lead this spring, they have been outscored by 34-15
and several players acknowledged that while victories and losses
don't really matter this time of year, it would probably be a good
idea to mix in a victory soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do the right things to win,'' said Jorge Posada,
the Yankees' catcher. ``Right now, we're not swinging the bats the
way we can. We know that. It's going to come, but nobody wants to
go out there and lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Raines lingered in front of his locker, in a pair of
shorts and a New World Order T-shirt, cheery as always, answering
questions about his milestone day. The question he heard most often
in the off-season _ ``What are you doing now?'' _ was well
intentioned, he knew, but based on the presumption that, at 40, his
baseball career was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come back to prove I can get to spring training,''
Raines said. ``I wanted to come back to play in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed like a long shot as recently as two weeks ago. The
Yankees signed Raines just before the start of spring training
mostly as a favor for his contributions to the team's championships
in 1996 and 1998, and because he was such a positive influence in
the clubhouse. The Yankees had no available spot for Raines, so the
plan was to give him as many at-bats as possible to showcase his
talents to scouts with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   But Darryl Strawberry was suspended for a year for using
cocaine, and now the Yankees are looking for a left-handed
designated hitter. Raines is here and he has looked good, probably
better than anyone expected, little more than seven months after
the diagnosis of his lupus, a disease that affects the autoimmune
system and has no nown cure.
</P>
<P>
   After the diagnosis, Raines, who was playing with the Oakland
Athletics at the time, immediately began treatments that left him
feeling horrible. He lost 40 pounds and required medication
administered in four-hour sessions. Raines would go to the
hospital, have an intravenous tube placed in his arm and watch ESPN
and reruns of ``Matlock'' on television.
</P>
<P>
   He told members of the Yankees that he would come back, and said
the same thing to George Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner.
At the same time, Raines asked a doctor if he could play baseball
again, and there was no answer. No one had ever heard of someone
playing baseball with lupus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speculation when I first got sick was that I won't play
again,'' Raines said in an interview last week. Virginia Raines
``kind of fell into that, too _ `I don't think you're going to be
able to play again.' I told her, when I was first diagnosed, `I'll
be back, I'll be back.' But it depended on how my treatments went.
We were dealing with something we never really heard of before.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines was not allowed to work out until after Christmas. ``Not
even walking _ nothing,'' he said. One of the most productive base
stealers in baseball history, Raines worked out for three weeks in
January before he was able to push himself through a sprint.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time he had ever trained side by side with his
son, Tim Raines Jr., who will play his third season in the
Baltimore Orioles' organization this year. The dream of father and
son is to play at the same time in the major leagues. ``He teased
me about trying to stay around, because he's coming,'' the elder
Raines said. ``That kind of drives us both.''
</P>
<P>
   He played in an intrasquad game last week, but was hit on the
little toe and missed five days. Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager,
told him he would play in Monday's exhibition against Cleveland,
and Raines told his wife. But Sunday morning, as Raines was getting
treatment in the trainer's room, Torre asked if he was ready to
play, and Raines said yes.
</P>
<P>
   He was nervous _ more than he expected, more than he had felt at
any time since the 1996 World Series _ as he stepped in to face
Houston's Jose Lima. ``He could've thrown me a resin bag, and I
would've swung at it,'' Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   He hit into a fielder's choice then, but singled in his second
at-bat and, after fouling off four two-strike pitches, smashed his
double. He did not save any piece of memorabilia from the game, but
he does plan to keep a ball or a bat, or both, if he makes the
Yankees and plays in a regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a little more emotional,'' Raines said, ``if I go
to New York.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sam King was barely 12 when AIDS struck his mother,
and he had to become her caretaker. He had already spent a
childhood moving from one apartment to another in a small Alabama
town, but when his mother died the summer before he was to start
high school, Sam had to make yet another move _ to Jamaica, Queens,
to live with an aunt whose only income was a monthly government
check of $500. He had not yet turned 14.
</P>
<P>
   Sam, now 17 and a senior at Richmond Hill High School in Queens,
summed up his trajectory with this bit of understatement: ``Life is
full of obstacles and challenges,'' he wrote in his application for
The New York Times College Scholarship Program last fall.
``Everyone has to deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sam, that has meant a life of academic excellence: scoring
in the 90th percentile on his New York State Regents exams, and a
perfect 5 on an Advanced Placement test in American history. It
also meant being chosen last week as one of six winners of this
year's New York Times College Scholarship Program awards. Each
prize provides $12,000 a year for the next four years to a
college-bound high school senior in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   All six scholarship winners, chosen from among 1,700 applicants,
have a record of sterling achievement in the face of punishing
odds. Perhaps most remarkably, they distinguished themselves in
interviews last week with a modest, sometimes wry,
matter-of-factness about their own lives, keenly aware of their
difficult circumstances but free of self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sweat the big things,'' is how Sam, in his whisper of
a voice, put it.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its second year, the scholarship program has been created
to ``make a critical and perhaps defining difference each year in
the lives of a handful of New York City high school students,''
said William E. Schmidt, an associate managing editor of The Times.
They were chosen on the basis of financial need and academic
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the scholars has had a mountain to climb. Some have had
to navigate a strange country and find their voice in a new
language. Some have been buoyed by nurturing parents, while others
have had to raise themselves. Some have had to become, even as
children, caretakers for their elders.
</P>
<P>
   Vikiana Reyes, 17, the eldest of a factory worker's three
children, considers herself fortunate to be alive. Not long ago, a
boy was killed in front of her apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn;
another time, on her way to school, she stumbled upon a man shot
dead on the sidewalk. ``I'm pretty lucky,'' she insists. ``I
haven't died. I'm not doing drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mei Ying Lai, 17, recalls the silent, lonely world in which she
lived when she first arrived in this country from China, 8 years
old and knowing not a word of English. She has since turned that
fear of language on its head, not only scoring in the 90s in her
English classes at Stuyvesant High School, but also taking on
French and Japanese as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cathleen Miles, 18, from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, cares for the
elderly woman who raised her, a former housekeeper and home health
aide who has suffered two heart attacks and now relies on Cathleen
to administer her medicine, prepare meals and keep house.
</P>
<P>
   Marcin Skomial, a farmer's son from a small Polish village,
landed in Ridgewood, Queens, two years ago, learned English and
leapfrogged his way into three Advanced Placement classes at Grover
Cleveland High School. Today, he spends his evenings as a part-time
doorman at an Upper West Side hotel and his days plotting his
unabashedly grand ambitions: Marcin, 18, wants to help Poland
become a member of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   And Kristina Chan, a scholarship student at the exclusive Loyola
School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, used her 16th birthday
party as an occasion to raise money for the homeless. Kristina,
whose single mother works seven days a week, persuaded her friends
to give to charity instead of buying gifts for her. ``I feel very
blessed,'' said Kristina, now 17, who lives in Astoria, Queens. ``I
don't think I need anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The six winners were selected by a panel of Times editors and
reporters from a pool of 22 semifinalists. In addition to the
scholarship money, each of the six winners will be paired with a
mentor at The Times and be offered a summer job at the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the scholarships are being financed by The New York
Times Co. Foundation. A sixth will be financed by a special grant
from the Ochs-Sulzberger family.
</P>
<P>
   Another five students will be awarded $6,000 a year for four
years. Three of those scholarships will be financed by a $1 million
donation from the Starr Foundation, a private organization in New
York City that supports educational efforts, among other things.
The other two will be financed by the scholarship program's reserve
fund, using money contributed by readers of The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Selected from among the semifinalists, the five students are
Lionel Anderson, 17, of Mount St. Michael Academy, the Bronx;
Natacha Pascal, 17, of George W. Wingate High School, Brooklyn;
Loan Phan, 18, of Christopher Columbus High School, the Bronx;
Ruben Porras, 18, of University Heights Secondary School, the
Bronx; and Steven Rocker, 18, of Beach Channel High School, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the scholarship winners will be among the first in their
families to go to college. They have been driven, they say, by the
chance to achieve what their parents could not.

COLUMN: EXPLOITING BREAST CANCER FOR POLITICS

   Diane Sackett Nannery of Manorville, N.Y., found activism when
breast cancer found her seven years ago. Since then she has won
approval of a postage stamp championing breast cancer awareness,
co-written a book on an aspect of the disease, even been criticized
for appearing in a campaign ad for Alfonse M. D'Amato in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Nannery, seasoned as she is, cannot get over what she has
seen in the last few days _ George W. Bush's discovery of breast
cancer and his use of the issue on Long Island, where so many women
are frightened because of a relatively large incidence of the dread
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio ad, and campaigning at the State University of New
York at Stony Brook with the ad's narrator, Geri Barish, a breast
cancer survivor, Bush portrayed John McCain as an opponent of
breast cancer financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him wearing that pink ribbon the other day, it
turned my stomach,'' Nannery, referring to the pastel symbol of
concern about the disease. ``You earn the right to wear that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to support a candidate if you think he has a good
record on the issue, which is why Nannery says she made the D'Amato
ad. And then there is pandering: ``This was an ugly thing,'' she
continued. ``They dragged breast cancer through the gutter, across
the graves of women who have not made it. We need attention if we
are going to win this war. But this is not an issue to be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes it is. In politics everyone and everything is used. And
it works so often that one has to wonder what's wrong with voters
who say they hate politics, then buy the most cynical tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Nannery, an independent who cannot vote in Tuesday's primaries,
was so exercised that she complained to a friend, Republican Rep.
Peter King of Long Island _ a McCain man. Now the McCain camp has
an angry public statement from Nannery to send to reporters. That's
politics: fight breast cancer survivor with breast cancer survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Barish, head of 1 in 9: the Long Island Breast Cancer Action
Coalition, is among the best-known of Long Island's advocates on
this issue. She is also a Republican ally of Gov. George Pataki and
D'Amato, and ran unsuccessfully for county office last year. When
the Nassau Legislature was still Republican-dominated, its
presiding officer made Barish the executive director of the
county-financed Hewlett House, a resource center for women with
breast cancer and their families.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Barish _ who did not return phone calls to her
office and home _ has a $75,000-a-year patronage job gratis the
county Republican machine (which lost its legislative majority last
year after Nassau went into a fiscal crisis).
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing inherently wrong with patronage. Some people in
patronage jobs are even qualified for them. But it is instructive
to note that the star of the Bush ad owes her livelihood to
Nassau's Republican Party, once led by D'Amato, mentor of Pataki,
who is leader of New York's Bush push. Funny how things work.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that ``people will figure it out.'' Some signposts
for those so inclined:
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed Bush was not doing as well as he had hoped with
women and the suburban vote. The McCain Web site revealed that he
voted against some Long Island breast cancer programs. Bingo!
</P>
<P>
   McCain says those programs got little or no public scrutiny and
were among $13 billion in ``pork barrel'' spending, a bit of
context that does not make it into Barish's radio script.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Texas advocates of women's health about Bush's record and
they say his wife, Laura, has been great on breast cancer. One
coalition of Texas women's groups says that four in 10 women over
age 50 in the state have not had mammograms in the last two years
and that Bush did not support one of its financing requests. The
governor's campaign Web site does not mention breast cancer once.
</P>
<P>
   Not that either candidate's record is as much an issue as why
politics and exploitation go together so often, and why they are
effective. Those of us with reason to know about the gravity of
this disease find that distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breast cancer is a political issue, but this is not the place
to endorse specific candidates,'' said Hillary Rutter, director of
the Adelphi New York Statewide Breast Cancer Hotline and Support
Program. ``We should be looking at candidates and fighting for
things that are important _ access to treatment, research dollars,
quality of care, patient confidentiality.''
</P>
<P>
   Substance! Try making an engaging, 45-second attack ad out of
that.

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Taking the pulpit at Riverside Church in Manhattan,
Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday rejected what she described as the
``false choice'' between aggressive crime fighting on the one hand
and civil relations between the police and minorities on the other,
as she invoked the death of Amadou Diallo to sharpen her criticism
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's leadership style.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention Giuliani by name during 18 minutes of
remarks at Sunday morning services at the interdenominational
church. But the meaning of her speech _ a political address from
the pulpit _ was unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a church that has become a towering symbol of social
change and integration, Clinton, the Democratic candidate for U.S.
Senate, asserted that New York City had paid a harsh and
unnecessary price for what many people see as Giuliani's defining
accomplishment, the drop in crime during his mayoralty, and she
assailed Giuliani's administration for failing to reach out to ease
the breach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject, with all my heart, the notion that falling crime
rates demand rising mistrust between communities and police,''
Clinton said, her voice echoing across the 70-year-old church that
was built in the Gothic image of the Chartres Cathedral south of
Paris. ``I reject the false choice between effective policing and
mutual respect. It is a false choice to say we cannot cut crime and
have better community relations. It is a false choice to say that
we cannot have safer streets and greater trust and confidence in
the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership in this city refuses to reach out, to work with
a community that is in pain, to even acknowledge that there is a
problem,'' Clinton said. ``I say that bad relations with the
community are not a necessary cost of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered a few general notions on ways to redress the
situation, from increasing the number of minority officers on the
city's police force to expanding community policing programs, to
financing research into new technology that would allow the police
to electronically scan passers-by for firearms, avoiding the
intrusion of a frisk.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part this was a speech about themes rather than
proposals, as the first lady sought to draw a stylistic contrast
between herself and Giuliani on the very issue that many
politicians believe is the foundation of the mayor's strength.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been the speech of someone running to unseat
Giuliani as mayor of New York, rather than a candidate for Senate;
there was little mention of the kinds of issues that might come
across the floor of the Senate, and much discussion of what Clinton
said the city should do in the wake of the reaction to the recent
acquittal of four police officers in the 1999 shooting death of
Diallo in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, it is too easy to retreat into outrage and
disbelief, to fall into cynicism and despair,'' Clinton said,
describing how she thought the city should move ahead in the wake
of the verdict. ``And on the other, it is too easy to perceive
every question or critique as an attack. To hunker down instead of
reaching out. To shut doors instead of opening them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I am new to New York and that many have tried to be
repairers of the breach,'' she said. ```But I hope my voice _ all
of our voices _ will help us move forward now.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani responded to Clinton's speech by accusing the first
lady and President Clinton of trying to turn a tragic case to her
political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that they would try to drive a wedge like
this. That is the way the Clintons practice politics,'' Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all New Yorkers can see that this is a political
tactic, really, in an interesting way, the kind of way the Clintons
play politics, in the name of uniting what they are really trying
do is to divide,'' Giuliani said. ``And that is kind of sad.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The setting for the speech the was the church on Riverside Drive
where, as Clinton noted, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke,
and which has long been identified with political and social
movements in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance there produced a clash of images: parishioners in
the huge church rising in prayer and pageant, competing with a
restless group of reporters. It did not always go smoothly: At one
point, just as a pastor was offering a prayer for the dead and ill,
a reporter in the pews began an audible whispered cell-phone
conversation from her seat, and parishioners glared angrily at the
intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   The importance that Clinton attached to these remarks had been
signaled for days _ by the first lady, her aides, and even Bill
Clinton, who spoke about the acquittal of four police officers in
the shooting of Diallo. Indeed, Hillary Clinton echoed almost
exactly what her husband had said about the case: that many
minority residents ``believe that if Amadou had been a young white
man in an all-white neighborhood, he would still be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she never mentioned Giuliani's name, the mayor was the
obvious subject of her remarks. The shooting death of Diallo, an
immigrant from Guinea who was unarmed and was standing in the
vestibule of his apartment building, set off weeks of protests in
front of police headquarters, and severely strained Giuliani's
relations with minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani expressed satisfaction with the verdict delivered by
the jury in Albany. Clinton has yet to offer any comment on the
verdict itself, and did not on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sprinkled her speech with readings from the Bible, and
consulted a number of church and police leaders, including William
Bratton, the former police commissioner under Giuliani, in
preparing for her appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was, as she frequently is, somewhat vague in discussing
specifics. She said, for example, that government should expand
programs to assist police officers who want to buy homes in poor
neighborhoods, but she did not offer an opinion on a police
residency requirement, a measure that has been pushed by a number
of minority leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Her spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said she did not have a position
on it.
</P>
<P>
   She called for an expansion of community policing, and said
churches and police officers should work together to deal with gun
violence and youth gangs on the street. Clinton also called for
programs to increase minority recruitment on the police force. She
also said the city should increase police salaries, to stop the
flow of experienced officers to better-paying jobs in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke approvingly of the drop in crime in New York,
though she did not give any credit for it to Giuliani. At the same
time, though, she went out of her way to offer praise for the
city's Police Department and empathy for people who were wary of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime's down dramatically _ and lives have been saved in this
city _ because every day brave men and women put on a uniform and
place themselves in harm's way to protect us,'' she said. ``And let
us also recognize that far too many people believe they are
considered guilty simply because of the color of their skin.''

JANET REED, 83, BALLERINA WITH COMIC TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (EDS: The spelling `WILLAM' is correct) 
(js) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Janet Reed, whose comic gifts and sparkling technique made her
one of American dance's most beloved ballerinas in the early years
of American Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet, died in
Seattle on Feb. 28. She was 83 and lived in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   She suffered a stroke one week earlier, said Maren Erskine, her
daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   A petite redhead whose vivacious energy delighted audiences in
both story ballets and pure-dance works, Reed was San Francisco
Ballet's leading ballerina from 1937 to 1941 before joining Ballet
Theater in 1942 and City Ballet in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   She was a member of Eugene Loring's experimental chamber
company, Dance Players, in 1942. In 1974 she helped found the
Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle, remaining for two years as its
first artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the original cast of Jerome Robbins' first ballet,
``Fancy Free,'' Reed became associated with a memorable role and
the kind of all-American image that audiences identified with her
dancing. When Robbins created ``Fancy Free'' for Ballet Theater in
1944 he cast her as the young woman who dances a romantic duet with
a sailor in a bar during World War II and then wipes her lipstick
off his face.
</P>
<P>
   By then Reed had also performed the ballerina roles in the
19th-century classics in San Francisco. These included Willam
Christensen's 1940 staging of ``Swan Lake,'' the ballet's first
full-length U.S. production. As Lincoln Kirstein noted in his book
``Movement and Metaphor,'' Reed was an excellent comedian but also
a classical dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Kirstein and George Balanchine founded City Ballet in 1948, and
Balanchine invited Reed into the company a few months later. He
quickly cast her in his signature Neo-Classical ballets, including
``Symphony in C'' and ``Serenade.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 he choreographed ``Bourree Fantasque,'' whose final
exuberant section exploited the vitality and virtuosity that made
up Reed's trademark style.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s and '50s City Ballet was a very different company
than it is today. Balanchine continued to develop a plotless
Neo-Classical genre, but the repertory was eclectic, drawing upon a
variety of choreographers. Robbins, like Reed, had transferred from
Ballet Theater and become associate artistic director in 1949. Reed
had danced in the 1945 premiere of ``Interplay,'' Robbins' enduring
mix of bravura and blues, and he continued to use her.
</P>
<P>
   Comic ballets, even by Balanchine, were not a rarity at City
Ballet, and in this realm Reed was queen. In Balanchine's ``A la
Francaix,'' Reed was a belle who lost her swain, Andre Eglevsky, to
a sylph, Maria Tallchief. In ``The Pied Piper,'' by Robbins, Reed
led a jiving pack after a clarinetist onstage. She was the droopy
Hortense, queen of the Waterlilies in Ruthanna Boris' ``Cakewalk,''
a comic gloss on minstrel shows.
</P>
<P>
   In City Ballet's 1953 revival of Lew Christensen's ``Filling
Station,'' a bit of 1938 Americana, Reed danced opposite the young
Jacques d'Amboise as a gas station attendant. She was in her
element as a tipsy debutante. When Balanchine created ``Western
Symphony'' Reed made his satire of a classical adagio a lesson in
strong technique and projection.
</P>
<P>
   John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, devoted an
article to Reed in 1954: ``Janet Reed is adorable, all right, and
that unquestionably brings a great many customers to the box
office; but she is also an artist of very high attainments, and a
performer among performers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed was born in Tolo, Ore., and studied ballet with Christensen
in Portland, Ore., and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although repeatedly praised for her comic timing and engaging
characterization, Reed had an extensive dramatic range that she
displayed in Antony Tudor's psychological ballets and Michael
Kidd's ``On Stage!'' at Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   After marrying Branson Erskine, an interior designer, she
appeared in the Robbins musical ``Look Ma, I'm Dancing'' in 1947.
She is survived by a son, Reed Erskine of New York, and a daughter,
Jane Erskine of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Reed returned to Ballet Theater briefly before joining City
Ballet, where she danced until 1958 and then was its ballet
mistress until 1961. She taught in several colleges before moving
to Seattle, where she also staged dances for the Seattle Opera. In
1983 she and Gene Kelly were the hosts of a gala celebrating the
San Francisco Ballet's 50th anniversary.  &QL;

PAKISTANIS, EAGER FOR CHANGE, ARE LEFT FRUSTRATED AFTER COUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite 17th graf for clarity.)  
(mk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ The euphoria that greeted a military coup
here almost five months ago _ and the hope that a no-nonsense
general could quickly turn this corrupt, virtually bankrupt country
around _ have given way to a weary sense that little has changed,
and to fears that Pakistan could be drifting toward more war with
India.
</P>
<P>
   While it is still early to judge the record of the new
government, the White House has little else to go on as it agonizes
over whether President Clinton should use his visit to India this
month _ the first to this region by an American president in 22
years _ to call also on Pakistan's military rulers and give them
the stamp of legitimacy they seek.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, has not
done the things that the American government considers most
important. He has not spelled out a plan for restoring democracy.
He has not cracked down on an Islamic fundamentalist group that the
United States has put on its list of terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   And in a decision that is a telling commentary on the general's
cautious style of governance, he has not signed the nuclear test
ban treaty. His foreign minister, Abdul Sattar, has spoken out in
favor it, but the new government has chosen not to sign for fear
that doing so would rile Islamic political parties.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Sattar asked why the new government should pay
the political price for signing when the U.S. Senate has voted
against the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantages of signing are unclear, and the disadvantages
of political opposition at home are concrete,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These rationales for inaction or for delaying action have
frustrated people who thought the military government would rule
with the swift decisiveness with which it overthrew Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   While Musharraf casts himself as the antithesis of a politician,
his government has been careful to look after certain
constituencies. While it has arrested 90 people, including
businessmen, on charges of defaulting on bank loans, it has not
gone after sitting military officers or judges on corruption
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Officials note that the military and the judiciary have their
own accountability systems. But it appears that the military has no
appetite for investigations of its own and does not want to
alienate judges who are hearing cases that challenge the
constitutionality of the army takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also been cautious in economic policy.
Musharraf said his government would tax the agricultural incomes of
feudal landlords who have always escaped payment and would broaden
the sales tax to cover retail shopkeepers. But rather than doing it
right away, his finance minister, Shaukat Aziz, formerly a senior
executive with Citibank, said he has used the last few months to
develop the new tax system and to build greater acceptance among
those who will be taxed come July, when the new budget year begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are changing the culture in a society where nobody likes
to pay taxes and where tax avoidance is the name of the game,''
Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
   In the political sphere, the government says it will take a
first step back toward democracy with local elections to be held by
the end of the year, but it offers no timetable for national
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talking about devolution of power to the local bodies
when we don't have a Parliament,'' said Asma Jehangir, a lawyer and
human rights leader whose father was a member of Parliament who
spent four years in prison under two previous military governments.
``It's a joke. How can you have freedom at the lower level when
there's not freedom anywhere?''
</P>
<P>
   The impatience with the slow pace of change is tangible not only
among the intelligentsia, but among the poor. People who cheered
the general's promise that he would do what Sharif never managed _
to tax the rich, punish the corrupt, revive the economy and build
``real'' democracy _ now say there is little difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of wheat flour has gone up, not down,'' said Lal
Muhammad, who ekes out a living selling wrinkled second-hand
sweaters on the streets of Peshawar. ``The lives of poor people
remain the same. I don't see any difference between Musharraf and
Nawaz Sharif.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Halim, a tailor in Peshawar who had skipped breakfast and
lunch so his wife and six children could eat, was just as hard
boiled. ``This is the fourth general who has come, and we haven't
seen a better life yet,'' he said. Still, despite his
disillusionment, he hopes Clinton comes. ``Maybe he can stop war
between India and Pakistan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Halim's sense of foreboding is shared by some academics and
diplomats. Musharraf has once again made Kashmir the dominant
matter in Pakistan's relations with India. It appears that rather
than turning down the heat there, Pakistan has backed more frequent
and deadly attacks by militants on Indian forces in Kashmir, the
majority-Muslim territory that both countries claim in a
half-century-old dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they don't have a hope in hell of liberating
Kashmir,'' said Pervaiz Hoodbhoy, a nuclear physicist at
Quaid-I-Azam University in Islamabad. ``They live in a fantasy
world. They think they're inflicting such grievous damage on the
Indians when the truth is the opposite. It's Pakistan which is
bleeding.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week, the Indian government _ citing as justification its
10-week war with Pakistan last summer in Kashmir _ proposed a 28
percent rise in military spending, a $3 billion increase that is
itself more than Pakistan's entire military budget.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, which already spends more than a quarter of its budget
on the military and almost half on debt service, can ill afford to
go deeper in hock to try to match India's military and economic
might.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it should have seemed inevitable that Musharraf _
a soldier, not a schooled statesman _ would disappoint. Pakistan's
entrenched problems are not amenable to quick fixes. So his men are
pleading for time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had completely unrealistic expectations,'' said Javed
Jabbar, who advises the general on national affairs. ``They thought
there was a magic wand.''

GAGNE WILD OFF THE BAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Los Angeles Dodgers pitching coach Claude
Osteen did his best to prep right-hander Eric Gagne on what not to
do, such as overthrow in an attempt to impress the bigwigs in his
first spring outing.
</P>
<P>
   So Gagne, being 24 and rarin' to go, went out and threw the ball
with all his might.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time he reached the clubhouse after allowing seven
runs on six hits in 1 innings Sunday against the Mets, he knew what
went wrong. And Gagne, projected to be the Dodgers' fourth or fifth
starter, wasn't worried about this having a bearing on the rest of
his spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to throw like Kevin Brown,'' Gagne said. ``My
mechanics were a little off. I tried to do too much. I tried to
strike everybody out. I was out of control out there. The only
thing I need to do is get back to my mechanics. I tried to impress
(manager) Davey (Johnson), (general manager) Kevin (Malone) and
Tommy (Lasorda). That's not what I need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Gagne, listed as one of the top young pitchers in the
game, is competing for a starting spot with Carlos Perez and Orel
Hershiser, he'd need about five more of these outings before he's
yanked from the rotation.

<P>
   ``He's fine. I don't worry about him,'' Johnson said. ``If you
had to go on everyone who had a great spring makes the club, you'll
have the wrong club.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown breezes: It was Brown's first outing of the spring, but he
looked in midseason form as he pitched three scoreless innings and
dominated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty free and easy, nothing to complain about,'' the
right-hander said. ``You just want a nice, smooth, steady
preparation to get ready for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre banter: Dodgers managing general partner and CEO Bob Daly
and Scott Boras, the agent for Adrian Beltre, are expected to set
up a meeting for either today or Tuesday to resume negotiations on
a three-year deal for the third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre's seeking free agency because he was signed at the age of
15, a violation of baseball rules.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Dodgers await the conclusion of this messy
four-month case - which will worsen if it reaches an arbitrator and
doesn't get resolved before the season begins - there are other
implications surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers sign Beltre, as both sides hope, the players
association would drop its grievance, and the cycle of sanctions
set forth by commissioner Bud Selig would kick in.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictions include a $50,000 fine, the closing of the Dodgers'
Campo Las Palmas facility in the Dominican Republic for a year
(though the club made plans to train at Jose Rijo's complex in the
country), and they won't be able to scout or sign players residing
in the Dominican Republic for one year. It's yet to be decided
whether the new contract would make the Dodgers exempt from paying
Beltre the $48,500 he's owed for signing early.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Catcher Todd Hundley grounded to second in his
first right-handed at-bat of the spring against Al Leiter. Hundley
also easily threw out Derek Bell trying to steal second....
Left-hander Onan Masaoka (sprained left ankle) is close to
returning. He fielded bunts and ground balls in the morning and
reported no problems.... Johnson said he expects to trim his roster
either Tuesday or Wednesday in order to get it down to a workable
size. They have 62 players in camp.... Garth Brooks was expected to
make the trip to Dodgertown, but a bruised left foot caused him to
remain in Port St. Lucie.

LAVIN: LOVE HIM OR LEAVE HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ How much did Steve Lavin have to do with UCLA
sliding out of Maples Pavilion as the new ``Wonder Boys,'' in a
rush to greatness to get to the Dance of 64 before anyone has a
chance to check those RPI rankings again?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows. We know that any criticism redirected at him this
week will look preposterous. Doesn't mean it's any less valid.
</P>
<P>
   Lav called the timeout right before the end of regulation to set
up the play in which Jerome Moiso moseyed through the key and hit
the shot to force OT. But how many more were screaming for play to
continue, to let the players figure out the last shot, since it was
their athletic ability that brought them this far against the No.
1-ranked team in the country?
</P>
<P>
   Credit for this talented group pulling itself together at this
critical point in the season, as opposed to the roller-coaster ride
earlier, has to do with relativity. It was eventually going to
happen whether Lavin slowed the process or not.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy the euphoria, 'cause after that upcoming blindsiding
blowout against (fill in the Detroit Mercy of '00 here) in the
first or second round of the Tour de Hoops - provided they get past
the Washington schools this week it'll all come around to the
fast-talkin' guy with the white shirt and loud tie trying to hug
the referee....
</P>
<P>
   --Even Charles Schwab coulda told Anna Kournikova Federov that
her arranged marriage to Pavel Bure was a bad investment....
</P>
<P>
   A video suggestion for the swoon-to-be Mrs. Bure: ``Married to
the Mob.''...
</P>
<P>
   --Where are they now - Bison Dele ... not with the Lakers, in
case anyone cares now....
</P>
<P>
   --The Dallas Mavs sold out three of the first five home games
since the signing of DRod. Which is the number of sellouts they had
all of last season....
</P>
<P>
   --The Harlem Globetrotters have retired Wilt Chamberlain's No.
13, the first time any number has been shelved in the 74-year
history of the squad....
</P>
<P>
   --If the Cincinnati Reds want to retire Sparky Anderson's No.
10, they're gonna have to rip it off the back of Eddie
Taubensee....
</P>
<P>
   --For what it's worth, a few New Jersey independent minor-league
teams say they're interested in Darryl Strawberry - when he's done
with his latest rehab, of course. One of 'em is named the New
Jersey Jackals....
</P>
<P>
   --Garth Brooks' foot injury pretty much ends his chances of
making the Mets' 40-man roster. His agent is checking American
League teams to see if they can use him as a DH - Designated Hick.
...
</P>
<P>
   --Even though the DH rule has outlasted its intended purpose -
inject offense into American League lineups - the players' union
balks at any talk of eliminating the stupid thing. Baseball folks
hope to convince them of doing away with it and may expand rosters
to as many as 27 players when the new collective bargaining
agreement comes up after next season....
</P>
<P>
   --The Iditarod is idiotic. And not just because it forces dogs
to mush a human who stands to win six figures more than 1,000 miles
across endless snowbanks....
</P>
<P>
   --Picking up an enforcer before the March 14 deadline wouldn't
kill the Kings....
</P>
<P>
   --The new Houston NFL franchise has narrowed its list of
nicknames to five: Apollos, Bobcats, Stallions, Texans and
Wildcatters. Apparently, the Dry Wells and Oilspills were taken.

EDITORIAL: MIDEAST PEACE MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, March 6:
</P>
<P>
   Israel's cabinet acted responsibly Sunday in endorsing Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's plan to withdraw Israeli troops from southern
Lebanon by July. Israel's departure would be smoother if carried
out in concert with a peace agreement with Syria, the dominant
military power in Lebanon. But even if there is no accord with
Damascus, Israel serves its own best interests by extricating
itself from its 18-year occupation of Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli forces invaded Lebanon in 1982 to drive out Palestine
Liberation Organization guerrillas. After pressing all the way to
Beirut and chasing the PLO from its former strongholds, Israel
pulled back in 1985 to the nine-mile-wide border zone it occupies
today. The ostensible reason for Israel's continuing presence is to
prevent Lebanese guerrillas from launching attacks against exposed
northern Israeli villages. But in recent years most of the fighting
has been inside Lebanon as Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas
attack Israeli soldiers in the occupation zone and Israeli planes
retaliate against targets throughout southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis increasingly see the Lebanese clashes as futile and the
casualties they inflict on Israeli troops as intolerable. Barak
last year promised to withdraw from Lebanon within 12 months. But
without substantial progress toward peace with Syria, Damascus may
feel little incentive to restrain Hezbollah from attacking Israel's
withdrawing soldiers and newly vulnerable civilians. To prevent
that, Barak is working hard to get stalled peace talks with Syria
moving again.
</P>
<P>
   But his task was needlessly complicated last week by a
parliamentary vote that would set unreasonable rules for the
referendum that would be required to ratify an eventual peace
agreement with Damascus. The vote was only a preliminary test of
strength. But, disturbingly, it drew support from three parties
belonging to the government coalition _ the Sephardic religious
party, Shas, the National Religious Party, whose constituency
includes Jewish settlers, and Yisrael Baaliya, a Russian immigrant
party. Barak needs to bring some of these defectors back into line
to keep the referendum rules from being enacted into law.
</P>
<P>
   The draft legislation would require any peace agreement with
Syria to win approval from an absolute majority of Israelis
eligible to vote in a national referendum, rather than a majority
of those who vote. This thwarts the principle of majority rule by
adding all those who do not vote to the no column, allowing a
minority of opponents to block a peace deal that most Israelis
judge to be beneficial. In Israeli elections, turnout is typically
about 80 percent. But even with such broad participation, more than
three out of five Israelis could vote for peace and the agreement
would still be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Barak made a bold overture toward Syria by
acknowledging that, in exchange for adequate guarantees, Israel
might withdraw from the entire Golan Heights. That has renewed
optimism that direct talks between Israel and Syria could resume
this spring. Successful talks could significantly reduce the
dangers of an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. They should not be
encumbered by a mischievous referendum law.

   NEW YORK _ Bonnie Malick had little time to revel in her
short-haired Scottish Fold reaching the finals of the 16th
International Cat Show on Sunday at Madison Square Garden. It was
quite a day for the 8-month-old white-and-brown tabby whose face
resembled an old-style bartender with his hair parted in the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   In his first adult show, Starrpawzs Got Milk? _ known as Moo Moo
_ was one of five group winners who awaited the prestigious
best-in-show judging.
</P>
<P>
   His selection as a finalist was greeted by fans at The Theater
with a roar of surprised affection. They liked him. They really
liked him!
</P>
<P>
   Moo Moo blinked his right eye. Was he acknowledging his adoring
public?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be amazing for a Scottish Fold to win,'' said Malick,
of New Rochelle, who showed Moo Moo during the weekend with her
sister, Jacqueline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually,'' Bonnie Malick added, ``it's a Persian.''
</P>
<P>
   And she was right. Pajean's Wild Thang, a chubby-cheeked,
serene, blue-and-white Persian, who hails from Baton Rouge, La.,
defeated the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a couch potato, an excellent pet,'' said Pamela Bassett,
her breeder and owner. ``She's the queen of the shows.'' Wild
Thang's goal, now, is to proceed further along the littered trail
to be named cat of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Thang, who is 18 months old, took her victory in stride, as
if awaiting her next can of Sheba. But her triumph is one for all
female Persians to aspire to. The standards for judging a Persian
were created for bigger male cats. But big-boned Wild Thang met the
standards, which impressed Richard Gebhardt, the best-in-show
judge.
</P>
<P>
   As cameras flashed and television cameras' lights made the
humans around her sweat, not a hair of Wild Thang's luxurious coat
was out of place. She did not even meow. She sat in Bassett's arms,
on the judge's table, or in Gebhardt's right hand, like David Cone
serenely answering the umpteenth postgame news-media query.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a show cat!'' Bassett said, to explain her cat's
equanimity.
</P>
<P>
   This show was nearly a different species from last month's
Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, also held at the Garden. The show
is inherently informal, even disorganized. It has a proletarian,
not an elite, sensibility. Cats, being cats, cannot be trotted
about rings by well-dressed handlers. So the cats spend their time
in cages in the Garden's Exposition Rotunda _ sometimes venturing
onto their owners' laps for grooming or greeting _ before they are
summoned from snoozing and snacking to impress six judges in breed
competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Around them, vendors sold cat toilets and cat hotels; a cat
psychologist promised to treat cat phobias; a veterinarian held
forth on acupuncture for cats, and cat fanciers had their faces
painted to look like cats.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton the Wonder Cat sat in a director's chair with his name
written in silver glitter. Don't worry. He was content.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Myles Cohen, the cat show's deep-voiced announcer,
offered messages to the hundreds of cats and cat-owned humans that
would be deemed gauche at Westminster. He was the feline realm's
Bob Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last call for kittens 67 and 68 to Ring 5,'' he said. ``If you
go to the Loot booth, you can pick up the cutest little fuzzy
mice,'' he said, with a bemused lilt. ``Last call for Household Pet
297 to Ring 6.'' he said, urgently. ``Hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   To be judged, cats were brought into rings and awaited their
turn to be stretched, stroked, spun, prodded and held aloft. Judges
chatted them up.
</P>
<P>
   With enough points from the breed competitions on Saturday and
early Sunday, cats were eligible to vie for supremacy in one of
five groups, a phase of the show that moved to The Theater on
Sunday. There, judges compared cats against others in their breeds,
then against others in other breeds within the group.
</P>
<P>
   To amuse the cats, or themselves, the judges wielded feathery,
or tinselly teaser toys at the contestants to see if they leaped
from their cages. The Abyssinians seemed ever ready for a
jailbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Besides best-in-show, kittens, household pets and spayed or
neutered cats also competed for category hegemony. Among the
household cats, Neeka, a 4-year-old brown McTorbie defeated a field
that included Bartholomew Bunny, a nearly 23-year-old Siamese
described by one breed judge as ``phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   The category included an odd-eyed white cat named Rev. Al
Sharpton. He did not make the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Neeka was one of a five-kitten litter found with the mother in a
phone booth in Hartford, Conn. ``I lost my first cat due to
illness,'' said Meghan Cooley, 15, of Enfield, Conn. ``I got this
one for my 10th birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Charm Moonflight, or Freddy, a copper-eyed male Persian,
fended off four other finalists to win as best kitten. ``He follows
us around the house, always begging for something to eat,'' said
Darlene Feger, of Riverdale, N.J., the co-breeder and co-owner of
the 7-month-old. ``She loves watching the birds on the Discovery
Channel. And looking at herself in a mirrored door.''

PLAN TO MONITOR PARTY PREFERENCES ANGERS SOME VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, Mo. _ The Missouri Democratic Party has Charley
Spillman feeling a bit ornery as Tuesday's presidential primary
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Spillman _ a decorated World War II veteran and lifelong
Democrat _ is angry about a new law that allows political parties
to have spotters in polling places to record who is voting in which
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like that I have to tell them which way I want to
vote,'' Spillman said. ``The only time I ever crossed over was in
1980 for Ronald Reagan. But I gave up three years of my life for
this country, and that entitles me to do what I ... please.''
</P>
<P>
   Spillman's feeling is not unusual in this heavily Democratic
county 78 miles southeast of Kansas City. Henry County Clerk Gene
Pogue said that over the course of a week he received about 50 to
60 calls complaining about the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel their privacy is being violated,'' Pogue said.
``People anymore are independent and want to vote for the
individual. If they own a business, they would just as soon that
when they go to the polls it's not broadcast which ballot they
took.''
</P>
<P>
   The law was enacted last year at the request of the Democratic
National Committee. Party leaders threatened not to seat Missouri's
delegation to this year's national convention unless the state
could verify that the results of the primary were untainted by
independent and Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Temple, the Missouri Democratic Party's executive director,
said that was a difficult goal in a state where voters do not
register by party affiliation. Last year, the national party
compromised and agreed not to challenge Missouri's results if the
state party made a good-faith effort to ensure that the nominee was
chosen by Missouri Democrats, Temple said.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition to the law may render it meaningless in many
places. The uproar in Clinton already has forced county Democratic
Chairman Fred Bunch to cancel plans to monitor a half-dozen
precincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to create any more controversy than has already
come about,'' Bunch said. ``The national party just wanted to
ensure the integrity of the process. People don't seem to
understand. This is far less intrusive than the prior
delegate-selection process.''
</P>
<P>
   With the caucus system, which Missouri used most recently in
1992 and 1996, voters had to sign a form attesting to their
membership in the party and announce to a roomful of people their
choices for president.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Struckhoff, the Greene County clerk who is president of
the state clerks' association, said he had heard only scattered
complaints from county clerks across Missouri. But Struckhoff, a
Republican, said he expects a heated reaction Tuesday when people
go to the polls and see party workers jotting down their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this came up, I told our county chairman to consider this
carefully because this could be a big public-relations problem,''
Struckhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Bunch said he did not understand much of the criticism. Some
people have the mistaken impression that party monitors will be
writing down how they vote, instead of merely which election they
are voting in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of fundamental fairness, you should expect that people who
nominate the Democratic candidate are Democrats and the people who
take part in the Republican primary are Republicans,'' Bunch said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kay Miles, publisher of the /{Clinton Daily Democrat/} and a
longtime Democratic loyalist, said election monitors conflict with
the culture of small towns, where people don't like someone keeping
tabs on them. Some people won't vote because of the new
requirement, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard one person say, `If he writes down which ballot I
take, I'm going to punch him in the nose,' &UR; '' Miles said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is intensified, she said, by the interest of
many longtime Democrats in crossing over to the Republican primary
to vote for Arizona Sen. John McCain. The feeling is especially
strong among veterans, Miles said.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't like the idea of people knowing they voted with
the Grand Old Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Civil War battle re-enactments around here _ which we
refer to as the War of Yankee Aggression,'' Miles said with a
smile. ``People cheer when the South wins. So they don't want to be
known as voting Republican. It's the principle of the thing: It's
supposed to be a private vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Spillman, the World War II veteran, said his buddies at the
Clinton chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars were bothered by
the party monitoring. He said many Democratic veterans want to vote
for McCain for two reasons: his status as a prisoner during the
Vietnam War and his opposition to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Spillman's wife, Theresa, is a die-hard Republican, but she said
she wouldn't vote if the GOP were monitoring local precincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another reason not to be a Democrat,'' Theresa
Spillman said. ``We're getting to the point where you can't even
breathe unless they know you're breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple said resistance to party monitoring stems from a
fundamental tension between the concepts of free elections and
party politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our democracy that we are free to vote,'' Temple
said. ``But it's the role of political parties to choose the
strongest candidate to run in November, and others shouldn't monkey
around with that process.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock, the Missouri Republican Party's executive
director, said GOP workers would be monitoring precincts at
scattered sites around the state, including some in Kansas City and
mid-Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The national GOP does not require the monitoring, but some local
party officials plan to use the information to stay in touch with
Republican voters during the fall campaign, Hancock said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Clinton, however, some people consider the controversy
to be much ado about very little.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Onwiler, who owns a plumbing service, was asked about party
monitors as he finished his lunch at Uchie's Fine Foods on the
courthouse square. Onwiler said they wouldn't affect his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to vote for the man I want to,'' he said, ``whether
he's a Republican, a Democrat or a Free Soiler.''

RAINS SUITS BURTON IN LAS VEGAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Jeff Burton's stock car is not equipped with Doppler
Radar. That hasn't prevented Burton from emerging as NASCAR's
rainy-day ace.
</P>
<P>
   Burton scored his third consecutive victory in a rain-shortened
Winston Cup race yesterday at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, where he
won the CarsDirect.com 400. With one red-flag stoppage already on
the books and the skies again threatening, Burton took the lead
from Roush Racing teammate Mark Martin for the third and final time
on Lap 136 of what was scheduled for 267 laps. But a cold rain
forced NASCAR officials to red-flag the action to a stop for a
second time on the 1.5-mile trioval. After a delay of just over one
hour, Burton was declared the winner for the second time here in
less than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take bizarre finishes as long as we come out on top,''
said Burton, who also won the Busch Grand National Sam's Town 300
on Saturday under caution after a late-race wreck. ``The key is to
put yourself in position. We seem to keep not falling into these
things, because you don't `fall into' any races. But we seem to
have ourselves in the right place at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly was the case in both Cup races at Darlington
(S.C.) Raceway in 1999, when Burton was in the lead when showers
sent him to soggy celebrations in Victory Lane. In addition, the
Pepsi Southern 400 on Labor Day weekend at Darlington and
yesterday's 400-miler were designated as Winston No Bull 5 events,
worth a $1 million bonus to both Burton's team and a lucky fan.
Joyce Williams of Port Isabel became a millionaire _ and a
permanent member of Burton's fan club _ yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't go to any racetrack on a given weekend thinking about
rain,'' said Burton, who scored his first victory of 2000. ``We had
great weather all week, and it's a shame it had to end in the rain.
I was just sitting in the fastest car on the racetrack. The rain
certainly made it easier for us, but nonetheless we had a great
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's latest success at LVMS continued Roush Racing's
domination in the desert. Martin won the inaugural race here in
1998, leading all five of his teammates to top-10 finishes. Burton
won last year's race, while Martin finished 10th. Yesterday, Burton
and Martin finished one-three, sandwiched around second-year star
Tony Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we won the race, it's not as dramatic as it could
have been,'' said Burton, driver of the No. 99 Exide Batteries Ford
Taurus. ``Because I think those three cars were getting ready to
put on one hell of a race, and everybody ran out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart began the day more concerned about the effect the
forecast for cooler weather would have on the handling of his No.
20 Home Depot Pontiac than the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the car would probably be a little tighter and the
track would have more grip in it,'' said Stewart, who was not among
the seven drivers to lead a lap. ``Everybody knew going into today
what the concerns were with the weather and everybody had the
opportunity to adjust their strategy accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, Stewart acknowledged, again adjusted better than
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he's doing,'' Stewart said, ``I'm going to rub up on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott finished fourth in another Ford, followed by Bobby
Labonte's Pontiac Grand Prix. Labonte overtook reigning Cup
champion Dale Jarrett, who finished seventh in his Taurus, as
series points leader for the first time since May 15. Meanwhile,
seven-time Cup champion Dale Earnhardt gave the beleaguered 2000
Chevrolet Monte Carlo its best finish, eighth, after starting 33rd.
The top rookie finisher for the second consecutive race was Dale
Earnhardt Jr. in another Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte leads Jarrett by four points (490-486) heading into the
Cracker Barrell Old Country Store 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's victory also was the 500th scored by a Ford product in
the Cup series since 1949. No other manufacturer has reached that
milestone, in either dry or rainy conditions.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE OFFICIALS PONDER MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR HOTEL TO
TRAIN STUDENTS ON CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Johnson County Community College officials
are considering a plan to build a multimillion-dollar hotel on
campus to provide students new opportunities for real-world work
experience.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say those experiences can already be found in the
kitchens and guest rooms of the county's expanding hotel market.
</P>
<P>
   It's all in the talking stages, but college officials envision a
100-room hotel designed for those willing to pay $75 a night to be
guinea pigs in a living laboratory for hotel and restaurant
students.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers, they say, would not be asked to foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting project,'' JCCC President Charles Carlsen
told the college's board last week. ``I think there is a need out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotel guests could begin the day with a workout in the health
club, eat breakfast at the restaurant, attend a continuing
education program sponsored by the college, relax in a hot tub in
the afternoon and dress up for an evening banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Performers, athletes, visiting professors, business travelers
and even racing fans at the new Kansas Speedway would be target
customers for the hotel, which would be built near the school's
Quivira Road entrance south of College Boulevard in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Students would manage the front office, run the vacuum cleaners,
create the marketing strategy, manage the money, book the
conferences, make the meals, mix the drinks and attend classes at
the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is to give students some hands-on training on campus
that would be difficult to do elsewhere,'' said Jerry Vincent,
academic director of the college's hospitality management program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hotel would add a lot of credibility to our program. If
you want to be a chef, a student wants to see some kitchens. And if
you want to be a hotel manager, you want to see a hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   No cost estimate, financing plan or detailed market analysis has
been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   But a feasibility study has been done, and the hotel concept has
been endorsed by the college's Hospitality Management Program
Advisory Committee and the Hotel and Motel Association of Greater
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   JCCC already is home to the National Railroad Academy, which
educates Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad workers, and a
police academy that trains officers for the Johnson County Police
Chiefs Association.
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time, says JCCC board member Lynn
Mitchelson, is that the college would be creating direct
competition with the private sector. He said he wants to see a more
detailed market study to determine whether guests would tolerate
heavy campus traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County already has plenty of hotels where students can
get hands-on experience, said Mary Birch, president of the Overland
Park Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current market has all kinds of hotels,'' she said Friday
after meeting with Carlsen. ``There are a lot of new facilities
coming on the market that are going to have a need for labor that
might be interested in partnering with the college for training
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Overland Park alone has 26 hotels and four more under
construction, four on the drawing board and a 412-room Sheraton
Hotel waiting in the wings for the city's convention center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a clamoring need for a hotel to provide
training,'' said Jerry Cook, president of the Overland Park
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, who also met with Carlsen on Friday, praised the college's
award-winning hospitality internship program, which helps fill gaps
in a market where it is hard to hire and retain good employees.
</P>
<P>
   College officials say that if a campus hotel is built, it will
be driven by community need, will not be financed by taxpayers and
will not compete with other hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have to pay for itself, and the college won't go for
any increase in taxes to pay for this,'' Vincent said. ``We're not
trying to compete with hotels in any way. We're just trying to
provide hotels with better employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of building a hotel on a community college campus has
been kicked around for two years and comes at a time when there is
a national shortage of trained hotel employees.
</P>
<P>
   There are no other training facilities in Kansas City, and the
closest school is a four-year program at Oklahoma State University
in Stillwater.
</P>
<P>
   At least one area hotel operator seems to like the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll all benefit from a training program,'' said Jerry
Albert, general manager of the 148-room Olathe Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   As a training site, the JCCC hotel would have the latest
technology and provide his hotel with better employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has a long way to go,'' said Tom Holden, executive
director of the Hotel and Motel Association of Greater Kansas City.
``But the bottom line is that Johnson County is growing. This is
good for the college, it's great for the city and it's a promising
opportunity for the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry standards show that midrange hotel rooms can be built
for $65,000 to $85,000 each. Under one plan, an operating company
would manage the hotel and hire JCCC students.
</P>
<P>
   A 41-page feasibility study released Nov. 26 by Horwath
Hospitality Consulting of Kansas City shows the average daily room
rate at the hotel would begin at $70 in 2001 and increase to $89 in
2005.
</P>
<P>
   Room occupancy is projected to grow from 58 percent in 2001 to
75 percent in 2005. Revenue is projected to grow from $1.5 million
in 2001 to $2.3 million in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 490 JCCC students last year took hospitality courses, a
program filled to capacity each semester and whose chef
apprenticeship program is the largest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   An on-campus hotel would be invaluable if JCCC wants to produce
students whom top hotel chains want to hire, said Ona Ashley, an
adjunct professor and a 20-year veteran of the hotel industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a freak windstorm blow over a wall, guests call me
names, and I've had electric storms fry my computers,'' she said.
``And the more stuff students can experience hands on, the better
they can learn.''

BID FOR KNOCKOUT NEARLY COSTS AYALA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The Fighter of the Year wanted to put on the Show of
the Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And there was boxer Paulie Ayala's problem Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need some more knockouts,'' Ayala assessed, surveying the
still-vertical torso of challenger Johnny Bredahl.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a whirlwind weekend, the capper to a whirlwind
month. The Fort Worth bantamweight had been named ``The Ring''
magazine's Fighter of the Year. And the fight that launched him,
Ayala's upset defeat of Johnny Tapia, had been selected as the
magazine's Fight of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   And then, too, this was Vegas. Bright lights, big weekend. The
Events Center at the year-old Mandalay Bay mega-hotel rang Saturday
night with the cheers of fans and friends from his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like we were in Fort Worth,'' said Ayala's head
trainer, Henry Mendez. ``It pumped him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think what happened was that he was pumped up so much,
he wanted to knock him out to show the people.''
</P>
<P>
   At 117 well-grounded pounds and with a wife and two children,
Ayala is not usually the kind to play to the crowd and swing for
the fences. He's a boxer, not a lounge act. He rose to the top of
the World Boxing Association's bantam ranks by being a smart and
adept counter-puncher, able to adjust in mid-fight to a variety of
changing styles.
</P>
<P>
   So he took the ring and tried to knock Bredahl out.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ayala won a majority decision, the scoring drew
consternation from some, especially the Bredahl camp. The assembled
media from Bredahl's native Denmark speculated that their boy had
been jobbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very professional business,'' promoter Bob Arum said
in measured tones, directly to a journalist from Copenhagen. ``We
use neutral officials, assigned by the WBA.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, from where Arum sat, he had figured Ayala
as being well ahead as the fight neared its closing rounds. In
truth, Ayala wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it was a hard fight to score,'' Arum said. ``The
judge, Chuck Giampa, is the best judge in Nevada, and he had it
very close, 115-113.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum shrugged. Hey, that's boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Bredahl had stormed abruptly from the ring once the decision was
announced. But later, dressed in street clothes and with his face
looking as if he had stuck it into a cat nest, Bredahl offered his
apology and a handshake to Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I won the fight,'' Bredahl tried to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala and his handlers tried to look at the night as a hard
lesson learned. The champ had won but had not been abundantly
impressive. Worse, he had strayed from the game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows that he's a role model, and Paulie feels that he
didn't perform before the people like he would have liked to,''
trainer Mendez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a time when we have to forget about the people. We
appreciate them, but we can't let them cause us to get away from
our game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paulie will learn. It comes from experience _ experience in
fighting these big fights like this.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was told what Ayala had said about ``needing more
knockouts,'' Mendez winced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a beautiful boxer, a wonderful body puncher,'' Mendez
said. ``He does everything just like it's supposed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't consider him a knockout puncher. What Paulie does
is throw so many punches, he wears you down. And once he wears you
down and has you hurt, that's when he has a chance to knock you
out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, after being knocked down in the second round,
Bredahl seemed equally determined not to give Ayala that chance.
His jab-and-run became more a game of run-and-jab. CompuBox, the
computerized punch tally, tried to claim that Bredahl threw 517
jabs and _ more incredibly - missed on 444 of them.
</P>
<P>
   The sunglasses that Ayala donned after the final bell were to
shade a developing puffiness around his left eye, an injury that
Paulie said was caused when the two fighters butted heads. Other
than that, the only damage that Ayala showed was that he had gotten
his new title crumpled.
</P>
<P>
   It had, indeed, been a whirl of a weekend for the Fighter of the
Year. He had returned to Vegas as a headliner. There was a
bantamweight title belt to keep in the family. There were friends
in the stands and an audience of pay-per-view customers.
</P>
<P>
   So he swung for the fences.
</P>
<P>
   And learned a humbling lesson?

IN MARCH, MID-MAJOR CHAMPS MOVE INTO SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ All or nothing. That's what mid-major
conference tournaments are. Teams that win go to the NCAA
Tournament. Teams that lose pull their jerseys over their heads and
go home to watch on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson Patterson had a whole lot of nothing the past two years.
Two trips to the Southern Conference tournament final produced two
oh-so-close losses. After last year's loss to College of Charleston
_ the Mountaineers let a lead slip away in the final six minutes _
Patterson asked permission to wear his game jersey home over spring
break. He wanted to remind himself how bad it felt to lose.
</P>
<P>
   So there was Patterson, with the ball, dribbling out the final
seconds of yesterday's Southern Conference championship game. Alone
near midcourt, Patterson leaned toward referee Steve Gordon and
said, ``I finally did it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The referee came up to me before the game and wished me luck,
told me he thought I had been a good player for four years,''
Patterson, a 5-foot-9 senior guard, said. ``I told him that I hoped
today was going to be different ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two years hurt so bad. We were right there. Both
times you could feel that dream just being snatched away.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson and his Appalachian State teammates provide one of
those stories that makes the NCAA Tournament an event like no
other. The Mountaineers' 68-56 victory over College of Charleston _
a fitting turn of irony, there _ gave them the Southern
Conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   And never mind that 23-8 Appalachian State, making its first
NCAA Tournament appearance since 1979, probably will be paired with
an Ohio State, a Tennessee or an Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team there's no better feeling than playing in the
NCAA Tournament,'' Appalachian State coach Buzz Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson knows. He played on four NCAA Tournament teams at North
Carolina and was a member of the Tar Heels' 1982 national
champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came time to cut the nets down, we kind of looked
around. Nobody knew what to do, except me. I could kind of
orchestrate that,'' said Peterson, making a scissors motion with
his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's roommate for two seasons at North Carolina wore No.
23. Hit the game-winning shot in the 1982 title game. Name of
Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   That had been Robert Bower Peterson's claim to fame. Now, in
four seasons under Peterson, Appalachian State has won more games
(79) than in any other four-year span. Peterson, who briefly
accepted the Southwest Missouri State job before reconsidering, is
one of the nation's hot young coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this was going to be a special team when I decided to
stay here last spring,'' Peterson said. ``I thought this team could
get to the NCAA Tournament. When that moment came, when we knew we
were going, it's like a thousand pounds off your back.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked like the weight of the past would wear down the
Mountaineers, who trailed 29-28 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't harp on what had happened the last two years, there
wasn't any Knute Rockne stuff,'' Peterson said. ``But when we were
walking out, I looked at Tyson and told him, `Look, you take us
home from here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me of my old roommate. They both have got big ol'
hearts. Michael would get that look in his eye that he would just
not be denied. I've seen that from Tyson the last few weeks. He's
become a leader this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Appalachian State missed 15 of its first 20 shots to start the
second half. But then, sixth man Rufus Leach made a 3-pointer from
the corner to give Appalachian State a 46-43 lead with 7:36 to
play. That, coupled with undeniable defense, sparked a 17-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars missed eight of nine shots and with 1:13 remaining
the Mountaineers had a 60-45 lead. Patterson had six points during
the game-turning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had lost, I was going home. I didn't have next year to
look forward to,'' said Patterson, who has played with broken
finger on his right hand since Feb. 9. ``I told the guys, some of
you can come back next year, but I have no more next years.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson finished with 21 points and added the Southern
Conference tournament most outstanding player trophy to his player
of the year award. As he walked off the floor following the awards
ceremony, he pointed upward. His grandmother died last week;
Patterson dedicated yesterday's game to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an entertaining point guard for everyone but the
opposition,'' said College of Charleston coach John Kresse, who
started campaigning for a National Invitation Tournament bid for
his 24-6 team.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-major losers wait _ hope _ for the NIT. Teams like the
Mountaineers wait for next Sunday, when they'll see their name,
opponent and travel destination flash on the television screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to skip school to watch the NCAA Tournament,'' said
senior forward Cedrick Holmes, whose 10 rebounds helped smallish
Appalachian State scrap to a 40-37 rebounding edge. ``Going to the
NCAAs is a dream I've always had and it's special to finally go.
Coach said it would change our lives if we didn't go.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes was sitting in the locker room at the BiLo Center,
clutching the game ball, a net and the tournament trophy. A few
minutes later, a team manager brought in the Southern Conference
regular-season conference trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``More hardware, more hardware,'' someone shouted.
</P>
<P>
   All the hardware. None of the heartache.

MORE DIVISION OF FAMILY SERVICES WORKERS ARE IN SCHOOLS TO PREVENT
CHILD ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 DONNA McGUIRE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ One morning a week, Christina Esteban carries
her laptop computer into Garcia Elementary School, checks her box
for messages, chats with the school nurse and heads to a small
conference room she uses as an office.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission: preventing child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   So far, referrals from school staff have been scarce. But
Esteban began visiting only a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the teachers are just becoming familiar with the idea
that I will be there,'' said Esteban, one of two Missouri Division
of Family Services workers recently assigned part time to schools
in the Kansas City School District.
</P>
<P>
   After 8-year-old brothers Larry and Gary Bass died of child
abuse and neglect last October, Kansas City School Superintendent
Benjamin Demps called for state social workers to be placed in
every district school.
</P>
<P>
   That has not happened. Instead, the district and the family
services division began discussing which schools would benefit
most.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools are so small or untroubled by abuse that they do
not need workers, Demps now says. But he still favors family
services being in most schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nexus of this thing is the child,'' said Demps, a former
social services director in Oklahoma. ``The child coming to school
brings his or her life with him. If there is difficulty, the
teacher can see it. We will have the Division of Family Services
right there to begin working on the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeannie Jones, who oversees child welfare in Jackson County for
family services, expects to assign at least three more staff
members to Kansas City schools in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They will join a growing number of workers assigned to county
schools. The total number has about tripled since last fall, with
20 family services staff members now spending time at 25 schools in
10 districts.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to prevent children from being harmed.
</P>
<P>
   The state workers learn about problems through teachers,
counselors and administrators then discuss those issues with the
family. In most cases, a call to the child abuse hot line is
avoided.
</P>
<P>
   If a child has severe problems with anger control, the worker
might recommend mental-health resources. If a parent does not know
proper discipline, a worker can discuss discipline options.
Parenting classes sometimes are recommended.
</P>
<P>
   If a child is often truant, the worker contacts a parent to
learn why. If it turns out the child has lice, the worker tells the
parent how to kill the lice and where to get the proper shampoo. If
the family is apathetic toward education, the worker explains that,
by law, the child must attend school.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Harvey, one of the more senior of the school-based family
services staff, has been at Ingels Elementary School in the Hickman
Mills School District for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she observes children in class. Sometimes, she calls
or visits a child's home. Sometimes, parents come to school to
discuss the child's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families are starting to see me as somebody working with them
and not against them,'' Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   One parent who didn't know how to handle a situation called
Harvey for advice. Another, unable to manage an out-of-control
teen-ager, called for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't happen right away,'' Harvey said of parents seeking
her assistance. ``At first, they are going to be suspicious of
DFS.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's supervisor, Rebecca Thomas, has encouraged the Center
and Grandview districts to accept family services workers,
especially in neighborhoods experiencing high numbers of abuse and
calls to the neglect hot line. Most of those workers moved into
schools in December.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotes told in staff meetings are encouraging, Thomas says.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a school knew of long-term neglect problems with a
family. When family services first got involved, it thought the
problems were recent _ until told otherwise. Because the situation
was chronic, family services sought court permission to remove the
children from the home. Without the school's input, that would not
have happened, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, potentially severe situations have been stopped
before they escalated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Keimig, a Grandview administrator, is eager to see if
child-abuse reports decline after family services workers have been
in the schools for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worked out well thus far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Hattie King has dealt with three student
situations in her first month at Troost Elementary School. A week
ago, she also began visiting Westport Edison Middle Academy, a
district charter school.
</P>
<P>
   Family services drew criticism for not helping the Bass brothers
after receiving a hot line call from a relative last August. Their
mother, Mary Bass, allegedly told the school and the family
services division that the boys no longer lived with her. A
division worker who visited the home in August or September
apparently never saw the two boys.
</P>
<P>
   Larry and Gary had attended three schools in four years. Each
time they transferred, they left behind teachers familiar with
their hunger problems.
</P>
<P>
   They seldom appeared at school in the fall 1999 term. Instead,
they were locked in the bedroom while their triplet brother and
older siblings headed off to class daily.
</P>
<P>
   Would family services at school have saved the Bass brothers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to speculate on that,'' Demps said.

FAMILY ASSUMES DINER RESPONSIBILITIES AFTER OWNER DIES 
</HEADLINE>

 TRISHA L. HOWARD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For years, Debby Raines dreamed about opening
her own diner.
</P>
<P>
   Until her sons, Darin and Dustin, were grown, she waited tables
and saved for a restaurant of her own. Five years ago, she used
about $20,000 to open Debby's Diner on U.S. 40 near Phelps Road on
the Kansas City-Independence border.
</P>
<P>
   She loved the work _ loved talking to the customers while she
took their orders, or sitting down to chat with them when the
orders slowed.
</P>
<P>
   But last fall, Raines' dream ended _ and a new dream began to
take shape.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 11, Raines, 47, died in a car wreck near her restaurant.
Apparently, she had suffered a heart attack, which led to the
accident, said her husband, David.
</P>
<P>
   Now the dream rests in the hands of David and Dustin Raines.
Just three weeks after Debby died, the two men reopened Debby's
Diner.
</P>
<P>
   This month, David Raines must decide whether to renew the
restaurant's lease. Even though Dustin and David Raines aren't
experienced restaurateurs, they say they can't close Debby's Diner.
There's just too much of Debby Raines there.
</P>
<P>
   David Raines has spent most of his working life in an
18-wheeler. He describes himself as a quiet guy who doesn't mind
solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, before Debby Raines' death, he would pitch in at the
diner, washing dishes, cleaning tables or working the cash
register.
</P>
<P>
   Debby Raines had asked him to do more. She was working 80 to 90
hours a week and planning to open a second restaurant. She already
had recruited 25-year-old Dustin Raines to take over some
responsibilities, in hopes that someday she could pass the business
to him.
</P>
<P>
   David Raines' trucking business made more money than Debby's
Diner, and he wanted to add to their savings. He was on the road
when he got the call that his wife had died.
</P>
<P>
   He has set the trucking business aside. He sold one truck,
parked another in the lot beside the diner and found someone else
to drive the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I was trying to build for us, work for our
retirement,'' Raines said. ``Now that's not important to me
anymore. I felt like I needed to open the diner back up. It was an
emotional call, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The first week the 48-seat diner reopened was ``like a wake,''
said Michael Stevens, one of the restaurant's regular customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The servers were all crying. Half the customers were crying,''
Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the restaurant, customers left flowers and wreaths.
Cards and letters poured in as people offered condolences. Almost
800 people attended her funeral, David Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding to keep the diner open was easy. Learning the
restaurant business has been harder.
</P>
<P>
   A few times, the diner has run out of hash browns, catfish _
items that ``you can't run out of, because it's on the menu,''
Dustin Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Kline, who eats breakfast at the diner almost every morning,
jokes about the time that Dustin Raines forgot to put eggs in a
cake, or about David Raines graduating from ``Busing Tables 101.''
But Kline admires the men for carrying on without Debby Raines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debby seemed to be here all the time,'' Kline said. ``That's
what impressed me most about her, that she was a hard worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys made a real hard effort in picking things up and
moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Raines has taken control of the books, logging the day's
receipts and bills on his computer every night, figuring the
payroll on Sunday afternoons, drawing up the next week's work
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   David Raines has gotten a crash-course in restaurant management:
ordering food and trying to balance the diner's overhead with its
profits so he and Dustin Raines can make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Both men put in 60 to 70 hours a week. They say it is time well
spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps me, even being here today,'' Dustin Raines said.
``When I'm here, I feel like my mom is with me. She's watching over
what I do.''

KANSAS CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL FIGHT TO REGAIN FULL
ACCREDITATION, DEMPS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Kansas City School District will do what
it takes to attain not just provisional accreditation but full
accreditation and ``even that A-plus rating'' that is so desirable,
Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr. said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In a forum at All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church, Demps
talked about how the district has changed since he arrived in
August and where he plans to take it. About 100 persons attended
the hourlong event, which included questions from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do now is move forward,'' away from a
district that has been controlled by a court to one that is
controlled by its citizens, Demps said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does this mean for us?'' he asked. ``It means there is a
tremendous amount of work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in Kansas City, Demps said, he was astonished to
see administrators bypass him on decisions and go straight to the
court-appointed desegregation monitoring committee instead. He also
was surprised that school principals weren't more involved in
running the district.
</P>
<P>
   One of Demps' goals was to change that situation and he said he
has had some success. The principals are more involved now in
decision making.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to change because we have to deliver a better
education to our children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Demps said the state board of education's decision
to strip the district of accreditation beginning May 1 presents ``a
very difficult challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But the district is engaged in a major effort to train its
teachers on how to best teach students in the core curriculum
classes, he said. The teachers will teach the students, the
district will test the students, and the test results will show
where gaps in learning remain, Demps said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the district will work with the teachers again in the areas
where gaps remain, he said, and the cycle will continue until state
test scores reach acceptable standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers at large are very pleased that someone is
bringing them something to deal with this situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The district also instituted Saturday school to give students a
better chance to boost scores. The effort is going well, Demps
said, and he expects it will continue in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The district will have two years to improve its test scores and
make other changes to regain accreditation. If it does not meet
state standards by then, it could face a state takeover, division
into smaller districts or other changes.
</P>
<P>
   Demps said he was concerned about the teacher shortage that the
district and schools nationwide face. He said he also was concerned
about the influx of charter schools, which he thinks is happening
too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen charter schools have authorization to operate in the
district and more schools want to go that way, Demps said. ``I'm
not saying, `Don't do it,' I'm saying, `Do it with a little more
thought.'''
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, Demps said he expected to hire a deputy
superintendent within a week. And he said he was working on a plan
that would keep suspended students in a school-type setting instead
of sending them home with nothing to do.

LENEXA TEENS SET EXAMPLE FOR PEERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 MIKE HENDRICKS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's column concerns two teen-agers. Their names are Brian
Scott and Pat Smith.
</P>
<P>
   They're accused of no crime. They shot no one. Neither is
neglected nor abused.
</P>
<P>
   I guess that's why I like this story. It's unusual.
</P>
<P>
   It's about good kids doing something for their peers and their
community. Not that there aren't plenty of others out there making
a difference. It's just that you don't hear about that very often
on the nightly news or read about it on the front page of the
morning paper.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the focus is on teen-agers and drugs. On students who
bring guns to school. On kids who kill or get killed. The children
of irresponsible parents who ought never to have had offspring. The
sons and daughters of caring moms and dads who simply can't figure
out where they went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like me, those stories are numbing. They make the next
generation seem hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't. Brian and Pat are proof of that.
</P>
<P>
   They're both seniors at St. Thomas Aquinas High School. Each
fall, their social studies teacher, Matt Brungardt, gives students
an assignment:
</P>
<P>
   Describe a community need and take steps to meet it.
</P>
<P>
   This teaches the public process. Teens research their topic,
maybe make a few phone calls or attend a public meeting. Seldom,
however, does anything come of these little campaigns to, perhaps,
add a street light or put up another stop sign.
</P>
<P>
   This year was different. Brian and Pat got results.
</P>
<P>
   The devoted skateboarders decided that what their hometown of
Lenexa really needed was a first-class park for skateboarders and
Rollerbladers in Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there's no place to skate,'' Pat, 18, told the
Lenexa Parks and Recreation Board last week. ``Except at
businesses, strip center parking lots, but they kick us out. It
kind of gives skateboarders a bad rep.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, Lenexa poured a square of concrete and called
that a skateboard park, but it's flat and lifeless as a fast-food
hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   Which explains the title of 17-year-old Brian's paper: ``What
good is a skatepark without any ramps?''
</P>
<P>
   Brian and Pat researched other skateboard parks. They compared
safety records and reviewed insurance industry views on the topic.
Then they arranged to speak before the City Council, which was so
impressed with their polite presentation the park board was
directed to see what it would take to build a first-class facility.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's board meeting, several dozen kids and their
parents spoke or offered support for the idea. There is now a good
chance a skate park will be near the top of Lenexa's capital
improvement budget later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the city might have gone ahead on its own eventually.
But it took Brian and Pat to get things rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would not have happened as quickly'' without them,
said Bill Nicks, parks director.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' parents are impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think it's pretty great that I'm getting involved with my
community,'' Brian said.
</P>
<P>
   Says Pat's mom, Susan Smith: ``I'm proud of the boys for
stepping out. Their efforts are going to benefit the younger kids
more than themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Initiative. Community spirit. Courtesy. Respect. Selflessness
rather than pure self interest.
</P>
<P>
   That teen-agers such as Brian and Pat exhibit those qualities
may not be big news.
</P>
<P>
   But it ought to be.

FURYK STEALS DORAL TITLE WITH WOODS-LIKE RALLY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For Jim Furyk, a seemingly impossible situation became
an improbable victory. For Franklin Langham, an almost certain
triumph became a haunting defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a six-stroke lead with seven holes to play, Langham was
overtaken by Furyk, one of golf's most consistent players, who saw
an opening and struck like a cobra.
</P>
<P>
   Furyk birdied five of the last seven holes to finish the
Doral-Ryder Open like a tornado, blowing past a shocked Langham,
who stumbled just enough to ensure his doom. One minute Langham was
sitting pretty, in position to capture his first victory on the PGA
Tour. But two hours later Furyk was holding the trophy, while
Langham tried to explain how his lead had dissolved like an
Alka-Seltzer tablet in water.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a remarkable 30 on the back nine of the Blue Monster,
and capturing the most dramatic victory of his career, Furyk shot a
final-round 65 to win by two strokes over Langham, who bogeyed
three of the final seven holes.
</P>
<P>
   Furyk finished 23 under par (265), tying the tournament record
set by Greg Norman in 1993. Langham shot 70 to finish at 21 under
par, and Nick Price finished third at 18 under par after Sunday's
final-round 67. David Duval and Shigeki Maruyama of Japan tied for
fourth place at 17 under par.
</P>
<P>
   When Langham reached the 12th tee leading by six strokes, almost
everyone at the Doral Golf Resort and Spa thought the tournament
belonged to him. However, Furyk knew better. Last month at Pebble
Beach, Calif., Furyk played with Tiger Woods in the final round,
when Woods won by overcoming a seven-stroke deficit with seven
holes to play. Having witnessed that dramatic comeback, and having
experienced two Ryder Cups and many high-pressure situations, Furyk
figured anything could happen. And he was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't believe it's possible, it's definitely not going
to happen,'' said Furyk, who posted his fifth career victory and
won $540,000. ``If you had told me Tiger was going to win Pebble
Beach standing on the 15th tee, I would have laughed at you.
Afterward I told myself that he won that event because he really
believed that he still could. Standing on the 12th tee today, if I
didn't believe I could shoot 30 on the back side, or didn't believe
I could win, it wouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Furyk's comeback started when he birdied the par-5 No. 12 to cut
his deficit to five. That was followed by a crucial two-shot swing
at No. 13, which Furyk birdied and Langham bogeyed, leaving Langham
with a three-stroke lead. Then Langham bogeyed No. 14, missing a
5-foot par putt, and his lead was down to two. Then at the par-3,
175-yard No. 15, Furyk hit a terrific 6-iron tee shot within 3 feet
and made the easy putt to cut Langham's lead to one.
</P>
<P>
   Langham still led by one stroke with two holes remaining, but he
lost his lead at No. 17, and then lost the tournament at No. 18.
Langham's tee shot on the par-4 No. 17 lodged in the collar between
the fairway and the rough, and his next shot sailed well right of
the green. Furyk reached the green in two shots, and one could
almost sense Langham's heart pounding as he faced a difficult up
and down for par. Langham hit a weak flop shot that cleared a
bunker, but the ball failed to reach the green, and then his chip
shot from 22 feet stopped just short of the hole. After Langham
tapped in for bogey, he and Furyk were tied. Then Furyk delivered a
crushing blow, making a 20-foot birdie putt that gave him a
one-shot lead with one hole to play.
</P>
<P>
   Both players hit good drives at No. 18, the fabled finishing
hole of the Blue Monster. Then Furyk hit another decisive shot, a
7-iron approach shot within 7 feet of the pin. Langham showed
character by hitting a strong approach shot as well, within 10
feet, but soon it was over. Langham needed to make his putt for
birdie at No. 18 to have any hope of forcing a playoff. But Langham
missed his putt left, and as the ball rolled past the hole, he bent
over in disappointment. Moments later, Furyk made the birdie putt
for good measure, then offered his condolences to Langham, who will
have to wait for his first victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm standing here 10 years from now and hadn't won yet,
then it would be devastating,'' said Langham, a 31-year-old from
Augusta, Ga. ``I'm only in my fourth year on tour. My time will
come. I've heard a lot of guys say the first win is the toughest.
I'm disappointed but not disheartened.''
</P>
<P>
   Furyk savored a special victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that under pressure, that is the best nine holes
I've played on tour,'' said Furyk, who has finished no lower than
12th on the money list the past three years. ``It feels great.''

LONG ISLAND HOLDING CO. MAKES OFFER FOR DIME BANCORP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   North Fork Bancorp, a fast-growing bank holding company on Long
Island, N.Y., made an unsolicited offer Sunday night to buy Dime
Bancorp, the parent of the Dime Savings Bank of New York, for $17 a
share, a 41 percent premium over Friday's closing price of Dime's
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which has some deep-pockets backing from FleetBoston,
would make North Fork the fourth-largest retail bank in the New
York metropolitan area, trailing Citibank, Chase Manhattan and
FleetBoston.
</P>
<P>
   The offer comes less than two weeks before Dime shareholders are
scheduled to vote on a proposed merger with Hudson United Bancorp
of Mahwah, N.J. North Fork's offer is contingent on Dime
shareholders rejecting that merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to own the Dime and we think our offer shows we are
serious,'' said John A. Kanas, president, chairman and chief
executive of North Fork, which is based in Melville, N.Y., and
operates 154 branches in the New York metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Dime did not respond to calls made Sunday night to the homes of
Lawrence J. Toal, the company's chief executive, and three other
Dime executives. Kenneth T. Nielson, chief executive of Hudson,
said Sunday night that he had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Dime shareholders would receive 0.9302 share of North Fork plus
$2 cash for each Dime share, Kanas said Sunday night. Based on the
$16.25-a-share price for North Fork stock on Friday, that values
the offer at $17 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of both Dime and Hudson have fallen since they announced
their merger plans on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Dime have fallen $4.25, to $12.9375, since Sept. 15, a
25 percent decline. Hudson shares have fallen $7.74, to $20.0625,
over the same period, a 28 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   North Fork bought 700,000 Dime shares, 0.6 percent of those
outstanding last year, for $19 a share, indicating it has lost $4.2
million in the value of that investment.
</P>
<P>
   Kanas said his bank's larger dividend and rapid growth should be
attractive to Dime shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   North Fork pays a dividend of 4.5 percent, based on Friday's
stock price, compared with 1.9 percent for Dime. And North Fork's
dividend growth rate over the last five years has been twice that
of Dime.
</P>
<P>
   North Fork earned $1.62 a share last year, up from $1.18 in
1998, a 37 percent increase, while Dime reported earnings per share
of $2.17, up from $2.09, an increase of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dime has $23 billion in assets, more than twice as many as North
Fork, yet the total value of its stock is half that of North
Fork's, an indication that the market rates the future prospects of
North Forks more highly.
</P>
<P>
   The $2-a-share cash payment to Dime shareholders is being
financed by a $250 million investment in North Fork by FleetBoston,
which is buying preferred stock that can be converted to common
stock and sold if the share price hits certain targets.
</P>
<P>
   If the transaction is completed, FleetBoston will also acquire
17 Dime branches with $2 billion in deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet would also acquire an option on 7.5 million North Fork
shares at $17.88, a price that is 10 percent higher than Friday's
closing stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson United would receive a $50 million breakup fee if Dime
shareholders reject the merger and accept the North Fork offer
instead. &QL;

WHITE SOX' FRANK THOMAS STARTS THE SPRING WITH A CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ The 1998 season was the worst of his career;
1999 was even worse. The 2000 season is still four weeks away, and
already it has been a bad year for him.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a few days early in spring training, Frank
Thomas had an on-field confrontation with his manager followed by a
two-hour, closed-door meeting that was punctuated by shouting; he
was criticized by former teammates; and he had his business
interests dissected and denigrated.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, to be young and an awesome slugger again, the object of
widespread admiration and appreciation. Maybe Thomas' reputation
will be restored in baseball circles this year, but it will
probably take the type of performance the Chicago White Sox saw in
his first seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still Frank Thomas, sometimes good, sometimes bad,'' he
said recently, sitting at his locker at Tucson Electric Park. ``If
guys are on first and third all the time, I have a chance to do a
lot of damage. If no one's on, if they're walking me, I can't
control that. But I will be much more prepared to hit the mistakes
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't prepared for the volatile start to his spring, though.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth day of Chicago's full-squad workouts, Thomas
declined to participate in a shuttle running drill, triggering a
heated exchange with Manager Jerry Manuel in full view of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't know the whole truth,'' Thomas said. ``He thought I
didn't want to do certain things, but that wasn't it. I wasn't
healthy. It was a shuttle drill, but I wasn't able to do it and he
had no clue. It was a misunderstanding and we got through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel acknowledged that he had been unaware of the extent of
the surgery Thomas had on his right ankle and a toe on his right
foot last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was more my fault than his,'' Manuel said. ``If anything,
the communication wasn't good. When you get into a setting where
you got to have communication, lots of things come out. That's what
that was about.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, somebody said, ``and while we're at it,'' and
the conversation deteriorated quickly. They retreated to Manuel's
office and remained there for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was more positive than anything else,'' the
manager said. ``I think he took it the same way. People said you
were yelling and yelling. It wasn't yelling at each other. It was
yelling of an issue. It wasn't `I'm going to knock your head off,'
`I'm going to knock yours off.' It was `It's this way,' `No, it's
this way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas played down the confrontational nature of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens in any professional sport,'' he said. ``Men will
be men. I'm a 32-year-old man almost. Jerry's 40-something. If you
got a dispute, you handle it the way we should have, in a
closed-door meeting. I'm not a kid anymore. I'm going to voice my
opinion, especially when I see things that aren't right. We cleared
the air, and we're much better men now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 26 incident, however, sparked a torrent of reports. The
Chicago Tribune, for example, canvassed former teammates of Thomas
and received mainly negative responses. Ozzie Guillen and Jaime
Navarro were particularly critical of Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen said Thomas ``wanted to be the man but he doesn't know
how,'' and he criticized him for not being a good role model on the
field for younger players and for having nothing to do with his
teammates. Navarro said Thomas' encounter with the manager didn't
surprise him because he ``likes to do things his own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did Thomas think players criticized him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think professional jealousy has something to do with it,''
he said. ``I've achieved, I've achieved, I've achieved. You're
going to get professional jealousy when one guy keeps making things
happen, making a certain amount of money, having a lifestyle
different than theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the comments hurt him?
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to consider the source,'' he said. ``You're not going
to like everyone you play with; everyone's not going to like you.
Ozzie is one that I never even worry about. He talked trash when he
was here. He's always been a talker. He has that type of
personality. You take everything he says with a grain of salt.
Jaime Navarro, I was a little shocked because I was in his corner
the whole time. He struggled just about as I did the last couple
years. But I was always with him. I was shocked he said those
things. When I see him, I'll have words with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was not upset with comments by Robin Ventura. They were
more explanatory than critical. Ventura said Thomas lived a
fishbowl existence and with his lusty hitting created greater
expectations than other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin made some good comments,'' Thomas said. ``Robin has
known me from Day 1. Maybe I focused on my off-the-field music a
little bit, but that has nothing to do with my baseball
performance. Pitchers adjusted to me the last couple of years, and
that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas batted better than .300 in each of his first eight
seasons, reaching at least .347 three times in a four-season span.
In 1998 he batted .265. Except for his first season, 1990, in which
he played only 60 games, Thomas drove in more than 100 runs each
year and hit 24 or more home runs, six times exceeding 30, three
times 40. Last season he hit 15 home runs and drove in 77 runs.

<P>
   ``It's somewhat surprising, just because he had some
unbelievable years, really,'' Ventura said recently at the Mets'
camp in Port St. Lucie. ``But there are other things that go on in
a person's life, and I think he had a lot going on. Maybe he wasn't
really in tune the way he was the first six years. I think that had
a little bit to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The downturn in Thomas' career was accompanied last year by the
stance he took on his position in the latter part of the season. A
first baseman by trade, he said he didn't want to play first; he
wanted to be the team's designated hitter. Even though statistics
showed that he hit better when he played first, he wound up playing
there in 49 games and was the DH in 82 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a team that was rebuilding,'' he said by way of
explanation. ``There's no need for me to be playing first base
every day with a rebuilding team. We had a couple guys much better
at first than me, and I wasn't getting regular rotation in
practice. I wasn't prepared to deal with that. First base has never
been easy for me. That's something I have to work on day in and day
out to feel comfortable in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   An official with another club said he heard that Thomas' desire
to be the DH was attributed to his outside businesses. Thomas, it
was said, would go to the clubhouse between times at bat to conduct
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Thomas said firmly. ``My ex-teammates are
making comments. Why didn't they make comments while they were
here?''
</P>
<P>
   This year, he added, he expected he would alternate between his
two positions. But his stance last season only added to his
reputation in the clubhouse as a selfish player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in this game is selfish,'' Thomas said. ``It's a
team game, but it's an individual sport. I don't worry about
anybody saying I'm selfish. The same guys are selfish themselves or
they wouldn't be making these comments. It takes a real small
person to talk about others in the media.''

</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who was a teammate of Thomas for nine years, sounded
sympathetic, explaining that Thomas has been the star of the team
and therefore has borne the brunt of the fans' reaction to the
team's decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a tough time,'' the Mets' third baseman said.
``Michael was playing for the Bulls, and Frank was putting up
numbers similar to what Michael was doing in basketball. But we
hadn't won, so he wasn't really at the level of Michael. People
were critical of him because they kind of looked at him that way.
It's a tough deal for him, really. He's kind of in a fishbowl.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the beating he has taken as the focal point, Thomas
wants to stay with the White Sox. Early last season, when he was
the only veteran player and the team did not show great promise, he
said he wanted to finish his career with the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel that way,'' he said nearly a year later.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' address, however, almost changed last year. In a
little-known development, the Yankees put in a claim for him when
the White Sox put him on waivers as a routine move. The Yankees
didn't want Thomas, but they claimed him to block him from possibly
going to a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox were furious over the claim and threatened to let
the Yankees have him and his mammoth contract. Letting Yankees
officials sweat, the White Sox waited until an hour before the
deadline to pull Thomas back.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the early spring turmoil, Thomas appears to be unfazed
and undeterred in his determination to return to his productive
years. Marital problems affected his focus in 1998, he said; his
ankle and foot injuries prevented him from balancing himself at the
plate properly in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel said Thomas hasn't adjusted to the adjustments pitchers
have made to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have changed,'' Thomas said. ``Guys would pound me in,
and get me out away. Or pound me away to get me out in. But the
past couple years they pounded me in, in, in consistently. Guys
haven't been giving in as much. That's going to change because we
have so many good hitters in the lineup. I'll get my shots. I'm
going out with the same goal every day _ that's to be sound
fundamentally with my mechanics, be patient and make things
happen.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: THOSE GOP ATTACK ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, March 6:
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to stimulating voter education and participation,
there is a clear civic value to lively, hotly contested campaigns.
For that reason, the strike zone for the rhetoric and advertising
used by candidates should be a wide one. Particularly in close
races, the candidates need room to hammer away at one another's
weaknesses, and this page has never been quick to denigrate tough
campaigning as negative campaigning. However, the tactics being
employed by supporters of Gov. George W. Bush against Sen. John
McCain should be of serious concern to every New Yorker in regard
to the integrity of politics in this state and in regard to the
nation's inadequate campaign-finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the state was blanketed with purportedly independent
television ads attacking McCain's environmental record and
exaggerating Bush's accomplishments in cleaning up air pollution in
Texas. Only loud press and public complaints about the secret
sponsorship of the $2.5 million ad campaign that also ran in
California and Ohio brought out the fact that the money came from a
wealthy Texas friend of the Bush family and the equally intriguing
news that the ads were placed through an advertising agency with
ties to Gov. George Pataki of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's contention that these attack ads paid for by Sam Wyly, a
Texas software billionaire, and his family are a happy accident
cries out for investigation by the Federal Election Commission.
Wyly and his brother, Charles, raised more than $200,000 for Bush's
gubernatorial campaigns, and Charles Wyly belongs to the
``Pioneers,'' the core fund-raisers behind Bush's $60 million
presidential campaign budget. And how, one wonders, did Wyly know
to seek out a firm that had done work for Pataki in putting up
these ``independent ads''?
</P>
<P>
   The New York primary will be long over before the slow-moving
FEC gets around to investigating whether there was illegal
coordination between the Bush campaign and Wyly. But setting that
question aside, the situation points up a fundamental flaw in the
nation's election laws. Congress' intent in the Federal Election
Campaign Act was to regulate expenditures for campaign ads in the
period just before an election. But in 1996, both the Clinton and
Dole campaigns used party funds, raised through unregulated soft
money from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals, to get
around the spending limits on ads. They did this by running ads
that left out the magic words ``vote for,'' but that any reasonable
viewer would recognize as promoting the sponsoring group's
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   This subterfuge represents a serious threat to the integrity of
future elections. The vast majority of Americans, as well as
candidates of character, abide by the $1,000 limits on direct
campaign contributions and the attendant limitations on advertising
expenditures by a candidate. But as McCain pointed out Sunday,
allowing wealthy individuals to flood the airwaves with ads
promoting their chosen candidates in the final days of a campaign
``distorts the process'' and gives a small class of wealthy
Americans a financial license to sway close elections without being
accountable to the public. The immediate answer to this problem is
simple.
</P>
<P>
   All political advertising that clearly attacks or endorses a
candidate close to Election Day, whether sponsored by candidates
themselves or third parties, needs to come under the same rules for
contributions, expenditures and public disclosure that govern the
candidates' ads. And in the long run, the country needs full public
financing.
</P>
<P>
   This page has endorsed McCain, but our view would be the same if
he, not Bush, were the beneficiary of this unethical and very
possibly illegal ad campaign. We are also dismayed by Pataki's
attempt to take New York back to the age of machine politics. What
we are seeing here is the second act in Pataki's attempt to rob New
York's Republican voters of their right to help choose the party's
nominee. First, the governor tried to keep McCain off the ballot,
and he and Bush abandoned that plan only when New York's
Communist-style election became a national joke. After that trick
failed, Pataki gave his blessing to the Wyly ads and to radio
commercials that dishonestly portray McCain as an opponent of
breast-cancer research. This kind of dirty politics has surely
erased Pataki's chances of being on the national ticket, but it
remains a mystery as to why he wants to erase entirely his chances
of being remembered as a progressive leader.

EDITORIAL: GREENSPAN'S NEW ECONOMICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 6:
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Alan Greenspan has gained worldwide acclaim for his
cautious stewardship of the Federal Reserve System. But in recent
testimony before Congress, Greenspan unveiled some unorthodox
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that a high rate of productivity growth _ something
economists usually regard as an unmitigated blessing _ has a nasty
downside, actually encouraging inflation. He also suggested that
the Fed might need to raise interest rates again to keep stock
prices from rising too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the chairman's normally ardent admirers, especially on
Capitol Hill, were taken aback. His fears about productivity seemed
overdrawn. So did his fixation on stock prices. The critics have a
point.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have generally thought that the impact of the stock
market on the economy was small. But Greenspan argues otherwise. He
starts with the fact that productivity _ output per worker _ has
been rising quickly in recent years. That means there are more
goods and services for people to buy, a situation that ordinarily
is thought to put downward pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
   But he says high productivity can also drive prices up by
creating an expectation among investors that corporate earnings
will rise. High corporate earnings drive up stock prices, enriching
consumers who own stock and inducing them to spend more. This then
adds to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly a novel argument. But there are not many
economists who will buy it. The simple reason is that there is no
evidence to support the claim that productivity does more to raise
prices than reduce them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Greenspan's remarks suggested to some observers that
the Fed might need to raise interest rates in order to prevent
stock prices from rising faster than household income, possibly
sparking an inflationary burst in consumption. In this case,
Greenspan appears to be giving too much weight to one cause of
inflationary pressure, and not an especially important one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan does not need these novel arguments. The economy grew
at a 7 percent annual rate toward the end of last year, a rate most
economists deem unsustainable. For that reason alone, Greenspan can
justify raising rates to slow the economy.

GORE CRITICIZES BUSH'S USE OF `SPECIAL INTERESTS' MONEY
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: UPDATES with Gore appearing with Mrs. Clinton in Manhattan on
Sunday night; adds response from Bush campaign; pickup graf bgng,
Gore made the remarks ...) 
 (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRANSTON, R.I. _ Turning his sights on the Republicans, Vice
President Al Gore criticized Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on
campaign finance issues Sunday, saying he was flooding the campaign
with soft money and suggested that if Bush wins the Republican
nomination, he might not have won it fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore raised those themes for the first time Sunday in Rhode
Island, and repeated them Sunday night in New York in an appearance
with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who holds a wide lead in polls over former Sen. Bill
Bradley in virtually every state where Democrats will vote on
Tuesday, was responding to reports that Bush's supporters were
spending millions of unrestricted dollars on ads attacking McCain
on environmental issues. The ads are running in New York,
California and Ohio, the three states with the biggest number of
delegates at stake in the Super Tuesday contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Governor Bush defeats John McCain in some of these contests
on Tuesday, this will raise serious questions about whether he did
so fair and square,'' Gore said as he spoke at a senior citizens
forum in Cranston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of the four candidates have endorsed campaign finance
reform,'' Gore said, in one of his hardest-hitting statements in
days. ``Governor Bush has not. And now we see the one candidate who
has not called for a ban on soft money using soft money in this
contest that will take place on Tuesday. We knew that Governor Bush
was in the hip pocket of the special interests; now we find what a
deep pocket that is _ $2.5 million all of a sudden flooding into
these contests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that it's wrong to flood soft money in these
contests,'' Gore added. ``I stand with Bill Bradley, with John
McCain and with the vast majority of the American people in saying
it is time to have meaningful campaign finance reform in law and a
higher standard in this campaign to get rid of the kind of
practices that we're seeing in the Republican contest from Governor
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to suggest that candidates who receive substantial
campaign contributions from special interests were likely to be
influenced by them. He said special interest contributions, such as
those from pharmaceutical companies, could make a candidate less
likely to vote for cheaper generic drugs. Similarly, he said, those
special interests could make a candidate ``less likely to show the
courage to say we want to get the pollution out of our environment
and have clean air and clean water and take on the problem of
global warming.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself has been vulnerable on the issue of campaign
finance, having been criticized for his fund-raising tactics in the
1996 campaign. Moreover, a longtime political fund-raiser for Gore,
Maria Hsia, was convicted on Thursday of five felony counts for her
role in arranging more than $100,000 in illegal donations to the
Democratic Party and its candidates in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's communications director, Karen Hughes, wasted no time
responding to Gore's comments. According to Reuters, Hughes said
Gore's comments had ``a terrible ring of hypocrisy coming from
someone who raised money at a Buddhist temple and whose fund-raiser
was just convicted of felony counts as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   With media reports over the weekend of the role of special
interest money in the Bush campaign, Gore aides said, this was a
perfect opportunity for the vice president to turn the attention
away from his own problems and highlight those of his likely
Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In an expansive speech Sunday night to about 200 supporters at
the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, Gore asserted that the presidency
was not ``a place from which to wield power on behalf of the
special interests,'' referring to industry and to interests like
the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Gore shared the stage with Mrs. Clinton, the second time the two
have appeared together since Feb. 20, and they appeared to have
achieved a relaxed, on-stage compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton lauded Gore for defending ``the new Democrat
philosophy'' that he and President Clinton had ``literally pushed
forward and spread around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In urging New Yorkers to go to the polls, Gore said: ``Don't
give in to the temptation to hold your heart back and worry that
you're going to be disappointed. Democracy is always imperfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore refrained from running down Bradley, a tactic he has
stopped in the last few days since the vice president has been
predicted to win virtually all the states, including New York, with
Democratic primaries on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case anyone was even thinking of voting for his
opponent, Gore mildly criticized some of Bradley's proposals,
especially his health-care plan. Still, he saved his strongest
objections for the Republicans, faulting them for opposing abortion
rights and favoring vouchers for public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made the remarks as he and Bradley concentrated on the East
Coast as they sprinted toward primaries and caucuses in 16 states
that Bradley says will be the decisive moment for his struggling
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In appearances in Buffalo, Maryland and Cleveland, as well as on
talk shows on national television, Bradley tried to rally his
supporters, refusing to give up hope for his campaign despite
trailing Gore by wide margins in polls in almost every state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with Vince Lombardi,'' he said, referring to the
former pro football coach in a live interview on ESPN Radio from
the ESPN Zone restaurant in Baltimore. ``There is no second place.
There is only first place.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Bradley continued to preach optimism, some of his
aides said they have begun making preparations for his exit from
the race soon after Tuesday's vote, working on a concession speech
and discussing the proper time and place to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on those preparations, Eric Hauser, Bradley's
campaign spokesman, said, ``The campaign and candidate are focused
on one thing, and that is doing well on Tuesday in as many places
as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Things look so bleak for Bradley in California that one of his
California campaign coordinators was traveling with him on the East
Coast on Sunday. And his advance staff was making only tentative
plans beyond Tuesday. Bradley plans to follow the results of
Tuesday's primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press'' Sunday morning, Bradley said he
would support Gore if the vice president became the Democratic
Party's nominee. But he said that he would not be Gore's running
mate under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   And asked whether Gore had run an honorable campaign, Bradley
carefully hedged his answer. ``He's said a number of things that
are untrue about his own record and about mine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think things in the last week or so have calmed
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said, ``I'm not prepared to say that defeat is on
the horizon.'' But when he was asked whether he was prepared to
lose, he said, ``I have no doubt I'll be able to deal with whatever
is out there. Because I know why I did this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters on a flight to Rhode Island Sunday afternoon
that he had softened his approach to Bradley in recent days because
Bradley had gotten softer on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that his tone changed in the last several days with
far less of the attack that had become commonplace,'' Gore said.
``And I wanted to reciprocate.''

CANDIOTTI CAN STILL GET IT DONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX, Ariz. _ Tom Candiotti is older than his manager, and
when he broke into professional baseball in 1979, 30 of the players
currently on the Anaheim Angels' 40-man roster had not turned 10
years old.
</P>
<P>
   But Candiotti has a chance to make this year's team, either as a
starter or a reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti, 42, was signed as insurance in case the young arms
the Angels are relying on don't pan out. But he's not a bad policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can pitch out of the (bullpen), he can start, he can gobble
up innings,'' said Candiotti's 41-year-old manager Mike Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti pitched two scoreless innings Saturday against the
A's, allowing only one hit and freezing Miguel Tejada with a
knuckleball so badly on a called third strike that Tejada's left
knee buckled.
</P>
<P>
   It is the knuckleball that has allowed Candiotti to stick around
as long as he has and it is a pitch the Angels haven't been afraid
of. They've had knuckleballers Dennis Springer and Steve Sparks
pitch for them in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mechanics are good right now, and throwing strikes is the
main thing,'' Candiotti said. ``Breaking balls and knuckleballs
don't break as much here (in the dry Arizona air). That's why I'm
concentrating on fundamentals and making sure my mechanics are
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti played for the A's and the Indians last season, but
was released by both teams. Only a year earlier, he made 33 starts
and pitched 201 innings for Oakland, going 11-16 with a 4.84 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm given an opportunity, I'm going to give you 200-plus
innings and 30 starts,'' he said. ``This team has a good defense
and a good offense. That adds up to wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival looking good: Closer Troy Percival pitched batting
practice to live hitters Sunday for the first time this spring,
throwing for about eight minutes. He said his surgically repaired
right shoulder felt fine, and he didn't hit any batters, which has
been a problem for him in BP in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing he needs work on is his breaking ball, and that
will come as we get closer to the season,'' Scioscia said. ``His
velocity is real close to what we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainy day: The Angels' game against the A's was rained out
Sunday after the Angels were retired in the top of the first
inning. Pitcher Kent Mercker, competing for a starting spot, will
be worked into the pitching lineup Tuesday and throw an inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting loose: The Angels are expected to make a number of cuts
today, reducing the number of players currently in major-league
camp from 62. Those players will report to the Angels' minor-league
facility in Mesa, Ariz.

TWO MEN ARRESTED IN MULTIPLE MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two men were charged in Miami on Sunday with the
murder of a young woman whose body was found with those of three
relatives and her fiance in a trail of killings in the Bronx last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, Luis Garcia, 39, of Miami, and Jose Cosme Pizarro,
40, of Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, were charged with killing Denise
Santos, 30. Santos was one of five people, all related, who were
discovered in swift succession last Thursday night and Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Sunday night that
detectives had recovered evidence that linked Garcia and Pizarro to
Santos' death, and that the men were suspects in the other
killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that these men are responsible for all five
murders,'' Safir said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Although Safir declined to describe what evidence the detectives
had gathered, a senior police official said Sunday night that
Garcia and Pizarro were found in Miami with Santos' jewelry. Safir
said the investigation was continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Although police officials had previously said that the Santos
family might have been involved in the narcotics trade, Safir
described such characterizations on Sunday night as
``speculation.'' He said the men killed Santos as part of a
robbery. Asked what they had intended to steal, he said merely,
``We believe they were trying rob money.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of the two men, who Safir said traveled to Florida
immediately after killing Santos, was a break in a case that police
described as mystifying for its scope and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   The crimes were uncovered after two children found the body of
Santos' sister, Evelyn Ortiz, 39, in an elevator at her apartment
building at 2825 Olinville Ave. on Thursday night. Ortiz had been
shot and stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   When the authorities went the next morning to notify Denise
Santos of her sister's death, they found her body on the floor in
her kitchen at 2934 Radcliff Ave. A carving knife was stuck in her
neck. Her house had been ransacked.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, the police found the bodies of Santos' fiance,
Ervin Aguilar, 33, as well as those of her brother, Eduardo Santos,
34, and her nephew, Ishmael Santos, 14. The three bodies were
inside an apartment at 2975 White Plains Rd., three blocks from
where Ortiz died.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was found dead on his bed with a gunshot wound behind
his ear. The two men were found slain at the doorway. Their
apartment had been ransacked also.
</P>
<P>
   The police on Sunday night withheld almost all details of their
investigation. But Safir said the investigation had made headway
when ``a common name became evident who we believed had contact
with all five victims. That name was Luis.''
</P>
<P>
   As the police narrowed down their list of suspects,
investigators said, they learned that witnesses had seen Garcia
with a number of the victims on the evening before the homicides.
Garcia was then tracked to Miami.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Six New York homicide detectives were dispatched there on
Friday, the police said. Garcia and Pizarro were held for
questioning at the Miami-Dade Police Department on Saturday and
were charged Sunday. They face extradition hearings this week.
</P>
<P>
   The police declined to describe the relationship between the two
accused murderers. They said that Garcia had no known criminal
record, and that Pizarro had been arrested repeatedly in New York
City from 1987 to 1993 on charges including grand larceny, assault,
auto stripping, criminal possession of burglar's tools, passing a
forged instrument, robbery and criminal possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also said that Pizarro served a prison term in
the late 1980s and while on parole in 1993 he was charged with
grand larceny and criminal possession of a controlled substance.

`CARE OF THE SOUL' AUTHOR THOMAS MOORE SUGGESTS WAYS TO SAVE SELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN JENKINS  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MAY MISSED THIS /  &UR; ALSO MOVING IN
THE ``E'' CATEGORY)
</P>
<P>
   In the Western world, a hard-and-fast line often is drawn
between the sacred and secular. But to be true to the soul's
nature, says author Thomas Moore, one must integrate the two _ and
learn to live life on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, whose ``Care of the Soul'' spent months on the ``New York
Times'' bestseller list, expands upon the spiritual principles laid
out in this 1992 book and subsequent ones in ``Original Self:
Living with Paradox and Originality'' (HarperCollins, $22). Moore
and his wife, Joan Hanley, whose woodcut drawings supplement the
essays in ``Original Self,'' are making a nationwide book tour.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 59, spent 12 years as a Roman Catholic monk. Living in a
Servite order, which was both contemplative and active, he learned
theological and philosophical truths that influence his writings
about the loss of ``soul'' in our culture. One of the most crucial
lessons he took from that time was ``the importance of living a
contemplative life, having time to be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way to give a little bit of time each day to
contemplation,'' he says. ``If you have that kind of experience, it
can make a crucial difference in the way you live in your active
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He says today's anxious, materialism-obsessed society could take
a page from ancient pagan religion, which took a holistic,
Earth-based approach to all facets of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we imagine the religious or spiritual life in limited ways,
the trouble is all these issues left to the secular world aren't
treated deeply enough,'' Moore says. ``The pagans had a lot of
problems, but one thing they did do right was (knowing) that every
aspect of a person's life has religious and spiritual dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as work. &QL; 
CROSSOVER ROOTS
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to assume it's a secular part of our lives,'' Moore
says, ``that it has nothing to do with our spiritual lives. Both
individually and socially, the difficulties we run into run so deep
they eventually cross over into a religious or spiritual dimension.
We have to begin realizing that everything has these deep roots and
all have some theological roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to think deeply enough, we need to be theologians in our
own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Original Self's'' essays address human personality _ and the
importance of passion, memory, living in the moment. Even the need
to own our neuroses and failures as unique qualities that make us
who we are. When perfection becomes the goal, much of life's
originality gets lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it,'' Moore says, it's about ``the faith in
oneself and trusting that life is offering what you need to live,
and take it on with such gusto that you can make mistakes. And
that's what I mean by original _ it takes a great deal of faith in
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore started writing the pieces that would eventually compose
``Original'' ``Se''lf over a year ago, finding quotes from his
favorite writers and expounding on them. His wife then read each
essay and created ``woodcuts in her own way that represented the
theme of each piece.''  &QL; 
KEY CONNECTIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Working as a psychotherapist for nearly 20 years, Moore says
that ``dealing with people's lives in tense situations'' helped him
clarify the themes he now writes and speaks about. He felt that
part of his job as a therapist was to help patients see the
connection between faith in a spiritual, as well as practical, way.
Being confident in themselves _ as well as trusting in some power
greater than themselves _ was key.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not separate at all,'' he says. ``It's a part of the
whole story. If you can just carry that faith forward, you don't
have to be paranoid. And beyond that, you can have faith that life
is worth living. It's seamless, as far as I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue is to have the faith (to) live your life so that
you don't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one major fault of our full-speed-ahead, Type A society,
he says. People are so obsessed with trying to master their fates,
to somehow reach perfection, that they fail to take ``generous
participation in the concrete life we're given.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of people who are realizing (that
being) a spiritual person is to be more tolerant of yourself and
others,'' Moore says.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he says, ``the word `perfect' means to complete, not
to be without mistake or error or fault.'' &QL; 
FEAR-BASED RELIGION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in some ways, Moore says, organized religion and its
concrete ``thou shalt not'' rules are partially to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of religion is based on fear, and that we should be
perfect,'' he says. ``It's a fear of letting life happen. I think
there's a profound lack of faith in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's only through releasing control that life gets
lived with passion and balance.
</P>
<P>
   As Moore writes in ``Original Self,'' ``. . . We pride ourselves
on our freshly won intelligence, while religion teaches the value
of holy ignorance. There is a thickheaded form of not knowing, from
not having reflected or thought, and an inspired way, being
sufficiently educated that we realize how absurdly little we know.
The former is plain ignorance, the latter verges on the sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   In his writings, Moore includes tenets and quotes from Daoism,
from Buddhism, from Christian mystic traditions, showing readers
that ``letting go'' is a common thread woven through most of the
world's faith traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't know everything,'' he says. ``In this Information
Age, it's hard to imagine this. What we have to do is become smart
enough to realize we're never going to know the context in which we
live. To me, that's opening the door to true faith.'' &QL; 
SECURE IN HIS BELIEFS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of his books' popularity, Moore often is invited to
speak at churches. He's talked to Catholics, Episcopalians,
Unitarian Universalists, and others. He's comfortable speaking to
churchgoers from ministers' pulpits, yet feels equally secure
addressing folks who ``hate church'' and organized religion,
because both audiences can relate to the spiritual nature of his
writings.
</P>
<P>
   The author of 10 books, Moore next will deal with deepening
one's spiritual life by ``connecting the spiritual with the
emotional, and tying together things pulled apart.''
</P>
<P>
   After that book is completed, Moore and his family will move to
Ireland while he writes about the richness of that country's
culture. He says travelers are drawn to Ireland not just for its
residents' trademark humor, music and storytelling, but because the
Irish have managed to syncretize strong Catholic faith with an
earthy, Celtic spirituality that's survived the centuries. He hopes
to show readers that it's possible to live in today's modern world
while retaining values that shape close-knit communities.
</P>
<P>
   Which gets back to that premise of linking the sacred and
secular in everyday life. It's not just a message Moore preaches,
but one he himself lives out, whether walking on the beach with his
family, cooking a meal or visiting with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best meditation for me is playing the piano every
morning,'' he says. ``My work is so caught up in religion, and I
don't see any separation between my spiritual life and my work. I
feel a certain call from the world to `come out here and talk to
us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, if you're living a real spiritual life, you're living a
real full secular life. If you can (tell the difference), you're in
trouble.'' &QL; Reach the reporter at maureen.jenkins(at)arizonarepub

``AS NATURE MADE HIM'' &QL; 
By John Colapinto (HarperCollins, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard about this book on television magazine and
talk shows, but until you read what happened to Bruce Reimer on
April 7, 1966, you won't understand the staggering trauma he
endured. On that day, Bruce and his twin brother, Brian, were set
to undergo routine circumcisions in the Canadian hospital where
they had been born eight months earlier. Bruce went first. Doctors
never got to Brian. Instead, their young parents were told that
there had been an ``accident'' during Bruce's procedure _ the
circumcision had been botched, his genitals were all but destroyed
and the family was left to make wrenching decisions in an era of
little knowledge and few options. In desperation, they consulted a
sex researcher at Johns Hopkins Hospital, who advised them to
``reassign'' their son as a girl, mentally and physically. So,
Bruce was castrated and raised as a girl _ Brenda _ until she was
14 and, in the book's most moving scene, finally told what had
happened to her. This is a chilling story about the power of
nature. If you have a baby boy in your house, you will want to grab
him and run for the hills. &QL;

   ``THE WORKSHOP: SEVEN DECADES OF THE IOWA WRITERS' WORKSHOP'' &QL; 
 &QL;

</P>
<P>
   There's some great fiction here, but we fell for the
introductions, the brief lead-in to each story written by the
writer or, in the case of Flannery O'Connor, Wallace Stegner, Andre
Dubus, Raymond Carver or others no longer living, by a
contemporary. Michael Cunningham, for example, tells the publishing
history of his story ``White Angel'' (an early chapter in his
novel, ``A Home at the End of the World''). He had sent many
stories to ``The New Yorker'' to no avail, but a friend insisted
that he try again with ``White Angel.'' To his astonishment, the
magazine said yes, and the story's appearance in 1988 made, he
says, ``more difference than I'd ever imagined,'' with a dozen
editors calling to ask whether they could have a chance at his
first novel. The stories are arranged chronologically, with Stegner
in the 1930s; writers such as Elizabeth McCracken and Buddy Udall
in the 1990s; and Ethan Canin, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Jayne Anne
Phillips, Stuart Dybek, Thom Jones, John Casey and others in
between. &QL;

<P>
   ``SHRUB'' &QL; 
By Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose (Random House, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We'd buy this one just for the title. In the introduction, Ivins
shifts to her other nickname for George W. Bush _ ``Dubya'' _ which
is good, too. Her book, subtitled ``The Short but Happy Political
Life of George W. Bush,'' is written from a Texan's point of view,
which is helpful because Dubya promises to do for the country what
he did for the state. Ivins and Dubose (editor of ``The Texas
Observer'') try to portray the candidate as he really is:
privileged, personable, unintellectual and most of all, LUCKY. For
one thing, he inherited a healthy Texas from Ann Richards, his
predecessor in the Governor's Office. Then there is his father.
``The political career of W. Bush is a fairly funny yarn,'' the
authors write, ``on account of being the son of a former president
is not . . . actually sufficient job training for the governance of
a large state. Fortunately, in Texas, this makes no difference.''
If you think that Bush's record is different from his rhetoric, and
that his resume is, as Ivins puts it, ``a little light,'' don't
blame her. ``There's really not much there,'' she says. ``We've
been looking for six years.'' &QL;

   Walls looks at our fascination with gossip, beginning with the

who subsequently became some of the most influential journalists of
the midcentury, and ending with the notorious events of recent
years _ the O.J. Simpson trial; the death of Diana, Princess of
Wales; Matt Drudge's theft of ``Newsweek'' information to scoop the
world on the Clinton/Lewinsky affair. Also here are miniprofiles of
former ``Vanity Fair'' and ``New Yorker'' Editor Tina Brown;
powerful Hollywood publicist Pat Kingsley (who redefined the term
``star access'' with her belligerence toward reporters seeking
interviews with client Tom Cruise); and Mike Wallace, who jumped
into the gossip cauldron with his 1956 program, ``Night Beat.'' In
the process of reporting all of this, Walls herself panders to the
gossip mill with mention of rumors of Cruise's homosexuality and
John and Robert Kennedy's simultaneous affairs with Marilyn Monroe.
Best of all, she provides an index. You can choose your own gossip,

BURBANK, CALIF. _ A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 with 142 people
aboard landed in the rain and skidded off a slick runway at Burbank
Airport shortly after 6 p.m. Sunday, smashing through a fence
across Hollywood Way before hitting a car and stopping at a gas
station.
</P>
<P>
   At least four people, including the pilot, were taken to the
hospital with what were believed to be minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, Southwest 1455, was en route from Las Vegas when the
accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers and crew scrambled to safety through emergency exits
and down inflatable ramps. Firefighters rushed to the scene and
sprayed fire-retardant foam to prevent fuel from bursting into
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adrenaline was pumping. And then there was much relief
among everybody. ... There were a number of us who couldn't dial
our cell phones because our hands were shaking so much,'' passenger
Kevin McCoy told KNBC Channel 4.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign of trouble during the flight, but passengers
said the plane was going very fast when it touched down. Portions
of the airport fence were sucked into the plane's right engine and
the nose of the plane was damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in really hard and really fast,'' passenger Ira
Leibowitz said in an interview with Fox television Channel 11. ``I
looked out the right window and we were going way too fast. ... The
pilot hit the brakes really hard but you could tell it wasn't going
to be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Leibowitz, who was sitting near the back of the plane, said the
aircraft was coming in on the runway parallel to the airport
terminal at the time of the accident.

`CARE OF THE SOUL' AUTHOR THOMAS MOORE SUGGESTS WAYS TO SAVE SELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN JENKINS  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MAY MISSED THIS /  &UR; ALSO MOVING IN
THE ``L'' CATEGORY)
</P>
<P>
   In the Western world, a hard-and-fast line often is drawn
between the sacred and secular. But to be true to the soul's
nature, says author Thomas Moore, one must integrate the two _ and
learn to live life on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, whose ``Care of the Soul'' spent months on the ``New York
Times'' bestseller list, expands upon the spiritual principles laid
out in this 1992 book and subsequent ones in ``Original Self:
Living with Paradox and Originality'' (HarperCollins, $22). Moore
and his wife, Joan Hanley, whose woodcut drawings supplement the
essays in ``Original Self,'' are making a nationwide book tour.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 59, spent 12 years as a Roman Catholic monk. Living in a
Servite order, which was both contemplative and active, he learned
theological and philosophical truths that influence his writings
about the loss of ``soul'' in our culture. One of the most crucial
lessons he took from that time was ``the importance of living a
contemplative life, having time to be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way to give a little bit of time each day to
contemplation,'' he says. ``If you have that kind of experience, it
can make a crucial difference in the way you live in your active
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He says today's anxious, materialism-obsessed society could take
a page from ancient pagan religion, which took a holistic,
Earth-based approach to all facets of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we imagine the religious or spiritual life in limited ways,
the trouble is all these issues left to the secular world aren't
treated deeply enough,'' Moore says. ``The pagans had a lot of
problems, but one thing they did do right was (knowing) that every
aspect of a person's life has religious and spiritual dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as work. &QL; 
CROSSOVER ROOTS
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to assume it's a secular part of our lives,'' Moore
says, ``that it has nothing to do with our spiritual lives. Both
individually and socially, the difficulties we run into run so deep
they eventually cross over into a religious or spiritual dimension.
We have to begin realizing that everything has these deep roots and
all have some theological roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to think deeply enough, we need to be theologians in our
own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Original Self's'' essays address human personality _ and the
importance of passion, memory, living in the moment. Even the need
to own our neuroses and failures as unique qualities that make us
who we are. When perfection becomes the goal, much of life's
originality gets lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it,'' Moore says, it's about ``the faith in
oneself and trusting that life is offering what you need to live,
and take it on with such gusto that you can make mistakes. And
that's what I mean by original _ it takes a great deal of faith in
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore started writing the pieces that would eventually compose
``Original'' ``Se''lf over a year ago, finding quotes from his
favorite writers and expounding on them. His wife then read each
essay and created ``woodcuts in her own way that represented the
theme of each piece.''  &QL; 
KEY CONNECTIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Working as a psychotherapist for nearly 20 years, Moore says
that ``dealing with people's lives in tense situations'' helped him
clarify the themes he now writes and speaks about. He felt that
part of his job as a therapist was to help patients see the
connection between faith in a spiritual, as well as practical, way.
Being confident in themselves _ as well as trusting in some power
greater than themselves _ was key.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not separate at all,'' he says. ``It's a part of the
whole story. If you can just carry that faith forward, you don't
have to be paranoid. And beyond that, you can have faith that life
is worth living. It's seamless, as far as I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue is to have the faith (to) live your life so that
you don't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one major fault of our full-speed-ahead, Type A society,
he says. People are so obsessed with trying to master their fates,
to somehow reach perfection, that they fail to take ``generous
participation in the concrete life we're given.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of people who are realizing (that
being) a spiritual person is to be more tolerant of yourself and
others,'' Moore says.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he says, ``the word `perfect' means to complete, not
to be without mistake or error or fault.'' &QL; 
FEAR-BASED RELIGION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in some ways, Moore says, organized religion and its
concrete ``thou shalt not'' rules are partially to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of religion is based on fear, and that we should be
perfect,'' he says. ``It's a fear of letting life happen. I think
there's a profound lack of faith in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's only through releasing control that life gets
lived with passion and balance.
</P>
<P>
   As Moore writes in ``Original Self,'' ``. . . We pride ourselves
on our freshly won intelligence, while religion teaches the value
of holy ignorance. There is a thickheaded form of not knowing, from
not having reflected or thought, and an inspired way, being
sufficiently educated that we realize how absurdly little we know.
The former is plain ignorance, the latter verges on the sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   In his writings, Moore includes tenets and quotes from Daoism,
from Buddhism, from Christian mystic traditions, showing readers
that ``letting go'' is a common thread woven through most of the
world's faith traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't know everything,'' he says. ``In this Information
Age, it's hard to imagine this. What we have to do is become smart
enough to realize we're never going to know the context in which we
live. To me, that's opening the door to true faith.'' &QL; 
SECURE IN HIS BELIEFS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of his books' popularity, Moore often is invited to
speak at churches. He's talked to Catholics, Episcopalians,
Unitarian Universalists, and others. He's comfortable speaking to
churchgoers from ministers' pulpits, yet feels equally secure
addressing folks who ``hate church'' and organized religion,
because both audiences can relate to the spiritual nature of his
writings.
</P>
<P>
   The author of 10 books, Moore next will deal with deepening
one's spiritual life by ``connecting the spiritual with the
emotional, and tying together things pulled apart.''
</P>
<P>
   After that book is completed, Moore and his family will move to
Ireland while he writes about the richness of that country's
culture. He says travelers are drawn to Ireland not just for its
residents' trademark humor, music and storytelling, but because the
Irish have managed to syncretize strong Catholic faith with an
earthy, Celtic spirituality that's survived the centuries. He hopes
to show readers that it's possible to live in today's modern world
while retaining values that shape close-knit communities.
</P>
<P>
   Which gets back to that premise of linking the sacred and
secular in everyday life. It's not just a message Moore preaches,
but one he himself lives out, whether walking on the beach with his
family, cooking a meal or visiting with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best meditation for me is playing the piano every
morning,'' he says. ``My work is so caught up in religion, and I
don't see any separation between my spiritual life and my work. I
feel a certain call from the world to `come out here and talk to
us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, if you're living a real spiritual life, you're living a
real full secular life. If you can (tell the difference), you're in
trouble.'' &QL; Reach the reporter at maureen.jenkins(at)arizonarepub

stranger, Debi Faris, who was so touched by the story of an infant
found dead in a duffel bag that she convinced the coroner to let
her give the child a proper burial. So began the Garden of Angels,
a burial place for unidentified abandoned children. Now Faris is
pushing for legislation that would offer legal protection to
parents who abandon their babies in safe places. (Monica

BUSH BANKS ON LATINOS IN CALIF. 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   John McCain's inability to speak Spanish does not automatically
mean that George W. Bush's comparative fluency in the language will
give him a decisive edge on Super Tuesday, according to those who
follow Latino politics.
</P>
<P>
   Banking in part on those language skills, the Texas governor is
wooing Latinos vigorously in California.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also courting Latinos in the Golden State, where the
Hispanic population jumped to roughly 14 percent from 7 percent
from 1990 to 1998. But McCain doesn't show the same intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush launched a Spanish-language ad in the state and
participated in a town hall sponsored by the Spanish-language
KMEX-TV in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Producers of the half-hour event on the flagship station of
Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language network, touted
the show as the first of its kind by a presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the most part in English, Bush even agreed to a
nationally televised debate before the general election to discuss
Hispanic issues such as immigration and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ````Solamente en espa''n``''``ol'','' or only if the debate is
in Spanish, the governor joked.
</P>
<P>
   The joke goes only so far, according to Arturo Vargas, executive
director of the National Association of Latino Elected and
Appointed Officials, a group that monitors elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking Spanish is an important symbolism,'' Vargas said.
``But Latinos know it is just symbolism. We want substance.''
</P>
<P>
   His advisers say Bush is keenly aware of that. For one thing,
wounds inflicted by Republicans around former Gov. Pete Wilson in
his war on immigration and affirmative action are still fresh among
California Hispanics, historically a Democratic voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing an uphill battle'' when it comes to competing for
Democratic votes, admitted Gary Mendoza, a former deputy mayor of
Los Angeles who is now in charge of delivering the Latino vote to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   To boost his appeal among Hispanics, the GOP front-runner
enlisted his 23-year-old nephew, George Prescott Bush, whose mother
is Mexican-born.
</P>
<P>
   George P. Bush may not be Ricky Martin, the pop music sensation,
but his youth and his Mexican background helps in connecting to a
community in which bilingual skills are highly valued, said Margita
Thompson, Bush's California Hispanic coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush, son of Florida Gov. Jeb &UR; Bush and his wife
Columba, a Mexican native, will remain in California until the
primary, visiting Latino organizations and colleges, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (George W. Bush) knows he must get every vote,'' Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
   During his 1998 gubernatorial re-election bid, Bush captured 49
percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas by campaigning heavily in
Latino communities. He emphasized education policies that increased
test scores, and he refused to embrace English Only policies.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those very issues, a majority of California Hispanics,
or 56.4 percent, said they will vote for Bush over McCain on
Tuesday. The January poll of 614 Hispanics of both major parties by
the William C. Velasquez Institute, an organization that monitors
voting patterns of Latinos, had a margin of error of 4 percentage
points. It gave Bush a comfortable margin over McCain in the
primary, 32.8 percent to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the general election, according to the poll, Democrat Al Gore
would attract Hispanic voters by a 2-1 ratio over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain may not be as aggressive as Bush in courting Latinos, but
his compelling military career is likely to evoke empathy from
Hispanic veterans, said Phoenix-native Tommy Espinoza, a McCain
adviser and a top official with the National Council of La Raza in
Washington, D.C. He noted that McCain had planned a series of
meetings with key Latinos leaders in California.
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza said the senator supports issues of concern to Latinos.
The senator helped pass the 1990 Dropout Prevention program, he
said, which later included an amendment focusing on the Hispanic
dropout rate.
</P>
<P>
   To help McCain, Espinoza said, his sister, Sandra, volunteered
to go to California over the weekend and knock on doors there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator used to come to south Phoenix and helped paint
homes,'' said Sandra Espinoza, a registered Democrat. ``He doesn't
like to brag about those things.'' &QL;
