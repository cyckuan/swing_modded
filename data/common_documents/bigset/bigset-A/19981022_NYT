MEGS JENKINS, ACTRESS KNOWN FOR MATRONLY ROLES, DIES AT 81
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONDON _ Megs Jenkins, a British stage, film and television
actress who specialized in playing kindly, matronly characters,
died on Oct. 5, said a spokeswoman for the Gordon Rodwell Funeral
Service in Felixstow, Suffolk, where her funeral was held. She was
81.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Jenkins played many parts in her long career, but she was
best known for her portrayal of nurses, governesses, maids, cooks,
long-suffering wives and wise mothers. With her unglamorous looks
and her plump, open face, she seemed made for sympathy and found
herself typecast in supporting, or supportive, roles.
</P>
<P>
   Born Muguette Mary Jenkins in Birkenhead, Cheshire, in 1917,
Miss Jenkins harbored dreams of becoming a ballet dancer but turned
to acting, and dispensed with her exotic first name, she said, when
she realized that she did not have a dancer's physique.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sad, really,'' she once said. ``I was this same
unsylphlike shape when I was 17. I had fancied I might call myself
by my real name, Muguette, once I became a ballerina. But I had to
face the fact that I was quite definitely a Megs.''
</P>
<P>
   After studying at the School of Dancing and Dramatic Art in
Liverpool, she took her first professional role, as a German
hausfrau in ``The Lift That Failed,'' in a production by the
Liverpool Repertory Company in 1933. She remained with the company
for four years, then moved to London.
</P>
<P>
   She had a long and distinguished stage career, veering several
times from the roles in which she was typecast: She played a cruel,
mentally unstable mother in Tennessee Williams' ``Summer and
Smoke'' (1951), for instance, and the title role in Pinero's
``School Mistress'' (1954).
</P>
<P>
   She was particularly praised for her role as a show-business fan
in Emlyn Williams' ``Light of Heart'' (1940) and for her portrayal
of the mother of a possible second messiah in a Welsh farming
community during the Crimean War in another Emlyn Williams play,
``The Wind of Heaven'' (1945).
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, she won the Clarence Derwent Award, then Britain's
highest stage prize, for best supporting performance in Arthur
Miller's ``View from the Bridge,'' in which she played a wife
trying desperately to ignore her husband's incestuous feelings for
his niece.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, she appeared in a number of patriotic
movies intended to boost morale and support the war effort,
including ``Millions Like Us'' (1943), about wartime factory
workers, and ``The Lamp Still Burns,'' in which she played, not for
the first or last time, a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared in dozens of films, including ``The Brothers''
(1947), a strange melodrama set on the Isle of Skye; ``The
Innocents'' (1961), a film based on Henry James' novella ``The Turn
of the Screw,'' in which she played the nervous housemaid; and
``Indiscreet'' (1958), playing Ingrid Bergman's housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps her most successful film was ``The History of Polly''
(1949), an adaption of H.G. Wells' comic novel, in which she seemed
perfectly cast as a homey, dependable landlady.
</P>
<P>
   Her television work included a role in the popular series ``All
Creatures Great and Small,'' based on the James Herriot books, and
a part in the comedy series ``Young at Heart,'' in which she played
a bickering retiree opposite John Mills, who had been her co-star
in ``The History of Polly.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Jenkins' 1943 marriage to George Routledge, a commando who
had been a childhood classmate and who renewed their acquaintance
when he saw her name in a review, ended in divorce in 1959.

ROBERT J. SUSLOW, RETAIL EXECUTIVE, DEAD AT 65 
</HEADLINE>

 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert J. Suslow, a retail executive who presided over Saks
Fifth Avenue, Ohrbach's, Famous-Barr and Batus Retail during the
1970s and 1980s, died Sunday at his apartment in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He was 65. The cause of death was arteriosclerosis, according to
his nephew, Steven Suslow.
</P>
<P>
   Suslow started his retailing career in 1951 as a trainee at
Bloomingdale's, rising to executive positions there and later at G.
Fox &AMP; Co. in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he became an executive vice president and general
manager of Ohrbach's and later its president. Five years later, he
moved to Famous-Barr stores in St. Louis as its president.
</P>
<P>
   He became president of Saks Fifth Avenue in 1976 and the
company's chief executive two years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 he was named the president of the BWI retail group of
Brown &AMP; Williamson Industries, the predecessor company of Batus
Retail Group, and in 1981 he became the chairman and chief
executive of Batus, which was then the corporate owner of Saks
Fifth Avenue, Gimbel Brothers and Marshall Field &AMP; Co. He resigned
from that position in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year he joined Calvin Klein Industries as its
president and held a 10 percent interest in the fashion designer's
business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, he resigned that position at the age of 50 and shifted
his attention from retail companies to his other passion: harness
racing.
</P>
<P>
   Although he remained a retail consultant, his nephew said that
horse racing became his hobby and his business, which he operated
as RJS Stables.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his life _ not just owning horses, but going to the
track and training,'' said Steven Suslow, who noted that his
uncle's most successful horse was Happy Escort, which won the
Little Brown Jug harness race in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Suslow is also survived by his brother, Howard of West Palm
Beach, Fla.

SPORTS COLUMN: TYSON'S SELF-ABSOLUTION  
</HEADLINE>

 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once again Mike Tyson in a minute takes full blame for his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Until the next minute, when he generously absolves himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no one's fault but mine,'' he told the five-man Nevada
State Athletic Commission Monday, which was deciding whether to let
him back in the ring a year and a half after he presumably mistook
Evander Holyfield's ears for an entree. ``Some people are sheltered
and protected,'' he went on, ``born with a silver spoon in their
mouth. They don't know what it's like to be hungry and scared and
have to have courage.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication is clear, it wasn't his fault: It was the
neighborhood. Tyson grew up in mean circumstances in the
Brownsville section of Brooklyn, and it was inevitable that he
would become a convicted rapist and perpetrator of other crimes,
misdemeanors and assorted crude behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, all kids like Mike who from the age of 12 grew up in a
nine-bedroom Victorian mansion on 10 acres of land on the Hudson
River are disadvantaged,'' said Teddy Atlas, a one-time assistant
trainer for Tyson when they both lived in the Catskills home of the
trainer Cus D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was treated like a prince,'' said Bill Cayton, who, along
with Jimmy Jacobs, managed Tyson in his early years, after taking
him out of a reform school and sending him to D'Amato. ``We spent
nearly a half-million dollars on him from the time Mike was 12 to
when he was 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlas added: ``A lot of people in many different fields have
come out of Brownsville, and other poor areas, and not gotten into
anything near the kind of trouble Mike Tyson's got into.'' He named
three: Eddie Mustafa Muhammad, Floyd Patterson _ former boxing
champions _ and Rodney Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Tyson? He is Mike Tyson's older brother, who at 37 is
five years older than Mike. Rodney grew up in the same place with
the same mother and for a while the same father, who would leave
their home when Mike was 6. Rodney Tyson went to the Navy and
studied pharmacy and is, at last report, employed by a Los Angeles
druggist.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Tyson could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but in
a Newsday interview several years ago, he said that his brother had
always been ``volatile,'' going back to when he was 9. ``As long as
he's doing something with his hands without putting them in other
people's pockets, we're happy,'' Rodney said, as a kind of family
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy Tyson became a pickpocket on public buses, rolled
drunks and mugged old ladies of their purses. By the time he was
13, he had been arrested 38 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had hard lives,'' Mike Tyson told Mark Kram in the
Playboy interview in the November issue. He said the family had
been on welfare. ``Humiliating.'' And yet, he said: ``Brownsville
was happy, too. Nothing big, just going to the pool. Gambling
without anybody getting killed or robbed over a dice game.
Laughing. Cooking food outside and music. That was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone grows up differently; the combination of environment
and genetic makeup and the early impacts of life are not the same
for any two people. But Tyson seems to be as divided internally as
few others are.
</P>
<P>
   Is he rationalizing, or is he simply lying, or denying when he
speaks so self-servingly and ambiguously about himself? He bit
Holyfield's ears because he was head-butted. He didn't punch two
motorists in August but ``if I did, I was unconscious, and I'm
sorry.'' And so on.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada commission had wondered what the future looked like
for him _ and for the ears of his possible opponents. They sought a
psychological evaluation to see if he was mentally capable of going
back into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion reached by a host of medical authorities was that
Tyson was normal enough to return to his brutal sport. The report
added that Tyson suffered from ``rage,'' and it should be monitored
with mental therapy, but the commission properly decided to allow
him, after having served a year's suspension, to again earn a
living in his vocation. As to the rage: Tyson has said ominously
more than once that ``I know I will blow one day.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that we've seen the last of Mike Tyson the Reprobate
and will be treated forevermore to Mike Tyson the Reformed, as he
has, yes, promised yet again.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely, however, to happen until he finally believes
that the fault, dear Mike, is not in Brownsville, but in yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves society _ in the ring and out _ with this alarming
question: Can Mike Tyson reach a benign insight before he
``blows''?

NOTE FOR THE RECORD BOOKS: ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ They needed the sweep on Wednesday night. They
needed it for history.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were going to win their 125th game anyway, one of
these nights, but four straight against the Padres was the way to
punctuate this special season, to make the final statement of who
they are, what they have accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   They even had a fitting obstacle to becoming only the 16th team
to sweep a World Series: Kevin Brown, the fierce-looking
right-hander, who runs and hits and pitches. However, Andy Pettitte
was even better, shutting down the Padres, 3-0, as the Yankees won
their 24th world championship _ a record for North American team
sports, forging ahead of the Montreal Maroons/Canadiens of the
National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   With 125 victories this year, the Yankees won more games than
any baseball team in history. Even factoring in the higher totals
from the four-year-old system of a three-tiered championship, the
Yankees are now worthy of being compared to the 1927 Yankees, the
1975 Cincinnati Reds, the Oakland A's of the early 70s, or teams of
earlier decades that few of us can remember or judge adequately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like a sweep, just so we can finish it,'' Joe Torre said
before the game. ``When it's all said and done, and we look back
and you start comparing, then I think we can get caught up in it.
But right now we can't afford that luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre prefers to compare his team to a dynasty from another
sport _ the old Boston Celtics of the National Basketball
Association (remember that league?).
</P>
<P>
   ``They were such a good team team,'' Torre said, using the word
as both a noun and an adjective. ``Nobody really cared if anybody
scored 30 points, with Russell in the middle and Ramsey, and all of
those people, they worked together as a unit, and it was fun to
watch them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics gained in stature from worthy opponents in the
finals, whether it was the St. Louis Hawks of Bob Pettit or the Los
Angeles Lakers of Jerry West and Elgin Baylor. The 1996 Yankees
will be remembered as the team that lost two and then bounced back
to win four straight against the powerful Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees would not have gained much luster from a long
series with the Padres, unless there were epic games, heroic
doings. A sweep was the way to go, and its value was enhanced
slightly because Brown was able to take the mound Wednesday night,
bruised shin and rheumy eyes notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   It was Brown who helped the Florida Marlins _ not exactly a
dynasty for the ages under the callous stewardship of Wayne
Huizenga _ win the World Series last year.
</P>
<P>
   Given the two travel days, one hot pitcher can dominate a World
Series. If Brown had come into Yankee Stadium and shut down the
Yankees, their entire destiny could have been threatened. What good
are 114 victories if you lose the World Series?
</P>
<P>
   However, Brown was weakened in that first game by a bug that was
going around the Padres. According to their resident expert on
infectious bacteria, Jim Leyritz, the bug was brought onto the
Padres' charter ``by some of the kids or wives.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a possibility that if the Padres could somehow carry
the Yankees deep into this World Series, then the nasty little
microbes might make a leap from the affected San Diego players to
the Yankees via an unwitting host _ namely the shuffling baseball
writers, their health and morale already undermined by the bad
hours, the bad food in stadiums, the bad ergonomics in crowded
press boxes, plus the foul air on airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees showed no signs of waiting for some epidemic or
slump or negative moon rays to affect them. They had destroyed
everything in their path since the first week, when they lost three
straight and the tabloids and the talk radio people were choosing
Torre's replacement. Honest, that really happened.
</P>
<P>
   It may be mere whimsy to try to compare teams of different
generations, but these Yankees were clearly a model of good
character, good fundamentals, good strategy, good training, good
athleticism, in their own time. It has been clear since the spring
that this was a special team, that it would not self-destruct. The
Yankees wanted their 125th victory sooner rather than later, and
they got it. They were like that for this entire long and glorious
season.

SPORTS COLUMN: PETTITTE'S POSITIVE THINKING PAYS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Andy Pettitte was relieved before he ever threw a
pitch against the Padres Wednesday night because his father, Tom,
was released from the hospital Wednesday after undergoing double
heart-bypass surgery last Thursday. So as Pettitte tried to guide
the Yankees to a World Series sweep, it was comforting for him to
know that his father was watching on television from home in Deer
Park, Texas. He was safe.
</P>
<P>
   The relief about Tom's health was obvious as Pettitte talked
about his father on Tuesday. The reverence was just as apparent as
he talked about how Tom tutored him as a pitcher from the time he
was 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the reason that I'm even here,'' said Pettitte. ``He's
been my pitching coach from the first time I picked up a baseball.
I want him to have a good time with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte made certain that his father and the Yankees would
enjoy Wednesday night forever with a superb pitching performance
that allowed them to beat the Padres, 3-0, in Game 4 and win their
second World Series Championship in three years.
</P>
<P>
   After being passed over to start in Game 2 or Game 3 and after
ending the season as the biggest question mark in the rotation
other than Hideki Irabu, Pettitte ended his season in style.
Wednesday night, Pettitte was like the Pettitte of old, stopping
the Padres on no runs and five hits for seven and one third
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's been a great season,'' said Pettitte. ``It's been
unbelievable the way that we have played. And that would be a great
way for me to end this, I guess, dismal or sub par season. I'd like
to be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done as Pettitte ran his scoreless streak in the
World Series to 15 2/3 innings. It was a redemptive outing for
Pettitte, who was not seriously considered to start sooner after
being pounded for four homers by the Indians in Game 4 of the ALCS.
Even though Pettitte probably benefited from the rest because of
the anguish over his father's condition, he was not happy about
being pushed to the end of the rotation. When the left-hander was
asked if he thought starting the fourth game would be helpful, he
bluntly said, ``Not really.''
</P>
<P>
   So Pettitte reminded manager Joe Torre and everyone else what he
can do and what he had done in Game 5 of the 1996 World Series.
Pettitte outpitched John Smoltz when the Yankees nipped the Braves,
1-0, in Game 5 and he provided more of the same artistry in
subduing the Padres Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to dwell on the problems I've had this year,''
said Pettitte. ``I'm going to think positive. You need to be
positive instead of negative out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the same type of advice Pettitte had dispensed to his
father, imploring him to relax and enjoy watching his son pitch for
the Yankees. But Tom has admitted that it is difficult for him to
do. Before Pettitte pitched Game 2 of the Division Series against
the Rangers, his father worked the graveyard shift at a chemical
plant and did not watch the game because he said it annoys him to
hear his son get criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fun listening to people beat up on your kid,'' said
Tom two weeks ago. ``I've always been more critical of Andy than
any New York fan or New York media, but he's my kid. I can do that.
To hear other people ripping your kid hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pettitte rushed to Texas for his father's surgery on
Thursday, he admitted that he was frightened. But even as
Pettitte's father was lying in a hospital bed, he tried to soothe
his son and get him to focus on the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left he was still in I.C.U. and he had tubes in him and
stuff like that so he could barely talk to me,'' said Pettitte.
``He always talked about baseball. He told me not to worry about
him, he's going to be fine and get ready to pitch my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre could not be blamed for starting Orlando Hernandez in Game
2 and David Cone in Game 3 because Pettitte had been too
inconsistent. For a pitcher who was 16-10 with a 4.24 earned run
average, Pettitte was not reliable. Even after Pettitte throttled
the Rangers in the division series, the Yankees wondered if he had
emerged from his drought. He had not as the Indians treated him
like a batting practice pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte came back on 11 days rest and was terrific. He
squeezed through a bases-loaded jam in the second and erased Ruben
Rivera off second in the seventh when he corraled Carlos
Hernandez's chopper and caught Rivera between second and third. It
was the kind of night that made lots of fathers and sons smile, but
none smiled as broadly as the Pettittes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All any parent wants is for his son to do well and to be
treated fairly by people,'' said Tom Pettitte, earlier this month.
``You want him to get a shot to do what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte got it, he seized it and the Yankees are champions
again.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ George Steinbrenner's team was getting ready to win
another World Series championship and soar into baseball history as
one of the best teams ever, but the principal owner, for once, was
straining for words. In the hours before Game 4, Steinbrenner was
searching for the proper way to describe this team, this team for
the ages. He settled on calling it astounding, with unbelievable as
a close second.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, however, Steinbrenner did not struggle for the
right words when he was asked about the possibility that he would
sell the Yankees, especially now that their already handsome value
should increase with their 24th World Series title in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has acknowledged having had sale discussions with
Cablevision, which also owns the Knicks, the Rangers and Madison
Square Garden. The possible purchase price for the Yankees is said
to range from $500 million to $900 million, and Steinbrenner
admitted recently that the discussions have included a tiered
pricing system depending on how far the team advanced in the 1998
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   According to people in baseball with knowledge of the talks,
Steinbrenner would remain in power for three years. In a telephone
interview Wednesday, the 68-year-old owner repeatedly declined to
answer questions about a possible sale, but he did not sound ready
to cede his ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you this, I'm never going to be in a situation
where I have a token role,'' Steinbrenner said. ``Like having
someone say, `Sell it to me and you can do a little.' I am going to
contribute by being in majority ownership. I'm very happy with all
of my people and everything that is happening now.''
</P>
<P>
   In one move, Steinbrenner could sell the Yankees for an
extravagant amount, avoid the wrangling over the fight for a new
stadium and avoid dealing with sticky free-agent issues like the
one involving Bernie Williams that will cloud the assembling of the
1999 team. But he said nevertheless that his youngest son, Hal, and
his son-in-law, Steve Swindal, were interested in eventually
operating the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, neither Hal nor Hank Steinbrenner, the owner's sons,
nor Swindal has seemed open to this possibility, and Yankee
officials have long stressed that no one in Steinbrenner's family
wants the responsibility of running the organization. Posturing or
not, Steinbrenner said: ``I've got sons and a son-in-law. If Steve
and Hal told me they like running this thing, I can walk away. If
my family wants it, I should be willing to give it to them. I'm
convinced that they do want it. You think I'm intense? Those two
are wrung out after each game. You should see how hard they take
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Steinbrenner, 29, has been listed as a general partner of
the Yankees since 1996; Swindal, 43, is in his first season as a
general partner. Both have stayed in the background, and
Steinbrenner's most significant praise for them was for the
development of the Yankees' Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know how to turn on the computer,'' said
Steinbrenner. ``You should see what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   When Steinbrenner was reminded that he could stroll into
baseball's sunset after one of the best seasons ever, with a far
bigger fortune for generations of Steinbrenners _ and all without
ever having to worry about payroll questions, stadium issues,
revenue sharing or unfavorable headlines as he approaches 70 _ he
did not seem eager to leave a position that has made him perhaps
the most recognizable owner in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say this, I want to put my family in a position where
they can be sure that they can take over this team,'' Steinbrenner
said. ``There are different rumors and different prices. I've just
told people I won't deal with that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner would not specifically discuss the impending free
agency of Williams or Scott Brosius, although it appears that the
third baseman is more likely to remain with the Yankees than the
center fielder. Some Yankee officials are convinced that Williams
is already planning to leave because Scott Boras, his agent,
realizes the Yanks will probably not offer him the $12 million or
more a year he is expected to seek. Although Steinbrenner pledged
to work ``pretty hard'' to keep the team intact, he admitted that,
inevitably, there will be changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you will see that,'' Steinbrenner said. ``Everybody
knows that. I hope some of the people who are here are convinced of
how great it is here. If you talk to some of the people who left,
I'm sure they'd tell you they wish they were here.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees having won the Series in dazzling style, there
will be pressure to keep the team together. But after the 1996
World Series, the Yankees allowed John Wetteland, that most
valuable player of that Series, and Jimmy Key, who won the
clinching sixth game, to sign free-agent contracts with other
teams. Steinbrenner reasoned that there would be as much pressure
on the possibly departing players to stay as there would be on him
to retain them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing in an Old Lady, but we dress her up pretty darn
good each season,'' Steinbrenner said, referring to Yankee Stadium.
``It's a privilege to be a Yankee. It really is. No team in sports
has ever won 24 championships, and we're about to. You've got to
like this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner likes symmetry, another reason why he loved the
idea that the Yankees were about to snatch their 24th title. The
Yankees have a World Series design that lists the different years
of their titles, and it has bothered Steinbrenner for two years
that the first three lines housed six championship years each and
the fourth line had only five years and a lonely asterisk.
Steinbrenner can now look forward to erasing the asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been astounding,'' he said. ``That's the best way to
describe it.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The New York Yankees have been a team greater than
the sum of its parts all year, and how fitting that on the night
they completed a sweep of San Diego in the World Series and secured
their own corridor in history, a pitcher who struggled in recent
weeks drove them over the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte, dropped to the back of the Yankees' rotation for
the World Series, applied the final stroke to their mosaic
Wednesday night, pitching seven and one-third shutout innings and
outdueling Kevin Brown in a 3-0 victory over the Padres in Game 4.
Pettitte, throwing sinking fastballs, generated 15 groundball outs,
rewarding the faith Manager Joe Torre demonstrated in him in the
final month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In completing their first World Series sweep since 1950, the
Yankees won their 24th championship and their second in three
seasons. They finished the year with 125 victories and 50 losses in
the regular season and post-season combined, shattering the
previous record of 118. Their winning percentage of .714 is the
third best in history for World Series winners, behind the 1927
Yankees (.722) and the 1909 Pittsburgh Pirates (.717).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will be honored with a parade that will begin at
11:30 a.m. Friday in Battery Park and extend up Broadway to City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees took a 1-0 lead in the sixth inning on Bernie
Williams' groundout, then added two runs in the eighth inning
against Brown on two walks and two hits, including a run-scoring
single by Scott Brosius, who was named most valuable player of the
Series. When the top of the eighth inning was over with the Yankees
leading by 3-0, Brown walked off the field and sarcastically tipped
his cap to an umpire, upset over an earlier call and defiant to the
end.
</P>
<P>
   In the Padres' eighth, Pettitte walked Quilvio Veras and allowed
a single to Tony Gwynn with one out, and the crowd of 65,427 _ the
largest ever to see a baseball game in this city _ was screaming
for a comeback. Right-hander Jeff Nelson relieved Pettitte and
struck out the right-handed-hitting Greg Vaughn, but when Nelson
fell behind switch-hitter Ken Caminiti, two balls and no strikes,
Torre called for his closer, Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti lined a single to right field and Paul O'Neill fired
the ball into second base, conceding the run. But Tim Flannery, the
San Diego coach, had stopped Veras at third, and so the bases were
loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz, the former Yankee with a taste for cowboy boots and
a penchant for post-season home runs, ambled to the plate, the
potential lead run. But Leyritz lined out to Williams in center
field, an out that effectively finished the Padres and Brown and
guaranteed the Yankees' their legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball glory engulfed the Yankees after Mark Sweeney grounded
to third base with two out in the ninth and Brosius threw to first
base for the final out, then threw his hands into the air. Rivera
dropped to his knees near the mound, and the other Yankees piled on
him.

   The Yankee catchers, Joe Girardi and Jorge Posada, jumped and
high-fived each other, and they all hugged. Chuck Knoblauch, the
smallest Yankee, was lifted off his feet over and over.

   The Padres' relievers walked off the field as the Yankees

 SAN DIEGO: George Steinbrenner. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brown was fighting a sinus infection and the Yankees in Game 1
last Saturday, and eventually both wore on him. The Yankee hitters
patiently waited for him to throw strikes, and Brown threw 64
pitches in the first 3 innings. After the fifth inning, he was bent
over in the runway to the clubhouse, feeling horrible, warning the
coaching staff that he might need relief in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Brown made it to the seventh and fell apart, and the Yankees
scored seven runs in the inning. Over the last few days, Brown was
rarely seen on the field, remaining in the clubhouse and receiving
treatment. He went to the mound Wednesday night apparently feeling
much better, stronger, more capable of coping with the Yankee
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing a variety of fastballs _ sinkers, cutters, four-seamers
_ that ranged from 88 to 96 mph, Brown dominated the Yankees early,
needing only 45 pitches to get through the first four innings. When
waiting for a sign from catcher Carlos Hernandez, Brown would stand
with his legs slightly apart, mouth turned down, arms hanging, a
gunfighter's stance, a pitcher with a gunfighter's mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte was far less overpowering, but no less effective, and
he donned his own peculiar stare _ cap curled low as if to hide his
eyes, mouth turned down, shoulders square. Right away, Pettitte
learned that the baseball gods had been kind to him: To succeed, he
needs a home-plate umpire who will call strikes on fastballs low
and away from right-handed batters. Durwood Merrill, the umpire in
Game 2 of the American League division series, had an extremely
wide strike zone and Pettitte thrived against Texas, allowing one
run in seven innings. When Pettitte pitched Game 3 of the AL
Championship Series, John Shulock interpreted the strike zone
strictly, giving pitchers almost nothing off the outside corner.
Cleveland pounded Pettitte for four home runs in four and
two-thirds innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching to Veras in the Padres' first Wednesday night, Pettitte
threw a sinking fastball low and away. Strike 1, said the plate
umpire, Dana DeMuth, and Pettitte had the kind of target he could
throw to time and again. He got 10 ground-ball outs in the first
five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte did flirt with trouble in the second inning, walking
Leyritz with one out. Ruben Rivera hit a chopper through the middle
that glanced off Pettitte's glove and away from shortstop Derek
Jeter. Leyritz stopped at second.
</P>
<P>
   Using his curveball, Pettitte struck out Hernandez, but with
Brown on deck, Pettitte pitched around the No. 8 hitter Chris
Gomez, loading the bases. Brown is a good hitter, and yet he tried
to drop a bunt, pushing the ball about 10 feet in front of home
plate. Girardi scrambled from behind the plate and threw to first
for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Pettitte dueled through the fourth _ when Jeter got
the Yankees' first hit _ and through the fifth _ when the Yankees
had runners on second and third and one out and could not score
because Girardi grounded back to Brown, the runners holding, and
Pettitte struck out.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees broke through in the sixth. With one out, Jeter
hit a high bouncer toward shortstop and, running hard all the way,
as he always does, easily beat the throw from Gomez. Then O'Neill,
his World Series batting average hovering barely above .100, turned
on a low fastball and pulled it into the right-field corner, the
ball skidding on the hard outfield surface and reaching the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter raced around second, turned at third and stopped, while
O'Neill rambled into second base. With one out, the Padres infield
played in, an attempt to prevent Jeter from scoring the game's
first run.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who acknowledged before the game that this might be
his last one with the Yankees, swung fully and bounced a chopper
off the plate, the ball caroming high toward the pitcher's mound.
Moving on contact, Jeter broke from third. Brown waited for the
chopper to come down, then leaped and reached with his bare right
hand to grab the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Brown glanced homeward, but Jeter was already knocking Hernandez
off his feet with a slide, and Brown had to settle for an out,
throwing to first. The Yankees scored 965 runs in the regular
season, another 59 in their first 10 games of the post-season, but
it was this particular run that put them ahead in the game they
were playing for the championship they had been seeking since
reporting to spring training in February.
</P>
<P>
   Brown pitched out of further trouble, striking out Brosius to
end the inning. Now it was a matter of whether Pettitte and his
support could hold the lead.

SERIES VICTORY CAPS OFF YANKEES' STUNNING SEASON
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ On the night the Yankees won the World Series with a
four-game sweep of the San Diego Padres, the outfielders for both
teams could almost have taken the night off. That was the kind of
game Andy Pettitte and Kevin Brown pitched.
</P>
<P>
   With both pitching brilliantly and allowing few balls to travel
beyond the infield, the Yankees won, 3-0, scoring their first run
on _ what else _ an infield out. And Derek Jeter, who scored the
run, reached base on _ of course _ an infield hit. Not to mention
that when the Padres threatened to tie the score in the seventh
inning, the key play that foiled their attempt was an infield
bouncer that Pettitte snared.
</P>
<P>
   So the Yankees ended their improbably great year as they played
most of it, beating teams with good pitching and airtight defense.
The kind of hitting they produced in winning 114 games during the
regular season, the hitting that helped produce a remarkable run
differential of 309, did not emerge last night.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte, who had a statistically successful but
artistically shaky season, showed that one was the only
differential he needed in sparking the Yankees to victory No. 125.
His performance was reminiscent of the 1-0 victory he pitched
against Atlanta in Game 5 of the 1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But this game was unusual for its follow-the-bouncing ball
pattern. To be sure, some balls reached the outfield. The two runs
the Yankees scored in the eighth inning that iced the game and the
Series came on such balls, though the run-scoring single by Scott
Brosius barely looped over the infield and Paul O'Neill helped load
the bases with an infield single.
</P>
<P>
   When Chris Gomez hit a fly ball to O'Neill in right field for
the final out in the seventh inning, it was only the second out the
Yankees had recorded in the outfield, the first since Greg Vaughn's
fly ball to Ricky Ledee in left field that ended the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Pettitte got 15 outs in the infield, four on balls
hit back to him, and he struck out four. Brown, in his eight
innings of pitching, also fielded four grounders for outs, induced
nine other infield outs, struck out eight and permitted the Yankees
only three outfield outs.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning, the Yankees batted baseballs to the
outfield twice. Tino Martinez led off by lining a single through
the infield to left field, and after Brosius took a third strike,
Ledee lined a double to right field. Suddenly the Yankees had their
first scoring chance of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Girardi rapped a one-bouncer back at Brown, who checked
Martinez at third before turning and throwing out Girardi at first.
He then struck out Pettitte, ending the threat. The Yankees,
however, would not be deterred.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the sixth, they resumed their infield attack.
Jeter hit a slow bouncer toward short and just beat the throw from
Gomez for a single. O'Neill then lashed a double to right, and
Jeter scooted to third.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams was the next batter, and he hit a high bouncer
to the mound. Brown, who had fielded three previous bouncers and
turned them into outs, reached up for the ball and grabbed it with
his bare hand. He looked home but saw he had no play there, so he
threw to first base to get Williams, though he got him on a
questionable call by Umpire Tim Tschida.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who had broken from third as soon as Williams had swung,
scored the first run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres had taken their shot at scoring with infield help in
the second inning. After Ken Caminiti grounded out, Jim Leyritz
walked and Ruben Rivera rapped a high bouncer back at the mound.
Pettitte jumped for the ball and got his glove on it, but he
couldn't hold it and the hit put Padres at first and second.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte struck out Carlos Hernandez for the second out, but he
pitched around Gomez, walking him on four pitches and loading the
bases for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher, who batted .207 during the season, decided to keep
the ball deliberately in the infield. With one strike, he bunted up
the first base line, but the ball didn't travel far and Girardi
pounced on the ball and easily threw him out.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning Gomez hit a bouncer back at Pettitte that
struck him on his left leg, but he quickly grabbed the rebound and
threw out Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn began the next inning with a roller toward first.
Martinez fielded the ball and dived for Gwynn, but the crafty
veteran slid and hooked the base with his left foot. The single did
not help. Two ensuing grounders produced a forceout and a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the seventh that the Padres staged their most serious
threat since the second.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz began the inning appropriately enough by grounding out
to first on a close play. But then Rivera hit a double to right.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte then reverted to the pattern that had worked, inducing
Hernandez to hit a bouncer back to him. He fielded the ball and
turned to see where Rivera was, and when he saw the runner far
enough off second, he threw there, and Rivera was out in the
ensuing rundown.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez batted next and actually hit the ball to the outfield, but
O'Neill caught it for the third out, and the Yankees went to bat
and scored two more runs to clinch the final victory of their
glorious season.

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Brian Cashman was still an assistant general manager
with the Yankees when an official from the Oakland Athletics raised
the possibility of trading Scott Brosius to New York last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Cashman told Billy Beane, then assistant
general manager for Oakland. ``But let me check with my people.''
Cashman was negotiating, of course, immediately responding with
lack of interest. But Cashman had communicated his own instincts as
well: No way. He knew Brosius was coming off a bad year, and he
knew Brosius would be in line to make a decent salary.
</P>
<P>
   After Cashman and Bob Watson, then the Yankee general manager,
checked with their scouts, others assured them that Brosius was
worth having _ and the rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius hammered two home runs Tuesday night in Game 3 of the
World Series and singled home the third run of the game Wednesday
night to help the Yankees wrap up their 24th title. It also helped
Brosius nail down the Series most valuable player award; he
finished with 8 hits in 17 times up (.471), including two homers
and six runs batted in. For the 13-game postseason, Brosius batted
.383 with six homers and 15 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius batted .300 and drove in 98 runs during the regular
season. In the estimation of his teammate Derek Jeter, he has been
the team's MVP _ a pleasant surprise to club executives, who had
hoped only that Brosius would play solid defense and contribute a
few hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know exactly what Scott Brosius was all about,''
said Joe Torre, the Yankee manager. ``You pick up a press guide and
you see numbers, and last year he wasn't that good.''
</P>
<P>
   An understatement: Brosius was terrible for Oakland in 1997, a
year in which ``everything that could go bad did,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything from just at times swinging the bat horribly to
other times swinging the bat pretty good and being unlucky, and
just not feeling real healthy, either,'' Brosius said. ``It was
just one of those things that kind of snowballed, and I was never
able to come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius batted .203 with 11 home runs and 41 RBI, with others on
the team feeling as if Brosius' quiet intensity hampered him as his
slump deepened. He had batted .304 in 1996, hitting 22 home runs,
but given his age of 31, it was easy to speculate he was in
decline.
</P>
<P>
   When Beane called Cashman after the 1997 season and told him the
Athletics were intent on trading Brosius before the Nov. 18
expansion draft, Cashman had his doubts. But the Yankees needed a
third baseman, having determined to allow the aging Wade Boggs to
depart as a free agent, and to exile Charlie Hayes. Cashman called
Ron Brand, the Yankees' West Coast scout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy can play,'' Brand told Cashman, noting Brosius'
strong defense and the fact that he always played hard and was well
liked by teammates. Even if Brosius doesn't hit enough to be the
everyday third baseman, Brand told Cashman, he could be an
exceptional utilityman, because he could play just about any
position.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Brand said: ``I heard some guys talk about how he was
complaining, but I never saw that in the way he played. I never saw
him complaining in the paper. He was always very gracious. He's a
model citizen. I figured he just had an off year.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was arranged: The Yankees sent Kenny Rogers and $5
million to Oakland for Brosius, who agreed to a $2.5 million
contract for 1998. But the Yankees wanted protection, as well, and
signed Dale Sveum to a two-year contract; they knew, too, that the
minor leaguer Mike Lowell could be an option.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of spring training, Brosius had won the third-base
job and Torre was talking about how Brosius was the best he had
ever seen at charging in and barehanding grounders and throwing to
first. He batted .263 in April, but on April 22, he drove in five
runs against Toronto's Roger Clemens with three hits. This is a
guy, Cashman thought to himself, that can get big hits, and Brosius
exploded in May, batting .396.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius can be a free agent after this season, and his agent had
cursory talks with the Yankees in June and July. Lowell is waiting
for his chance, coming off an exceptional season with Class AAA
Columbus, but re-signing Brosius appears to be a priority in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   He figures to be in line for a three-year deal, perhaps for
something in the range of $4 million to $5 million a season, and
has indicated he would take less than his market value to remain
with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipate we'll knock it out,'' said Cashman, who must also
negotiate with free agent-to-be Bernie Williams. ``Ultimately, we'd
like to keep him, though we're protected with Lowell coming up.''

CAMINITI'S MERE PRESENCE WASN'T ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ His back was so sore, he could hardly bend over. His
knees and quadriceps ached so much, he could barely swing without
falling down.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Ken Caminiti would never say how hurt he was,
there were those who felt the San Diego Padres' third baseman was
hurting his team in the World Series when he insisted on playing
through the pain.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres never bought into that argument. Caminiti is their
cleanup hitter and one of their motivational leaders in the
clubhouse. As San Diego General Manager Kevin Towers had said
before Wednesday night's Game 4: ``Cami's presence alone is a plus
for our club. And you would have a hard time dragging him out of
the lineup, anyway. I'd rather tell one of you guys to go in and
tell him he was out.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Caminiti finally came through in his final at-bat in
the Series with a line single to right off Mariano Rivera to load
the bases in the bottom of the eighth, it was too little and it was
soon to be too late. Jim Leyritz followed with a hard-hit liner,
but straight at Bernie Williams. And the Padres could not avoid
becoming the 16th team in World Series history to be swept in four
games.
</P>
<P>
   For the series, Caminiti went 2 for 14 with 7 strikeouts, a
double and one RBI. To make matters worse, even though he is one of
the better fielding third basemen in the game, he made two crucial
errors. One was an overthrow that led to three Yankee runs in the
first inning of Game 2. The other came when it looked as if he
couldn't bend enough for a ball hit to his left that scored New
York's second run in the seventh-inning of a 5-4 Yankee victory in
Game 3 here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   And, in Game 3, Caminiti was playing with the bug that had beset
the San Diego clubhouse throughout the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better today,'' Caminiti said before Game 4, his
intense blue eyes burning as usual. ``I'm not complaining. I need
to start.''
</P>
<P>
   But, it was obvious the Padres needed some more production from
their brawny third baseman, who was the National League's Most
Valuable Player in 1996, to avoid being swept.
</P>
<P>
   After going 1 for 4, Caminiti, who hit .252 with 29 homers and
82 RBIs this season, might have been playing his final game with
the Padres here Wednesday night. He becomes a free agent, and there
is no guarantee that the Padres will be able to re-sign him,
especially if their Nov. 3 ball park initiative does not pass.
</P>
<P>
   But wherever he ends up next season, no one will ever question
Caminiti's toughness. He played nearly his entire MVP season with a
torn left rotator cuff that one doctor said was the worst he had
ever seen. In August of that same year, he unhooked a set of
intravenous needles from his body to hit a pair of homers against
the Mets in Mexico when he was suffering from dehydration, then
belted a grand slam the next day in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what this guy's played through,'' said Towers.
``He's violent, the way he plays. He's always on the ground. He
tackles runners on plays at third. He plays baseball like a middle
linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Yankees, Caminiti played like a middle linebacker
who was hurt. To which his manager, Bruce Bochy, simply shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did in '96, I questioned myself putting him in the
lineup. And he was the MVP,'' Bochy said before Wednesday night's
game. ``And he was hurt then more than now. He's not playing at 100
percent. But the only thing I can do is go on what my trainers
say.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Interestingly, the Padres' hitting coach, Merv Rettenmund, said
that playing with the torn rotator cuff in '96 may have helped
Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't overswing,'' Rettenmund said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is something Caminiti did for most of the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   In 14 games, covering all three rounds, the switch-hitting
Caminiti batted only .200 (10 for 50) with 14 strikeouts, two
homers and five RBIs. From the left side, he was an abysmal 4 for
26 (.154).
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti was down on himself even after the Padres won their
division series matchup with the Houston Astros. And after Tuesday
night's game, Caminiti _ who has always been accessible to the news
media after games _ slammed the door to the players' lounge after
undergoing treatment on the side of his left knee, where he had
fouled a ball off during an eighth-inning at-bat, when he struck
out against Mariano Rivera with the tying run on base.

MIDEAST TALKS PUNCTUATED BY INCREASING TENSION AND BRINKSMANSHIP

<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ For all the American efforts to envelop Middle
East talks in a rustic and secluded setting at the Wye Plantation,
the smoke signals issuing from behind the police barricades have
spelled a steady increase in tension, frustration and brinkmanship,
building up to the pillar of flame that erupted on Wednesday when
the Israelis angrily threatened to bail out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a critical moment in terms of intensity and
importance,'' conceded James Rubin, the State Department spokesman,
in some of the strongest language to emerge from his studiously
bland briefings _ officially the only sanctioned source of
information here. Rubin's other morsel for the day was that the
Americans intended to present their version of a potential
settlement to both sides on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Rubin made the two-mile voyage to the community
college where reporters were keeping vigil, the Israelis had raised
the alarm. Briefing Israeli reporters in time to make evening
newscasts back home, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman,
Aviv Bushinsky, declared that the Israeli delegation intended to
pull out unless demands were met for the revision of the
Palestinian Charter and the extradition of Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The threats built through the day. The Israelis set a 10 p.m.
deadline for their departure from Wye Mills, and a midnight takeoff
from the airport. They demonstratively moved bags into vans when
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright came over to their lodgings
for another hour of talk with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians kept pace with the Israelis. Yasser Arafat's
spokesman, Dr. Ahmed Tibi, was not far behind Bushinsky on the lawn
outside the community college. He described in soothing tones how
Arafat had sent over a bouquet for Netanyahu's 49th birthday on
Wednesday, and how the Palestinians welcomed the American proposal,
and how the Israeli threat was ``a political game.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before 10 p.m., Netanyahu blinked, issuing a terse
statement saying he had ``instructed the delegation to continue
talks.'' To temper the impression that Netanyahu had threatened to
walk out on the Americans, the statement added, ``the prime
minister values the efforts invested by President Clinton and the
secretary of state to advocate the goal of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave no indication what had changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fact of most negotiations, and certainly of all the
bitter Israeli-Palestinian talks since Netanyahu came to power,
that all is not as the participants would try to make it. What
emerged from the day's threats, ultimatums and statements was a
high-powered end-game in which feints, image and politics were at
least as important as substance.
</P>
<P>
   According to participants at the conference, the ``document''
that the Americans were to present to the conference on Wednesday
was in fact shown to both sides Tuesday evening, and the document
prompted the Israeli tantrum _ which, in turn, was probably a play
to pressure the Americans into twisting a few more concessions out
of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Rubin made his next briefing at 6:20 p.m. _ over a
speakerphone, this time _ no American document had actually
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   The reality behind the drama was that after long resisting and
dodging American persuasions, Netanyahu's back was against the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Americans had mounted some of the most formidable
pressure the Clinton administration has ever unleashed on any
front. President Clinton himself had spent 57 hours talking and
eating with the Israeli and Palestinian delegations _ in the heat
of a critical national campaign. Albright had spent the entire
``seven days and seven nights'' _ as Rubin intoned a few times _ at
Wye, and even the ailing icon of the Middle East, King Hussein of
Jordan, arose from his sickbed to plead for peace.
</P>
<P>
   This time, too, Netanyahu could not count on his supporters
among congressmen and American Jews to push Clinton off. Americans
were wrapped up in the campaign, and the Israelis and Palestinians
had come willingly to Wye, all professing total commitment to
making peace.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from the scope and intensity, the basic dance at Wye
was the same it had been for so many months _ Americans talking
alternatively to Palestinians and Israelis, back and forth, trying
to find that elusive formula that would enable both to claim
victory. By all accounts, the few direct encounters between Arafat
and Netanyahu were formalities.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the focus was on Netanyahu. Essentially, he was down
to three choices: to accept the American plan, and face the
inevitable rebellion from his constituents; to reject it, and face
the inevitable denunciation of political opponents and much of the
world, or to play for more time. The Americans and Palestinians
seemed equally determined to cut off the last option, with the
Americans demanding a response to their document, and the
Palestinians rejecting any partial agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, the Jewish settlers were preparing a nasty welcome if
Netanyahu did agree to a deal. Leaders of the settlers' council,
Aharon Domb and Pinhas Wallerstein, were on their way back from
Wye, raising the alarm that ``almost all of the Israeli demands to
the negotiations have collapsed and Israel is conceding on all
fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though the opposition Labor Party had pledged to support an
agreement, there was no guarantee that it would not join with the
right on the very next vote to force new elections.
</P>
<P>
   In all the drama, the least mystery was the outline of the plan.
As Rubin acknowledged, it was essentially the same package the
Americans have proposed for several months _ a staged Israeli
pull-out from 13 percent of the West Bank accompanied by a series
of concrete Palestinian actions against terrorists, all monitored
by the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   For the Israelis, the critical issue was also to ensure that
Arafat would not proclaim a state next May, as he has threatened to
do when the Oslo agreements run out. And for Netanyahu, a key
requirement was to demonstrate, if he did strike a deal, that the
19-month delay had resulted in the ``peace with security'' that he
had promised.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Netanyahu's lieutenants repeated again and again that
Israel was giving something concrete, land, and thus expected
equally concrete security assurances in return.
</P>
<P>
   To round out their position, the Israelis demanded further
revisions of the Palestinian national charter and a reduction of
the Palestinian police forces. As in all past negotiations, the
Israelis also dangled before the Palestinians the prospect of
letting them open their airport in Gaza and traveling freely
between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat likewise issued demands intended to demonstrate to his
increasingly frustrated people that he was playing tough. He issued
new demands for the release of prisoners and resisted demands for
the reduction of his police force. The Palestinians also refused to
release the Israelis from their obligation under the Oslo
agreements to make yet a third withdrawal from the West Bank before
a final settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat's central strategy, as it has been for many months
now, has been to agree with most anything the Americans proffer,
essentially forcing the Israelis into the position of repeatedly
locking horns with the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The steps were familiar. Only in the quiet, pretty setting of
the Chesapeake farmlands, it was finally evident that this dance,
at least, had come to an end.

TOO MANY PENALTIES PUT ISLES IN A BOX 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The Islanders couldn't keep out of the penalty
box, and as a result, couldn't keep the puck out of their net.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up two power-play goals early in Wednesday night's
game, the Islanders lost focus, then lost to the Edmonton Oilers,
4-2, before another sparse crowd at Nassau Coliseum. The attendance
figure was not announced, but there appeared to be fewer than 3,000
fans in the seats, an embarrassingly small number even on a night
when the Yankees won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the third period, the Islanders were losing,
3-0, but managed to make a game of it late, cutting their deficit
to 3-2 on goals by Trevor Linden and Kenny Jonsson. But the Oilers
(3-3) got an empty-net goal from Boyd Devereaux, his second score
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had good jump at the start of the game,'' said
Mike Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general manager. ``But when
you have six minor penalties in the first few minutes, you can't
get into any kind of a rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   The first period saw the Islanders (2-3) play their best hockey
of this young season. But they left the ice down by 1-0, foiled by
senseless penalties. After putting 10 quality shots on Oilers
goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov, and getting as many quality saves from
Tommy Salo, the Islanders found themselves in a four-on-three
situation. Gino Odjick was in the penalty box for interference and
Kevin Miller was called for a high stick. The result was a
power-play goal by Pat Falloon.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties kept coming, and so did Oilers' goals. Bill Guerin
scored another power-play goal at 7 minutes 5 seconds of the second
period and Boyd Devereaux tallied the Oilers' third goal at 12:08
of the period at even-strength.
</P>
<P>
   While the absence of a respectable turnout probably did not
contribute to Islanders' loss, it does take a toll on the players.
``It shouldn't bother us,'' said Claude Lapointe, ``but sometimes
its hard to play when you have five, six-thousand people.''

   SAN DIEGO _ Brian Cashman was still an assistant general manager
with the Yankees when an official from the Oakland Athletics raised
the possibility of trading Scott Brosius to New York last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Cashman told Billy Beane, then assistant
general manager for Oakland. ``But let me check with my people.''
Cashman was negotiating, of course, immediately responding with
lack of interest. But Cashman had communicated his own instincts as
well: No way. He knew Brosius was coming off a bad year, and he
knew Brosius would be in line to make a decent salary.
</P>
<P>
   After Cashman and Bob Watson, then the Yankee general manager,
checked with their scouts, others assured them that Brosius was
worth having _ and the rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius hammered two home runs Tuesday night in Game 3 of the
World Series and singled home the third run of the game Wednesday
night to help the Yankees wrap up their 24th title. It also helped
Brosius nail down the Series most valuable player award; he
finished with 8 hits in 17 times up (.471), including two homers
and six runs batted in. For the 13-game postseason, Brosius batted
.383 with six homers and 15 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, a jubilant Brosius leaped in the air, then
joined the swarm of teammates who jumped on top of each other.
Later, in a jubilant Yankee clubhouse, he said, ``To come over here
like this, I just feel privileged to be a part of this team.''
Holding his MVP trophy, he said: ``I don't know what to do with
this thing. It's bigger and heavier than anything I've ever
gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius batted .300 and drove in 98 runs during the regular
season. In the estimation of his teammate Derek Jeter, he has been
the team's MVP _ a pleasant surprise to club executives, who had
hoped only that Brosius would play solid defense and contribute a
few hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know exactly what Scott Brosius was all about,''
said Joe Torre, the Yankee manager. ``You pick up a press guide and
you see numbers, and last year he wasn't that good.''
</P>
<P>
   An understatement: Brosius was terrible for Oakland in 1997, a
year in which ``everything that could go bad did,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything from just at times swinging the bat horribly to
other times swinging the bat pretty good and being unlucky, and
just not feeling real healthy, either,'' Brosius said. ``It was
just one of those things that kind of snowballed, and I was never
able to come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius batted .203 with 11 home runs and 41 RBI, with others on
the team feeling as if Brosius' quiet intensity hampered him as his
slump deepened. He had batted .304 in 1996, hitting 22 home runs,
but given his age of 31, it was easy to speculate he was in
decline.
</P>
<P>
   When Beane called Cashman after the 1997 season and told him the
Athletics were intent on trading Brosius before the Nov. 18
expansion draft, Cashman had his doubts. But the Yankees needed a
third baseman, having determined to allow the aging Wade Boggs to
depart as a free agent, and to exile Charlie Hayes. Cashman called
Ron Brand, the Yankees' West Coast scout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy can play,'' Brand told Cashman, noting Brosius'
strong defense and the fact that he always played hard and was well
liked by teammates. Even if Brosius doesn't hit enough to be the
everyday third baseman, Brand told Cashman, he could be an
exceptional utilityman, because he could play just about any
position.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Brand said: ``I heard some guys talk about how he was
complaining, but I never saw that in the way he played. I never saw
him complaining in the paper. He was always very gracious. He's a
model citizen. I figured he just had an off year.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was arranged: The Yankees sent Kenny Rogers and $5
million to Oakland for Brosius, who agreed to a $2.5 million
contract for 1998. But the Yankees wanted protection, as well, and
signed Dale Sveum to a two-year contract; they knew, too, that the
minor leaguer Mike Lowell could be an option.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of spring training, Brosius had won the third-base
job and Torre was talking about how Brosius was the best he had
ever seen at charging in and barehanding grounders and throwing to
first. He batted .263 in April, but on April 22, he drove in five
runs against Toronto's Roger Clemens with three hits. This is a
guy, Cashman thought to himself, that can get big hits, and Brosius
exploded in May, batting .396.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius can be a free agent after this season, and his agent had
cursory talks with the Yankees in June and July. Lowell is waiting
for his chance, coming off an exceptional season with Class AAA
Columbus, but re-signing Brosius appears to be a priority in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   He figures to be in line for a three-year deal, perhaps for
something in the range of $4 million to $5 million a season, and
has indicated he would take less than his market value to remain
with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipate we'll knock it out,'' said Cashman, who must also
negotiate with free agent-to-be Bernie Williams. ``Ultimately, we'd
like to keep him, though we're protected with Lowell coming up.''

1998 YANKEES CAPTURE PLACE IN HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO -- The world is like baseball's strike zone and
Calista Flockhart's waistline: It continues to shrink before our
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the wonders of technology, a baseball belted out of a
park in Southern California turns people's heads around the globe.
The sheer exposure afforded today's players at once enlarges their
celebrity and reduces their margin of error. It magnifies what the
New York Yankees have accomplished this year to the point where
this much is as obvious as the nose on manager Joe Torre's face:
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees are the pride of any season.
</P>
<P>
   From Antarctica to Zaire, more than 200 countries watched
Wednesday as the Yankees completed a four-game sweep of the San
Diego Padres in the 94th World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Global strife isn't covered by the number of correspondents who
descended upon Qualcomm Stadium for the climax of this Fall
Classic. There were 1,000 credentialed reporters scrutinizing and
second-guessing every pitch and every swing. There were 19 Fox
Network television cameras (not counting the catcher cam) recording
every facial tic, registering every emotion.
</P>
<P>
   During the revelation that was the Yankees' glorious 11-2
postseason, we saw right fielder Paul O'Neill throw his batting
helmet against a dugout wall and center fielder Bernie Williams
slip out a side door to avoid our prying questions. We heard people
ask pitcher David Wells about his night life and shortstop Derek
Jeter about his love life.
</P>
<P>
   The 1927 Yankees -- the team against which all others are
measured -- won 110 regular-season games and finished with a .714
winning percentage. En route to sweeping Pittsburgh in four games
in the World Series, those Bronx Bombers didn't have to worry about
being picked apart on sports talk radio by the likes of Benny from
Brooklyn or Harvey from Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Earle Combs were the fastball
killers on Murderers' Row, but they weren't pursued like fugitives
by television reporters from ESPN, Fox, Comedy Central and MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the postseason, Torre talked about the need for
players ``to sort of hide out'' to maintain their focus. Then he'd
return to a clubhouse that was more crowded than a New York subway
train at rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   In Ruth's day, players could hide behind a tumbler in a bar
without worrying about being exposed by reporters. Nowadays, it's
all the players can do to cover themselves with a towel before
their privacy is invaded.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the 1998 Yankees survived the scrutiny and thrived.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask Torre how they did it. He hasn't a clue. ``Even when
we were tense, we played well,'' he said. ``That's unusual in my
experience. That was a revelation to me, that guys aren't loose and
yet they still manage to win.''
</P>
<P>
   His Yankees won 114 regular-season games and matched the overall
winning percentage of the 1927 Yankees in a season that is now
eight games longer. Those Yankees had Ruth and Gehrig and Combs
(ital on)and(ital off) shortstop Mark Koenig, whose .500 batting
average in the World Series led all the hitters in pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Yankees had Williams, Tino Martinez and, until he
was diagnosed with colon cancer, Darryl Strawberry, but also Scott
Brosius who batted .538 in the first three games of the Series.
</P>
<P>
   The unsung heroes of the 1927 Yankees were their starting
pitchers: Waite Hoyte, George Pipgras, Herb Pennock and Wilcy
Moore. So it was with the 1998 Yankees' rotation of Wells, Orlando
Hernandez, David Cone and Andy Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   Are Torre's Yankees better than Miller Huggins' men of 1927?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you hear about those guys a lot,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Torre wears the pinstripes too well to tread over the legacy of
any Yankee team.
</P>
<P>
   But all things being equal, the nod has to go to the 1998 team
because of the one significant thing that distinguishes the two.
The 1927 Yankees didn't have an African-American on their roster.
Or a Latin American. The major-league teams in those days excluded
some wonderfully talented players from the game's fraternity and
even the greatest teams of those days were poorer for it.
</P>
<P>
   This year's squad is as diverse as the boroughs surrounding
Yankee Stadium. Williams, who won the American League batting
crown, is from Puerto Rico. The winning pitcher in Game 2,
Hernandez, is a Cuban who sailed to freedom on a leaky boat last
December. There also are players on the roster from Japan,
Australia, Panama and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   The first four batters from the 1927 team are immortalized in
the Hall of Fame. The ballots are out on Chuck Knoblauch, Derek
Jeter, O'Neill and Williams, but this much Torre knows for certain:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrific ballclub when it comes to self-motivation and
determination, like no other club I've ever been around,'' said
Torre, who has managed 17 seasons for four different organizations.
``These players have an inner security about them. They know
they're good but they don't really care about telling people how
good they are.''
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, the 1998 Yankees are very much a reflection of
their manager. Torre was a league MVP in 1971 and a part-time
player a couple of years after that. So he can relate to the stars
on his team but also has an empathetic touch with the journeyman
players.
</P>
<P>
   All year Torre had people telling him how good his Yankees were.
Now he should feel free to agree. They're quite simply the best.

EDITORIAL: MUZZLING DISSENT IN SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 22:
</P>
<P>
   While the West's attention is fixed on Kosovo, Slobodan
Milosevic is stilling independent voices inside Serbia. On Tuesday
Serbia's parliament passed a suffocating new law on the media, the
latest in a series of threats and actions against dissenters there.
As always, Milosevic's timing is diabolically clever. Western
officials have not sufficiently criticized these attacks on
Serbia's civil society, afraid to anger the leader they need to
deliver a deal on Kosovo. Washington has not yet realized that
these independent activists are essential to the development of a
democratic Serbia, the best way to break Milosevic's power.
</P>
<P>
   The new media law bans the broadcast of Serbian-language foreign
programs from services such as the Voice of America or BBC, which
need local transmission to reach listeners without shortwave
radios. It allows the government to level instant fines, minimum
$40,000, on media that it decides have violated any of a long list
of vague rules. One such fine would be enough to close any
independent newspaper or radio station. The new law comes after
Serbia's government closed three newspapers and two radio stations
and stripped several broadcast stations of their frequencies
earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   The media are the heart of Serbia's civil society, but other
sectors have suffered as well. Another law took away the autonomy
of Serbia's universities, allowing the government to appoint deans
who control hiring and can dismiss any professor. The far-right
nationalist who is deputy prime minister, Vojislav Seselj, has said
that independent journalists, human rights workers and antiwar
activists were spies for the West and would be taken as hostages if
NATO carried out its bombing threats.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's opposition political parties have been crippled and
divided by Milosevic, but groups doing theater or journalism,
creating Internet sites or working for civil rights proliferate.
Although Milosevic has often imposed harsh restrictions on the
groups he finds threatening, he has not eradicated them. The
network of independent radio stations has 1.6 million listeners.
</P>
<P>
   These activists need more support from the West, both financial
and moral. When American and European diplomats meet Milosevic,
they should emphasize his suppression of dissent. Last week
Serbia's most prominent independent journalist, Veran Matic of
Radio B-92, said he had never met Washington's two top negotiators
on Kosovo. On Tuesday one of them, Ambassador Christopher Hill,
held a meeting with Matic and other journalists from the
independent media.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo talks would not suffer if such meetings were held
frequently. Most high-level diplomats who visit Belgrade see only
Milosevic and his men, which boosts his standing and sends the
message that the West does not care about Serbia's dissenters.
Independent groups are not the solution to the Kosovo problem, but
they may be the start of a solution to the Milosevic problem.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The night before Game 3 of the World Series here,
Yankee pitcher David Wells had an unexpected reunion with a group
of his friends and former teammates from Point Loma High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``His old baseball buddies arranged it,'' Don Cameron, Wells'
brother-in-law, said of the Monday get-together at the Brigantine
in Point Loma. ``I listened to all the great stories these guys
remembered from the 1981 and '82 seasons. Normally, when David's in
town, we get together in Ocean Beach, where he grew up. But I think
it would have been too big a scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Beach has remained much the same as when Wells grew up
there in the '70s and '80s. It is a ragged little beach
neighborhood that ends at the Pacific Ocean and is set apart from
hipper Pacific Beach and upscale La Jolla by the San Diego River
bed. Today, the main street of Newport Avenue has the same
buildings from 40 years ago, only the storefronts have changed to a
'90s look, with antique shops, pizza parlors, coffee shops and bars
like Cheswicks West and the Sunshine Co. Wells had been drinking at
Cheswicks West the night he broke his pitching hand in a fistfight
in December 1996, soon after signing with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheswicks, Sunshine Co., they are meeting places,'' said
Antonio (T.J.) Johnson, a 46-year-old actor, Wells' friend since
they played basketball at the O.B. Recreation Center in the late
'70s. ``Everything about this town comes through here. We don't
work hard at life in Ocean Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   On any day or night in O.B., as the regulars call it, different
types of people can be found along Newport Avenue. It is not
unusual to see teen-agers dressed like flower children mixing with
a Hell's Angels motorcycle gang, or a Little League team eating ice
cream nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say it's a rough crowd in O.B.,'' said John Holmes, 47,
a salesman in Ocean Beach and Wells' friend from the O.B. Bums
basketball league. ``That's overrated. O.B. isn't a community; it
is an attitude that has its own rules. If a car is stopped in the
middle of the street on Newport, an Obeatian doesn't honk. They
wait. Go with the flow. It's so cool. David floats in here and
doesn't flaunt his greatness. He's the same today as back then _
and that was a brash, cool kid, who was super street-smart and
spoke his mind at 15 years old. No one told him what to do. Except
Attitude Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   Annie, Wells' mother, died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the stories printed,'' Cameron said, ``Annie was a good
mother. She knew David was special in baseball. She stayed on him
and got him to practice. He always had food on the table. It's true
she had attitude _ she ran with a rough group of guys, the Hell's
Angels. On any day, you could see 20 bikes outside David's house.
He grew up with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But David Wells is what he is today because of his childhood.
He wasn't arrogant; he had confidence that the Hell's Angels
buddies would back him up on the street. At his high school games,
you visualize parents watching their kid play. Well, David's crowd
was different. Twelve or 15 bikers would motor up for the game with
Annie. David was never embarrassed. He loved his mother, just like
he loves his friends. And his talent, well, he was a major leaguer
at 9 years old, with the best arm any of us ever saw.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Wells, 35, who was scheduled to pitch Game 5 of
the World Series on Thursday if necessary, has never forgotten his
roots. David Camara, 34, was a center fielder on Wells' Point Loma
High Pointer team that won a county championship in 1982. He
accompanied Wells and Wells' 6-year-old son, Brandon, to Disneyland
last summer when the Yankees were playing the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, we did all the teen-age things,'' said Camara,
a bread distributor in San Diego, ``cruised the beach, played
basketball, went to the senior prom. David used to ride his bike to
school each morning or we'd pick him up. He was always a natural
pitcher, but he didn't dominate until high school. He could throw
the football 70 yards. Sports was his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Wells and a friend cruised the beach and had
lunch at a delicatessen. It seems that all of Wells' friends have
remained in contact with him throughout his baseball career. And
all of them have stories to tell that have made Wells a legend in
Ocean Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember we were in the '82 season playing an important
game,'' Camara said. ``It was the fifth or sixth inning and Dave
walked off the mound and brought me in from center field. `Hey,' he
said, `I'm going to walk the first three guys and strike out the
next three.' `No, don't,' I said. He walked the first three, then
turned and gave me a nod. He struck out the next three and laughed.
That's the O.B. attitude. New York's got to know that you can't
take the O.B. out of Dave.''

EDITORIAL: FOR CONGRESS FROM NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 22:
</P>
<P>
   There are more members of Congress from New York City and its
suburbs running uncontested this year than facing serious
opposition. But an election still presents an opportunity to
evaluate the incumbents. Here are our endorsements in some of the
more interesting local races:
</P>
<P>
   Fourth District (Nassau County): Carolyn McCarthy's
transformation from nurse-housewife to gun control advocate to
member of Congress was one of the most dramatic stories of the 1996
political year. Now Mrs. McCarthy, a Democrat, is running for
re-election and she has the right to boast that she has become more
than a one-issue lawmaker. Mrs. McCarthy has worked hard on
constituent services and broadened her concerns in Congress to
education and health issues, while compiling an impressive record
of support for the environment. Her opponent, Gregory Becker, is a
longtime state Assemblyman whose main rationale for running seems
simply to be that the district ought to be under the control of the
Republican Party. We are impressed by the degree to which Mrs.
McCarthy has grown in office, and we give her our enthusiastic
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth District (parts of Queens and the Bronx): Voters who feel
that political power brokers are elbowing them out of the
decision-making process have no farther to look than this district,
where veteran incumbent Thomas Manton engineered a transfer of
power to his chosen successor in the middle of the night, at a time
when it was too late for other Democrats to file for a primary or
for Republicans to nominate a serious opponent. The beneficiary of
Manton's scheme, Joseph Crowley, is a 36-year-old member of the
state Assembly whose main exertion seems to have been promoting the
racing industry. Crowley, a personable Democrat with deep roots in
Queens politics, will almost certainly be elected to Congress,
since the Republican Party is giving no support to its nominee,
James Dillon, a maverick. Dillon should be commended for his effort
to give voters more of an option than the local political machines
seem to have intended. But his positions on tax policy are extreme
and his platform on foreign policy seems to call for American
isolationism, except in regard to countries whose ethnic groups are
represented in the district. Despite our reservations about the
illegitimate way in which he obtained the nomination, we
reluctantly endorse Crowley and hope Queens voters will get more
respectful treatment in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteenth District (part of Brooklyn and Staten Island):
Freshman Republican Vito Fossella quickly established himself as a
loyal foot soldier for Speaker Newt Gingrich. We have disagreed
with Fossella on a number of fronts, including his extreme
opposition to abortion rights and family planning. He also opposes
requiring federal employee health plans to cover contraceptives for
women, just as they cover other prescriptive drugs. But Fossella's
most unforgivable failure was his persistent attempts to sabotage
bipartisan efforts to pass a campaign finance reform bill. Eugene
Prisco, a Democrat and Staten Island schoolteacher, is a long shot
at best in this race. But he has been a lifelong fighter for reform
and has a sensible list of priorities including school construction
aid and environmental protection. He gets our strong endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-Sixth District (Lower Hudson Valley to Ulster County, the
Catskills and north to Ithaca): Incumbent Democrat Maurice
Hinchey's district is larger than Connecticut, and includes both
troubled industrial cities and tourist resorts. During his three
terms in Congress, Hinchey has represented this diverse territory
well with an agenda that combines economic development and a
staunch support for the environment. Along with Sherwood Boehlert
of Utica, a Republican, Hinchey has set the pace for
environmentalism in the New York Congressional delegation. His
Republican opponent, William Walker, an apple farmer who owns
several upstate radio stations, has no real experience in
government. Hinchey has served his district well and should be
returned to Congress.

DODGERS TO OFFER DAVEY JOHNSON MANAGER POST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MATT MCHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO -- The Los Angeles Dodgers will offer Davey Johnson
the job as their new manager, team and baseball sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who won the 1986 World Series title with the New York
Mets and division championships in Cincinnati and Baltimore during
the past four years, becomes just the fifth manager during the
Dodgers' 40 years in Los Angeles, but the third in less than five
months.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 53, was selected over Kevin Kennedy, the product of
Woodland Hills, Calif.'s Taft High School who has managed the Texas
Rangers and Boston Red Sox and now is working as a commentator for
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Well-known for turning ballclubs around quickly, Johnson
inherits a team that finished 83-79 in 1998 but whose
underachieving led to the trading of franchise player Mike Piazza
and the firings of manager Bill Russell and General Manager Fred
Claire.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will be offered the job today, less than 24 hours after
the New York Yankees closed out the 1998 World Series with a 3-0
victory over the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who recently has lobbied for the post, is scheduled to
fly to Los Angeles today and will be introduced Friday during a
news conference at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers General Manager Kevin Malone refused to comment
Wednesday on Johnson's hiring as he was leaving Qualcomm Stadium.
``We will talk to (the team's ownership) in the morning, and I
think we can move quickly from there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did not return phone calls to his home in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Major League Baseball rules prohibiting any major
announcements during the World Series, Malone used the past several
days to confer with club President Bob Graziano and representatives
from the new owners at Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano attended Tuesday's Game 3 in San Diego and was
scheduled to return to Los Angeles before Game 4. But with the
decision on Johnson pending, Graziano stayed and watched the game
with Malone, new farm-club director Bill Geivett and Malone
assistant Ed Creech.
</P>
<P>
   Since Johnson interviewed with the Dodgers on Saturday in New
York, Malone has been in regular contact with Fox executives Peter
Chernin and Chase Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Malone had been turned down by Felipe Alou, who decided to stay
with the Montreal Expos. Amid speculation that Malone was angling
for managers tied to other teams, San Francisco's Dusty Baker and
Minnesota's Tom Kelly said they did not want to manage the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who returned home to the Los Angeles suburb of Tarzana
on Wednesday night, said he had not heard from the Dodgers. He was
a minor-league field coordinator in 1994 when Malone was the Expos'
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the manager in Baltimore during the 1996 and '97
seasons and twice led the Orioles to the American League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Malone called Johnson a maverick who brings out the best in
teams but often runs afoul of upper management.
</P>
<P>
   He clashed with the Cincinnati Reds' fiery owner, Marge Schott,
and was let go after the Reds went 85-59 in 1995 and defeated the
Dodgers in the National League division series.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson quickly was hired by the Orioles and won 88 games in
1996 and 98 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He battled with Bobby Bonilla -- now with the Dodgers -- over
Bonilla's use as a designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's biggest problems were with outspoken owner Peter
Angelos, who overruled several trades Johnson had encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was the assistant general manager in Baltimore during
Johnson's tenure with the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was out of baseball this season. In 10 years as a
major-league manager, he has a .575 winning percentage, tops among
active managers.

`DON ZIMMER ATE MY HOMEWORK' AND OTHER TALES FROM GAME 4 ON FOX
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In two instances on Wednesday night, Fox's Joe Buck showed why
he is a delight.
</P>
<P>
   When Kevin Brown struck out his 42d batter of the playoffs, Buck
quickly noted that the Padres' starter had set a post-season
record. Then, he gave voice to anybody thinking about the playoff
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``That comes with a gigantic asterisk,'' he said. ``Kevin Brown
has had many more opportunities to rack up strikeouts with this
playoff format.''
</P>
<P>
   A few innings later, Buck related how Jimmy D'Angelo became a
Yankees batboy, and speculated upon an apt alibi for any missed
schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear, Don Zimmer ate my homework,'' Buck said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Buck, Fox almost always hit the right notes on Wednesday
night during Game 4 of the World Series. This crew misses little.
It could be Tim McCarver using a double-boxed screen to chart the
contact play that led to Derek Jeter's scoring the Yankees' first
run on a ball chopped high off home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it could be Bob Brenly suggesting before the game that Andy
Pettitte should use his cut fastball less frequently, or noting how
Jeter keeps his right hand close to his glove to ease the transfer
to a throw.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Brenly and McCarver, former catchers, is like
auditing a class in mastering the crafts of pitching to spots,
blocking balls in the dirt, framing balls outside the strike zone
and guessing catchers' signs.
</P>
<P>
   They excelled especially in parsing Brown's herky-jerky motion,
which, Brenly said, forces batters to speed their swing on
fastballs or changeups.
</P>
<P>
   And you can always sense that almost anything that the three
announcers describe will be amplified with the right live picture
from the director, Bill Webb, or the apt replay, from the producer
John Filippelli.
</P>
<P>
   In the technical toy department, Fox decided on Wednesday night
that less was more. There has been criticism from viewers that Fox
is close-up happy. The Fox credo is to keep images flying,
especially between pitches. So there are some excessive cuts to the
managers, Joe Torre and Bruce Bochy, sitting expressionlessly.
</P>
<P>
   But the shots are rarely distracting and don't cause Fox to miss
pitches. Through seven innings on Wednesday, there were 75
closeups, including 15 of Torre, 12 of Bochy, but only one of
Zimmer, a serious cinematic oversight.
</P>
<P>
   By the eighth inning, the use of close-ups accelerated, largely
to step up the endgame drama. By the ninth, the close-ups were
coming even more furiously, as the emotional gap between Padre
faces and Yankee faces widened.
</P>
<P>
   But there were quibbles. The major one was McCarver and Buck
refusing to be quite when the game ended and let the Yankees'
celebration and the Padres' misery speak for themselves. Everything
they said to summarize the Yankees' 24th championship could have
waited for the post-game program. And, in comparing the 1927 and
1998 Yankees, Buck erroneously described the earlier team as a very
different one that played in the ``dead ball'' era.
</P>
<P>
   Also: The ``whooshing'' sound leading in and out of replays is
annoying. The network promos that pop up between batters are
distracting. The full-screen house ads for the Fox Sports Web site
are unnecessary, but fortunately, nobody discussed the current
on-line voting on foxsports.com to see if ``Fox NFL Sunday's''
Terry Bradshaw should shave his new goatee.
</P>
<P>
   It should never be required for Fox to display the prime-time
stars it seats strategically throughout World Series stadiums. Fox
has reduced the number of sightings from the World Series two years
ago, but seeing two stars of ``Beverly Hills 90210'' did not
illuminate the game in any way. More shots of Zimmer would have
been far more welcome and appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   And unfortunately, the nature of Fox's prime-time programming
rarely suits the reading of written promos by the sports division's
announcers. You can sense that Buck is lightly mocking the promos,
but when Pat Summerall must lend his august baritone to the concept
of ``Miniskirt Monday,'' it sounds like the end of Western
civilization. Remember, at CBS, each week he would say: ``Coming up
. . . `60 Minutes.''' Those days are over.
</P>
<P>
   If Wednesday night's game did not reverberate with viewers as if
it were the final episode of ``MASH,'' then this World Series may
wind up as the lowest-rated ever. Through three games, the 13.4
average Nielsen rating is down from last season's Florida-Cleveland
series. But last year's seven-game series finished at a 16.7, the
second-lowest in network history to the 16.4 for the
earthquake-interrupted San Francisco-Oakland series in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratings are disappointing, but we don't control the
outcome of the games,'' said Vince Wladika, a Fox Sports spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Why the decline? Make your choice: (a) the Yankees were big
favorites after a 114-victory regular season, lowering expectations
for the Series; (b) Game 1 was dramatic, but rated lower than the
Sept. 8 game in which Mark McGwire hit his 62d home run, and Game 2
was a blowout, which curbed the audience for Game 3; (c) neither
McGwire nor Sammy Sosa were playing, (d) viewers were offended by
Fox's salacious ``Miniskirt Monday'' promo for ``Ally McBeal'' and
(e) there were simply too few close-ups of Zimmer and his skin
pores. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN DIEGO _ The sun sets in the west.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The waves come to the shore.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Congress does nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   There are some things you can always count on.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't the noisiest team. Just the team that made the
loudest bang.
</P>
<P>
   When the Padres' Mark Sweeney hit the last ground ball to third
base and Tino Martinez gathered in the final out of a 3-0 win that
wrapped up a sweep of the World Series, it only confirmed what the
baseball world has known since, oh, about last April.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't the most flamboyant team. Just the best team.
</P>
<P>
   The headlines say these are not the Yankees of Ruth or Gehrig or
DiMaggio or Mantle or all the rest. But the record books will say
they are better.
</P>
<P>
   125-50.
</P>
<P>
   That is not overcoming all obstacles. It is smashing them,
crushing them, annihilating them, reducing them to ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, these poor Padres never had a chance. Not against
this pin-striped funnel cloud that left everything in its path
looking like the remnants of a trailer park.
</P>
<P>
   They could beat you with their bats, their gloves, their arms,
their heads and their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have the kind of record we had right from the very start
and to have a team that never took a day off, that is incredible,''
said manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   What is amazing is that these 1998 Yankees did it in a more
convincing style than any of their glamorous predecessors _ and all
the while managed to stay as individually anonymous as the grounds
crew.
</P>
<P>
   Think about the Yankees and their incredible heritage. From the
Babe to the Mick, from the Iron Horse Gehrig to the Yankee Clipper
DiMaggio to Mr. October Jackson, they are the most storied
franchise in American sports. And yet along comes a collection of
talent where only shortstop Derek Jeter can be legitimately rated
as a possible future Hall of Famer. And this team moved to the top
of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   The MVP of the World Series, Scott Brosius, was the perfect
representative. One year after he batted .203 in the lonely
baseball outpost of Oakland, he owned these four games _ hitting
.471 with two home runs and six RBIs _ and the biggest city in the
land.
</P>
<P>
   In a season when baseball celebrated a return to the nation's
consciousness with the great home-run chase of Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa, it was a bit ironic that it was this amorphous Yankee
blob that took it all. Big Mac and Slammin' Sammy indeed made the
summer memorable. But it was this cohesive, deadly effective group
that made October all its own.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were the team that played with the most heart from
the start of the season, so it was fitting that the pitcher who
took them the last step of their journey was Deer Park's Andy
Pettitte, who had that most vital organ on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   It was just six days earlier when Pettitte's father, Tommy,
underwent double-bypass heart surgery back in Houston. Leading up
to this Game 4 start, there had been so much talk and so much
speculation about how much focus the younger Pettitte could put
into this game.
</P>
<P>
   So all Pettitte did was to pitch 7 shutout innings and limit the
Padres to five hits. They might as well have been in shackles for
the way Pettitte shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   They scored the only run they really needed in the sixth on an
infield single by Jeter, a double by Paul O'Neill and aBernie
Williams chopper back to the mound that didn't come down in time
for San Diego ace Kevin Brown to make a play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Do the best teams just happen to be the luckiest? Or do they
always make their own luck?
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees treat each game like it's a piata. They keep hitting
it and hitting it, smacking it and banging it, figuring that it
will eventually bust open and the prizes will fall at their feet.
</P>
<P>
   They have more ways to beat you than a mongrel has fleas.
</P>
<P>
   It was a season that seemed fated, preordained, with these
Yankees being pushed on from so many different directions. They
were trying to finish off the grand run for their teammate Darryl
Strawberry, who was snatched from their midst with colon cancer at
the start of the AL playoffs. They were trying to win for Joltin'
Joe DiMaggio himself, who watched from a hospital bed in Florida,
recovering from pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   It was a year to be remembered after setting a record with a
114-48 mark in the regular season. And yet they faced a postseason
where all they could do was win it all or be perceived as failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you win, the more everybody expects you to win,''
Torre said. ``And the thing that concerned me most was not winning
the World Series and having someone look down their nose at what we
accomplished. I think that's where the pressure came from.''
</P>
<P>
   So they rose to meet it.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Something to count on.

GROUP SAYS VAIL FIRES WERE IN BEHALF OF LYNX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 7th graf for updating))  (mk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Earth Liberation Front, a shadowy group that has
taken responsibility for a series of arson fires in the Northwest,
declared in an e-mail communique Wednesday that the fires atop Vail
mountain on Monday were carried out ``on behalf of the lynx.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting profits ahead of Colorado's wildlife will not be
tolerated,'' read the brief statement, which was sent
electronically to several Colorado news organizations. ``We will be
back if this greedy corporation continues to trespass into wild and
unroaded areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven fires caused about $12 million worth of damage to
buildings and chair lifts along a 11,200-foot-high ridge that
overlooks a National Forest area where the Vail ski area started
clearing trees on Friday as part of a controversial expansion.
Earlier this year, environmentalists, back country skiers and many
residents of Eagle County had spoken out at public meetings to
block Vail's plan to expand into an area seen as potential habitat
for the reintroduction of the lynx in the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Vail, which plans to open for skiing on Nov. 6, is the nation's
busiest ski area, selling 1.6 million lift tickets last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the nation's skiers, the communique warned: ``For
your safety and convenience, we strongly advise skiers to choose
other destinations until Vail cancels its inexcusable plans for
expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening in Vail, the Eagle County sheriff's office
said after receiving the two-paragraph statement by fax:
``Currently investigators are reviewing the origin and the content
for credibility and will continue its investigation using this
communique as a source for information.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Witt, spokesman for Vail Resorts, said, ``We are aware of
the facts and are letting the proper authorities investigate.''
Although the fires here appear to be in response to a local
dispute, security was tightened this week at other ski areas around
Colorado, the nation's most popular skiing state.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Clausen, a Northern California researcher who studies
terrorist acts claimed by environmental extremists, said Wednesday
that the Earth Liberation Front has taken credit for most of the
arson fires linked to environmental protests.
</P>
<P>
   He said the language in Wednesday's communique ``is almost
identical to other letters the ELF has sent to other victims of
arson fires.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Clausen said, the Earth Liberation
Front has taken credit for five arsons against federal government
buildings in Oregon and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a decline in small acts of sabotage, against
timber and mining, and an escalation of large acts of terrorism,''
Clausen said from his office in Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that an article criticizing Vail's expansion plans
appeared in the May-June issue of Earth First Journal, Clausen
said: ``It's a real pattern. Many times articles come out in the
Journal. Then, there is sabotage.''
</P>
<P>
   The article, headlined ``Super Vail ... Super Ugly!'' charged
that Vail wanted to ``bring the resort lifestyle into some of the
last, best old-growth habitat for lynx in the southern Rockies.''
But the author, Ben Doon, did not advocate violence. Citing legal
efforts to stop the expansion, Doon urged readers to contact
Ancient Forest Rescue, an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   In interview in Vail on Tuesday, Jeff Berman, the local
representative of Ancient Forest Rescue, appeared depressed by the
fires, describing them as a setback in his battle for public
opinion. He asked: ``Does this help us? Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Theresa Kintz, editor of the Earth First Journal,
said after reading the communique: ``It is entirely possible that
it was an ELF action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't have a problem with hitting people like
Vail Inc. in their pockets,'' said Ms. Kintz, who dedicates a page
of news, headlined ``Earth Night,'' to sabotage actions claimed by
the Earth Liberation Front. ``I don't have a problem with seeing
their facilities burn down. It's a war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monkey wrenching and eco-sabotage are strategies that some
people feel are justified in some circumstances,'' she continued,
using Earth First! jargon for sabotaging machinery. Noting that
arson was a new step, she added: ``Classic eco-sabotage would be
monkey wrenching bulldozers.''
</P>
<P>
   In its November 1990 edition, the Earth First Journal published
a photograph of a bulldozer apparently sabotaged by militants
opposed to a ski area expansion near Pagosa Springs, Colo., the
only other recent case of environmental terrorism against a
Colorado ski area.

YANKEES ARE WORLD-BEATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN DIEGO _ Hold a prism to this most splendid of baseball
summers, and through the brilliant swatches of blue (Sammy Sosa)
and red (Mark McGwire) and even orange (Tony Gwynn), all the
refracted colors ultimately fade to a thin black pinstripe.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees, 50 years after the death of Babe Ruth, 25
years after the arrival of George Steinbrenner, and two years since
their last World Series title, last night concluded what history
may judge the finest of all seasons by beating the San Diego
Padres, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   What is undisputed is this: No team has ever won more games than
the Yankees of Brooklyn-born manager Joe Torre and fifth-string
left fielder Ricky Ledee, batting champion Bernie Williams and
reborn Scott Brosius, the supremely intense Paul O'Neill and the
cancer-stricken Darryl Strawberry, the rebellious David Wells and
the brave Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take a back seat to no one in my lifetime,'' Torre
said. ``I've never had a more courageous group, a more determined
group.''
</P>
<P>
   With their 125th win of 1998, they became the first team to
sweep a World Series since the 1990 Cincinnati Reds, who dispatched
the Oakland A's of McGwire and Jose Canseco, and the first Yankee
team to sweep since the 1950 club of aging Joe DiMaggio and rookie
Whitey Ford bounced the Whiz Kids of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will probably be talked about forever,'' said World
Series MVP Brosius. ``You could look at it and say we probably had
the best single season of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of their four-game ouster of the Padres, whose
winter will be haunted by the two three-run leads they could not
hold, the Yankees not only won their 24th World Series, they also
forced the abdication of the King, Jim Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
   The former Red Sox DH, who in a previous incarnation hit two
postseason home runs for the Yankees that became the stuff of myth,
then hit four more for the Padres this fall, went 0 for 10 in this
Series, lining out with the bases loaded to end the eighth last
night.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz also made a dubious defensive decision at first base
that jump-started the Yankees' two-run rally in the top of the
eighth. With Jeter aboard first on a walk and the Yankees ahead,
1-0, Leyritz fielded O'Neill's high chopper. But instead of
flipping to the pitcher, Kevin Brown, who was at the bag, Leyritz
elected to make the play himself, sliding into the bag. First base
umpire Tim Tschida, making one final controversial decision in a
postseason nearly overshadowed by judgment calls, ruled O'Neill
safe, enraging Brown.
</P>
<P>
   TV replays appeared to support Tschida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was too close (to Brown) to throw it,'' Leyritz
said. ``But after watching the replays, I guess I could have.''
</P>
<P>
   An infield out advanced the runners, and Brown intentionally
walked Tino Martinez, loading the bases. Brosius, the World Series
MVP who won Game 3 with a three-run home run, then made it 2-0 with
a flare over a drawn-in infield that didn't reach the outfield
grass on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   A third run scored on a sacrifice fly by Ledee, and a still
steaming Brown tipped his cap, a la Pedro Martinez, to Tschida as
he left the field.
</P>
<P>
   Lefthander Andy Pettitte set aside his poor outing in the
American League Championship Series by reviving memories of his 1-0
win over the Braves in the '96 World Series. Pettitte, who on the
eve of the Series had flown to Texas to be with his ailing father,
held the Padres to five hits in 7 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I saw Andy's first pitch, I knew we were in great
shape,'' Torre said. ``I go back to '96 and know there's an
enormous heart there, and what's been going on in his life, to go
out there and match Kevin pitch for pitch in front of those frantic
fans, it was just appropriate to win a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte departed after Quilvio Veras walked and Gwynn singled
with one out in the eighth, then turned the game over to a bullpen
that was impenetrable in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Mariano Rivera, who did not give up a run in 13 1/3
postseason innings, dropped to his knees in prayerful exultation
after third baseman Brosius, putting the coda on the best year of
his life, threw out Framingham, Mass.-born Mark Sweeney on a roller
to third for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest moment is that third out,'' Brosius said,
``throwing the ball and knowing it's going to end the game and end
the season. There's nothing better than coming up and seeing the
players' eyes and that sense of achievement and accomplishment and
excitement. It was just a great scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, who hit a three-run home run in the clinching game of
the ALCS against the Indians, won MVP honors after batting .471 (8
for 17) in the Series, .268 higher than the .203 he hit for A's
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm a litte wet right now, but it's a great feeling,''
said Brosius, bathing in champagne when only a year ago, he was
eating pizza and watching the World Series on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their distress at being swept _ the Padres have lost
seven straight Series games dating back to '84, when they made
their only other appearance _ San Diego players rewarded the
largest crowd in their history (65,427) by returning to the
Qualcomm Stadium field after the game. Steve Finley threw baseballs
into the upper deck. Trevor Hoffman, to one last chorus of ``Hell's
Bells,'' tipped his cap. Manager Bruce Bochy and several players
took a microphone and thanked the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hell of a run,'' Bochy said. ``We weren't expected
to win our division, we weren't expected to beat Houston or
Atlanta, and I can't say enough about the hard determination our
club played with.''
</P>
<P>
   But from April to October, the Yankees forced everyone to pull
over to the side of the road. They have now won more championships
than any other team in professional sports history, one more than
hockey's Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little young to know about those teams in the early
1900s,'' said the 24-year-old Jeter. ``But we were 125-50. Not too
many teams can say that. You can argue we're the best of all
time.''

PADRES PLAYED SECOND FIDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The San Diego Padres may have pleased a few voters
with their second World Series appearance in 14 years. With a
proposal for a new stadium on the local ballot and the future of
baseball in the deep south of California hanging in the balance, it
was nice timing.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the National League won't like it one bit that
their representative was humbled by the New York Yankees in a
four-game sweep that in glorious hindsight was almost too easy. The
Padres were competitive in three of the games. But they learned the
hard way that the team that won an American League-record 114 games
during the regular season and went 11-2 in the postseason was far
superior to any they faced all year.
</P>
<P>
   Plain and simple, this was a mismatch. The Yankees are the best
team in baseball, maybe of all time. Twice in this series, they
beat Kevin Brown, perhaps the NL's most talented starter. They
outlasted Sterling Hitchcock, who beat Randy Johnson of Houston,
Tom Glavine of Atlanta, and John Smoltz of the Braves in the NL
playoffs. To beat the Yankees, it took more than a quality start.
And that was the best San Diego could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give credit to the Yankees,'' said Padres general manager
Kevin Towers. ``They've got a hell of a club. I don't know where
they have any weakness. Position by position, they have youth and
speed available. They also have experience, speed, and defense. Add
to that power, wonderful starters, and a great bullpen, a great
manager _ and more _ and you can understand why they won so many
games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres knew the jig was up Tuesday night when they lost
their second three-run lead of the Series _ and their third
straight game. No team had ever overcome a such a deficit, and the
Padres weren't about to set a precedent. But they wanted to give
the record San Diego baseball crowd of 65,427 at Qualcomm Stadium
something to be proud about Wednesday night. With Brown on the
mound, they had a chance to prolong the series, it was thought.
</P>
<P>
   Not against this juggernaut. Brown was outdueled by Andy
Pettitte as the Yankees completed the sweep, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the best team we've played all year,'' said Brown.
``But it's difficult to evaluate this series because I thought we
had a better team than what showed up here. There are a combination
of reasons for that. I know one thing. These guys don't have to
hang their heads. Nobody expected us to do that. Nobody was willing
to give us credit or give us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz, who went 0 for 10 in the series, took the blame for
a play at first in the eighth that helped break the game open for
New York.
</P>
<P>
   With a runner on first and the Yankees ahead, 1-0, Paul O'Neill
hit a high chopper that Leyritz fielded at first. But instead of
tossing to Brown, he slid for the bag himself. Despite Brown's
protests, umpire Tim Tschida ruled that O'Neill was safe, and the
Yankees went on to score twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could beat O'Neill to the bag,'' said Leyritz, who
began the season as the Red Sox DH. ``I didn't think I could get
the ball out of my glove in time to flip it to Kevin. After I
watched the replay, I saw that I could have. It was a judgment
thing on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz knew what it was like in the other locker room. He was a
Yankee World Series hero in 1996, a major part of the celebration.
This year he'll celebrate, he said, but first he must tip his cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have 114 victories,'' he said, ``and they came along and
beat us four in a row. We have a pretty strong ball club ourselves.
Unfortunately, we didn't execute this week and they did. They have
a right to claim they are the best club in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, it's not like they went out there and totally killed
us. We feel good about what we did, even though we didn't win a
game. We would have liked to have done better, but we have nothing
to hang our heads about.''
</P>
<P>
   Venerable Tony Gwynn, a World Series loser for the second time
in his fabled Padres career, put this in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an awesome experience,'' he said. ``I'm sure everybody
wishes it would have turned out better. But the Yankees have a
great club. They did everything they needed to do in the series.
The pitching was great. We were banged up. But I can't take
anything away from the Yankees. They did everything they needed to
do to win.''

CAST WORTHY OF A CURTAIN CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  SAN DIEGO _ The 1998 major league baseball season was all
about two things. It was about history and it was about theater.
</P>
<P>
   History was everywhere, from a guy _ excuse me, two guys _ who
hit more baseballs where people couldn't catch them than anyone
else who ever played this game at the top level, to a guy who made
coast-to-coast headlines when he decided to take a day off. And
theater? We had a kid whiffing 20, a Ruth aficionado with a Ruthian
waistline throwing a perfect game _ and we weren't even out of May
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, we had a team, a T-E-A-M from its manager to its
25th man, a team that started off 1-4 and then decided that, all
things considered, winning was a lot more satisfying than losing. A
lot of people know this, but few teams have ever been more
physically qualified or ferociously, and unselfishly, determined to
do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   This was a team that won an American League-record 114 games.
When trouble surfaced in the AL Championship Series, the manager
turned to a (supposed) 29-year-old refugee from Castro's Cuba, a
mysterious character with a throwback pitching style who had
arrived on these shores via a leaky raft, to straighten things out.
The TV movie looms, but until then, we can label the Orlando
Hernandez story as pure theater.
</P>
<P>
   When the man known as ``El Duque'' stopped the Cleveland Indians
in Game 4 of the ALCS, the team relaxed. It began playing baseball
as only it could. It finished off the Indians in three straight,
and Wednesday night The Best Team In Baseball made more history
while providing us with even more theater, completing a four-game
sweep of the National League champion San Diego Padres with a 3-0
victory.
</P>
<P>
   This was, believe it or not, the first Yankee World Series sweep
since 1950, when the second Casey Stengel team (and penultimate Joe
DiMaggio team) knocked off the Philadelphia Phillies' ``Whiz Kids''
in four. That's right. Mickey Mantle never participated in a
Yankees sweep. But Homer Bush has.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the theme of the season, the winning pitcher
Wednesday night was Andy Pettitte, by far the most suspect member
of the Yankees' sensational starting pitching rotation. The
26-year-old lefthander had been touched by personal trauma because
on the eve of the World Series, his father underwent serious heart
surgery. When the Series opened, Pettitte was more than 1,500 miles
away, in Louisiana, at his ailing father's bedside.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night he was standing on that mound of dirt, 60
feet 6 inches from home plate, and he was magnificent. Andy
Pettitte was a mediocre 16-11 for a team that was 66 games over
.500 during the regular season, but on this important occasion, he
was man enough to bring his A game. He brought the same breaking
ball and the same control to the mound he had brought in a
wonderful performance against the Atlanta Braves in Game 5 of a
more competitive World Series two years ago. In 7 1/3 innings,
Pettitte limited the Padres to five hits and no runs. Scorned by
many serious Yankee fans as unreliable, he pitched better than
David Wells, better than El Duque, better than David Cone, and,
most important, better than the great Kevin Brown, his mound
opponent Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Kevin Brown. Now let's talk some theater. Our last look at
this tremendous competitor was the sight of him storming off the
mound at the conclusion of the Yankee eighth, tipping his cap in
mock salute toward first base umpire Tim Tschida, who Brown felt
had missed a pivotal bang-bang play at first during a two-run New
York flurry. Brown felt aggrieved, for sure, but when he simmers
down, he will realize that neither he nor anyone else was going to
interfere with the clear cosmic destiny of this very special Yankee
team. He had pitched well, but by the conclusion of this series, it
was obvious that whatever the Padres would do, the Yankees would do
better.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were theatrically minded to the very end. What other
team could provide as a partial World Series hero a player who had
begun the postseason in Florida awaiting a call to arms he thought
would never come? That was the case with Ricky Ledee, who was at
that time a clear fourth on the available left-field depth chart
behind Tim Raines, Chad Curtis, and Shane Spencer, and that doesn't
even count Darryl Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry. Did someone say ``theater''? Strawberry was
diagnosed with colon cancer during the Division Series, and when he
swapped a date in the postseason for a trip to the operating table,
that led to the call-up of Ledee, who wound up with six hits in 10
official at-bats, to go with two walks, a sacrifice fly, nine total
bases, and four runs batted in. Did someone say, ``42nd Street''?
</P>
<P>
   This was said to be the season when America rediscovered
baseball, and while the final returns are not in nationwide, we can
safely say that the city and environs of San Diego sure have fallen
in love with the game. Wednesday night's crowd of 65,427 was the
largest ever to see a game here, and when it was over, they refused
to leave. They demanded curtain calls by their fallen heroes, and
they got what they wanted, complete with rousing speeches and pleas
to come back and see us next year.
</P>
<P>
   It was a very uplifting and touching scene. Pure theater, if you
will. We know the Yankee fans would never have been so generous to
their team in defeat, but that's the mootest of all possible moot
points, because the 1998 Yankees knew the concept of ultimate
defeat only as an abstract.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, these Yankees set out to make history, and they did. Along
the way, they gave us great theater. Let's just call it the
``Broadway Diamond Melody of 1998.'' What a team. As they say on
the Great White Way, the Yankees broke every leg they could.

BRUINS FLATTENED BY ANAHEIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Their power play dormant and penalty trouble
abounding, the Bruins dug a hole and buried themselves in it
Wedneday night, losing to the Mighty Ducks, 3-0, at Arrowhead Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Their second straight loss dropped them under .500 for this trip
(2-3) with one game remaining. For the season, Boston is 3-3-1.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that the Bruins were without right wing Rob
DiMaio, who began serving a two-game suspension for elbowing
Phoenix wing Dallas Drake Monday night. DiMaio likely would've
helped stem the tide against the Ducks' stars, but in the end, what
beat the Bruins was their lack of finish and inability to put
anything past goalie Guy Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Boston has been shut out this year, and
the Bruins have generated just one goal in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   The first period was beyond dull, one of the Bruins' most brutal
on the trip. They looked listless, slow, and tentative while being
outshot, 15-6.
</P>
<P>
   Boston didn't pose much of an offensive threat in the opening 20
minutes. Conversely, the Paul Kariya-Steve Rucchin-Teemu Selanne
combination posed all kinds of problems for the Bruins, putting
five shots on goalie Byron Dafoe. He managed to hold off the Ducks
until less than a minute remained.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie defenseman Mike Crowley, who assisted on the first three
Anaheim goals, tying a club rookie record, blasted a shot from the
left point that Dafoe stopped. However, the goalie couldn't control
the rebound, and it bounced out in front, where Jim McKenzie
backhanded it into the net from the slot with 46.1 seconds left to
give Anaheim a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins looked better in the middle period but were sunk by
penalty troubles that led to two more Ducks goals less than a
minute apart.
</P>
<P>
   The problems began at 13:10 when Steve Heinze was whistled for
holding the stick. Just 42 seconds later, Ray Bourque joined Heinze
in the penalty box for cross-checking, giving the Ducks a two-man
advantage for 1:18. Fifty-nine seconds later, Anaheim made Boston
pay, with Kariya potting his third goal of the season on a play
that is bound to be shown on ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne, off to the far right of Dafoe, rifled a pass through
the crease that went past defenseman Hal Gill and hit the stick of
Kariya. The puck popped up in the air and Kariya, following its
flight, bunted it into the net near the right post at 14:51, giving
the Ducks a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's situation soon worsened. With Bourque still in the box,
Ducks center Travis Green was called for closing his hand over the
puck, creating a four-on-four situation. At 15:18, just 34 seconds
before Bourque's penalty expired and they would've gone on the
power play, the Bruins turned the puck over with the Ducks charging
in for a two-on-one break. Rather than give them the odd-man rush,
Darren Van Impe hauled down Selanne, preventing the rush and
probably a goal. But the Bruins were faced with a four-on-three
situation and the Ducks cashed in at 15:42 to take a 3-0 lead.
Defenseman Fredrik Olausson fired a slapper from the top of the
right circle and the Bruins' deficit had quickly become three
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne's line had eight shots in the first 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had nine shots in the middle period, but the defense
accounted for five.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins put some heat on the Ducks in the third period. Their
best chance came at 10:15 when Bourque's slap shot from the point
clanged off the right post. The puck caromed behind Hebert, and
center Chris Taylor tried for a sweeping backhander on the rebound
at the right post, but the goalie was there to block it.

TORRE MAN OF THE HOUR _ AND YEAR _ FOR YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ In the dazzling reflection of an 11-2 postseason
record and a second championship in three years, it seems the
episode must have happened before the invention of dirt. But there
was a time this season when the New York Yankees were in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   After an 8-0 shelling by the Mariners in the opener of a
three-game April series at the Kingdome, the Yankees were 1-4. The
Bad Apple tabloids were thick with speculation about the imminent
demise of Joe Torre, who might be destined in modern Yankee history
to be the man most suited, by skill and temperament, to manage
baseball's flagship franchise.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Yankee employee here at the World Series, owner
George Steinbrenner called Torre and launched a tirade about the
poor start. An angry Torre slammed down the phone _ an act in club
culture considered professional suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, The Boss rang back, demanding to know why he hung
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were yelling at me,'' Torre said calmly.
</P>
<P>
   Disarmed by Torre's quiet dignity, Steinbrenner backed down, for
perhaps the first time in his bellicose, 26-year Yankee tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of his voice, Torre prefers to raise World Series
trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say he is incapable of deploying the stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a meeting in Seattle,'' Torre said. ``We said, `Let's
do something about it. We're supposed to be better than this. We've
got to get angry.' And we started playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing well? The next night, facing the lamentable Jim
Bullinger in his only career Mariner appearance, the angry Yankees
won 13-7, beginning a 24-3 streak. Or, to take it up through
Wednesday night's 3-0 win over the San Diego Padres in Game 4 of
the World Series, 124-46.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing as the raw number is, its achievement was more or less
expected. The Yankees were known in the preseason to be good on
paper, then proved it on grass and turf, and had virtually no
alternative but to do the postseason crush thing because it was New
York and because it was the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you win, the more you expect to win,'' Torre said.
``The thing that concerned me most was not winning the World Series
and having someone look down their nose at us.''
</P>
<P>
   The only view of the Yankees this morning is from far below.
They are at a pinnacle never reached in baseball history. To a man,
the players credit Torre.
</P>
<P>
   They made it a point to do so immediately as they spilled from
the traditional postgame pigpile on the rock-hard infield of
Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went out on the field,'' Torre said, a little dazed,
``every one of the players came up to me and said, `Thank you,'
before I could say it to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That knocked me off my stilts a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre's reasonableness, steadiness and sincerity have been the
handles that players and coaches have grabbed hard in the
relentless tumult of baseball in the big town for the big boss with
the big tradition that has produced its 24th world champion in 35
Series appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the field, in the clubhouse and the front office, he has a
hand on everything,'' said Mel Stottlemyre, Yankee pitching coach
and Yakima native. ``He managed the pressure so well, and he does
it so quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I don't even know what his relationship with
Steinbrenner is. And maybe that says something in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   He had to guide players from 10 nations, stars from other
franchises, work with an immediate boss more than two decades his
junior and an ultimate superior who throws money and tantrums with
equal ferocity. Torre's ego-less, deferential manner threatened no
one and inspired all.
</P>
<P>
   As a native New Yorker and well-steeped in baseball tradition,
he knows the prestige and pressure of the position so well that he
feels no intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very high expectations when you wear a Yankee
uniform,'' he said. ``I'm not putting any other ballclub down. It's
just that when you work for George, he's a perfectionist. He always
tries to improve on perfection. When you come to New York, you
understand that getting to the World Series is what it's all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that's why there was a vacancy for Torre in the first
place. His capable predecessor, Buck Showalter, was let go after
the Mariners beat his Yankees in the dramatic 1995 Division Series,
an event that Yank pitcher David Cone this week called
``devastating ... and the reason Showalter and others lost their
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for his liberal applications of cash at all levels
of his organization, Steinbrenner demands championship and brooks
only the smallest setbacks. Which is why this season's magnum
triumph caused him so much emotion in the champagne chaos of the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner was wallowing in his glory, crying and laughing and
spraying. He created a magnificent, albeit expensive, new standard,
and knew the baseball world must leap to catch him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as good as any team I've ever had, and as good as any
team I've ever seen,'' he said, his jacket a stinky, sticky mess.
``There's never been anyone better.''
</P>
<P>
   For San Diego, the Series results turned out to be welcome as
snow. For baseball, hoping to follow upon a season of spectacular
individual achievements with a riveting climax, it wasn't so hot
either.
</P>
<P>
   But on a warm evening in Southern California, there was no
disappointment in being in the presence of greatness. Nor was there
any arguing with Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Only Torre gets the last word with Steinbrenner.

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ This one was for dad.
</P>
<P>
   On a night the Yankees won their 24th world title and during an
emotional time off the field for Andy Pettitte, the lefthander
picked up the pieces and pitched the game of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, at his father's bedside last week when he had heart
bypass surgery, threw 7 1/3 shutout innings in Game 4 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   He obviously was able to take his emotions and direct them on
the field. He had struggled in the league championship against the
Indians but really never was in any trouble on this beautiful
night.
</P>
<P>
   Just how awesome was he?
</P>
<P>
   _ He retired the side in the first, third, fourth and pitched to
only three batters in the sixth as his club turned a double play.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the second, he walked Jim Leyritz after one out, then gave
up a hit to Ruben Rivera. But Pettitte came back and struck out
Carlos Hernandez, walked Chris Gomez and got Kevin Brown on a
grounder back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the fifth after two were out, he gave up a single to Brown
but came right back and got Quilvio Veras on a grounder back to the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   _ The biggest test came in the seventh when after one out,
Rivera doubled to right. But Pettitte got Hernandez to hit a ball
back to the mound. Pettitte grabbed it, turned towards Rivera and
caught him off second. He then retired Gomez on a flyball to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Petitte did get in some trouble in the eighth when after one
out, he walked Veras and gave up a single to Tony Gwynn. Yankees
manager Joe Torre decided to go to his bullpen, calling for
righthander Jeff Nelson to face the always tough Greg Vaughn.
Nelson did his job, striking out Vaughn, but then fell behind in
the count to Ken Caminiti. On came closer Mariano Rivera with a 2-0
count on Caminiti, who hit the first pitch into right field to load
the bases. Up stepped Jim Leyritz, who hit a line drive to center
for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   So ended a very draining period for Pettitte. But it was not as
if he had not done the job before in the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1996 against the Braves, he won Game 5 by the score of
1-0, going 8 1/3 innings and setting up New York to win a title in
Game 6. This time Pettitte led the final charge.

 &HT;    McGwire catches foul ball in stands
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a good thing for baseball commissioner Bud
Selig that Mark McGwire made it back to the ballpark Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The new single-season home run king threw out the first pitch
before Game 4, throwing a perfect strike and, of course, receiving
a standing ovation. The Padres had wanted McGwire to throw out the
first pitch on Tuesday night, but the Cardinals first baseman has
been rather busy, making an appearances Monday on the David
Letterman Show.
</P>
<P>
   Also, McGwire grabbed a foul ball that went into the stands,
catching it right in front of Selig. The two were sharing the same
box and it isn't the first time this season that McGwire has saved
Selig.
</P>
<P>
   More second guessing
</P>
<P>
   Padres manager Bruce Bochy continued to get questioned about his
moves in the ninth inning in Game 3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With San Diego down by one run with runners at first and third
and two outs, Bochy had his best left-handed hitting pinch hitter
(John Vander Wal) in the game as a pinch runner, leaving
weak-hitting Andy Sheets to hit. Sheets struck out against Yankees
right-hander Mariano Rivera to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we thought the matchup with (Mark) Sweeney against
Rivera was our best matchup, so I pinch ran Vander Wal, knowing if
Sheets comes up, we are going to let Andy hit,'' Bochy said. ``He
took two good swings, and so really the non-moves were working out,
we had first and third, and a chance to tie the game. I could have
hit Greg Myers, but we felt like the best chance was to let Andy
hit. And it didn't
</P>
<P>
   work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Help from Zim
</P>
<P>
   While his team is certainly the most talented in baseball,
Yankees manager Joe Torre has received a lot of help from bench
coach Don Zimmer. Many times during a game, Torre will turn to
Zimmer for advice. ``I've always respected Don,'' Torre said. ``He
had coached here a couple of different times, and I thought he
would be a guy I could trust to tell me the truth, be there for me,
and help me in a lot of ways. And I'm glad I made that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the horn
</P>
<P>
   A Yankees victory Wednesday would give New York it's 61st
championship in professional baseball, football, basketball and
hockey since 1901. The city has won 31 in baseball. ... It also
would be the Yankees' 24th title, which would be an all-time record
by sports franchises. Both the Yankees and the NHL Montreal
Canadiens have 23 titles. ...Going into Wednesday's game, the
Yankees had won their last five Series games on the road, their
last loss coming in Game 5 of the 1981 Fall Classic against the
Dodgers. ... Rivera has pitched 12 scoreless innings in nine games
in the postseason, the most since Ken Dayley of St. Louis worked
the same number in 1985. ... The two home runs Scott Brosius
produced in Game 3 was the 41st multi-homer game in Series history
and first by a Yankee since Reggie Jackson went deep three times in
Game 6 in 1977. It was just the third time a third baseman had a
multi-homer game, the others being Cincinnati's Chris Sabo (1990)
and Bob Elliot (1948) of the Boston Braves. ...The Yankees had
entered the Series hitting .229 in the postseason with 36 runs
scored in nine games but entered Game 4 hitting .324 with 23 runs
in three games.

 &HT;    The Yankee clincher: New York wins 3-0 to sweep World Series
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Perhaps it was fitting that Big Mac was only a few
feet away watching.
</P>
<P>
   For in a season where Mark McGwire thrilled the world, the New
York Yankees won it all, completing a four-game World Series sweep
of the Padres with a crisp 3-0 victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees finish the season with an incredible 125-50 record,
their 24th world title and second in three years, a team that will
go down as one of baseball's greatest.
</P>
<P>
   And they did it with an awesome display of teamwork, outscoring
the Padres 26-13 and really never feeling threatened by a club that
was obviously overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   Along with McGwire, who was sitting in the commissioner's box,
65,427 fans, the largest crowd ever to watch a baseball game in San
Diego, still held out hope for their Padres. But their team was
simply outpitched this night. While Kevin Brown was good, Yankees
lefthander Andy Pettitte was better, almost unhittable.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Pettitte battled for five innings without anyone
scoring until the sixth, when the Yankees got a run, in one of
their many ways to score, on an infield grounder. Pettitte kept
holding on, picking up two more runs of support in the eighth, and
then came the bullpen, setting up one final chance for the Padres
to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and two outs in the eighth, San Diego's
Jim Leyritz stepped up to the plate against Yankees closer Mariano
Rivera. It was two years ago that Leyritz, wearing Yankee
pinstripes, turned the Series around against the Braves with a
three-run shot off Mark Wohlers. Could he turn around a World
Series again, this time against his former team?
</P>
<P>
   No, not this time as Leyritz drove a ball into center field
where Bernie Williams was waiting for it. San Diego's unbelievable
season had all but ended. Rivera retired the Padres in the ninth
and it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees third baseman Scott Brosius, who had two homers and six
RBIs in the Series, was named the MVP.
</P>
<P>
   But on this night, it was not one man, it was teamwork that
produced the Yankees runs. In the sixth, Derek Jeter singled with
one out and Paul O'Neill followed with a double. Williams then hit
a ball down into the dirt. It bounced high and into the glove of
Brown, who looked home, but didn't make the throw. Bad decision as
the Yankees led. In the eighth, Jeter opened the inning by walking
and O'Neill singled. Jeter would eventually come home on a Brosius
single, O'Neill crossing on a sacrifice fly by Ricky Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, the Yankees celebrated, hugging and crying at the
pitchers mound. A parade awaits in New York. They indeed are great
champions.

 &HT;    Game 4's telecast restrained
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When there's pitching duel like the one between the
Yankees' Andy Pettitte and the Padres' Kevin Brown, Fox's job
Wednesday night was not to get in the way of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Game 4 became a case where less was more, and producer
John Filippelli appeared to recognize that. The telecast seemed to
have less than the usual amounts of spray charts, graphics and
split screens.
</P>
<P>
   Announcers Joe Buck, Tim McCarver and Bob Brenly, who have done
a solid job throughout the series of not talking too much, kept the
idle chatter to a minimum and gave one of their most concise
performances.
</P>
<P>
   However, when a situation called for more, like Paul O'Neill
barely beating Jim Leyritz to first for an infield single that set
up the Yankees' two-run eighth, Fox had excellent replay angles
that indicated the safe call was correct.
</P>
<P>
   But the better example of recognizing when more was better came
after the Yankees went ahead 3-0. Aggressive camera work that
switched from one dugout to the other conveyed the emotions of the
moment as Padres pitching coach Dave Stewart was captured shouting
in frustation, while the Yankees were seen pumping each other up,
obviously sensing victory was near.
</P>
<P>
   The camera work wasn't quite as active in the bottom of the
eighth when the Padres loaded the bases, and didn't convey the
tension as well.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Fox did a fine job making the audience aware of Mark
McGwire's presence. Like it did with Sammy Sosa in New York, he was
interviewed from the stands in the first inning. But Fox got lucky
in the fourth when McGwire made a bare-handed catch of a bouncing
foul ball, which naturally warranted a replay.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also came up with its one beauty shot of the Series by
capturing the sun dipping beneath the horizon at the end of the
third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Said Buck: ``The sun is setting on San Diego. The Padres hope
it's not on them.

ZEILE SEEKS EXTENSION OR MAY DEMAND TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Rangers third baseman Todd Zeile appears willing to
exercise his right to demand a trade should the organization not be
prepared to discuss a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, scheduled to earn $3.2 million for the 1999 season, can
exercise that right as a player traded while signed to a multiyear
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the club is unwilling to commit to him beyond the '99
season, then that means he could be traded again by July,'' said
Seth Levinson, who represents Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers signed Zeile to a three-year contract Dec. 8, 1996,
and traded him to the Marlins on May 16, 1998. The Rangers acquired
Zeile in the July 31 trade that sent two minor-league players _
right-hander Daniel DeYoung and third baseman Jose Santo _ to the
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile must exercise his right to demand a trade within a span of
15 days after the conclusion of the World Series, although Levinson
plans to discuss a contract extension with Rangers general manager
Doug Melvin before that time.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would be forced to trade Zeile by March 15 should
the demand arise or allow the 33-year-old infielder to become a
free agent. That demand, though, would not come without risks for
Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran third baseman would become a free agent and forfeit
his guaranteed contract for 1999 should the Rangers be unable to
complete a trade, or Zeile could be traded to an undesirable
situation. Rangers win awards Rangers right fielder Juan Gonzalez
and catcher Ivan Rodriguez yesterday captured their fifth American
League Silver Slugger Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez led American League players in runs batted in (157) and
doubles (50) and ranked second in slugging percentage (.630) and
extra-base hits (97), fourth in home runs (45) and total bases
(382), sixth in base hits (193) and 10th in batting average (.318).
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who drove in 91 runs with 40 doubles and 21 home
runs, ranked eighth in batting average (.321) and ninth in base
hits (186).
</P>
<P>
   League managers and coaches also chose Orioles first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro, Tigers second baseman Damion Easley, Royals third
baseman Dean Palmer, Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez and center
fielder Ken Griffey Jr., White Sox left fielder Albert Belle and
Blue Jays designated hitter Jose Canseco for the award at their
positions. Clayton pursued Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said
he has begun negotiations with Arn Tellem, shortstop Royce
Clayton's agent. Clayton can be a free agent after the World Series
and the Rangers have made re-signing him a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said the two sides, ``have talked about numbers,'' but
Tellem is also a basketball agent who is caught up in that sport's
labor negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said he has also begun talks with Will Clark's attorney
about a possible new contract. Arnsberg promoted The Rangers
promoted Brad Arnsberg, who coached at Double-A Tulsa last season,
to pitching coach at Triple-A Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Tunnell, who coached at Charlotte last season, will replace
Arnsberg at Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also announced that Oklahoma manager Greg Biagini
and Tulsa manager Bobby Jones will return next season.

GALAXY DEAL IMMINENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Galaxy, one of Major League
Soccer's most successful clubs on and off the field, is in the
final stages of being sold to Los Angeles Kings' owner Philip F.
Anschutz, a Colorado billionaire who has been one of the league's
primary investors since its 1995 inception.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, confirmed by two Galaxy officials and by sources with
Anschutz's two other MLS clubs, probably won't be finalized for
another week or so, but a news release is expected today and a
formal announcement will be made Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rumor mill is not too far off the mark,'' said one Galaxy
official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. ``It's
in the final stages, basically, but it's not by any means a done
deal. Certain issues remain, but they could be wrapped up next
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said
talks began a few months ago, and Galaxy captain Dan Calichman said
he ``heard it was a done deal a while ago.''
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Soccer Partners LP, a consortium headed by investment
banker Marc Rapaport, will make a profit on its $5 million
investment, although the selling price is not known. Reports have
estimated it as between $20 million _ the current price for an MLS
club _ and $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Rapaport nor general manager Danny Villanueva, also part
of the ownership group, would comment on the sale, and MLS Deputy
Commissioner Sunil Gulati referred questions to Commissioner Doug
Logan, who did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Anschutz, 58, whose Denver-based Anschutz Corporation's primary
interests are in natural resources, real estate, transportation and
communications, already owns MLS' Colorado Rapids and Chicago Fire,
which will play in Sunday's league championship at the Rose Bowl.
Neither Anschutz nor Robert Sanderman, the chief executive officer
of the Kings and the president of the Fire and Rapids, could be
reached Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This spells nothing but good news for the Galaxy,'' said one
team official. ``(Anschutz's) reputation is that he puts forth
resources to create a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy reached MLS' title game in 1996 and was a Western
Conference finalist this season after winning the conference's
regular-season title with a 24-8 record. The team also led the
league in attendance, averaging 21,784, and has drawn 1.14 million
fans to the Rose Bowl in three seasons, an average of 23,775.
</P>
<P>
   One Galaxy official said it was unlikely that Rapaport or
Villanueva would continue their involvement with the club but that
Anschutz was unlikely to ``clear house.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy players, long critical of L.A. Soccer Partners' fiscal
conservatism, were optimistic about the sale, particularly with
regard to a training center. While most MLS clubs have first-rate
practice facilities, the Galaxy's primary training spot has been
the Rose Bowl's Area H, an uneven, sometimes trash-strewn stretch
of grass used as a parking lot during events at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what it means to us, but we're awfully
excited,'' Calichman said. ``We've never been given anything, never
been treated like professionals (by current ownership), and we hear
great things from the Chicago and Colorado (players), that he's a
great owner.''

TEMPLE'S UPSET TOUGH ONE TO DIGEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Comments like ``upset of the century'' or ``win for the ages''
make me more nauseated than Cade McNown or Mike Van Raaphorst on a
Saturday afternoon. Then along comes a game like Temple's 28-24
victory over Virginia Tech. The Hokies were not just upset, they
were embarrassed by one of the worst teams in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech (5-1) _ ranked 10th in the USA Today/ESPN poll and
13th in the Associated Press poll _ blew a 17-0 lead over Temple
(1-6). Did we mention it was homecoming for the Hokies?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, everybody's in shock, and rightfully so,'' said
Temple first-year coach Bobby Wallace. ``I'm glad we're off this
week because it will take a little while to get everybody's heads
in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how shocking was this victory? Let's review a few facts:
</P>
<P>
   __ Temple's victory over Virginia Tech was the Owls' first
victory over a ranked opponent since defeating No.16 Pittsburgh
24-21 on Sept. 19, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   __Temple's victory was its first Big East road victory. Not of
the season but for  &UR; !ital! &LR; any &UR; !off! &LR;  season.
</P>
<P>
   __Temple's victory snapped a losing streak at eight games.
</P>
<P>
   __Temple scored 28 points on a Virginia Tech defense that had
allowed just 30 points all season.
</P>
<P>
   __Temple had 28 points, 328 yards and 11 first downs on its
final eight possessions. In its first six, Temple had one first
down and 29 yards.
</P>
<P>
   __Temple quarterback Devin Scott, a freshman, completed 4 of 9
passes, but they went for 155 yards.
</P>
<P>
   __Temple started six freshman and at times played seven freshmen
on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, other Big East coaches fell over themselves defending
the insanity of the Owls beating a Top 25 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Temple has a good football team,'' Boston College coach Tom
O'Brien said. ``They have a good scheme. It was going to take some
time to get everything to fall into place. Those things happen in
college football now. You could see the athletes they had. I'm sure
they're going to win a couple more.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. But if you were in the Big East, you would probably
say the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   The league was 0-4 in bowl games a year ago and is now 4-7
against Bowl Championship Series league opponents. The Big East's
highest ranked team is now West Virginia, which is 13th in both
polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Big East is the only BCS conference without a team in the
top six, and every BCS league but the ACC and Big East have two
teams in the top 12.
</P>
<P>
   __Fargas makes move: Former Notre Dame High School star tailback
Justin Fargas earned the starting job at Michigan this week after
he carried 31 times for a career-high 120 yards to beat
Northwestern 12-6 in a rainstorm last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Big Ten football,'' Fargas said. ``This is why I came
out here from California, to play in all sorts of conditions and
play physical football.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery is why Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr took so long to
play Fargas.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning of the season, we have been trying to find
a tailback who would run with authority,'' Carr said. ``Based on
what Justin did in that game, he may be the guy. He will start ...
because he deserves to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr played Fargas after senior Clarence Williams fumbled on the
first series against Northwestern. Fargas drew the bulk of the
carries the rest of the soggy night. Fargas did not fumble once,
even though the two teams combined for 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really sure what coach had in mind,'' Fargas said.
``I just wanted to be prepared. We all had a great week of
practice. I'm happy I was able to do pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Carr: ``What you saw there was one of the finest efforts
ever by a true freshman. When you look at him, he doesn't look like
a real strong guy, but that's deceptive. He's strong and has great
speed. I'm still not sure how durable he is. In that regard, he
came out of this game healthy. Whether he can do it week in and
week out, we have to see.''
</P>
<P>
   __Internet follies: The rise of the Internet, and radio via the
Internet, has led to unprecedented amount of bulletin-board
baloney. The latest example came in Indiana's 14-7 victory over
Iowa, after which Indiana defensive end Adewale Ogunleye credited
Hawkeyes coach Hayden Fry for inspiring the Hoosiers.
</P>
<P>
   Ogunleye claimed Fry said on his weekly radio show that the
Hoosiers quit in their game against the Hawkeyes last year and that
they were going to quit again this year. ``I've heard those words
ringing in my ears all week,'' said Ogunleye, one of several
Hoosiers who listened to the show on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Only one problem: Those words were spoken by one of the phone-in
callers, not Fry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh well, I took it as being him and I used it,'' Ogunleye said
with a smile. ``It worked for me.''
</P>
<P>
   __Dubious honor: Illinois coach Ron Turner after freshman Steve
Fitts, a punter, was named a Big Ten co-player of the week for
special-teams play: ``I'm happy for Steve _ he's doing a great job
for us _ but that's not the guy you'd like to have as player of the
week.''
</P>
<P>
   __ This just in: Stanford coaches say former Camarillo High
quarterback Joe Borchard will begin making random appearances for
the Cardinal in relief of starter Todd Husak.

McNOWN'S CENTERFOLD 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Which is better for a Heisman Trophy campaign _
throwing touchdowns or throwing up? UCLA quarterback Cade McNown
will find out soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated photographed McNown vomiting in the Oregon
game and has published it (full-color) on the contents page of its
current issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the country to see Cade's human side,'' UCLA
media-relations director Marc Dellins said. ``Not unlike when
Rodney Peete had the measles 10 years ago, we'll figure out a way
to make it work to Cade's advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue circulated through UCLA's Morgan Center and the locker
room. Most of the Bruins laughed, then said, ``I've got to get a
copy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Bob Toledo was one of the first to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grabbed it, took it to the quarterbacks meeting, then I took
it to every meeting room,'' Toledo said. ``It's funny, but it's not
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Westwood reaction: USC coach Paul Hackett's comment that
Oregon is the Pac-10's best team whipped through Westwood faster
than Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned it to the team,'' Toledo said. ``It's a comment
that was made. I tell the players not to make bulletin-board
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime coaches make comments or players make comments, I save
them.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Something must give: Cal has allowed 33 sacks this season,
most in the Pac-10. UCLA's defensive line has no sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big concern,'' Toledo said. ``There's no reason we
can't have a defensive lineman with one sack after five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting tied up. They're not using the techniques
they're being taught. They're freezing their feet and getting
locked up on people.''
</P>
<P>
   __ BCS update: If the season ended today, UCLA would play Ohio
State for the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today computed the top teams based on the Bowl Championship
Series formula, which averages top-25 rankings and computer
rankings, then adds a strength-of-schedule quotient and one point
per defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The teams with the fewest points in the final BCS poll (Dec. 6)
will play in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State is No. 1, with 3.45 points. UCLA is No. 2, with 3.71
points, followed by Tennessee (7.15) and Kansas State (7.55).

DEVELOPER GETS TWO-YEAR PACT TO WOO NFL TEAM TO LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Coliseum officials Wednesday put their
hopes of winning a National Football League team into the hands of
developer Edward Roski Jr., along with their dream of seeing a
revival of the historic but aging facility.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium's commission, in a rare unanimous 8-0 vote, approved
a two-year contract with Roski and his New Coliseum Ventures Inc.
to negotiate with the NFL to win either an expansion team or have
an existing team relocate to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is breathing new life into the Coliseum,'' commission
President Mike Roos said. ``This is telling the NFL that we are
serious about our commitment to have football return to this great
facility.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL team owners will meet Tuesday in Kansas City to decide where
the league's 32nd franchise will be located. Roski will make the
presentation for the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which will be
competing with a proposal from onetime superagent Mike Ovitz for a
site in Carson and a pitch from the city of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident we have everything the NFL has asked for,''
Roski said. ``This agreement with the commission tells the league
that we have the credentials to go ahead to seek a team.''
</P>
<P>
   One drawback that developed Wednesday was word that Mayor
Richard Riordan will not attend the meeting because of a conflict
with the kickoff of his Read to Me literacy program. Instead, the
mayor's aides said, he will make a videotaped speech for the NFL
owners, indicating his support for Roski and the Coliseum proposal.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ovitz, Roski said he was not concerned about the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are friends,'' Roski said of the former Walt Disney Co.
president and Hollywood heavyweight. ``I would like to see him join
us, but I don't think that will happen as long as he's advancing
his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both going to be presenting Los Angeles in the best
light that we can. Both of us are trying to show the NFL that Los
Angeles is ready for the NFL. We just happen to have different
ideas on where it should be played.''
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, Roski and his partners will have
two years in which to convince the NFL to place an expansion team
in the facility or work with an existing team to move to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum Commission will retain the right to talk with
existing teams that approach it about moving, but the Roski group
would be entitled to repayment of up to $5 million for its costs.
</P>
<P>
   Roski said his focus has been on acquiring an expansion
franchise, but added that existing teams might be interested in
moving after next week's presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that there will be a number of existing teams that
may be challenged in their marketplace,'' Roski said. ``You know,
you've got to remember that Los Angeles is the entertainment
capital of the world and NFL football is entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendously big market. Everybody, I think, will be
looking at our presentation, our facility and . . . who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   The only team officials indicated they weren't interested in was
the Oakland Raiders, which left Los Angeles two years ago. Raiders
owner Al Davis has insisted he maintains the rights to Los Angeles
and has a lawsuit pending over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials say they will determine which team, new or
existing, plays in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Roski, who co-owns the Los Angeles Kings hockey team with Denver
billionaire Philip Anschutz, raised his profile in the past two
years as he won city approval to build the Staples Center sports
arena. The $300 million facility, to be built on land adjacent to
the Los Angeles Convention Center, will serve as home to the Kings,
and the Lakers and Clippers basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   While Anschutz remains his partner in the football effort, Roski
stepped forward this week to take the lead role on the Coliseum
plan saying he would borrow $100 million toward the NFL franchise
fee and pay up to $400 million more.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also is planning to borrow $216 million toward the
remodeling of the Coliseum to accommodate between 67,000 and 80,000
fans, and providing 150 luxury suites and 15,000 club seats.
</P>
<P>
   Roski has committed to paying $80 million for the improvements
with the remaining funds coming from the Community Redevelopment
Agency and a ticket tax on all Coliseum events.
</P>
<P>
   Roski has chartered a jet to fly a 30-member delegation to
Kansas City for his presentation, including representatives of his
new architectural firm, NBBJ Associates; city and county officials;
and officials from Merrill Lynch on the financial plans.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL said it does not expect to make a final decision at the
meeting, but wanted to hear on the status of each proposal.

PLAYERS GATHER TO MAP STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In a city where everything under the sun has a
betting line attached, no one's ready to lay odds on saving the NBA
season. Not even the NBA players themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As players began arriving Wednesday night for today's union
meeting, the mood was moderately pessimistic that the 113-day-old
lockout would end anytime soon. But neither are the players ready
to resort to desperate measures to jump-start the season.
</P>
<P>
   Decertify the union? Push the matter into federal court and
force NBA owners to end the lockout? Don't bet the farm it'll
happen, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's premature,'' said Orlando Magic center Danny
Schayes, a member of the union's negotiating committee. ``It's
certainly out there as a possibility, but I certainly don't think
it's desirable from anyone's point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding of it is kind of like the weapon of mutually
assured destruction,'' Schayes said. ``It's a great way to drop a
nuke. But the idea is to negotiate a deal. That certainly is what
our agenda has been throughout.''
</P>
<P>
   So the players, possibly 200 of the 400-plus union members, will
meet late this morning at Caesars Palace to discuss negotiation
strategies, review contract proposals and take straw polls on where
they go from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of us getting together is to decide what to do
next,'' said Schayes, a 17-year veteran. ``The reason we're
including the entire (membership) ... is to make sure everyone
knows what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, at this moment, isn't much. NBA owners and players have
met only three times since the lockout began July 1, and no
progress has been made in a dispute over how to divide the league's
$2 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Owners want to reduce the players' share _ which reached 57
percent this past season _ and want to impose a strict salary cap
to reach their objective. Players want to retain the current
salary-cap system, with its numerous loopholes, including the
``Larry Bird exception,'' which allows teams to re-sign free agents
at any salary.
</P>
<P>
   Schayes said players have been willing from the outset to place
limits on Bird contracts in order to help contain salaries and
restore the NBA's shrinking middle class. But he said the owners
are intractable.
</P>
<P>
   With both sides entrenched a handful of players in the 19-member
agents advisory committee met Wednesday and discussed a range of
options; financial assistance for players, fund-raising through
exhibition games, and possibly even creation of a new league.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, fans are left as helpless spectators to a high-stakes
game that unfortunately lacks the thrill of, say, Bulls vs. Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bugs me, but I can understand what (the players) are
doing,'' said 18-year old Sean Kelly, who waited five hours to
catch a glimpse of his hero, Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's biggest thrill this day would be to get MJ's autograph,
maybe a snapshot. But he'd gladly trade it for a fadeaway jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have them play,'' he said. ``Hopefully, it doesn't
take too long.''

SODA FOUND TO PROVIDE 8% OF TEEN CALORIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER AND MELISSA SCHMITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Is no snack safe from the food police?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Center for Science in the Public Interest,
who previously exposed the nutritional evils of burgers, burritos
and popcorn, warned Wednesday that American teen-agers have become
dangerously hooked on soda pop.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers guzzle twice as much soda as milk. Soda-drinking boys
are worse than girls, consuming an average of 3.33 cans a day, the
center reported. &UR;  &LR; Girls drink about one-third less.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, researchers say, is that the fondness for soda is
pushing other, more nutritious foods out of their diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's diets are completely unbalanced by soft drinks,''
said Michael Jacobson, the center's executive director. ``It's
crazy that it's gone to this extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Soda industry executives immediately blasted the report as yet
another attempt to scare the public away from one of its favorite
foods. And teen-agers said the report merely told them what they
already knew, that drinking gallons of sugar water can be bad for
them.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Soft Drink Association, called the
report ``an insult to consumers' intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Soft drink makers ``have never made a nutritional claim,'' said
Jim Finkelstein, executive vice president of the organization. ``We
simply make a nice, little refreshment product. We've always said
people should maintain a balanced diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Erica Lastufk, 18, of Los Angeles suburb West Hills, working on
her second root beer Wednesday at a San Fernando Valley Taco Bell
in Canoga Park, knows soft drinks are not good for her but finds
them irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm, like, addicted to the stuff,'' she said. ``I drank, like,
two to three cans a day when I was a little kid. I know it's bad
for me, and I'm trying to cut back. I have cavities on my front
teeth from drinking too much soda, and I heard it puts crystals on
your kidneys.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said Americans spent more than $54 billion on
soft drinks in 1997. Among teens, the drinks accounted for 9
percent of all calories boys consumed each day and 8 percent in
girls' diets.
</P>
<P>
   The study links growing soda consumption to rising obesity
rates. And it warns that girls who drink soda instead of milk could
be risking osteoporosis later in life because they aren't getting
enough calcium to build up their bones.
</P>
<P>
   To correct the problem, the center recommended that schools stop
selling soft drinks in cafeterias and urged states to impose taxes
on soda sales.
</P>
<P>
   Finkelstein contended that a balanced diet has plenty of room
for soda as a refreshment, not as a serious source of nutrition. As
for the report's claim that teen-agers are drinking soda at the
expense of more nutritious beverages, he said, ``That's a
parental-guidance thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rebekah Kouy-Ghadosh, 17, of suburban Tarzana said it's also
a cost and convenience thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of have no other options,'' said Kouy-Ghadosh, sipping
her second Dr. Pepper of what she said will be five or six by day's
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be drinking sparkling apple juice -- it's really
good -- but soda is everywhere,'' the Los Angeles Pierce College
student said. ``I can't get away from it. It's ubiquitous.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Spero, 16, of West Hills blames his eight-can-a-day Diet
Coke habit on his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised on it,'' he said, laughing. ``It's affecting my
brain because of all the NutraSweet.''

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The signature play of UCLA's season began with a
mistake. In the huddle, quarterback Cade McNown called a formation
that positioned receiver Danny Farmer on the left side, instead of
the right. Farmer realized the error as he trotted to the line.
Once there, he looked at McNown.
</P>
<P>
   No words, just a look _ a look that said, ``Hey, I'm not
supposed to be here, but I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   They adjusted accordingly, and seconds later connected on a
64-yard touchdown pass that broke Arizona and propelled UCLA to one
of its most impressive victories in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain what happened,'' Farmer said. ``Cade and I
don't talk much on the field. You don't talk. You feel. We don't
interact on the sideline, but we're connected somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Powered by friendship, familiarity and necessity, McNown and
Farmer have become one of the Pacific-10's most potent tandems.
McNown is third in passing, while Farmer leads the league in
receiving yards per game (105.8) and yards per catch (24).
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny has made some big plays in his career,'' McNown said.
``He's one of the guys I have confidence in. He's got a knack for
finding the open spot, especially against zone coverage. He's got a
good feel.''
</P>
<P>
   So, apparently, does UCLA's aerial attack. The Bruins are
averaging 296.6 passing yards and 46.6 points per game, third in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But closer inspection reveals a receiving corps struggling with
injuries and inexperience. Freddie Mitchell is out for the year
with a broken leg. Brad Melsby hasn't regained his freshman form
after missing two seasons with injury and illness. Brian Poli-Dixon
is talented but inconsistent, as his drops against Oregon showed.
Jon Dubravac is learning the offense. Cody Joyce doesn't catch
enough passes in practice to merit time on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Demand is high. Supply is low. Enter Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question he's our go-to guy,'' offensive
coordinator Al Borges said. ``With Freddie, we were so complete,
because we had depth and we were talented. Now the cupboard isn't
as full, but it's not bare.''
</P>
<P>
   In their third season together, Farmer, a redshirt junior, and
McNown, a senior, have developed a sixth sense that's as difficult
to describe as it is to stop. McNown trusts that Farmer will catch
anything in sight. Farmer trusts that McNown will throw a catchable
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before Freddie got here, I was the only experienced
receiver,'' Farmer said. ``I made it clear to myself that I really
had to perform to a higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they arrived in 1995, McNown and Farmer spent little
time together. McNown was busy running the team. Farmer, a walk-on
better known for his volleyball talents, toiled with the scout
team.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer received a football scholarship the following summer and
joined the rotation. He led UCLA with 31 catches in 1996, including
a memorable 52-yard touchdown against USC. Last season, he made 41
catches and was named honorable-mention All-Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer and McNown have grown closer. They play golf and lounge
on the beach, McNown chatting away, Farmer reciting lyrics from
every song imaginable. This summer, McNown took Farmer home, to
West Linn, Ore., and they went fishing and river rafting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationship isn't just football,'' Farmer said. ``We've
truly become friends. We complement each other well.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer is what Borges calls a ``gamer,'' meaning he practices
well but plays great. McNown is the same way, his arm stronger in
games than practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice, Danny does a good job, but you don't really
notice him,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``But in games, he continues
to make big plays. Some guys have it, some don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer has the genes for it. His father, George, played football
and basketball and ran track for UCLA. His uncle, Dave, lettered in
football at USC. His maternal grandfather, Steve Miletich, played
basketball for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer is the only UCLA football player with an
NCAA-championship ring. As the volleyball team's middle blocker in
1997-98, he has two. Not surprisingly, he authored the signature
sequence in the '98 title drive, making six consecutive kills to
fuel UCLA's rally against Lewis (Ohio) College in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In games, I've seen him run balls down that you don't think he
could touch,'' Bruins volleyball coach Al Scates said. ``I've had
some competitive guys, like Karch Kiraly, and Danny's the same
way.''

Too melodramatic. Way too sappy.

   In baseball, though, we love our tear-jerkers.

among the great teams in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius, whose dad made it to the games here despite
suffering from colon cancer _ I warned you that this was a
tear-jerker _ had a key, bases-loaded run-scoring single in the
eighth, when the Yankees put the game away and Brown blew up
emotionally. The hit clinched the vote for Brosius, homer-hitting
hero of Game 3, as Series most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unbelievable,'' said Brosius, who hit just .203 at
Oakland last season before staging a remarkable comeback in '98.
``Coming off last year, sometimes you wonder what kind of plan God
has for you. To come back and have a year like this, I'm just very
grateful. It's an incredible thrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest moment is that third out, knowing that you're
going to throw the ball and end the game and end the season, and
then to see the look in your teammates' eyes as we rushed to the
mound.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Yankees' 125th victory of 1998 against just 50
losses. Let the baseball historians wrestle with that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best team a lot of us will every be a part of,''
right fielder Paul O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously to have the best record of all time, to win 125
games is remarkable,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``One-twenty-five
and 50 ... how neat is that? We may not be the best team of all
time, but we have the best record. The 1927 Yankees put the bar up
pretty high and we went over that.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, Torre's big brother Frank, celebrating the second
anniversary of his new heart, is doing just fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, who had flown to Houston to be with his father during
his open-heart surgery last week, gave up just five hits in 71/3
innings and Torre deftly maneuvered his bullpen to ease his team
out of an eighth-inning tight spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres helped out with a highly questionable judgment calls
by third base coach Tim Flannery, who inexplicably held speedy
Quilvio Veras at third on Ken Caminiti's line single to right in
the bottom of the eighth, even though the Yankees were conceding
the run and not even throwing to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Sigh. Maybe they should bring those tacky, orange and brown
taco-vendor uniforms back after all.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who may own the best right arm and the worst luck in
baseball, ultimately saw his infamous sinker hurt him as much or
more than it did the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Twice the Yankees chopped the ball off the dirt in front of the
plate to snap a scoreless tie in the sixth. They scored twice more
in the eighth and barely got a ball out of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who had walked Derek Jeter to start the eighth, lost it
when first-base umpire Tim Tschida signaled O'Neill, who had
dribbled the ball to Leyritz at first, safe on a bang-bang play.
</P>
<P>
   Twice Brown had to be physically restrained from getting to
Tschida, who probably would have been justified in throwing him out
of the game. Brosius' single over a drawn-in Padres' infield plated
one run and Ricky Ledee's sacrifice fly brought home another.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the good sport that he is, derisively doffed his cap at
Tschida as he left the field at the end of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   You just can't change the stripes on a skunk.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it didn't matter what kind of stink Brown raised.
This was the Yankees' year and no team could have kept them from
their destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been around a more determined or more courageous
group,'' Torre said. ``To have the record we had going and to
continue to play well and never take a day off, that was a great
indication to me that we were pretty special.''
</P>
<P>
   So very, very special.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, like the Rangers and the Indians before them, were
just bit players on the Yankees' stage, no more important than
pieces of movable scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Some were able to speak a few lines (not the Rangers), some (the
Indians) were able to spend a little more time on stage than the
others.
</P>
<P>
   But there was never any question who deserved star billing.
</P>
<P>
   So now it's time to bring on the roses and rise to your feet,
baseball fans. Open the curtains and let the Yankees take their
bows. If ever a team deserved a standing ovation and a round of
``Bravos!'' it is this one.

BERNIE'S BIG DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Has Bernie Williams played his final game with the
New York Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   Williams' pending free agency has made his future with the team
an issue throughout the 1998 season and Wednesday night was no
different.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Yankees won their second World Series in the last
three years by sweeping the San Diego Padres on Wednesday, success
alone might not be enough to keep him in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Yankees had the inside track over other teams,
Williams did not exactly say what New York fans wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say it's probably about as good as any other team right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who turned 30 last week, won the American League
batting title with a .339 average. He had 26 homers and 97 RBI and
is in the prime of his career. Next to Ken Griffey Jr., Williams is
considered the best center fielder in baseball. All that is
expected to make his market value sore well above $10 million per
season.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is part of a premier free-agent class that includes
Padres Game 4 starter Kevin Brown, former Dodgers catcher Mike
Piazza and Houston left-hander Randy Johnson. World Series MVP
Scott Brosius also is eligible for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have balked at giving Williams anywhere near $10
million annually in previous negotiations. They have offered five
years for $37 million and have exclusive negotiating rights for the
next 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Scott Boras, has not made free agency an issue during
this magical Yankees season. But it is a difficult subject to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996 championship season, the Yankees lost closer John
Wetteland and starter Jimmy Key to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if that's going to be the case, we hope we can send him
away with the ring,'' said emotional Yankees manager Joe Torre.
``And though the nature of the games is you're not going to have
everybody back, obviously we all hope we get Bernie back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough saying good-bye to Jimmy Key and John Wetteland,
too, in 1996. We understand it and I think that's why players want
to take advantage of something special like we have going on right
now. But it is going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams finished the Series with a meager .063 batting average
(1 for 16), leading many to believe he was distracted by the
free-agent possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees won the American League Championship Series
against Cleveland, Williams skipped the celebration and remained in
the players' lounge. After the Yankees clinched the World Series on
Wednesday, he left the celebration and walked alone with his wife
in deep center field at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I let it slip a little bit and in the back of my
mind it's all that uncertainty, the feeling of not knowing what's
going to happen next year,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I start thinking about the things that are happening
to me right now and I feel very blessed. I'm just going to worry
about (free agency) when the time comes.''

PETTITTE PERFECT IN PINCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Andy Pettitte's mind admittedly wasn't on baseball a
week ago. But on Wednesday, in the most monumental start of his
young career, the Yankees pitcher threw his whole soul into the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte pitched 71/3 masterful innings to help power the
Yankees to a 3-0 World Series-sweeping win over the Padres in front
of the largest crowd ever to watch a baseball game here (65,247).
</P>
<P>
   The win capped some kind of weird, worrisome, wonderful season
for the Yankees, who battled more adversity off the field than on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry, no small presence among the pinstripes, was
diagnosed with colon cancer early in the postseason and the team
didn't blink. The father of third baseman Scott Brosius also is
fighting colon cancer and Brosius didn't miss a beat, hitting two
home runs to almost singlehandedly win Game 2 on Tuesday to earn
Series' MVP honors.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Pettitte, whose father underwent double-bypass
heart surgery during the American League Championship Series
shortly after his son was shelled in the Yankees' last loss of the
season, as it were, against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte gave up eight hits, four of them home runs, in 42/3
innings, then traveled to Houston to be at his father's side.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it had been that kind of year for Pettitte, 26,
whose earned-run average of 4.24 was significantly worse than his
2.88 in 1997. Never had a 16-game winner felt so miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of embarrassing to say I won 16 games,'' Pettitte,
who was 16-4 during the regular season, said on the eve of his
stiffest assignment as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would have graded his regular season, Pettitte
answered bluntly, ``I'd give myself a B-minus. I felt like it was a
little bit more of a struggle than it has been in the past.
Mechanically, I've had difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, the beauty of midterms; they show you what you need to bone
up on to ace the final exam.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte's 100-pitch performance was first-rate. It was
reminiscent of his effort in Game 5 of the 1996 World Series
against Atlanta when he pitched 8.1 shutout innings to give the
Yankees a 3-2 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called weak link in the Yankees' rotation allowed five
hits and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to think about the bad things more than the good so
this was definitely gratifying,'' said Pettitte, who tends to be
harder on himself than any of Yankee Stadium Bleacher Creatures
could ever be.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation that had he pitched in Game 2 at home, he
would have been booed. Instead, Pettitte will return to New York as
Broadway's newest matinee idol.

DESTINY FULFILLED IN MAGICAL SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The hype, it turns out, was justified. The New York
Yankees capped as memorable a season as their time-honored
franchise has ever seen by winning their record 24th World Series
championship in stylish fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they had done all season, the Yankees smothered their
opponent in the World Series, sweeping San Diego in four games to
win their second championship in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, who mostly resembled a club in awe of the Yankees
and their mystique, succumbed, 3-0, on Wednesday night, becoming
the 16th club to fall victim to a World Series sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt they're the best team I've seen in a long
time,'' said Kevin Brown, the losing pitcher in Game 4. ``They're a
super team from top to bottom. They have few holes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' triumph culminates a season in which they won 114
regular-season games while losing 48 and then breezed through the
postseason with an 11-2 record, giving them an incredible overall
record of 125-50.
</P>
<P>
   It also fulfills Yankees boss George Steinbrenner's promise last
year that his New York club would win the 1998 World Series, a
pledge he made publicly the same night the Yankees lost to
Cleveland in the division playoffs last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a little emotional tonight,'' said Steinbrenner, who
celebrated his fourth Series title in the 25 years since he bought
the club. ``This is as great a Yankee team as there has ever been.
It's wonderful because New York needs this; it boosts the entire
city right up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end the Yankees simply threw too many weapons at San
Diego, who were National League champions for only the second time
in their 30-year history.
</P>
<P>
   It started snowballing for the Yankees in Game 1 when Chuck
Knoblauch and Tino Martinez slammed key home runs in the seventh
inning, helping erase a three-run deficit, and finished with New
York starter Andy Pettitte putting the Padres to sleep with 7
innings of scoreless ball Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In between, New York tossed its arsenal at overwhelmed San
Diego, including little-known outfielder Ricky Ledee, who was 6 for
10 with four RBIs; perennial All-Star Bernie Williams, who slammed
a key two-run home run in Game 2; and Series Most Valuable Player
Scott Brosius, whose four-RBI game on Tuesday propelled the Yankees
to victory that night.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's heroes for the Yankees were Pettitte and shortstop
Derek Jeter, who made a spectacular defensive play and scored twice
while reaching base three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel privileged to have been a part of this team,'' said
Brosius, who arrived from Oakland in exchange Kenny Rogers last
winter. ``No one guy carried the load. It was all 25. It's a
special group of guys filled with great character.''
</P>
<P>
   But this series seemed to be decided well before Wednesday,
like, say, back in Game 1 last Saturday. From the beginning, San
Diego seemed awestruck, especially during the first two games at
venerable Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   No one displayed how intimidated the Padres were more than third
baseman Ken Caminiti, who admitted he was freaked out by the
raucous scene in the Bronx. He may not have been alone: Caminiti,
Wally Joyner and Steve Finley hit a combined .088 with one RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, who fell on his rear three times in the last two games
while swinging and missing pitches and has been bothered by a
strained groin almost all season, finished the series with two hits
in 14 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get anything going,'' said Caminiti, whose seven
strikeouts were the most in a four-game series since Bob Meusel did
the same for the Yankees in the 1927 Series. ``I was good enough to
be out there so I should have been good enough to get the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego, whose 1-8 World Series record ranks last in
big-league history, fell one victory shy of becoming the first club
since the 1993 Philadelphia Phillies to go an entire season without
being swept in a series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to use the word magic because I used it in '96,''
said Yankees Manager Joe Torre, who has guided New York to the
title in two of his three years there. ``I will say, I've never
seen a more determined group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're inundated with so many stats these days and players get
into the `What's in it for me' mentality. There was none of that
here this year. It was a special, special team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to argue that point. &QL;

KARIYA IS BACK WITH A FLASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ He's back.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 10, 1997, Paul Kariya was in Vancouver waiting for a new
contract offer. The franchise's centerpiece was snipped out of the
opening-night video package and new coach Pierre Page was lustily
booed on one of the strangest evenings in Anaheim Mighty Ducks
history.
</P>
<P>
   And that was before the first puck of the game was even dropped.
The sleep-inducing tie with Ottawa that followed seemed to set the
tone for what would turn out to be the worst season in Anaheim's
short history.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations may not be great heading into the 1998-99 season,
but Kariya was in the highlights, on the program cover, and most
importantly in the lineup Wednesday as the Ducks defeated Boston
3-0 in the home opener before a sellout crowd of 17,174 at the
Pond.
</P>
<P>
   In his first regular-season home game since Feb. 1, Kariya added
another goal to his own personal highlight reel as the Ducks won
their second consecutive game after opening the season with three
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who also had an assist, gave the Ducks a 2-0 lead at
14:51 of the second period while Anaheim had a two-man advantage.
Teemu Selanne's cross-ice pass to Kariya at the side of the Boston
net turned into a goal when the Ducks winger swatted the puck past
Boston goalie Byron Dafoe baseball-style after it bounced off his
stick.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, who had scored only once in their first 21 power-play
chances, then scored their second power-play goal of the game when
Fredrik Olausson's shot from the right point slipped through
Dafoe's pads at 15:42.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Ducks a 3-0 lead, which was more than enough for a
team whose defense has been surprisingly effective in the first
five games.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg doesn't have the luxury of calling
upon Chris Chelios like he did in Chicago, but he insists defense
is more than a one-man effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team thing, you have to have pride in playing defense
as a team,'' said Hartsburg. ``We've got guys who are capable of
playing well back there. I like the way they compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chelios is an unusual player, coaching him you learn to
respect him, but that's over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim defense did a good job of shutting down the Bruins,
especially in the first two periods when they limited Boston to 15
shots. In particular, the Ducks controlled dangerous winger Sergei
Samsonov, who came into the game with six points in the first six
games.
</P>
<P>
   When the defense did falter, goalie Guy Herbert was up to the
challenge. He made a glove save to stop Ted Danato from close range
midway through the second period. In the third period he foiled a
three-on-two break by the Bruins when he slid across to stop Steve
Heinze.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert got some help from the post on a shot by Ray Bourque
midway through the third, but made some of his own luck by diving
backwards to deny Chris Taylor after his shot bounced off the post.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert stopped 26 shots to record the Ducks' first home shutout
since Nov. 26, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya had three shots in the first period and even dished out a
good body check on Bourque. But it was one of Kariya's newly
acquired bodyguards that opened the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McKenzie knocked in his own rebound with 46.1 seconds left
in the opening period, this after defenseman Mike Crowley was able
to hold the puck in at the left point thanks to a good forechecking
effort by Tomas Sandstrom.

THEY'RE GOOD, BUT DON'T SAY GREATEST EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO - They don't have a nickname. No sure Hall of Fame
candidates. Nothing that separates them in the mythology of
baseball other than a bloated victory total.
</P>
<P>
   No, the '98 Yankees are not the best team of all time.
</P>
<P>
   What they are is a wonderful anomaly. A home-grown outfit. A
team without egos or superstars. A team that is deep, resourceful,
without a weakness.
</P>
<P>
   A team that isn't supposed to exist in the statistic-driven,
me-first era of free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a back seat to no one in my lifetime,'' Yankees
Manager Joe Torre said. ``This ballclub is like no other club I've
ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the Yankees won their 24th world
championship. With a sweep over the Padres, they closed the books
with a record of 125-50, the best winning percentage since the
fabled Yankees of 1927. They started the season with a three-game
losing streak, finished with a seven-game winning streak, and in
between, posted the most victories of any team in American League
history.
</P>
<P>
   And after they celebrated on Padres soil, they walked off the
field, assuming their place under the microscope of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to rank among the greatest ever,'' Yankees' owner
George Steinbrenner said. ``Not just the greatest Yankees, but the
greatest ever. They are warriors. All those great teams of the
past, each year, they would get bigger in people's minds. This team
will do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner is right about one thing. These Yankees make the
team picture. But they are not Murderer's Row. They are not the
Swingin' A's. They are not the Big Red Machine. And without a
ferocious slugger or something worthy of romantic folklore, they
will not get bigger with age.
</P>
<P>
   The first four batters for the '27 Yankees made the Hall of
Fame. The A's won three straight titles from 1972-74. The Reds were
an offensive juggernaut, one that capped their second straight
title in 1976 without losing a game in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees went 11-1 against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now three levels of playoffs,'' Steinbrenner
countered. ``You know how hard it is to get through three levels,
particularly with everybody pointing at you?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the road is longer. But with a league seriously diluted by
expansion, a league with an enormous economic disparity between the
big and small markets, the journey is much easier.
</P>
<P>
   When El Duque washed ashore, the Yankees spent the money. When
Hideki Irabu refused to play for the Padres, the Yankees spent the
money. And who else could afford to pay Chili Davis _ a part-time
designated hitter _ a whopping $7 million a year?
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you're the Yankees and you go out and spend the
money, you're going to have a chance to win,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   In this Series, the Padres never got that chance. They were
badly outclassed. Their manager didn't go a night without a
questionable maneuver. As they paraded around the field afterward,
holding their arms up in triumph, they were clearly content with
second place.
</P>
<P>
   In the other locker room, expectations were met, champagne
swirled, Steinbrenner fought back tears. Like him or not, much of
this accomplishment is a reflection of the owner.
</P>
<P>
   While the system is broken, Steinbrenner will spend anything to
win. From an enormous scouting department to a gigantic payroll,
the man seizes the moment.
</P>
<P>
   And there is something special about his baseball team. While
Scott Brosius was MVP, the Yankees were best symbolized by a
wonderful pitching staff, the professionalism of Paul O'Neill, the
youthful brilliance of Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 125-50. I don't think many teams can say that, and we
played with an intensity level that I've never seen before,'' Jeter
said. ``I think you can argue for us as being the best of all
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you can argue that an air-tight team such as the Yankees were
destined to put up huge numbers in an expansion year. An
organization that enjoyed a great season, but certainly not the
greatest bunch to lace up the cleats.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrate them for what they are. A team in the truest sense of
the word.  &QL;

NHL ROAD PASSES THROUGH FLAGSTAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Uncertain. Anxious. Altruistic. Vengeful, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes left wing Greg Adams admits his emotions likely will run
the gamut tonight when he and his new teammates meet his old
teammates, the Dallas Stars, at a building appropriately named the
Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, having played there the past few years, you almost
feel like you want to prove yourself,'' said Adams, a 14-year NHL
veteran who joined the Coyotes this summer as an unrestricted free
agent. ``It's going to be weird. There's a lot of good friends of
mine over there. It's going to be strange to play against them for
the first time. I'm not sure what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Adams felt the same way when he left his family
and home in Nelson, British Columbia, to accept a hockey
scholarship from an obscure little university tucked away in the
pines in a town he'd never heard of before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where ``did'' he go to college?'' asked Coyotes goalie Jimmy
Waite, a French-Canadian from Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   NAU.
</P>
<P>
   ``NA-what?'' Waite said.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Arizona University. It's up in Flagstaff,Ariz. The
Lumberjacks. They don't have an NCAA hockey program anymore,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah. I've heard of that place,'' Waite said. ``I didn't
know they ever had college hockey here.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Adams, but it was the only college in North America
that offered him a full scholarship. He took it, closed his eyes
and prayed. After two years of playing Tier II junior hockey near
Vancouver and getting absolutely zero sniffs elsewhere, he figured,
``What the heck?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect at all,'' Adams said. ``About the
only thing I knew is that it was in Arizona someplace. When I came
down here, I remember flying into Phoenix, and it was something
like 110 degrees, and I'm like, `Oh, my gosh! How are we going to
play hockey here?' But I got a much different feeling driving up to
Flagstaff. It cooled off a lot, and I said, `I can handle this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   During his second and final season at NAU, in 1983-84, Adams
didn't just handle it. He manhandled the rest of the NCAA, leading
the nation in scoring with 44 goals and 73 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a real good team that year,'' he said. ``We had a lot
of guys in the same situation as me, where we didn't get the offers
from the big schools, but we all were good enough to play for one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone just had a great year. We ended up something like
21-5, but because we were an independent, we didn't go anywhere. It
was a little disappointing, too, after having such a good season
and not being able to finish it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too many years later, the men's ice hockey program at NAU
was finished as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that was kind of sad,'' Adams said. ``They had a lot of
problems with the arena, and they never had the money to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, though, was just beginning. His big season at NAU caught
the eye of the New Jersey Devils, who signed him as a free agent.
Since then, he's scored 30 or more goals four times in his career
and has reached the 20-goal plateau nine times _ five while with
the Vancouver Canucks, where he was a teammate of Cliff Ronning,
Jyrki Lumme and Gerald Didick and went to the Stanley Cup Finals
against the New York Rangers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give him a lot of credit for coming out of a
small school like that and making it as big as he has,'' Waite
said. ``It's a pretty cool story.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it doesn't come with its share of jokes. Adams said he
gets teased about his days at NAU from several players, including
an ex-teammate in New Jersey who once told him, ``A hockey player
coming out of Arizona is like a baseball player coming from
Alaska.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are glad it worked out the way it did, though. In
Adams, they get a 6-foot-3, hard-working, two-way player who has
tallied 306 career goals and 631 points. They get some desperately
needed scoring help behind captain Keith Tkachuk. And they get a
guy who's been through the playoff wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not only a highly skilled player,'' Coyotes Coach Jim
Schoenfeld said, ``but he's a very intelligent player, both with
and without the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes the right read in the offensive rush. He doesn't
force a play that isn't there. If the thing's shut down, he knows
how to make a good dump-in and establish our forecheck. He's real
good in the neutral zone, he knows all his assignments, and he
battles so hard, he usually wins the one-on-ones.''
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly what he did in Dallas, where he was traded
halfway through the 1994-95 season. He scored 60 goals in 177 games
with the Stars. He was at his best last November, when he had four
goals and four assists, earning NHL player of the week honors. &QL;

'99 BUSCH SERIES RACE SPEEDING TO WARD PIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For nearly 10 years, fans, teams and sponsors have
been hammering Phoenix International Raceway President Buddy Jobe
for a NASCAR Busch Series race.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what?
</P>
<P>
   It's here.
</P>
<P>
   Sources on Wednesday told ``The'' ``Arizona Republic'' that
PIR's 1999 schedule will include a Nov. 6 Busch Series race, which
is scheduled the same weekend as the NASCAR Winston Cup event.
</P>
<P>
   PIR officials have scheduled a noon press conference today to
make the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is we're very close (to an agreement),''
Jobe said. ``It's something we've wanted for a long time. If we get
a Busch race, it will elevate the program we have at PIR.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Operations Director Kevin Triplett wouldn't confirm the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan on announcing our 1999 Busch schedule in the near
future,'' Triplett said. ``Until certain things are done, we can't
really comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Busch Series, second in NASCAR importance to the Winston Cup
circuit, has 31 races this season. Many of its races are held in
conjunction with Winston Cup events, giving fans twice the
opportunity to see such stars as Mark Martin, Dale Jarrett and Jeff
Burton, who often compete in both races.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt Jr. are also going
to compete in several Busch Series races next season, one of which
could be at PIR.
</P>
<P>
   Although sources said there was initial discussion regarding a
Busch Series race at PIR in January, NASCAR officials apparently
never seriously considered the date.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first got our Winston Cup race in 1988, we started
asking about a Busch race,'' Jobe said. ``But from Day 1, the
response was Busch would never race west of the Mississippi
(River).
</P>
<P>
   ``Now look at the series. There were three races (at Las Vegas,
Fountain, Colo., and Fort Worth) in this region this year. It would
be an immensely great addition for us if we get one. The race fans
want and love this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series schedules two
yearly races at PIR, one of which is Saturday's GM Goodwrench
Service Plus/AC Delco 300 at PIR, which precedes Sunday's
Dura-Lube/Kmart 500.
</P>
<P>
   But the Busch Series addition means the Truck Series will appear
once on PIR's schedule next season. A truck race will be held the
same March 26-28 weekend as an Indy Racing League event.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Saturday truck race prior to the Dura-Lube 500
attracted a crowd of about 60,000, and it's believed a Busch Series
race will draw even more fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (PIR officials) think 70,000 fans would come to a Busch
race,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   Seating capacity at the track is 72,576. However, infield and
hillside attendance swelled last year's Winston Cup crowd to
104,000.
</P>
<P>
   Besides seeking a Busch race, Jobe has lobbied for a coveted
second Winston Cup race. But he's convinced it won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's in the cards for us to get another race,''
said Jobe, who sold PIR last year to Daytona Beach, Fla.-based
International Speedway Corp. ``There's too many other areas NASCAR
needs to go like Kansas City and Chicago. I think the chances of
tracks getting a second race are slim and none.'' &QL;

STANFORD'S LOSING, BUT PASSING FANCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - When the game-ending whistle sounds _ sometime
near daybreak Friday is a safe bet _ Arizona State will have a
sense of its immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's meeting with Stanford at Sun Devil Stadium could be
the start of a promising era with Chad Elliott at quarterback. Or
it could mean ASU's fifth loss and a season continuing to spin out
of control.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty heavy stuff for a game in which the teams have combined
for three victories.
</P>
<P>
   Both are in a funk. ASU (2-4, 1-2 Pac-10) has lost two straight.
Stanford (1-5, 0-3) is coming off a heartbreaking defeat against
Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   How does the Cardinal plan to snap out of it?
</P>
<P>
   Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to spread us all over the field,'' ASU Coach
Bruce Snyder said. ``They're going to have shifts, motions and
they're going to try to find a mismatch. And if (quarterback Todd
Husak) has time, he's going to find the open guy. We've got to put
pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is expected to play without two backfield starters,
tailback Coy Wire (dislocated thumb) and fullback Maxwell Stevenson
(neck). A team that has attempted more passes than rushes in all
but one game this season is expected to continue its air assault.
</P>
<P>
   It could get interesting. Stanford wants to make better use of
backup quarterbacks Randy Fasani and Joe Borchard _ two of the
team's most athletic players _ and that could manifest itself in
unusual ways.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick told the ``San Francisco
Examiner,'' ``You might see two of them in the backfield at the
same time. There are all sorts of possibilities. . . . I'm still
looking for the ultimate, to get all three in the ballgame at once.
It's not going to happen this week, but it's going to happen. I'm
not going to say when.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's strength has been its receivers. DeRonnie Pitts and
Dave Davis likely will surpass 1,000 yards this season. Preseason
All-America Troy Walters is back after playing in just two full
games because of an ankle sprain. Husak has passed for 1,772 yards
and 11 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been excited about his ability to run our offense and
really keep us in the right thing at the right time,'' Cardinal
Coach Tyrone Willingham said. ``His ability to spread the ball
among our receivers has been super this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Said ASU's J'Juan Cherry, ``As a cornerback, you want them to
throw the ball. I ``really'' want them to throw the ball. If
there's a challenge, me and Courtney (Jackson) and the rest of the
defensive backs, we can step up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils will be forced into their nickel and dime
packages, which isn't necessarily a good thing because of how thin
they are at defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plan on being there until about midnight,'' Snyder said.
``We're just going to sleep over.''
</P>
<P>
   He was kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't he?
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see 60, 70 passes from them,'' Snyder said. ``I don't
know, but if you look at the circumstances . . . it could be like a
pass scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just talked to the whole defense: We need to get four-man
pressure where he must throw on time. If he doesn't, we've got to
get him to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger story, at least for ASU fans, is Elliott. How will
the redshirt freshman perform in his first start in place of Ryan
Kealy?
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is the right opponent for a debut. Its weaknesses have
been defending the run and giving up big plays. The Sun Devils
offense has the potential to capitalize on both.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder has vowed to get fullback Jeff Paulk in the game more,
and his blocking, in particular, has a significant impact on how
well the Sun Devils run. Having the option to hand off to J.R.
Redmond is the ideal way to keep Elliott focused.
</P>
<P>
   He'll pass, too. Count on it. Elliott loves to throw deep, and
if ASU finds it can capitalize on Stanford's secondary, which is
allowing a conference-high 9.7 yards per reception and 10
touchdowns, he'll go long.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real confident, and it has a way of rubbing off on other
players,'' center Grey Ruegamer said.

Trevino, hometown hero Dave Stockton from USC and
golfers-turned-broadcasters-returned-golfers Johnny Miller and Gary
McCord.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who will draw the biggest crowds is Palmer, who is
coming off seven weeks of radiation treatment related to his
recovery from prostate cancer that was diagnosed in January of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   This is Palmer's first tournament since August. He has been able
to practice around treatments and has shot several rounds in the
60s, including a 63 on his home course at Latrobe Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good scores happened within two weeks of starting the
treatments,'' said Palmer, who turned 69 on Sept. 29. ``It was
before I had much reaction to it. I was rested from all of the work
I had been doing and started to play some pretty good golf.''
</P>
<P>
   (Palmer played a round with his son-in-law Sunday and shot 68.)
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Palmer won't rule out the chance of one more magical
weekend. His continuing optimism in the face of advancing age and
deteriorating skills is a large part of his appeal to fans. They've
appreciated him for parts of five decades and Palmer says the
feeling is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans have always been a special part of my career,'' he
said. ``They have inspired me over the years and I hope I have
inspired them, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Names in the game: Alice Cooper, Eddie Van Halen, Hootie and
the Blowfish, and ... Grayson Taylor Eleftheriou? The first three
are rockers turned golfers and Grayson Taylor certainly has that
potential _ but he'll have to wait awhile for both professions.
</P>
<P>
   Six-week-old Eleftheriou, born Sept. 11, is the son of former
heavy metal bandsman and current Scholl Canyon head pro Ted
Eleftheriou, who now combines 60-70 lessons a week with late-night
diaper duty. Mother (Lisa) and baby are doing well, and as for that
predictable wailing and shrieking in the middle of the night,
ex-rocker Ted calls it music to his ears....
</P>
<P>
   __ SCPGA junior stars: Santa Clarita Valley's Brandon
Christiansen, 12, is one of 10 area junior golfers to earn a top-10
placement in the final Southern California PGA junior age-group
rankings for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen, a La Mesa Junior High seventh grader who will
compete in the national final of the Golf Skills Challenge Nov. 7
at Ojai, wound up sixth in the age 12-13 SCPGA division. Anthony
Kim of Studio City was second in that division, which was topped by
player of the year Henry Liaw, the 13-year-old Rowland Heights
phenom and two-time Junior World champion.
</P>
<P>
   Other area top-10 finishers included Nick Geyer of Agoura Hills,
Eugene Choi of Granada Hills and Edgar Reyes of Lakeview Terrace
(3-5-7 in boys 11-under); Calabasas High junior Justin Ohye (10th
in boys 14-15); Alemany High junior Krystal Shearer (fifth in girls
15-17); Harvard-Westlake sophomore Ina Kim and Hart freshman Sarah
Jones (2-9 in girls 12-14); and Grace Woo of Burbank (eighth in
girls 11-under).
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who has helped Harvard-Westlake get off to a 15-2 start in
this, the Southern Section's first year of girls' high school golf,
is one of two members of her family to earn top-10 recognition.
Older sister Hanna, a junior at Brentwood, is ranked No.5 in the
girls 15-17 division.
</P>
<P>
   __ Klein honored: Former Notre Dame High star Emilee Klein, who
honed her game at Glendale's Oakmont Country Club and won a
national junior girls championship in 1991 en route to a career on
the LPGA Tour, has been inducted into the SCPGA Junior Golf Hall of
Fame. Klein, 24, who won the 1994 individual NCAA championship
while competing for Arizona State, has won twice on the LPGA Tour,
including the 1996 Women's British Open.

PAC-10 STILL ATTRACTIVE TO OUTSIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - With the temptation of greener (as in money) pastures,
the Pac-10 continues to be courted by universities who want to
join.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego State recently invited the conference's athletic
directors and media to tour its state-of-the art facilities. Rumors
of interest from programs including Colorado and Brigham Young have
kept talk of Pac-10 expansion alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're closely monitoring the landscape from a national
perspective,'' Arizona State Athletic Director  &UR; Kevin White said.
``There are no evident moves on the horizon, but it would be less
than honest to say we weren't paying attention to other
conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular notion is this: When the Big 10 adds a 12th member _
Notre Dame being its No. 1 choice _ other major conferences will
respond accordingly, and the Pac-10 would add two more schools.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest names out there include Colorado, Texas, BYU and
Utah. Although the latter two are moving to a new conference in
1999, Cougars Athletic Director  &UR; Rondo Fehlberg acknowledged,
``We'll always do what's in our best interest. If's there's a
better alternative, we'll listen.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest argument for expansion is income opportunity.
Greater market size and penetration means bigger dollars.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pac-10's revenues have increased 115.3 percent since
1990, the 12-team Southeastern Conference's revenues are up 261.3
percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that dividing the pie 12 ways would mean less
revenue than expected. Traditionalists wince at the thought of
enlarging the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something we're pursuing, but, sure, it's often a
topic of discussion,'' said  &UR; Jim Muldoon, Pac-10 assistant
commissioner
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand the lure: tradition and success. Pac-10
teams won 11 NCAA championships last season. Additionally, the
conference grossed $15.8 million in bowl revenue, which was divided
among its schools. The Western Athletic Conference, by comparison,
brought in $2.1 million. &QL; 
Around the Pac &QL; 
When  &UR; Chris Sailer missed a 21-yard field goal at the end of
regulation against Oregon last Saturday, he had a horrible
flashback to a moment at practice two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He accepted a challenge from a local TV sports anchor to kick
field goals of 25 yards. He won, but tweaked a groin muscle in the
process and didn't kick in practice for the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the smartest thing I've ever done,'' he told the`` Los
Angeles Times''.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Sailer, he hit a 24-yarder in overtime to lift
UCLA and keep the Bruins in the national championship picture.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA linebacker  &UR; Brendon Ayanbadejo said the Bruins remind him
of another Pac-10 team not so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we do look like that Arizona State team,'' he said.
``They pulled it out no matter what. We have the same spark of a
champion, like ASU in '96.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern California Coach  &UR; Paul Hackett provided some bulletin
board material for UCLA when he called Oregon, the Trojans'
opponent Saturday, ``the best team in the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said, ``I don't know if anything can be put on the
bulletin board to affect that rivalry. We're going to play UCLA in
the distant future, so I can't worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the week &QL; 
``Basically, I think you can pray all you want, but God's not going
to help you make a block or run the ball. If you're not ready to
play, praying's not going to help you.'' _ USC guard  &UR; Travis
Claridge, on his team's decision to pray before and after each game
in the locker room. &QL;

INJURED MCCLESKEY ACHING TO PLAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Here's how badly Cardinals cornerback  &UR; J.J.
McCleskey wants to play against Detroit on Nov. 1:
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see me there in a wheelchair, if I have to,'' said
McCleskey, who has missed four consecutive games because of a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   McCleskey returned to practice Wednesday for the first time
since undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on Sept.
24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been very frustrating,'' said McCleskey, who was
starting right cornerback for much of training camp while  &UR; Tom
Knight was sidelined because of a shoulder injury. ``Seeing people
make plays and not make plays, I figured I could do it. I'm a
confident player.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said McCleskey has been missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very, very tough and physical player who isn't very
big,'' said Tobin of McCleskey, 5 feet 8, 184 pounds. ``He battles
you. He's a competitor and played well at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``His knee was bothering him all of camp. Finally, he couldn't
go anymore. I'm anxious to see how well he can run, cut and cover
the next two weeks.'' &QL; 
Personal business &QL;

KNIGHT UNDERSTANDS DURABILITY QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Tom Knight, the Cardinals' second-year
cornerback, has heard the whispers. He knows there are those
questioning his durability, attempting to attach a hated label to
the ninth pick of the 1997 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Injury prone.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that Knight has the athletic talent to
live up to that first-round draft status. And if he blossoms into
the player the Cardinals envisioned when they selected him out of
Iowa, Knight and Aeneas Williams could be among the NFL's best sets
of cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   But injuries have hampered Knight's progress, even during last
season when he started 15 of the team's 16 games. A knee strain,
shoulder injury and concussion slowed his progress and Knight did
not intercept a pass as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Another shoulder injury slowed him at training camp, and then a
freakish knee injury during a non-contact practice drill, sidelined
him for the past three games.
</P>
<P>
   Knight had undergone reconstructive knee surgery at Iowa, but
played his last two seasons there relatively injury-free. His
durability never had been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely frustrating,'' Knight said Wednesday after he
returned to the Cardinals' first team defense in a light workout.
``Obviously, you hear all the things that come up. Maybe you don't
hear it yourself, but you turn on a radio show and a friend or
somebody else is saying, `He's always hurt.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing for me is to understand things are going to
happen and realize that they happen for a reason. I can't let it
become a negative thing throughout the course of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are hopeful that Knight will be ready to return to
the starting lineup Nov. 1 when they visit the Detroit Lions, a
team with one of the NFL's most explosive receiver tandems, Herman
Moore and Johnnie Morton.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals secondary coach Larry Marmie believes the team and its
fans have yet to see Knight's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think last year he went through the usual growing pains of a
rookie,'' Marmie said. ``At that position, you're out there
isolated. We felt he was really close to making a lot of plays.
That's the one thing we really talked to Tommy about in the
off-season. He needs to become a playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he had taken a big step forward in training camp
when he hurt the shoulder, and he was really playing well before he
had the setback with his knee injury. He was making plays. That's
the encouraging thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Marmie said he feared the worst when Knight injured the knee,
especially after seeing the play on film. Knight felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hyperextended it, and the knee was kind of moving all over
the place,'' Knight said. ``After what I had gone through before
(with the knee surgery), it was very frightening. Fortunately,
nothing was torn in there and it remains stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight figures to be a target when he gets back into the lineup.
But then he's used to that. It comes with playing opposite a
four-time Pro Bowl selection like Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a target on his chest,'' Marmie said. ``Teams are
going to test him. They know what Aeneas can do, and they're going
to find out what the other guy can do.''
</P>
<P>
   And Knight still believes that he can do a lot more than he's
had a chance to show in his brief NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go out there this season and really make a
statement,'' Knight said. ``I felt like I was really starting to
get in a groove, play well and get the tempo. I don't think the
best of me has been on the field yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's driving me absolutely nuts sitting out. It's that same
feeling you get when you're a kid. You want to participate. Whether
it's good or bad, you want to feel like you're a part of it.'' &QL;

YANKEES' DREAM SEASON ENDS WITH SERIES SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Many have tried to come up with words to describe
the 1998 New York Yankees, calling them a great team, a complete
team, maybe one of the best teams ever.
</P>
<P>
   But the best way to describe the Yankees' 1998 World Series
championship can be summed up in one word.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees completed a four-game sweep of the San Diego Padres
with a 3-0 victory Wednesday night in front of 65,427 at Qualcomm
Stadium. It was the Yankees' 24th World Series title in 35
appearances. No other major league team has won more than nine
titles.
</P>
<P>
   It was inevitable because the Yankees proved a team which won an
American League record 114 regular-season games and a major league
record 125 games overall was indeed the best team in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitable because the Yankees didn't have to rely on any one
player to carry them, instead getting production from everyone on
the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitable because, well, they're the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre said he didn't quite know what he had
in spring training, but he had a good idea after seeing his team
respond after struggling early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until the first week of the season did I know we might
have something special,'' Torre said. ``We started out 1-4 and I
told them, `Do something about it. You've got to get angry.' And
they started playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have this inner conceit. They know they're good but they
don't care about telling other people about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they showed everybody on the field, going 125-50
overall for a winning percentage of .714, the fourth highest in
major league history.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees starter Andy Pettitte, who hadn't pitched since Game 3
of the ALCS on Oct. 9, pitched seven scoreless innings before
tiring in the eighth Wednesday. Relievers Jeff Nelson and Mariano
Rivera worked out of that jam, however, with Rivera getting Jim
Leyritz on a flyout with the bases loaded to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored the only run they needed in the sixth inning
when Bernie Williams, playing in what was probably his final game
as a Yankee, drove in Derek Jeter from third with a high chopper in
front of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was thrown out at first, but the Yankees had the lead
to keep. World Series MVP Scott Brosius drove in the Yankees'
second run of the game with a single in the eighth and Ricky
Ledee's sacrifice fly made it 3-0 later the same inning.
</P>
<P>
   In sweeping the series, the Yankees beat the Padres in two games
started by Kevin Brown, the hottest pitcher in baseball going into
the Series.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Pettitte who deserved most of the credit for
Wednesday's victory, pitching for the first time since the Indians
knocked him around for six runs and eight hits in 42/3 innings 12
days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte responded with 71/3 scoreless innings Wednesday,
allowing five hits while striking out four and walking three. Brown
gave up three runs and eight hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   All that's left for the 1998 Yankees is finding their place in
history. But to those in the champagne-soaked clubhouse, there is
no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is as good as any there's ever been, Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner said as he searched for a champagne bottle that
still had champagne in it. ``The game is so much more difficult
today to get to the next level. There are so many more steps along
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how his team would fare against the '27 Yankees,
Steinbrenner said: ``We'd do very well against them, put it that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees players say their record speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the greatest team ever,'' Yankees pitcher David Wells
said. ``We've got the best record ever, that makes us the best
team. Some day, some team might pass us. But right now, we're the
best ever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked around the lockerroom when I got here and I said I'm
lucky,'' DH Chili Davis said. ``I knew this was a special ballclub.
I was hurt most of the year, and when I was ready to come back I
walked into a team that was a moving train going full-speed ahead.
I had to run alongside to catch up. And what a ride it was.''
</P>
<P>
   As pitcher Orlando Hernandez passed out Cuban cigars to his
teammates, Steinbrenner summed it up: ``This is one of the best
teams ever in one of the best seasons ever. That's supposed to
happen to the Yankees.''

PADRES TAKE CURTAIN CALL  
 WILL FANS BE SO GENEROUS IN VOTE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The scene following Wednesday night's final game of
the 1998 baseball season was so incredible that even longtime
baseball watchers could not recall such an outpouring of emotion
for a losing World Series club.
</P>
<P>
   With Qualcomm Stadium still nearly full after the home club had
just suffered a somewhat embarrassing four-game sweep at the hands
of the powerful New York Yankees, the masses forced the Padres
players out for one final curtain call with a steady roar, similar
to what occurs at the end of a concert.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they players streamed out to thunderous ovations
from what can arguably be called the loudest fans in baseball.
Moments earlier, the Padres had already begun undressing. Suddenly,
they began putting on their pants again and scampering to the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' San Diego General Manager Kevin Towers
said. ``It makes you proud to be a San Diegan and be associated
with this city. Most fans would have been out the turnstiles and
headed for the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was special. With the amount of free agents (six) we have,
maybe their last thought or impression will be what you just saw.
Maybe they'll remember how special it is to play here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, who figures to be among the most wanted free agents
this winter, however, never saw the scene. Brown remained inside
the Padres clubhouse, sitting alongside reliever Randy Myers, who
was heartily booed when he entered in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Brown insists it was a memorable season for him,
one that culminated in his second consecutive trip to the World
Series. Still, the sense was he probably played his last game for
the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a fairy tale ride to finish it out,'' said
Brown, who pitched for the Florida Marlins last season. ``I don't
think we have anything to be ashamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   While Brown will wrestle with his decision, nearly everyone
inside the Padres clubhouse was astonished at the fans' wanting to
see the players one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get back in this situation one more time,'' third
baseman Ken Caminiti said. ``We all hugged inside the clubhouse and
felt a lot of emotion. There was a lot of love inside there.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest day in San Diego Padres history will take place in
2{ weeks when voters will be asked to help pay for a new baseball
park for the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt within the club's front office that
reaching the World Series was significant achievement, one that
very well could push the vote over the top for the Padres, who are
talking like they will leave town if the voters deny the new park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a threat,'' club President Larry Lucchino said. ``The
reality is that we need this new ballpark to survive in San
Diego.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres probably will not have to worry about the chanting
fans who remained inside the stadium more than an hour after San
Diego lost, 3-0, to the Yankees. They may as well have been
chanting ``Yes on C,'' the referendum's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all helped us through the season like you would not
believe,'' Manager Bruce Bochy told the crowd. ``Seeing you all
still here, it gets emotional down here. Thank you''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fitting end to a spectacularly memorable 1998 season.
The lingering memories will be of the juggernaut Yankees club. But
the scene that took place in San Diego after the game should not be
forgotten, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fans were great,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said. ``I
think they appreciated us for what we did this season. As I like to
say, we don't spike the ball. We just play the game.'' &QL;

CATS' FOE WON'T FEAR TUCSON TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - Northeast Louisiana is just 4{ years removed
from Division II, yet it has a schedule that Nebraska has been
known to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The obscure school, nicknamed the Indians, plays its third
ranked team Saturday in No. 14 Arizona. It won't be in awe.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians already have played two teams that were No. 3 at the
time. They lost to Florida, 42-10, and Kansas State, 62-7.
</P>
<P>
   They're traveling west, perhaps because Nebraska couldn't fit
them in this year. But there is a payoff. Notheast Louisiana is
guaranteed $350,000, or $200,000 more than the NCAA minimum. In
part, Arizona is paying for not scheduling a home-and-home series
with the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Louisiana is also a late stand-in for Virginia.
Orginally, the Wildcats were supposed to play at Charlottesville,
Va., this Saturday. But Arizona Coach  &UR; Dick Tomey didn't like the
idea of having to travel across the country a week after playing at
Oregon State. &QL; 
Crowd count &QL; 
An interesting statistic this Saturday will be the crowd size at
Arizona Stadium. With an obscure opponent, there are questions
about whether the Wildcats are a strong draw in themselves. In
part, the crowd will serve as measure of where the football program
stands in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is fourth in Pac-10 attendance. Over two home games, the
Wildcats have drawn a total of 111,372 fans, or an average of
55,686. UCLA leads with an average of 71,882. Washington is second
at 71,048 and Arizona State third at 66,602. &QL; 
Bowl roll &QL; 
The Wildcats (6-1) will qualify for a bowl with a probable victory
over Northeast Louisiana. The NCAA requires six victories for bowl
qualification. Arizona needs a seventh because it has a 12-game
schedule. But bowl talk sounds premature to quarterback &UR; Keith
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals are to go as far as we possibly can,'' he said. ``It
is so hard to look at a bowl game right now. You don't know what is
going to happen.'' &QL; 
Briefly. . .  &QL; 
Running &UR; Leon Callen was one of three nominees for the Pac-10
offensive Player of the Week, which went to UCLA quarterback  &UR; Cade
McNown for the second straight week. Defensive end  &UR; Mike Robertson,
a first-time starter, was nominated for defensive Player of the
Week, which went to UCA linebacker &UR;  &UR; Brendo Ayanbadejo.
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: Robertson started at Oregon State for  &UR; Joe
 &UR; Tafoya, who was suffering from back spasms. Tafoya, probably
Arizona's best defensive lineman, is questionable for Saturday.
Center  &UR; Bruce Wiggins is troubled by a bruised left shoulder.
Cornerback  &UR; LaChaux Rich, sidelined because of an ankle sprain the
past four weeks, probably will miss his fifth game. &QL;

LEGACE CARVES EARLY LEGACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ A few years back, Manny Legace was at training
camp with the Hartford Whalers, awed by his surroundings and
wondering who his roommate would be.
</P>
<P>
   He had a Sean Burke hockey card in his wallet, when in walked
his roommate ... Whalers goalie Sean Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walks in,'' Legace said, ``and I said, `Wow.' I feel like a
mouse in a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, with Kings regulars Stephane Fiset and Jamie
Storr sidelined with groin injuries, Legace made his NHL debut
against the Florida Panthers and their goalie, Sean Burke.
</P>
<P>
   By game's end, Legace had stopped all but one of the 50 shots
he'd faced and was the sole reason the Kings (2-1-2) escaped with a
1-1 tie in the first game of a five-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my dreams, I never thought I would get 50 shots,'' said
Legace, who received the approval of 17,367 at the National Car
Rental Center. ``I thought I played OK.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he was the difference in the Kings' third consecutive
overtime game. Burke only faced 19 shots, and he made some big
saves, particularly one where he flung himself across the crease to
block a third-period shot by Yanic Perreault. But the goal he
allowed _ a first-period wraparound by Luc Robitaille in the first
six minutes _ was soft.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the ice, Legace made one save after another,
including stopping Florida rookie Oleg Kvasha from point-blank
range with less than six minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' Kings goaltending coach Don Edwards said,
shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like they were 50 shots here and there,'' Kings
coach Larry Robinson added. ``Some of them were point blank,
screened. He won the game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he didn't quite win it, but Robinson's point was clear.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was not nearly as happy with the rest of his team as he
was with his 25-year-old rookie. Not only did the Kings manage just
nine shots in the first two periods, they had to survive eight
Florida power plays, including a 74-second two-man disadvantage in
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have killed 28 of 29 short-handed situations in their
first five games. But the Kings' power play was 0 for 8 against
Florida and went without a shot during its final opportunity, which
came in the last minute of regulation and first minute of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I probably have more faith in young kids than
anything else,'' said Robinson, whose team was without center Jozef
Stumpel (hip-flexor strain), defenseman Steve Duchesne (groin
strain) and winger Josh Green (shoulder strain).
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I know one thing: that they're going to give you 100
percent and they're going to work hard. That's more than I can say
for our team on most nights. And that's the most disheartening
thing for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not playing like we were last year. Last year we were
committed to playing hard for the team and proving everybody wrong
that was saying we're not that good a team. Right now, we're not
getting that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Legace, however, the Panthers managed just one goal.
Dave Gagner beat him on Florida's 14th shot of the game, a rebound
from the left faceoff circle 43 seconds into the second period
after he'd stopped a shot by Gord Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to give their goaltender a lot of credit,'' Florida
coach Terry Murray said. ``I'll give him a lot of marks.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one Kings teammate, center Nathan LaFayette, said he
was not surprised by Legace's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing against Manny since we were 10 years old,''
LaFayette said. ``He's stood on his head every time. I wouldn't
expect anything different.''
</P>
<P>
   Legace, however, admitted he was nervous through 60 minutes of
regulation, the first 3:39 of overtime, the 20 minutes it took to
sweep up a broken pane of Plexiglas, and the final 81 seconds of
the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sleep last night,'' Legace said. ``I got a couple
of hours, not very much. The last couple of nights have been like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Kings, he was wide awake Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd be exhausted,'' Legace said. ``When the alarm
went off this morning, I was a little tired. But when I got to the
rink, I wasn't. I'll sleep when I'm dead.''

HAPPINESS IS BEING  .  .  .  NO.  30  
 MAGEE ON BUBBLE FOR TOUR CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If golfers wore numbers on their backs like football or baseball
players _ or maybe even Brahma bulls _ Andrew Magee would be No.
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here he comes out of the chute . . . NUMBER 30!'' deadpanned
Magee, who finished 30th on the PGA Tour's money list last year and
is in the same precarious position with $890,702 going into this
week's final regular-season event, the Walt Disney World Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a second-string quarterback, or a great player off
the bench. I'm always the middle man, and I like it like that. I
don't want to be up there any higher (on the money list). That
would be scary. I'd have to make a lot of public appearances if I
finished better than Number 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Humor always has been Magee's defense mechanism. In the
dog-eat-dog world of professional golf, the Paradise Valley pro
stays alive by staying loose.
</P>
<P>
   But this is an extremely serious weekend of golf for Magee. Any
of the players currently sitting from No. 31 to 50 can knock him
out of next week's $4.5 million Tour Championship if they can grab
one of the top five spots at Disney, and the money adds up in their
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Magee says not finishing among the top 30 money winners ``might
get to someone else, but I'm sleeping fine these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Magee, 36, is at ease because last year's season-ending
event, the Las Vegas Invitational, had such a bizarre twist. Magee
and his wife, Susan, were sitting on the couch at home watching
ESPN when the cable network announced that Magee, who had missed
the cut in Vegas, had been bumped to No. 31 by Billy Andrade. Susan
Magee's math, however, added up to a different result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Susan called ESPN, and a half hour later they announced
that I'd beaten Billy by about $5,'' Magee recalled. ``That shows
you how close it is in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks before the 1997 Tour Championship, Magee had made
a $30,000 check with a 10th-place finish at Disney, which this year
switched dates with Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I got up and down on the last hole from some ridiculous
place in the bunker to essentially earn the $5 I needed,'' Magee
said, laughing at the razor's edge that so often defines life on
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the story of my whole career. I'm just a
30-kind-of-guy _ the 45th-ranked player in the world. Not bad; but
not great. It's just what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tag that Magee seems comfortable with. But don't let it
fool you. He has no plans to visit Disney World on this trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I had won about $665,000 at this point of the
season. This year I've already gone way over that,'' said Magee,
who has several second-place finishes but no victories in '98.
``Regardless of what happens, this is my best season ever
moneywise, so why should I be worry?
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so shortsighted by just looking at the money as
some kind of barometer for success. I'm trying to have a career out
here, not just a good year. I'm concentrating on the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the winner of four tournaments in 15 years on tour is
not the only guy on the Tour Championship bubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I never expected that I'd be chasing Tom Watson,
who is in 29th place ($897,385), about $7,000 ahead of me,'' Magee
said. ``Apparently, Tom is not playing this weekend, so that shows
me he's got a lot of money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there is Stewart Cink, who is No. 31 ($828,835). If he
gets into the top five or six, he could knock me out. And Stewart
has a lot of incentive, because he represents East Lake (Golf Club)
in Atlanta, the site of the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can hope for is that I have my best stuff and pitch like
`El Duque' (New York Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez). That's
exactly what I'm planning to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing among the top 30 money winners also has several other
perks, like automatic berths into the major championships for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there's that, too. I'd certainly like to pencil Augusta
(National) into my April schedule for next year,'' Magee conceded.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how the cards fall at Disney, he plans to spend a
couple of extra days in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be the featured guest Monday night on ``Golf Talk
Live'','' said Magee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll either be a happy guy by that time, or I'll be a happy
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   For No. 30, there is no other way.

TERRY LABONTE REVVING UP FOR 600TH START IN ROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Move over  &UR; Cal Ripken Jr. and make room for  &UR; Terry
Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte's NASCAR Winston Cup record for consecutive starts
should grow to 600 on Sunday, when he is expected to take the green
flag in the Dura-Lube/Kmart 500 at Phoenix International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte's remarkable streak began nearly 20 years ago on Jan.
14, 1979, when he qualified 25th, but finished last in the Winston
500 at defunct Riverside (Calif.) International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Competing in that same race was rookie  &UR; Dale Earnhardt, who
proved to be a similar iron man. Earnhardt is second all-time with
576 straight starts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ricky Rudd is third with 537.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't seem that long ago,'' Labonte said.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte set the record two years ago, breaking the mark held by
 &UR; Richard
 &UR; Petty, who made 513 successive starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, somebody brought it (Petty's record) to my
attention,'' Labonte said following the historic 514th start in
April 1996. ``When you start out, that's not one of the goals you
set.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, known as the ``Iceman'' for his low-key demeanor, was
22 when he began the record run. He'll be 42 next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big weekend for (Terry),'' younger brother  &UR; Bobby
Labonte said. ``He doesn't really get himself into predicaments
where he can get into trouble. I think it goes back to when he
worked on his own race cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he tore one up, he knew he'd have to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the expected 600th start, QVC will broadcast a live
three-hour ``For Race Fans Only' show tonight at Phoenix-based
Action Performance, Inc. &QL; 
Tire news &QL; 
Goodyear is supplying Winston Cup teams with 500 sets of tires. The
tires are essentially the same Goodyear Eagle tires used at last
year's race. The only modifications were to the left-side tires,
according to Goodyear lead engineer  &UR; Tony  &UR; Freund.
</P>
<P>
   Green-flag pit stops are expected to occur every 90-100 laps,
depending on fuel consumption. &QL; 
Pit stops &QL; 
Winston Cup rookie  &UR; Kenny Irwin, last year's NASCAR Craftsman Truck
Series rookie of the year, will be pulling double duty. He'll also
drive in Saturday's GM Goodwrench Service Plus/AC Delco 300,
driving a Cintas sponsored truck.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mike Bliss again will drive the Caterpillar Chevrolet Winston
Cup car, replacing  &UR; Steve Grissom.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hut Stricklin has been hired as a consultant for Winston Cup
driver  &UR; Gary Bradberry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gary Grossenbacher, crew chief for Winston Cup driver  &UR; Jeff
 &UR; Green, is a 1983 graduate of Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jack Sprague holds a 28-point lead over  &UR; Ron Hornaday with two
remaining Truck Series races, the closest in series history.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, what's so special about  &UR; Jeff Gordon's 11 wins this season,
the most since  &UR; Dale Earnhardt won 11 in 1987? When Earnhardt won
his 11th race, it was the 22nd event of a 29-race season. Gordon
won No. 11 in the 30th race of 33-race season.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the ``Park n' Ride'' shuttle offered for Sunday's
race at Blockbuster Desert Sky Pavilion, located north of McDowell
Road on 83rd Avenue. It's $7 to park, but rides to and from the
racetrack are free. Buses begin shuttling at 7 a.m. Save yourself a
headache and ride the bus. &QL;

GETTING AWAY FROM IT ALL  
 TONTO DRIVE WELL WORTH SOME WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's probably the fastest way to get into the pines from the
Phoenix area. A careful driver can make it in a car. It offers
awesome views and vegetation to match. There's even a chance to
take a hike or just have a picnic.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Forest Road 201, an eight- or 10-mile stretch in
Tonto National Forest, has to offer those who wish to escape to the
high country.
</P>
<P>
   The turnoff to Forest Road 201 is located north of Sunflower on
State Route 87 (Beeline Highway) to Payson.
</P>
<P>
   The turnoff to the left is at Slate Creek Pass, which no longer
has a highway sign, but the mile marker is 225. There's a large
pull-off area to the left.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for traffic at the turnoff. Vehicles coming on SR 87 from
the north are rather blinded from the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Once you make the turn, there's a decision to be made. The
unpaved forest road splits. Take the right fork to get on 201. A
sign marks the road.
</P>
<P>
   The road immediately begins a rise into the Mazatzal Mountains
and heads toward the Mazatzal Wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Take plenty of warm clothes. It was cool in the Valley when we
left last Saturday morning, and it was downright cold in an open
Jeep when we started the climb toward Mount Peeley, which is near
the end of the road.
</P>
<P>
   This narrow road is spectacular. Most of the travel is on ridges
or ledges. In either case, there are steep drop-offs, sometimes on
both sides. Until you reach the pines, the terrain offers
impressive views of the Mogollon Rim, Mount Ord and its
communication towers plus the rugged Mazatzals themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The panorama offers abandoned mines and lush vegetation. It
starts with prickly pear and other desert plants, moves into an
oak-juniper-pinon environment and finally ends up in ponderosa
pines.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the road is nearly 6,000 feet above sea level. And
some of the tree leaves along the way have turned into brilliant
fall colors. Some trees are along the road, some are are in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   In the final stages of the drive, trees form a canopy over the
road with drop-offs into heavily timbered canyons. It's difficult
to believe that such scenery can be found so close to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about the road itself. For a Jeep or truck, it is a mere
nothing. It's a little rough in spots and has some steep grades,
but four-wheel drive isn't necessary. Still, the road is so narrow
in stretches that meeting another vehicle requires some
maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't hesitate to take a car, but those not used to driving
on unpaved and sometimes rough roads should be a little wary.
However, if they take it slowly, I don't believe there would be
trouble except in mud.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the road, there's a parking area cradled among the
mountains that's just made for a picnic. It's shady and beautiful.
It's also a jump-off to a number of hiking trails.
</P>
<P>
   The summit of Mount Peeley, which is more than 7,000 feet high,
is only 1.5 miles away. The first half mile is an easy hike. The
next mile rises 1,000 feet. The trail heads up a steep grade and
apparently stays that way.
</P>
<P>
   There are other, easier trails to be hiked.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tough trip to beat if you want scenery and recreation
in a single day. &QL;

`TREATED LIKE A TRAITOR'  
 URBAN SCHOOL OFFERED GREENER PASTURES 
 THAN GRASS VALLEY FOR ASU'S ELLIOTT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a novel or a movie or just something make-believe, it had it
all. Lies, rage and jealousy. A small town divided. Revenge and
accusations and, eventually, redemption. Peyton Place without the
sex.
</P>
<P>
   But the story was real.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Elliott was the main character.
</P>
<P>
   But the sordid tale has a happy ending. Elliott endured and so
did his mom and dad, who felt everything their son felt, and more.
This, after all, is what parents do. Thursday night, when Elliott
starts at quarterback for Arizona State for the first time, Evon
and Stan Elliott will be in Sun Devil Stadium watching, cheering
and perhaps reflecting on the journey they and their son had to
make to reach this moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had taken one wrong step,'' Stan Elliott said, ``he
wouldn't be there right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems straightforward _ a struggling, 2-4 ASU team and a
typical quarterback switch before a game against Stanford. Elliott,
the brash, confident, redshirt freshman in; Ryan Kealy, the
third-year sophomore whose confidence seemingly has vanished, out.
What's going on with Kealy is anything but simple. And so is the
sequence of events that produced his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The price Elliott paid to position himself to get an ASU
scholarship was high.
</P>
<P>
   On Page 33 of the ASU football media guide, under the picture of
a very serious-looking Chad Elliott, is a description of his high
school career. It says he was a 1997 graduate of Grant High School
in Sacramento and lists his honors and statistics, including the
3,150 yards, the 69 percent completion rate, the 47 touchdowns and
the three interceptions that helped produce a 12-2 record and a
sectional championship.
</P>
<P>
   There is brief mention of what he did his junior year, but
nothing about it being spent at Nevada Union High School, which
serves the twin towns of Grass Valley and Nevada City.
</P>
<P>
   Grass Valley, not Sacramento, is Elliott's hometown, a
postcard-pretty community in the northern California pines about an
hour from Lake Tahoe. Prospectors used to come there for the gold
buried in its mountains. It is where Evon's parents own a grocery
store. Evon Elliott is fourth-generation Grass Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It is also where some considered Chad Elliott to be a turncoat
for switching high schools. His family was ridiculed and scorned.
Tires were slashed, and private investigators looked into the
Elliotts' finances, poked through their garbage, talked to their
neighbors and likely followed them around.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of cruel things that happened,'' Evon Elliott
said.
</P>
<P>
   All because her son wanted to throw the ball, to go deep, to use
his strong right arm and quick wits to the fullest. This, after
all, is what quarterbacks do. And he got to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my days where I was not very happy, crying,'' Evon
Elliott said. ``I was very upset that high school football could
get this far off the track.''
</P>
<P>
   The story begins during Elliott's junior year at Nevada Union.
The previous season, Elliott led the Miners to a championship, but
then he got hurt and was becoming increasingly frustrated with
Coach Dave Humphers' effective but conservative Wing-T attack.
Elliott knew the only way to attract college recruiters was to show
his stuff, and he couldn't do it there. Besides, Elliott was
somewhat of a rebel and wise guy. He and Humphers were starting to
get on each other's nerves. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Change of scenery &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 60 miles away in the Del Paso Heights section of
Sacramento sits Grant High School. It is everything Nevada Union is
not. It is predominantly Black as opposed to all-White. It is
bordered by concrete, not trees and mountains. Its coach, Mike
Alberghini, likes to pass. And he hired as quarterbacks coach a
Grant alum named Aaron Garcia, who was good enough to play
quarterback at Washington State before Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents knew it would be best for me to go to another
school and hope to get a scholarship out of that,'' Chad Elliott
said. ``At least give me a chance where I can shine, because all I
was doing at the other school was handing off.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant High School's No. 1 rival is Nevada Union, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Alberghini, the coach at Grant, knew about Elliott. Knew him? He
defensed him the previous two years. He admired his athletic
ability, respected how he would take a hit and get right back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put relentless pressure on him,'' Alberghini said, ``and he
never broke down.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he heard from Stan Elliott, ``I thought it was a
joke,'' Alberghini said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look where he grew up,'' he said. ``It was practically
all-White, a mixture of pretty affluent people who had chosen to
move to the hills and get out of the city, and people who had lived
there all their lives. Our school is 83 percent minorities.
Predominantly Black. Samoans. Hispanics. Most of the White kids are
Russian immigrants. It was complete culture shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberghini wanted to test the Elliotts' sincerity, so he told
them Chad would have to enroll for the spring semester of his
junior year. He did that. Chad also would have to take a geometry
class in summer school and participate in a summer ``passing
league.'' He did that, too, making the hour-plus daily commute.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I knew what kind of character he had, what kind of
person we had,'' Alberghini said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Unrest in Grass Valley &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Grass Valley, the reaction was somewhat less than
enthusiastic. Some of the residents, in fact, were irate. It wasn't
enough that Elliott left, but that he went to Grant, of all places.
An undercurrent of racism already tinged the rivalry, and now this.
People wondered aloud why parents would send their son to a school
where he would need a bulletproof vest, why a family would move to
a bad place with gangs.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, many supported the move and understood the
motives. And Evon Elliott wants it made clear she does not want the
people of Grass Valley portrayed as racist. But, she said, ``There
is some backward thinking there.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before stories about Elliott surfaced, how he was
uncoachable, a problem. Sure, Elliott said, sometimes he'd irk the
coach by wearing a hat in class or by not wearing a tie when he was
supposed to. But it was all small stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Humphers said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was benched several times for greater offenses than that,''
he told the ``Sacramento Bee'' in October 1996. ``But I'll not drag
a 17-year-old kid through the mud. I just want to leave it alone
and let him play.''
</P>
<P>
   A message left on Humphers' answering machine at Nevada Union on
Tuesday was not returned. &QL; 
Accepted and rejected &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Elliott to be eligible to play for Grant, he and his family
had to establish residency in the school district. So they rented
an 700-square foot apartment from which Stan, a building
contractor, and Evon, who works in her parents' store, commuted to
Grass Valley and back each day. Their other son, Alex, then 11,
stayed in Grass Valley and came down to Sacramento on weekends.
They kept their house.
</P>
<P>
   It was expensive and a little cramped, ``but it was kind of nice
to have a smaller place,'' Evon Elliott said. ``In a bigger house,
sometimes kids find their own sanctuaries.''
</P>
<P>
   At Grant, Elliott was ``fully accepted in a minute,'' Alberghini
said. Throwing to receivers such as Dante Stallworth, who wound up
with a scholarship to Tennessee, Elliott had a huge season. The
Pacers finished 12-2 and won a sectional title.
</P>
<P>
   One of the losses was to Nevada Union, 21-19, in its first
return to Grant's field since a shooting incident caused games to
be moved from Friday nights to Saturday afternoons. Elliott
completed just 8 of 20 passes for 155 yards and was knocked around
quite a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The real pain came after the game when he was ignored by friends
and former teammates, many of whom he played football with since
the age of 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was hard for him,'' Evon Elliott said.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was treated as a traitor,'' said Alberghini.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when Elliott went back to watch a Nevada Union game,
somebody slashed his tires. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A wonderful `melting pot' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Elliott was growing as a football player, and in ways more
substantial than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how wonderful it was,'' Evon Elliott said of
the family's move to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it would be a good experience for my son. We lived in a
predominantly White area. Here he was, about to be 17, and he'd
rarely seen any other races in our area. It was beneficial in so
many ways. He made so many lifetime friends. It was good. Football
was good. Relations were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Evon Elliott said her son regularly brought teammates home for
dinner, and even now she sends care packages to Dante Stallworth in
Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped me a lot,'' Chad Elliott said. ``College is a
melting pot, a bunch of different cultures and people, and it
helped me get ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the season, Stan, Evon and Chad returned to Grass Valley,
but Chad finished out the school year, driving up and down the
mountains each day. ASU assistant coach Phil Snow had noticed
Elliott and began recruiting him hard. Quarterbacks coach John
Pettas joined the effort. They were virtually the only ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at his old school were disgruntled and were telling bad
stories about him,'' Pettas said. ``So we investigated his
character. We thought he was a good kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott committed to ASU before Christmas. One reason was,
``They stuck by me,'' he said. ``I was getting recruited a lot and
all of a sudden some would drop off. My quarterback coach called
the colleges and asked why. They said the coach of my previous high
school said I was a bad kid and don't recruit me. But ASU stuck by
me.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Digging up garbage &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another investigation was taking place. In February
1997, the ``Bee'' reported that the Nevada Joint Union High School
District was checking to see if the Elliotts failed to maintain a
full-time residence in Sacramento. That would strip Grant of its
title and Elliott of his records. The newspaper also reported that
private investigators were hired to follow Elliott and his family.
That was denied. But neighbors were interviewed, credit checks were
made and the Elliott's garbage rummaged through.
</P>
<P>
   It also was a fact that Nevada Union High School sent a letter
of inquiry to Grant. Both principals would not comment, but Nevada
County superintendent of schools Terry McAteer called the whole
thing a ``mess,'' and added, ``It's really sort of sad when a
school district sanctions private eyes going through people's
garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation produced nothing but harder feelings and a
lawsuit against the school district filed by the Elliotts. No
improprieties were found. Chad Elliott's records stood. Life goes
on, and folks calmed down.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott enrolled at ASU and during his first year, Evon Elliott
moved again, this time to Chandler for six months to help her son's
transition. After Elliott's success at Grant, the same people in
Grass Valley who decried his leaving now looked at him ``like I had
done something special,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If all is forgiven, who knows? If Elliott can lead the Sun
Devils out of the doldrums and becomes the college quarterback he
thinks he can be, they might have a parade for him. &QL;

DESTINY FULFILLED IN MAGICAL SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The hype, it turns out, was justified. The New York
Yankees capped as memorable a season as their time-honored
franchise has ever seen by winning their record 24th World Series
championship in stylish fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they had done all season, the Yankees smothered their
opponent in the World Series, sweeping San Diego in four games to
win their second championship in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, who mostly resembled a club in awe of the Yankees
and their mystique, succumbed, 3-0, on Wednesday night, becoming
the 16th club to fall victim to a World Series sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt they're the best team I've seen in a long
time,'' said Kevin Brown, the losing pitcher in Game 4. ``They're a
super team from top to bottom. They have few holes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' triumph culminates a season in which they won 114
regular-season games while losing 48 and then breezed through the
postseason with an 11-2 record, giving them an incredible overall
record of 125-50.
</P>
<P>
   It also fulfills Yankees boss George Steinbrenner's promise last
year that his New York club would win the 1998 World Series, a
pledge he made publicly the same night the Yankees lost to
Cleveland in the division playoffs last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a little emotional tonight,'' said Steinbrenner, who
celebrated his fourth Series title in the 25 years since he bought
the club. ``This is as great a Yankee team as there has ever been.
It's wonderful because New York needs this; it boosts the entire
city right up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end the Yankees simply threw too many weapons at San
Diego, who were National League champions for only the second time
in their 30-year history.
</P>
<P>
   It started snowballing for the Yankees in Game 1 when Chuck
Knoblauch and Tino Martinez slammed key home runs in the seventh
inning, helping erase a three-run deficit, and finished with New
York starter Andy Pettitte putting the Padres to sleep with 7
innings of scoreless ball Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In between, New York tossed its arsenal at overwhelmed San
Diego, including little-known outfielder Ricky Ledee, who was 6 for
10 with four RBIs; perennial All-Star Bernie Williams, who slammed
a key two-run home run in Game 2; and Series Most Valuable Player
Scott Brosius, whose four-RBI game on Tuesday propelled the Yankees
to victory that night.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's heroes for the Yankees were Pettitte and shortstop
Derek Jeter, who made a spectacular defensive play and scored twice
while reaching base three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel privileged to have been a part of this team,'' said
Brosius, who arrived from Oakland in exchange Kenny Rogers last
winter. ``No one guy carried the load. It was all 25. It's a
special group of guys filled with great character.''
</P>
<P>
   But this series seemed to be decided well before Wednesday,
like, say, back in Game 1 last Saturday. From the beginning, San
Diego seemed awestruck, especially during the first two games at
venerable Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   No one displayed how intimidated the Padres were more than third
baseman Ken Caminiti, who admitted he was freaked out by the
raucous scene in the Bronx. He may not have been alone: Caminiti,
Wally Joyner and Steve Finley hit a combined .088 with one RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, who fell on his rear three times in the last two games
while swinging and missing pitches and has been bothered by a
strained groin almost all season, finished the series with two hits
in 14 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get anything going,'' said Caminiti, whose seven
strikeouts were the most in a four-game series since Bob Meusel did
the same for the Yankees in the 1927 Series. ``I was good enough to
be out there so I should have been good enough to get the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego, whose 1-8 World Series record ranks last in
big-league history, fell one victory shy of becoming the first club
since the 1993 Philadelphia Phillies to go an entire season without
being swept in a series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to use the word magic because I used it in '96,''
said Yankees Manager Joe Torre, who has guided New York to the
title in two of his three years there. ``I will say, I've never
seen a more determined group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're inundated with so many stats these days and players get
into the `What's in it for me' mentality. There was none of that
here this year. It was a special, special team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to argue that point. &QL;

THEY'RE GOOD, BUT DON'T SAY GREATEST EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ They don't have a nickname. No sure Hall of Fame
candidates. Nothing that separates them in the mythology of
baseball other than a bloated victory total.
</P>
<P>
   No, the '98 Yankees are not the best team of all time.
</P>
<P>
   What they are is a wonderful anomaly. A home-grown outfit. A
team without egos or superstars. A team that is deep, resourceful,
without a weakness.
</P>
<P>
   A team that isn't supposed to exist in the statistic-driven,
me-first era of free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a back seat to no one in my lifetime,'' Yankees
Manager Joe Torre said. ``This ballclub is like no other club I've
ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the Yankees won their 24th world
championship. With a sweep over the Padres, they closed the books
with a record of 125-50, the best winning percentage since the
fabled Yankees of 1927. They started the season with a three-game
losing streak, finished with a seven-game winning streak, and in
between, posted the most victories of any team in American League
history.
</P>
<P>
   And after they celebrated on Padres soil, they walked off the
field, assuming their place under the microscope of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to rank among the greatest ever,'' Yankees' owner
George Steinbrenner said. ``Not just the greatest Yankees, but the
greatest ever. They are warriors. All those great teams of the
past, each year, they would get bigger in people's minds. This team
will do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner is right about one thing. These Yankees make the
team picture. But they are not Murderer's Row. They are not the
Swingin' A's. They are not the Big Red Machine. And without a
ferocious slugger or something worthy of romantic folklore, they
will not get bigger with age.
</P>
<P>
   The first four batters for the '27 Yankees made the Hall of
Fame. The A's won three straight titles from 1972-74. The Reds were
an offensive juggernaut, one that capped their second straight
title in 1976 without losing a game in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees went 11-1 against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now three levels of playoffs,'' Steinbrenner
countered. ``You know how hard it is to get through three levels,
particularly with everybody pointing at you?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the road is longer. But with a league seriously diluted by
expansion, a league with an enormous economic disparity between the
big and small markets, the journey is much easier.
</P>
<P>
   When El Duque washed ashore, the Yankees spent the money. When
Hideki Irabu refused to play for the Padres, the Yankees spent the
money. And who else could afford to pay Chili Davis _ a part-time
designated hitter _ a whopping $7 million a year?
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you're the Yankees and you go out and spend the
money, you're going to have a chance to win,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   In this Series, the Padres never got that chance. They were
badly outclassed. Their manager didn't go a night without a
questionable maneuver. As they paraded around the field afterward,
holding their arms up in triumph, they were clearly content with
second place.
</P>
<P>
   In the other locker room, expectations were met, champagne
swirled, Steinbrenner fought back tears. Like him or not, much of
this accomplishment is a reflection of the owner.
</P>
<P>
   While the system is broken, Steinbrenner will spend anything to
win. From an enormous scouting department to a gigantic payroll,
the man seizes the moment.
</P>
<P>
   And there is something special about his baseball team. While
Scott Brosius was MVP, the Yankees were best symbolized by a
wonderful pitching staff, the professionalism of Paul O'Neill, the
youthful brilliance of Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 125-50. I don't think many teams can say that, and we
played with an intensity level that I've never seen before,'' Jeter
said. ``I think you can argue for us as being the best of all
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you can argue that an air-tight team such as the Yankees were
destined to put up huge numbers in an expansion year. An
organization that enjoyed a great season, but certainly not the
greatest bunch to lace up the cleats.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrate them for what they are. A team in the truest sense of
the word.  &QL;

'99 BUSCH SERIES RACE SPEEDING TOWARD PIR 
</HEADLINE>
 SERIES-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly 10 years, fans, teams and sponsors have been
hammering Phoenix International Raceway President Buddy Jobe for a
NASCAR Busch Series race.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what?
</P>
<P>
   It's here.
</P>
<P>
   Sources on Wednesday told ``The'' ``Arizona Republic'' that
PIR's 1999 schedule will include a Nov. 6 Busch Series race, which
is scheduled the same weekend as the NASCAR Winston Cup event.
</P>
<P>
   PIR officials have scheduled a noon press conference today to
make the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is we're very close (to an agreement),''
Jobe said. ``It's something we've wanted for a long time. If we get
a Busch race, it will elevate the program we have at PIR.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Operations Director Kevin Triplett wouldn't confirm the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan on announcing our 1999 Busch schedule in the near
future,'' Triplett said. ``Until certain things are done, we can't
really comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Busch Series, second in NASCAR importance to the Winston Cup
circuit, has 31 races this season. Many of its races are held in
conjunction with Winston Cup events, giving fans twice the
opportunity to see such stars as Mark Martin, Dale Jarrett and Jeff
Burton, who often compete in both races.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt Jr. are also going
to compete in several Busch Series races next season, one of which
could be at PIR.
</P>
<P>
   Although sources said there was initial discussion regarding a
Busch Series race at PIR in January, NASCAR officials apparently
never seriously considered the date.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first got our Winston Cup race in 1988, we started
asking about a Busch race,'' Jobe said. ``But from Day 1, the
response was Busch would never race west of the Mississippi
(River).
</P>
<P>
   ``Now look at the series. There were three races (at Las Vegas,
Fountain, Colo., and Fort Worth) in this region this year. It would
be an immensely great addition for us if we get one. The race fans
want and love this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series schedules two
yearly races at PIR, one of which is Saturday's GM Goodwrench
Service Plus/AC Delco 300 at PIR, which precedes Sunday's
Dura-Lube/Kmart 500.
</P>
<P>
   But the Busch Series addition means the Truck Series will appear
once on PIR's schedule next season. A truck race will be held the
same March 26-28 weekend as an Indy Racing League event.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Saturday truck race prior to the Dura-Lube 500
attracted a crowd of about 60,000, and it's believed a Busch Series
race will draw even more fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (PIR officials) think 70,000 fans would come to a Busch
race,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   Seating capacity at the track is 72,576. However, infield and
hillside attendance swelled last year's Winston Cup crowd to
104,000.
</P>
<P>
   Besides seeking a Busch race, Jobe has lobbied for a coveted
second Winston Cup race. But he's convinced it won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's in the cards for us to get another race,''
said Jobe, who sold PIR last year to Daytona Beach, Fla.-based
International Speedway Corp. ``There's too many other areas NASCAR
needs to go like Kansas City and Chicago. I think the chances of
tracks getting a second race are slim and none.'' &QL;

PAC-10 STILL ATTRACTIVE TO OUTSIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the temptation of greener (as in money) pastures, the
Pac-10 continues to be courted by universities who want to join.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego State recently invited the conference's athletic
directors and media to tour its state-of-the art facilities. Rumors
of interest from programs including Colorado and Brigham Young have
kept talk of Pac-10 expansion alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're closely monitoring the landscape from a national
perspective,'' Arizona State Athletic Director Kevin White said.
``There are no evident moves on the horizon, but it would be less
than honest to say we weren't paying attention to other
conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular notion is this: When the Big 10 adds a 12th member _
Notre Dame being its No. 1 choice _ other major conferences will
respond accordingly, and the Pac-10 would add two more schools.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest names out there include Colorado, Texas, BYU and
Utah. Although the latter two are moving to a new conference in
1999, Cougars Athletic Director Rondo Fehlberg acknowledged,
``We'll always do what's in our best interest. If's there's a
better alternative, we'll listen.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest argument for expansion is income opportunity.
Greater market size and penetration means bigger dollars.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pac-10's revenues have increased 115.3 percent since
1990, the 12-team Southeastern Conference's revenues are up 261.3
percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that dividing the pie 12 ways would mean less
revenue than expected. Traditionalists wince at the thought of
enlarging the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something we're pursuing, but, sure, it's often a
topic of discussion,'' said Jim Muldoon, Pac-10 assistant
commissioner
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand the lure: tradition and success. Pac-10
teams won 11 NCAA championships last season. Additionally, the
conference grossed $15.8 million in bowl revenue, which was divided
among its schools. The Western Athletic Conference, by comparison,
brought in $2.1 million. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Around the Pac &QL; 
 &QL; 
When Chris Sailer missed a 21-yard field goal at the end of
regulation against Oregon last Saturday, he had a horrible
flashback to a moment at practice two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He accepted a challenge from a local TV sports anchor to kick
field goals of 25 yards. He won, but tweaked a groin muscle in the
process and didn't kick in practice for the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the smartest thing I've ever done,'' he told the Los
Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Sailer, he hit a 24-yarder in overtime to lift
UCLA and keep the Bruins in the national championship picture.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo said the Bruins remind him of
another Pac-10 team not so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we do look like that Arizona State team,'' he said.
``They pulled it out no matter what. We have the same spark of a
champion, like ASU in '96.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern California Coach Paul Hackett provided some bulletin
board material for UCLA when he called Oregon, the Trojans'
opponent Saturday, ``the best team in the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said, ``I don't know if anything can be put on the
bulletin board to affect that rivalry. We're going to play UCLA in
the distant future, so I can't worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the week &QL;

``Basically, I think you can pray all you want, but God's not going
to help you make a block or run the ball. If you're not ready to
play, praying's not going to help you.'' _ USC guard Travis
Claridge, on his team's decision to pray before and after each game
in the locker room. &QL;

PADRES TAKE CURTAIN CALL  
 WILL FANS BE SO GENEROUS IN VOTE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The scene following Wednesday night's final game of
the 1998 baseball season was so incredible that even longtime
baseball watchers could not recall such an outpouring of emotion
for a losing World Series club.
</P>
<P>
   With Qualcomm Stadium still nearly full after the home club had
just suffered a somewhat embarrassing four-game sweep at the hands
of the powerful New York Yankees, the masses forced the Padres
players out for one final curtain call with a steady roar, similar
to what occurs at the end of a concert.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they players streamed out to thunderous ovations
from what can arguably be called the loudest fans in baseball.
Moments earlier, the Padres had already begun undressing. Suddenly,
they began putting on their pants again and scampering to the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' San Diego General Manager Kevin Towers
said. ``It makes you proud to be a San Diegan and be associated
with this city. Most fans would have been out the turnstiles and
headed for the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was special. With the amount of free agents (six) we have,
maybe their last thought or impression will be what you just saw.
Maybe they'll remember how special it is to play here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, who figures to be among the most wanted free agents
this winter, however, never saw the scene. Brown remained inside
the Padres clubhouse, sitting alongside reliever Randy Myers, who
was heartily booed when he entered in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Brown insists it was a memorable season for him,
one that culminated in his second consecutive trip to the World
Series. Still, the sense was he probably played his last game for
the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a fairy tale ride to finish it out,'' said
Brown, who pitched for the Florida Marlins last season. ``I don't
think we have anything to be ashamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   While Brown will wrestle with his decision, nearly everyone
inside the Padres clubhouse was astonished at the fans' wanting to
see the players one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get back in this situation one more time,'' third
baseman Ken Caminiti said. ``We all hugged inside the clubhouse and
felt a lot of emotion. There was a lot of love inside there.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest day in San Diego Padres history will take place in
2{ weeks when voters will be asked to help pay for a new baseball
park for the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt within the club's front office that
reaching the World Series was significant achievement, one that
very well could push the vote over the top for the Padres, who are
talking like they will leave town if the voters deny the new park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a threat,'' club President Larry Lucchino said. ``The
reality is that we need this new ballpark to survive in San
Diego.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres probably will not have to worry about the chanting
fans who remained inside the stadium more than an hour after San
Diego lost, 3-0, to the Yankees. They may as well have been
chanting ``Yes on C,'' the referendum's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all helped us through the season like you would not
believe,'' Manager Bruce Bochy told the crowd. ``Seeing you all
still here, it gets emotional down here. Thank you''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fitting end to a spectacularly memorable 1998 season.
The lingering memories will be of the juggernaut Yankees club. But
the scene that took place in San Diego after the game should not be
forgotten, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fans were great,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said. ``I
think they appreciated us for what we did this season. As I like to
say, we don't spike the ball. We just play the game.'' &QL;

MICROSOFT CITES NETSCAPE E-MAIL AT ANTITRUST TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ Microsoft assailed the credibility and motives of
Netscape _ its big Internet software rival and the linchpin of the
government's antitrust case _ by revealing Wednesday a 1994 e-mail
from Netscape co-founder Jim Clark asking Microsoft to buy a stake
in his company.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The e-mail undermines the government's key charge that Microsoft
first approached Netscape, at a controversial meeting in June 1995,
about selling a stake in the company in return for an agreement to
cede the bulk of the browser market to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day of the landmark antitrust case, Microsoft used
the e-mail to ridicule the government's argument that the software
giant illegally exploited its dominant Windows computer operating
system and attempted to drive out its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to work with you,'' Clark told top Microsoft
executives in the Dec. 29, 1994, e-mail. ``Working together could
be in your self-interest as well as ours. Depending on the interest
level, you might take an equity position in Netscape with the
ability to expand the position later.''
</P>
<P>
   By owning part of Netscape, Clark implied, Microsoft could
venture into the market for Internet browsers without competition
from the then-industry leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never planned to compete with you,'' Clark said in the
e-mail. ``We want to make this company a success, but not at
Microsoft's expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Lead Microsoft attorney John Warden asked Netscape chief
executive officer Jim Barksdale, the government's key witness,
whether the message laid the groundwork for the June 1995 meeting.
Barksdale denied that the e-mail had any effect. ``It was not
consistent with my company's strategy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale, who did not work for Netscape at the time Clark wrote
the e-mail, said he did not learn of the offer until he was
preparing for trial. He also said it was not discussed at the
subsequent meeting with Microsoft, and Barksdale said Clark in
retrospect ``described this (e-mail) as a moment of weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's message ended with a note that no one else at Netscape
knew about the offer.
</P>
<P>
   At a courtroom break, Netscape lawyer Christine Varney told
reporters that the e-mail ``was in no way related to this June
conversation'' and that Clark wrote the e-mail at 3 a.m. when he
was ``a little nervous'' because startup Netscape was short on
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Lead government attorney David Boies told reporters he will show
that Microsoft rebuffed the offer and never referred to it at the
June meeting. ``This has nothing to do with the case,'' Boies said.
``It's another attempt by Microsoft to change the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   As Warden meticulously picked away at Barksdale's 127 pages of
written testimony, the two parried in testy exchanges. Barksdale
seldom offered information beyond what Warden directly asked, often
adopting a folksy Southern demeanor while appearing painfully
obtuse.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Warden, a thick-set New York attorney with a
booming voice, asked Barksdale whether he had seen certain magazine
reviews of Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the reviews in his hand, Barksdale asked if he was
supposed to turn the page. Warden barked, ``The first page after
the cover, yes!''
</P>
<P>
   Warden continued to attack the government's claim that Microsoft
used illegal monopoly tactics to gain market share in browsers by
``bundling'' Explorer with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Netscape's own plan all along was to give away
its browser for free, as it is now doing, as a promotional device
to get people to use other high-margin Netscape products, such as
its Internet servers.
</P>
<P>
   Warden cited quotes from Netscape executives in a
soon-to-be-published book saying that Netscape's strategy was to
make the browser ``free but not free,'' a tool to entice new
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale snapped, ``I have never heard this term, `free but not
free,' '' adding that Netscape ``emphasized market share, but we
were also running a business where we had to meet payroll. . . . We
didn't consider that then, now or ever to be a viable business
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden also attacked Barks-dale's contention that Microsoft's
free browser distribution hurt consumers and innovation or
precluded anyone from using Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it true that any home user of a personal computer
connected to the Internet can freely choose at no cost to use
Netscape's Web browsing software?'' by downloading it from the
Internet, Warden asked.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale bristled, calling the question biased. ``Most people
don't go to the trouble to do it,'' he replied. ``They are free to
walk down to the store and buy a new Edsel, but they don't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden ridiculed Barksdale for complaining about Netscape's
market share slide from 85 percent in 1996 to 54 percent last
month. ``What was GM's market share before Japan started selling
large numbers of automobiles in this country?'' Warden asked,
before Boies objected.
</P>
<P>
   Warden also attacked Barksdale's assertion that Microsoft
hobbled innovation and hurt consumers. ``Would there have been
greater innovation if you had maintained your 85 percent market
share?'' Warden asked.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale insisted that if Netscape had been able to continue to
charge for its browser, it would have had more money to invest in
research and that other companies, seeing a profit opportunity,
would have invested more as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``So consumers are not better off getting a browser for free
than getting a browser they would have had to pay for in your
hypothetical world?'' Warden asked.

JUPITER'S MOONS BOOST HOPES OF FINDING LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    New evidence from the Galileo spacecraft orbiting Jupiter
reveals that the planet's crater-blasted moon Callisto _ long
thought to be solid rock to the core _ may conceal a salty ocean
much like Earth's.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The vast warm ocean that probably lies beneath the
iceberg-studded crust of Europa is equally salty too, scientists
now say.
</P>
<P>
   A team of researchers investigating the powerful magnetic field
that pulsates around giant Jupiter reported Wednesday that a
sophisticated instrument aboard their spacecraft has detected
effects on the two Jovian moons that can best be explained by the
existence of salty water conducting electricity beneath the
mysterious satellites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, we thought Callisto was a dead and boring moon,
just a hunk of rock and ice,'' said space physicist Margaret
Kivelson of the University of California at Los Angeles, who has
been using Galileo's magnetometer to measure electric currents
flowing from Jupiter for nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new data certainly suggest that something is hidden below
Callisto's surface, and that something may well be a salty
ocean,''she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jupiter's moon Europa, images of icebergs on the icy
crust that were beamed down from the spacecraft after it reached
the planet in January of 1995 revealed strange patches of yellow
and brown matter that many scientists argue must indicate the
presence of organic matter _ the possible precursors of life _ in a
warm ocean miles beneath the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The two moons possess only weak magnetic fields of their own.
But the electric currents that Galileo's magnetometer first
detected on Europa's surface indicate that Jupiter's erratic
magnetic field is strongly influencing the currents around the
satellite, Kivelson said. That fact, she and her colleagues
theorize, would best be explained by a liquid ocean salty enough to
conduct electromagnetic currents.
</P>
<P>
   Although the team had no evidence that Callisto was anything but
an inert rocky satellite whose craters are pocked with ice, the
scientists reviewed their magnetometer data from Galileo when the
spacecraft flew past the moon three times in 1996 and last year.
</P>
<P>
   To their surprise, Kivelson said Wednesday, they found evidence
of electric currents flowing on Callisto's surface, and they too
could only be explained if beneath the rock and ice there existed a
salty ocean carrying electrical currents sufficient to produce a
full-scale magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   Although life is conceivably possible in Europa's relatively
warm ocean, it is most unlikely in the waters of Callisto because
not enough energy would be available there, said Galileo project
scientist Torrance Johnson at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Europa the ocean's warmth is produced both by internal
radioactivity and by tidal energy generated by the moon's closeness
to Jupiter, Johnson said. But Callisto has no tidal energy because
it is much farther from Jupiter, so its only heat would come from
internal radioactivity _ not nearly enough for life to exist,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The team studying magnetic forces on the two moons includes
scientists from UCLA, Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, where the Galileo mission is controlled. A full report on
the group's new findings is being published Thursday in the
scientific journal Nature.

OLYMPIC GYMNAST SAYS PARENTS HAVE SPENT ALL HER MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOAN RYAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    Until this week, Dominique Moceanu's life story seemed to
unfold like a script. Her parents, former Romanian gymnasts, had a
plan. ``I made a commitment,'' her father once said, ``that my
first-born, boy or girl, would be a gymnast. It was an unfinished
dream.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The girl won the U.S. championship at age 13 and an Olympic gold
medal at 14. She smiled through it all, publishing an
autobiography, gracing the cover of Vanity Fair and the pages of
Time and People magazines and leaping across the TV screen in ads
for Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just weeks after turning 17, U.S. gymnastics' brightest
star has jolted friends and fans with a lawsuit that contends that
her parents have squandered both her fortune and her childhood,
pushing her relentlessly to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu ran away from home Sunday, hired a lawyer and petitioned
the District Court of Harris County, Texas, to be declared
independent of her parents. A judge signed a temporary restraining
order Monday saying that Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu must stay away
from their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always had to be about the gym,'' the gymnast said of her
parents. ``I would think, `Don't you guys know anything besides
gymnastics? Can't we go out for ice cream? Can't you be my mom and
dad instead of me being your business?' . . . They haven't been
working since 1996. Where does their income come from? Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, an upset Dumitru Moceanu held a press conference at
his lawyer's office, saying that he and his wife only wanted the
best for their daughter. He said his wife was so distraught that
she could not leave the house. Dumitru Moceanu declined to say much
about a trust fund that his daughter says is all but depleted, but
he confirmed that it was set up so she would have access at the age
of 35. Dumitru Moceanu pleaded for his daughter to come home and
resume training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love her very much,'' he said, crying. ``She's just a
child, she's just a minor. I don't believe this comes from her. It
comes from other people.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dominique Moceanu's lawsuit, her father has wasted
money she earned since turning professional at age 10. But the
teenager told the Houston Chronicle on Tuesday that the problem is
about much more than money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a childhood,'' said Dominique Moceanu, who began
training at age 3 and never took a vacation until after the 1996
Olympics. She regularly put in seven- to nine-hour days in the gym,
six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always was in fear because I would get yelled at by my
father, and I would say to myself, `I'm 13 years old, come on.'
Instead of talking to me, they're always yelling with me, fighting
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Olympics approached, she stopped going to school because
it interfered with gymnastics. She was home-schooled with
videotapes and books. Her relationship with her parents
deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Moceanus opened a $4 million gym in Houston with
some of their daughter's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been getting rough for a while; a lot of people
don't know,'' said the teenager, who won the all-around gold at the
Goodwill Games in New York in July. ``We've been trying to keep
things hidden.'' She admitted that her father has hit her ``a
couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu has a 9-year-old sister who is also training
in gymnastics. The gymnast told the Houston Chronicle that she does
not want to see her sister go through the same problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu's unhappiness came to a head over the weekend
when her father reportedly threatened to fire her coach,
26-year-old Luminita Miscenco, a Romanian immigrant who is credited
with reviving Moceanu's career. Miscenco apparently had advised
Moceanu to look more carefully at her finances. With Miscenco by
her side, Moceanu called her attorney from a shopping mall Sunday
and asked to meet with him. She has since been living with friends.
</P>
<P>
   The gymnast and her lawyer, Roy W. Moore of Houston, both
declined to say how much money she has earned or how much has been
lost. But Moore said the trust that had been set up for the gymnast
is all but gone.
</P>
<P>
   Some gymnastics observers were surprised but not shocked by the
young gymnast's revelations. Gymnastics, figure skating and tennis
_ sports in which girls can become the best in the world at very
young ages _ have seen their share of athletes crumble under the
pressure from parents and coaches, from the strain on their
still-growing bodies and from the often unrealistic expectations of
fans and the media.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, tennis player Mary Pierce filed a restraining
order against her father, who was also her coach, saying he
physically abused her. Apparently no other athlete, however, has
legally tried to separate from his or her parents, though some
child acting stars, such as Macaulay Culkin, have done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that on the outside Dominique always looked happy, but
I think she looked happy because she (ital) wanted (ital) to look
happy,'' said former Olympic gymnast Kathy Johnson, now a
television commentator for Turner Broadcasting. When an 11-year-old
Dominique Moceanu was crying during a workout at the U.S. Olympic
Festival, Johnson told her to relax and just have fun. ``She looked
at me like this was some foreign advice,'' Johnson said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   USA Gymnastics, the sport's national governing body, which has
been buffeted by charges in recent years that it was not doing
enough to protect its young athletes, had little to say of
Dominique Moceanu's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be as supportive as we can to Dominique,'' said
spokesman Craig Bohnert. ``It's unfortunate when you see any parent
and child resort to legal means (to resolve their problems). . . .
This is such a fresh story we haven't had an opportunity to see if
there's something we could have done, or could do in the future, in
a situation like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu has been hiding from her parents for the past
few days, moving from house to house to stay with friends. To gain
legal adult status, her attorney said, she must prove that she is
living away from home and can support herself. Her hearing is set
for Nov. 11. If the status is granted, she will be able to demand
an accounting of her money through legal channels. She does not
turn 18 until Sept. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say they cannot imagine a court denying her
petition. If she is adult enough to support her family financially
for the past several years and to put in 30- to 50-hour workweeks
since she was a young child, who can tell her she's not adult
enough to begin living her own life?

YANKEES TOP OF THE HEAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The New York Yankees have put the final touches on
their seasonlong aura of invincibility, leaving absolutely no doubt
who has the best baseball team in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did so by completing a four-game sweep of the San
Diego Padres with a 3-0 victory in Game 4 of the World Series last
night at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte outpitched Padres All-Star Kevin Brown by throwing
four-hit, shutout baseball for 71/3 innings, giving the Yankees
their record-extending 24th World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could truly win a championship for a city to appreciate
and enjoy, it's there in New York,'' said third baseman Scott
Brosius, who was selected the Series most valuable player.
``There's no better place to win it all. I look forward to the
parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Yankees' 24 World Series winners, this club could go
down with the 1927 Yankees of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig and the
Mickey Mantle-Roger Maris edition of 1961 as one of the greatest
teams ever because few teams have been so dominant throughout the
season. The Yankees won an American League-record 114
regular-season games and 11 of 13 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is we were 125-50, and not many teams can say
that,'' shortstop Derek Jeter said. ``So I think you can argue that
we're the best team of all time. We came to play every day, and we
played with an intensity level I've never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   They also put to rest the notion that their regular season would
not be validated if they stumbled in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won 114 games, and it would have been, in its own right, a
wonderful accomplishment,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``Then
you get into postseason, and you get through the first round and
then the second round, and you think you're going to enjoy the
World Series. But the more you win, the more people expect you to
win. The thing that concerned me the most was not winning the World
Series and having someone look down at their nose at what we
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees don't have to worry about that. They really never
did stumble, except perhaps when they lost two of the first three
to Cleveland in the American League Championship Series. They've
won seven in a row since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' first baseman Tino Martinez said. ``People
were picking us to win the World Series by the All-Star break. To
finally fulfill all those high expectations is a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulfillment finally came when reliever Mariano Rivera, who had
retired Jim Leyritz on a liner to center field with the bases
loaded and two out in the eighth, got pinch hitter Mark Sweeney on
a grounder to Brosius for the final out in the ninth. He
immediately pointed both arms to the sky and was soon buried under
an avalanche of joyous teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees kept up their pitching-mound celebration for about
10 minutes while the vast majority of the crowd remained behind
chanting ``Padres, Padres.'' It was a fitting tribute to a gutsy
team that upset the Houston Astros and Atlanta Braves in the
National League playoffs but couldn't figure out a way to beat the
titans from the other league.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, pitching on three days' rest, matched Pettitte for five
innings before the Yankees broke through in the sixth. Jeter beat
out an infield single, raced to third on Paul O'Neill's double and
scored on Bernie Williams' high chopper to third. They added two
more in the eighth, which was more than enough. Pettitte combined
with Jeff Nelson and Rivera for the Yankees' fourth postseason
shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no weaknesses out there,'' Padres manager Bruce
Bochy said. ``They have starting pitching, relief pitching, and
everybody in that lineup does a great job. I have to tip my cap to
them; they're one of the best teams ever assembled.''

SLOCUM KNOWS THE SCORE AFTER 25 YEARS OF COACHING AT A&AMP;M
</HEADLINE>
 
FIXES RICE TO NORTON, 10th graf (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If R.C. Slocum ever had a personalized bumper sticker, it could
read like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a native Aggie, but I became one as fast as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has stayed one seemingly forever, or, in the opinion of
some Texas A&AMP;M former students, too long.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hard road to travel, that Texas Highway 6.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you would think an unhappy Aggies football fan had to
be nonexistent, Slocum was talking yesterday about his recent mail
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I heard from more than several about how they didn't like
our fourth-quarter defensive strategy,'' Slocum said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about the week after the upset of No. 2 Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   As legend has it, there is no place tougher in Texas, or maybe
the nation, to coach football than in College Station. Aggies are
considered, well, crazy when it comes to football and football
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum can testify to that more than anyone who ever tried to
coach in Aggieland. An Orange product with a degree from McNeese
State, Slocum has spent 25 years on the A&AMP;M staff, longer than any
football coach in school history.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, he has been head coach, third only to Dana X.
Bible (11 seasons) and Homer Norton (14 seasons). But those two
names involve ancient history. No head coach in more than 50 years
has survived as long as Slocum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greatest fans and greatest place in the world,'' he said. ``By
and large, the people are good. They've got a life and they've got
jobs, and their entire existence doesn't revolve around a football
game on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are disappointed when we lose, and they celebrate when we
win. But the right perspective is there. Then there are a few
others, and those are the ones you hear from, and no matter what,
they aren't going to be pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   In what has been Slocum's strangest season, the critics were
louder than ever until two weeks ago. There was the loss to
then-No. 2 ranked Florida State in the opener, followed by a
struggling offense in wins against so-called lightweights, followed
by a quarterback change, followed by ...
</P>
<P>
   The shocking win against Nebraska. Then last week, the Aggies
showed no victory hangover in disposing of a Baylor team on the
road. Until A&AMP;M, Baylor had played everyone extremely tough.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought that the Aggies would be ranked No. 8 in
the land by late October? Who would have thought the contest at
Kyle Field on Saturday against No. 25 Texas Tech would mean another
big-game atmosphere for College Station?
</P>
<P>
   ``For 99.9 percent of Aggies, the mood changed dramatically
around here after the Nebraska game,'' Slocum said. ``We had won
the game _ the so-called big one _ that many said we couldn't. I
always thought that criticism was way overblown, but it was there,
no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum is fond of reminding about this being the winningest
decade in A&AMP;M history. ``To achieve that, you have to have won some
big games along the way,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   And he also tacks on the zinger that makes the dog bark in
College Station. ``At no time has the NCAA ever felt better about
this football program _ just ask the NCAA,'' Slocum said. ``This is
a university where the entire foundation is supposed to be built
upon honor and upon integrity. And then to have football scandals _
that should not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there was the Jackie Sherrill era. And Slocum was an
assistant on Sherrill's staff, leading some of us to believe more
dirty tricks were coming with his promotion in 1989. But Slocum has
taken the program in exactly the opposite direction. Meaning up.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, there was a scandal under Slocum. The
infamous case of Warren Gilbert, the Dallas booster, in the
mid-1990s. ``It gave us another bad name and it hurt recruiting for
several years, but in the end, it was the best thing that ever
happened,'' Slocum said. ``The NCAA came out and said the school
president is trying to do it the right way and the coach is trying
to do it the right way _ that we had gotten the message. But that
others obviously hadn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum called it ``a clear line being drawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ``Some of our fans still thought the old way was
the right way. But what that case did was tell one and all that if
you did it the old way, you wouldn't be involved with us any
longer. The whole process did hurt, but it was also very
beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   For Slocum, this particular season has been the same. The
``99.9'' now love him in Aggieland. And will continue to do so as
long he beats Tech on Saturday.

   The blow-by-blow of the Mideast peace talks continues to
dominate, leading at USA Today, the New York Times and the
Washington Post. This is also the top international news story at
the Los Angeles Times, which leads instead with word that bilingual
education continues to thrive in California's public schools
despite passage this year of a statewide initiative substantially
restricting it.
</P>
<P>
   The big peace talk development Wednesday, the papers report, is
that Benjamin Netanyahu warned Yasser Arafat that he would take his
delegation home if his country's West Bank security demands were
not met. The most pressing demands appear to be for the
Palestinians to repeal the PLO charter's provision calling for the
destruction of Israel, and to turn over to the Israelis a number of
suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT, WP and LAT report that things had unwound so much that
the Israel delegation had packed their bags and some of their
luggage was transferred to the airport. It's not clear from the
coverage why the Israelis didn't make good on their threat. The NYT
quotes an American official saying it was just the Israelis'
``childish ploy,'' intended for domestic Israeli consumption. The
LAT notes that both settlers and the right wing of Netanyahu's own
party are warning him not to roll over.
</P>
<P>
   The WP cites this factor and adds another: Netanyahu, who is
inclined toward GOP sentiments, knows how much a breakthrough
before the congressional elections would mean to Bill Clinton, and
hence wants to deny him this success. This American political angle
is very prominent in the WP reporting, which says flatly that
Clinton wants a deal far more than the participants he's hosting
do.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the LAT makes a bathetic and rather yuppyish
reference to Clinton's role, saying that thus far, he has
``invested more than 55 hours'' in the summit talks. Do you think
the papers ever wrote about Ralph Bunche or Dag Hammarskold as if
they billed by the hour?
</P>
<P>
   The USAT runs a front-pager reporting that as part of the
just-concluded budget agreement, U.S. researchers will receive $23
million to continue work on a drug-eating fungus that could destroy
opium poppies and coca plants. A congressman who co-sponsored the
funding says that the technology should be finished in about a
year.
</P>
<P>
   A Wall Street Journal feature makes the point that the Border
Patrol, the unit of the INS that most directly polices the Mexican
border, is no longer just Anglos. Currently, 38 percent of the
patrol's rank-and-file officers are Hispanic. This is a result of
the INS' beefing up of its Operation Gatekeeper, which targets
illegal entries from Mexico into the San Diego area. The expanded
hiring recruited heavily from southwestern border states and
emphasized fluency in Spanish. The Hispanic agents often come in
for special pleading in Spanish and failing that, special abuse,
from those they detain.
</P>
<P>
   The WP front features the surprisingly successful Minnesota
gubernatorial candidacy of Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura, a
libertarian former professional wrestler, bodyguard, Navy Seal and
talk show host. Ventura has, reports the paper, stimulated the
electorate with an unpackaged campaign the likes of which have not
been seen since early Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Before dismissing Ventura as any kind of a stereotype, consider
his response to a question about his stance on gay rights: ``I have
two friends that have been together 41 years. If one of them
becomes sick the other one is not even allowed to be at the
bedside. I don't believe government should be so hostile, so
mean-spirited....Love is bigger than government.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the NYT and LAT fronts feature stories about so-called
``smart guns'' that can only be fired when held by the designated
shooter, because of a distance-sensitive transponding device such
as a finger ring. The guns could, the papers write, unify both
sides of the gun debate in that they promise to boost gun sales for
manufacturers developing them, while reducing accidental shootings
by children and ``take-away'' shootings of cops. But, notes the
NYT, there are still concerns: a government test has found that
there are reliability problems, many due to limitations of battery
life, and even if perfected, the technology would make no dent in
gun suicide by rightful gun owners, or in the gun deaths lurking in
the form of all the ``dumb'' guns already out there.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: TEENS AS ECONOMIC DRAGON SLAYERS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Oct. 25
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not long ago, the mother of a daughter about to
turn 16 called National Public Radio's ``Car Talk'' with a query:
Should the $35,000 BMW 328i she and her husband were buying as a
birthday gift come equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission or
with an automatic shift?
</P>
<P>
   ``Car Talk's'' hosts told the caller she was nuts for having
chosen such a machine for a teenager who had just gotten her
driver's license. By turns, Tom and Ray Magliozzi sought to steer
her toward a better choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll be so disappointed,'' the caller finally said. ``She so
had her heart set on that BMW.''
</P>
<P>
   Such big-ticket purchases serve as one of the final bastions of
parental discretion in an era when teenagers increasingly make
their own buying decisions. That fact is evident in the line-up of
programs being aired in the new fall television season: Beleaguered
by a splintering market, the networks are locking onto an
ever-younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-second commercial on CBS's top-rated ``60 Minutes'' costs
about $250,000 to air. For about the same amount of money, but for
half the audience share, an advertiser can buy a spot on ``Dawson's
Creek,'' a series being aired by WB that features the sex lives of
small-town teens. (The initials stand for Warner Bros., the folks
who run it.)
</P>
<P>
   After three years on the air, WB has yet to earn a profit. But
as a recent report in the Washington Post notes: ``WB has drawn
ratings among young viewers this fall that rival those of ABC, NBC,
CBS and Fox _ quite an achievement, given that WB is carried mostly
on weak UHF stations and still can't reach about 10 percent of
households nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder advertisers are hooked: Marketing studies show that
teens are a highly brand-loyal bunch. More than half purchase the
same brand on two out of their last three shopping trips, across
all brand categories.
</P>
<P>
   Teenage disposable income has also risen steadily through the
golden '90s. These funds currently average $75 a week, gleaned
mostly through part-time jobs and parental allowances. And nearly
all the money is spent rather than saved, mostly on clothing,
health and beauty aids, and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the nation's 30 million teens deliver some $110
billion a year to retail marketers. They also have what one
marketeer, a firm named ``MarketSource,'' calls ``a persuasive
influence on $150 billion'' in additional family purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's own sales pitch, posted on the Internet, reports:
``Teens are independent, experimental, materialistic, and extremely
difficult to reach through traditional media outlets.''
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, at the next meeting of the Federal Reserve Board,
perhaps Fed chairman Alan Greenspan will praise teenage buying
habits for having averted a recession.
</P>
<P>
   As the father of a 21-year-old who plans to leave the family
``payroll'' next May when he graduates from college, let me voice
my gratitude for having made it through those tough years without a
having bought him a BMW or watching ``Dawson's Creek,'' let alone
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''

</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT VEALE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 BURNING THE DAYS: RECOLLECTION 
 By James Salter 
 Vintage International, $13  .
<TEXT>
<P>
   The novelist recalls his many careers _ fighter pilot,
expatriate in Paris, screenwriter _ as if they were a series of
love affairs bound by masculine energy and a fondness for women. In
1997 our reviewer, Samuel Hynes, said this memoir gives ``eloquent
witness to the . . . power of the human imagination to re-create in
language the feeling of being, with all its elations and
despairs.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HISTORY OF THE SIEGE OF LISBON &QL; 
 &UR; By Jose Saramago &QL; 
 &UR; Translated by Giovanni Pontiero &QL; 
 &UR; Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13 &LR;  &QL; .
</P>
<P>
   The hero of this ingenious novel is a humble proofreader who in
a flash of creative lunacy alters the national saga of Portugal by
inserting a single word into a standard history text. His
publishing house is outraged, but his boss is intrigued by his
subversiveness and urges him to follow up on his impulse to rewrite
the past. In recounting their highbrow courtship, the Portuguese
author, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature earlier this
month, ``has a sure sense of the pleasurable danger of seduction,
the fear of offending, the wild hope of wooing,'' Edmund White
wrote in these pages last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FRANCHISE: &QL; 
 &UR; A History of Sports Illustrated Magazine &QL; 
 &UR; By Michael MacCambridge &QL; 
 &UR; Hyperion, $14.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This exhaustively researched book tracks the symbiotic rise of
big-time sports and one of the world's most successful magazines,
focusing on the combustible mix of raging egos, talent, crushing
pressures and Time Inc. cash that redefined sportswriting. Last
year our reviewer, Bruce McCall, called the author ``scrupulously
objective and fair-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WORLD IS THE HOME OF LOVE AND DEATH: STORIES &QL; 
 &UR; By Harold Brodkey &QL; 
 &UR; Metropolitan/Holt, $15 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This posthumously published collection revisits the author's
childhood and his obsession with the many haunted voices of the
past. The characters _ like the tales _ are constantly changing, by
turns angry and gentle, crazy and sane. ``Brodkey's style is a
magnificent achievement,'' Jonathan Rosen wrote here in 1997. ``He
captured the child's world spinning inside the adult mind.'' Holt
has reissued First Love and Other Sorrows: Stories, ($14), which
follows the lives of educated, middle-class people in the 1950's
and includes three new stories. In 1958 in The New York Times,
William Goyen said, ``Brodkey shows . . . an uncommon perception of
the secret glow within the trivialities of our poor human
majesty.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUMMER FOR THE GODS: &QL; 
 &UR; The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and
Religion &QL; 
 &UR; By Edward J. Larson &QL; 
 &UR; Harvard University, $14.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Long before O. J. there was another trial of the century, the
Scopes ``monkey trial'' of 1925, which had everything a media
circus could ask for: faith versus reason, biology versus the Bible
and colorful lawyers jousting over the role of religion in public
life. This Pulitzer Prize-winning account is ``an excellent
cultural history of the case,'' Rodney A. Smolla said here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIGHTNING SONG &QL; 
 &UR; By Lewis Nordan &QL; 
 &UR; Algonquin, $10.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Dearman is a goofy 12-year-old living on a Mississippi
llama farm who is driven to distraction by the women around him,
notably his mother and a seductive teen-age baton twirler. ``I love
this boy,'' Valerie Sayers wrote here in 1997. ``I also love the
excesses of this novel's language.'' The Starlite Drive-In, by
Marjorie Reynolds (Berkley, $6.99), also features an anxious
12-year-old hero: a tomboy who tells what happens when a brooding
stranger turns up to help her father run a drive-in theater in
Indiana. ``Reynolds tidily explores the gap between fantasy and
reality in her surely told first novel,'' Megan Harlan wrote in
these pages last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPACE IS THE PLACE: &QL; 
 &UR; The Lives and Times of Sun Ra &QL; 
 &UR; By John F. Szwed &QL; 
 &UR; Da Capo, $16.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Herman Poole Blount, a.k.a. Sun Ra, was the wildly eccentric
leader of an influential jazz ensemble that baffled and enchanted
listeners for more than 40 years until his death in 1993. ``Szwed
has produced a rare jazz biography -- one that takes full account
of the history that shaped the music and its central
personalities,'' Brent Staples wrote here in 1997. The same
publisher has issued Milestones: The Music and Times of Miles
Davis, by Jack Chambers ($21.95), which combines both volumes of
the author's earlier biography of the trumpeter and includes a new
introduction detailing Davis's final years. Reviewing the second
volume here in 1985, Francis Davis said, ``Chambers deserves praise
for his assiduous research as well as for his insightful
criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLACK JACKS: &QL; 
 &UR; African American Seamen in the Age of Sail &QL; 
 &UR; By W. Jeffrey Bolster &QL; 
 &UR; Harvard University, $14.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A historian pulls together two centuries of rousing nautical
lore, showing how seafaring commerce not only offered
African-Americans a sense of the wider world but allowed them to
bring back word of blacks in other countries. ``The book crackles
with enough drama for many novels or plays,'' Carla Davidson said
here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALL AROUND ATLANTIS: STORIES &QL; 
 &UR; By Deborah Eisenberg &QL; 
 &UR; Washington Square/Pocket Books, $14 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protagonists in this collection are affluent,
neglected children whose precocious perceptions are offset by an
inability to articulate them. Last year our reviewer, Jim Shepard,
found the stories to be ``spirited and masterly road maps through
sad and forbidding and desolate terrain.''

BIG GIRLS DON'T CRY
</HEADLINE>
  By Fay Weldon 
 346 pp. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press. $24 
 ------ 
 THE WOMEN'S ROOM 
 By ELIZABETH GLEICK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The date is 1971; the place, the middle-class London home of
Stephanie and Hamish and their two children, Rafe and Roland. A
group of women _ ``five furies in the front room'' _ have gathered
for that quaint get-together of the past, a consciousness-raising
session. Upstairs, their consciences distinctly unraised but their
consciousnesses tingling, Stephanie's husband, Hamish, and her
friend Daffy are getting it on. But never mind that: downstairs,
history is being made. As the women plow through bottles of cheap
wine and make boldly original pronouncements along the lines of
``The personal is the political'' and ``Men have art, women have
babies,'' they decide to form their own publishing company, Medusa.
To celebrate this decision, they dance naked around the living
room.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie, Layla, Alice and Nancy _ the group that eventually
runs Medusa _ are the key ``big girls'' of Fay Weldon's latest
novel, ``Big Girls Don't Cry,'' and given that Medusa sounds
suspiciously like the British publishing house called Virago, their
real-life counterparts may all be out there somewhere. But it isn't
necessary to decode this roman a clef in order to enjoy it. Part
ensemble piece (following the fortunes and misfortunes of its
characters from 1971 to the present) and part feminist primer,
``Big Girls Don't Cry'' cruises through the decades, aided by a
chatty narrator with a well-honed sense of irony and a knack for
telescoping history. Here, for instance, is one of Weldon's sly
then-and-nows: Back in the early 70's, Stephanie and Hamish were
``not very happy living together,'' she writes, ``but the custom of
the times also suggested that this was just the way things were. .
. . The human right to veracity and authenticity in personal
experience was not yet established. To be 'happy' was no one's
quest, simply to get by was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the novel, Weldon asks _ and attempts to answer _ two
loaded questions: What were the early feminists thinking? And was
the women's movement really worth it? By way of response, she toys
with our preconceived notions, flipping them, then flipping them
again. After Daffy and Stephanie have an argument, the narrator
notes: ``In those days, it was generally accepted that in any
quarrel over a man the women were to blame. The woman who lost him
had 'failed to keep him.' The woman who won him had 'led him on.'
The man stood centrally, smiling, erect, free from accusations.''
How very unfair, the reader thinks _ only to stumble, a few
sentences later, on this: ``Now yet again the gender switch has
operated. If in doubt, blame the man.''
</P>
<P>
   In their decades-long quest for both happiness and political
equality, Weldon's characters trade sexual partners and sexual
preferences with abandon. Stephanie dallies in radical lesbianism;
Layla makes Medusa her life; Alice, after pioneering the whole idea
of ``gender studies,'' gets sucked up by the New Age; and Daffy is
stuck raising Stephanie and Hamish's boys. Weldon's fiction is not
known for its subtlety _ in her last novel, ``Worst Fears,'' a dead
husband turns out to have been not merely unfaithful but
grotesquely unfaithful _ yet we come to care about the fates of
these women and their various offspring both for the ideas they are
meant to represent and for who they are.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a good thing, too, since Weldon never really resolves _
as if anyone possibly could _ the contradictions wrought by
feminism. At times she appears to yearn nostalgically for a simpler
era when the world was more ``erotic, supercharged: composed of
polarities. . . . He, she. Hard, soft. Think, feel.'' At others she
wants to be sure we don't forget the sacrifices made by her
heroines. Toward the end of the novel, Layla, childless and
dissatisfied, considers selling Medusa. ``Feminism, the bloodless
revolution,'' she mutters, lying in the bed of her longtime married
lover. ``The casualty rate was high. Suicides, the collapse of
relationships; so many of us alone, because who would put up with
us, and how could we put up with them? When every casual word is .
. . assessed for correctness, life gets exhausting.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Weldon's satirical breeziness can be infuriating, it's
always entertaining. Those who think that 1971 was not so long ago,
that things haven't changed all that much, have another think
coming. As do those who think the battle is over. ``Well, we're
sorry,'' Weldon writes, in a scene in which a selfish young woman
proves immune to the demands of the sisterhood. ``Every generation
must apologize to the future, and the greater the change that was
brought about, the profounder the apology needs to be. . . . Let
the feminists apologize for the death of love, lost children and
the diminishing of man.'' Whew! Then, just in time, Weldon steps
back from the brink of heresy: ``But what was a girl to do? Someone
has to reform the world. You can't see what you see and do
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In our passionate and often blinkered debates about the legacy _
even the survival _ of feminism, at least Weldon can be counted on
for one rare quality: in her hands, nothing, truly nothing, is
sacred.

TOO GOOD TO BE FORGOTTEN
</HEADLINE>
  Changing America in the '60s and '70s 
 By David Obst 
 282 pp. New York: John Wiley &AMP; Sons. $24.95 
 ------ 
 ZELIG'S BACK 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to publicity, David Obst ought to know a thing or
two. He's been a literary agent, a writer, the head of a news
service and _ who could forget ``Revenge of the Nerds''? _ a
Hollywood producer. And while this memoir of the 1960's and 1970's
was still in galleys, Obst's name began infiltrating gossip columns
and getting dropped at Georgetown dinner tables. Because Obst, who
acted as literary agent for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein when
they sold their book proposal for ``All The President's Men,''
reveals that Deep Throat did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least he doesn't believe that Deep Throat existed. Obst
emphatically asserts that his clients created a composite character
(Woodward has denied this equally emphatically) in order to sell
more books and befriend Hollywood. In fact, he writes that he was
shocked to hear the Deep Throat character in the film admonish his
reporter to ``Follow the money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Interestingly enough, that line is not to be found in the book
version,'' Obst writes. You mean _ Gracious me! _ Hollywood isn't
faithful to the letter? (Hasn't he seen ``Up Close and Personal''?
And, heck, who has ever seen a newspaper reporter who looked
anything like Robert Redford?)
</P>
<P>
   But Obst often adopts the tone of the ingenue _ as if to
recapture the wide-eyed idealism of his youth _ in this sometimes
amusing but frequently frustrating personal history. Obst says he
was born in 1946, but he also says his mother was pregnant with him
a month after D-Day, so we can't be sure how accurate a historian
he is to begin with. Nevertheless, he styles himself as a classic
baby boomer. Raised in California, he grew up with school air-raid
sirens, polio and the cold war. He studied at Berkeley, lived in
Southeast Asia, protested the Vietnam War, hung out with Abbie
Hoffman and dropped acid. His book, he writes in the introduction,
is ``about being a baby boomer, about how the emergence of the
youth culture, the Vietnam War and Watergate left their imprint on
our generation. . . . It's the story of how we almost succeeded in
stealing America from the grown-ups, were beaten back, and, by the
inexorable process of aging, became those very adults that we used
to make such great fun of.''
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know. At this point, you're thinking, ``Shouldn't I
just go rent 'The Big Chill' instead?'' But Obst did achieve some
measure of fame as a savvy operator with a good market sense for
the times. In the 1970's, he found himself heading a news service
that, because of his truly creditable and enterprising efforts,
distributed Seymour Hersh's Pulitzer Prize-winning acount of the My
Lai massacre. He met Daniel Ellsberg, who entrusted him with a set
of the Pentagon Papers, and whom he represented for a later book
deal. He began a career as a literary agent in Washington; he is
now a writer and producer, and lives in Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Too Good to Be Forgotten'' is so self-adoring, it
probably should have been subtitled ``How I Changed America in the
60's and 70's,'' but Obst does spin a few good yarns. When Abbie
Hoffman doses him with LSD at the 1972 Republican National
Convention in Miami, he describes the surreal scene: thousands of
Republicans are chanting ``Four more years! Four more years!'' but
he is so acid-addled that he hears ``You're in fear! You're in
fear!'' and flees to try to hide on the bottom of a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   However, the book is less a rousing portrait of a generation
than a retread. Despite Obst's Zelig-like appearances at some
fascinating historical junctures, he begins each chapter with a
list of that year's most popular movies, record albums and
television shows. Why waste the space? You get the sneaky feeling
that it's because he was a peripheral player and needed some stuff
to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Obst's painfully didactic prose would be better off on
one of those coffee mugs you get for giving money to public
television. At the house _ actually, ``domicile'' _ of a high
school friend, ``minds were like parachutes: They only functioned
when they were open.'' When President Kennedy was murdered, ``it
was like something within us had also been assassinated.'' Obst's
generation was ``inculcated with the idealism of a limitless
future.'' The historian Taylor Branch is ``a true wordsmith.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington is _ of course _ ``the belly of the beast.'' During a
news conference ``expletives were hurled,'' (which begs the
question: when can we start just throwing them, or saying them?).
And, oddly given his P.C. mien, Obst refers to Asia as ``the
Orient.'' And as for his freewheeling California youth, when it
came time to lose his virginity, he didn't want to do it in the car
because that was ``both unsafe and uncomfortable.'' (The beach, by
the way, had ``sand and fleas, and so forth and so on,'' so that
was out, too.)
</P>
<P>
   This all makes for a pretty lackluster tribute to the baby
boomer generation. Perhaps readers should bear in mind that Obst
may have brought up the subject of Deep Throat's identity so that
he'd have a hook upon which to hang an otherwise flimsy piece of
work.

 RADIANCE 
 By John J. Clayton 
 Ohio State University, paper, $12.95  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Middle-aged, focused hazily on the middle distance of their
comfortable lives, most of the men in this collection of stories
have their eyes jarred joyously, then painfully, open. In
``Glory,'' Avrom Hirsch, mourning the death of his best friend, is
seized by glimpses of a shimmering connection between the living
and the dead. In ``Open-Heart Surgery,'' an emergency operation
leaves Ned Koenig feeling naked afterward, his heart rawly
vulnerable to the love and hurt around him. And in ``The Man Who
Could See Radiance,'' Peter Weintraub glances into the unguarded
eyes of a stranger on a Boston trolley and loses all sense of a
barrier between himself and others. Back at work, he sidles closer
to a man he loathes just to feel his waves of pulsing life, ``a
humming like when he stood at night outside a Con Edison plant -- a
kid, summertime, doors open and the turbines humming like a giant
chorus in all registers, and it seemed they were producing the
energy that made the earth turn and the trees grow.'' Wives,
children and co-workers think these guys have snapped. But John J.
Clayton sees his reluctant Jewish prophets as wildly lucid, drunk
on spirituality in a secular world that needs each one of them to
be a mensch -- narrowly focused, a pillar of strength for his
family. Writing with compassion, simplicity and power, Clayton
adjusts their visions just enough so they can find the way home. _

   &UR; A VIEW FROM THE MANGROVE &QL; 
 &UR; By Antonio Benitez-Rojo &QL; 
 &UR; University of Massachusetts, $24.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A View From the Mangrove'' is the final part of a trilogy by
the expatriate Cuban writer Antonio Benitez-Rojo in which he sets
out to investigate the history and culture of the Caribbean using
three different genres. Thus the short stories in this collection
can be read as companion pieces to his novel ``Sea of Lentils'' and
his book of essays ``The Repeating Island.'' Not surprisingly, this
new volume (translated by James Maraniss) covers a wide historical
range, from the 16th century to the mid-20th; some of the material
is based on actual records, some has been fictionalized to resemble
fact. Here Benitez-Rojo chronicles events of unremitting and often
unspeakable horror -- slave trading, invasions, mutinies,
rebellions, murders. His stories are dense with disaster and rich
in description. The characters seem to exist only in extremis,
dying in despondency and despair or in false glory. They are either
mysterious and foreign to one another or brothers in suffering.
Ambition motivates them all -- hypocritical priests, opportunistic
scoundrels, even a few doomed romantics. In Benitez-Rojo's view,
the truth is often more contradictory and confusing than fiction,
and in both it is difficult to tell the defeats from the triumphs,
the pious from the godless, the honorable from the unworthy.
History is what is written down, an orderly procession of events
leading to a specific outcome -- to a duel, to the establishment of
trade, to the political division of an island. These stories
persuasively present the improbable swirl of action out of which
that history is confidently fabricated. _ BARBARA FISHER

   &UR; TELL ME EVERYTHING &QL; 
 &UR; And Other Stories &QL; 
 &UR; By Joyce Hinnefeld &QL; 
 &UR; Middlebury/Bread Loaf/University Press of New England, $17.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Hinnefeld's strong debut collection portrays in spare,
haunting prose the lives of women of different ages and
backgrounds, all of whom feel trapped in various female roles.
``What Alma Knows'' is a particularly successful story about a
self-described ``spinster'' aunt, ignored by her relatives;
unhappily, her attempt at revenge during a Christmas party winds up
endangering the one family member she cares about. ``Echo Guilt''
subtly describes a wife who increasingly loses all ambition as her
husband's professional success grows. The yuppie narrator of ``The
Slow and Painful Demise of the American Family'' cannot quite
accept her destiny -- to marry her boyfriend and become a housewife
in the suburbs -- but fears any other possibilities. In ``Speaking
in Tongues,'' a teen-age girl deeply troubled by her sexuality
fantasizes about Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Unfortunately, other
stories -- including the title story and the four brief poetic
sketches that divide the book -- are simply too elusive.
Interestingly enough, the best entry, ``Stories About Miranda,''
has the only male narrator in the collection. He is Rumer Rutledge,
a 21-year-old flasher who is urged by a hospital psychiatrist to
talk about his mother, Miranda, a fat, 45-year-old doll collector
who never brushes her hair or changes out of her baby-doll pajamas.
``The truth is,'' Rumer reluctantly admits, ``Miranda herself is a
pretty interesting story.'' And he turns out to be right. _ JENNY

   &UR; THE SHADE OF BLOSSOMS &QL; 
 &UR; By Shohei Ooka &QL; 
 &UR; Center for Japanese Studies/University of Michigan, cloth, $28.95;
paper, $12.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shohei Ooka's novel about a bar hostess in postwar Tokyo is a
bracing alternative to the more familiar geisha stories that have
appealed to romantic American readers. Published in Japan in 1961
but untranslated until now, ``The Shade of Blossoms'' focuses on an
aging woman named Yoko and her various lovers: Matsuzaki, an art
history professor with a wife and child; Takashima, a shady
antiques dealer; Shimizu, a television producer who likes older
women; and Hata, a widower intent on finding a new bride. Yoko has
recently switched bars, with a promotion in rank, but her beauty is
fading and she has few prospects. Unlike many other hostesses, she
won't simply settle for the first man who comes along -- or the
fourth or the fifth. In Dennis Washburn's smooth translation, the
novel displays the subtleties of a sector of Japanese culture ruled
by sexual courtesies. Yoko has a definite sense of self-esteem,
which makes her romantic entanglements and spiritual descent all
the more affecting. _ DAVID GALEF

   &UR; THE LOSS &QL; 
 &UR; By Vladimir Makanin &QL; 
 &UR; Northwestern University, cloth, $44.95; paper, $14.95 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Russia's writers have always been her most prescient observers.
And now that Communism lies in ruins, it is the writers who are
best at expressing the uneasiness of a new era -- no longer
silenced by ideology but as troubled as ever by the trepidations of
modern life. Byron Lindsey's translation of ``The Loss,'' a novella
and two short stories by Vladimir Makanin, is a revealing
contribution to the literature of the former Eastern bloc. Makanin,
who was banned for many years under Brezhnev, has flourished since
glasnost, winning the first Russian Booker Prize in 1993 and
creating a stir with each new work. (His 1995 story, ``The Prisoner
From the Caucasus,'' included in this volume, is a fine example,
capturing the raw nerves on both sides of the war in Chechnya.)
Distinctive for its layered narrative and existential musings, the
title novella, ``The Loss,'' is a retelling of a centuries-old
legend about a bungling boozer who is determined to dig a tunnel
under the Ural River. With a ragtag cast of helpers, he devotes
himself to this ill-fated pursuit, even as the story's narrator,
lying in a 20th-century hospital bed, tries to dig deeper into his
own childhood memories and connect with this mythic past. Finally,
yet another narrator, intoxicated by the sweet, melancholy wine of
loss, picks up the story -- and, ``searching for a certain
confluence of things,'' gently places it down at the site of his
vanished ancestral village. _ ANDERSON TEPPER

 THE CAT AND THE HUMAN IMAGINATION 
 Feline Images From Bast to Garfield 
 By Katharine M. Rogers 
 University of Michigan, $29.95  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Katharine M. Rogers recognizes the paradox of the cat: though we
may live for years with our beloved pet, we may never truly know
it. Instead, we are led to imagine. Perhaps we see in its searching
stare a ``preternatural knowledge,'' in its stealthy movements a
tendency toward artifice, or in its antiauthoritarian disposition a
rejection of bourgeois values. In ``The Cat and the Human
Imagination,'' Rogers examines the progression of our cultural
understanding of the cat. Her insightful exploration, which begins
with ancient Egypt and ends with the present day, attempts to
explain why and how certain artists and thinkers -- among them
Tintoretto, Poe, Dickens, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Mark Twain,
Baudelaire, Renoir and (of course) T. S. Eliot -- have embraced the
image of the cat. Rogers charts the historical development of
feline representations as the ``insignificant domestic animal''
becomes ``a treasured and mysterious companion.'' Her book
catalogues not only artistic but also linguistic, folk and
religious perspectives relating to cats. Threaded throughout are
Rogers' arguments about why some people hate cats, why cats are
``successful rivals to dogs'' and why discussions of cats often
``slide automatically into comparisons with women.'' The book --
sheer catnip for the intellectual feline lover -- implies that
whether we consider it a symbol of the home, a paragon of
independence, an agent of evil or a cherished friend, the cat will
remain in our cultural imaginings for centuries to come. _ ZOE

   &UR; SLAVE IN A BOX &QL; 
 &UR; The Strange Career of Aunt Jemima &QL; 
 &UR; By M. M. Manring &QL; 
 &UR; University Press of Virginia, cloth, $47.50; paper, $14.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'se in town honey,'' Aunt Jemima announced in early
advertisements for the pancake mix that has borne her name and
image since the 1890s. This apocryphal figure has always provoked
resentment among black people, and understandably so, as M. M.
Manring points out in ``Slave in a Box.'' Aunt Jemima was
cartoonish at best and demeaning at worst, starting life, Manring
writes, ``as a white man, in drag, wearing blackface, singing on
the minstrel stage.'' The odd twists of Aunt Jemima's career took
her to many advertising pages of women's magazines as well as to
the 1893 World's Fair stage and hundreds of county fairs, where a
former slave and her successors were hired to portray her. She
still adorns the Quaker Oats pancake, waffle and syrup containers,
though today she is thinner and stylish, wearing earrings instead
of a bandanna. ``Who cares?'' Manring asks, and then ably shows why
so many people did and still do, regarding Aunt Jemima not as a
neutral part of the consumer landscape but as a damaging racial
image. From the start, the Aunt Jemima advertising campaign
``traded on themes of racism and sexism, on a relentlessly
sentimental and unrealistic portrait of slave life and Old South
hospitality,'' Manring, an independent scholar in Columbia, Mo.,
writes. Though repetitive, ``Slave in a Box'' is absorbing in its
thickly and thoughtfully layered analysis of the mammy whose
pancake mix, the ads promised, ``made women womanly, men manly and
turned boys into Eagle Scouts.'' _ ANDREA HIGBIE

   &UR; ALL-AMERICAN ANARCHIST &QL; 
 &UR; Joseph A. Labadie and the Labor Movement &QL; 
 &UR; By Carlotta R. Anderson &QL; 
 &UR; Wayne State University, $34.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A generation's distance no doubt helped Carlotta R. Anderson
avoid the dangers of settling grudges or idealization in writing an
affectionate portrait of her grandfather, Joseph A. Labadie, a
flamboyant, genial labor organizer and a starry-eyed anarchist.
Labadie (1850-1933) was an American original whose life spanned the
country's transition from agrarian to urban. Growing up in Michigan
and Canada before the Civil War, he absorbed Ojibwa ideas of
community and shared property that shaped his political philosophy.
As a young itinerant printer, he observed the wretched working
conditions of immigrant laborers, and the sight turned him into one
of Detroit's earliest union organizers. In his prime, Labadie
helped organize the Knights of Labor, worked tirelessly on behalf
of the fledgling American Federation of Labor and wrote for
countless short-lived labor papers, his columns generating ``a
predictable surge of apoplectic rebuttal.'' As conservative
personally as he was radical politically, he was a devoted husband,
a loyal friend, a natty dresser and, in time, such a well-known
local icon that he received mail addressed to ``Joseph A. Labadie,
Detroit, Mich.'' A born mischief maker, he once put anarchist
stickers on his outgoing mail and sat back to watch the uproar when
the Post Office refused to deliver it. Labadie, the dogged
anarchist, was married to Sophie, an equally dogged archivist who
saved the voluminous papers that form the core of this biography.
Though her subject is interesting, Anderson's biography is marred
by excessive detail and hampered by irrelevant tangents. Subject,
biographer and labor history would have been well served by an
equally dogged editor. _ LAURA GREEN

   &UR; BASEBALL AND THE LAW &QL; 
 &UR; By Roger I. Abrams &QL; 
 &UR; Temple University, $27.95 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of organized baseball and the legal process is a
story about people and institutions,'' Roger I. Abrams writes.
``From the outset, the legal process played an important role in
transforming a pastime, a summertime amusement, into a commercial
venture, run not by the talented young men who played the game but
by the entrepreneurs who supplied the capital.'' Starting with John
Montgomery Ward (the Columbia Law School graduate who pitched for
the New York Giants and organized the first players' union in 1885)
and ending with Judge Sonia Sotomayor of Federal District Court in
Manhattan (who forced an end to the baseball strike of 1994-95),
Abrams, the dean of Rutgers Law School, focuses on the checkered
history of the reserve system, which bound a player to a franchise
in perpetuity: how Napoleon Lajoie evaded the system, how Curt
Flood unsuccessfully challenged it, how Andy Messersmith and
Carlton Fisk won arbitration claims that brought it down. On the
management side, Branch Rickey earns notice for developing the farm
system (as well as for bringing Jackie Robinson to Brooklyn) and
Kenesaw Mountain Landis for the despotic, extralegal power he
wielded as commissioner. The Supreme Court, Abrams suggests, has
generally erred by confusing the game and the business of baseball.
In 1922, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, writing for a unanimous
Supreme Court, held that baseball, unlike vaudeville, was not
interstate commerce and hence was exempt from antitrust law.
``Legal Bases'' ranges from Honus Wagner to the Wagner Act, names
the four lawyers in Cooperstown's Hall of Fame (Rickey, Ward,
Miller Huggins and Hughie Jennings) and reveals that Chief Justice
William Howard Taft, in his less ponderous days, played third base
for Yale. The book reflects its author's experience as a baseball
salary arbitrator, balancing anecdotes with antitrust analysis and
overviews of the collective bargaining process. Wearing lightly his
notable learning, Abrams writes with verve and intelligence. _

 &UR; Edited by Matthew Passmore and Chip Robertson &QL; 
 &UR; O'Brien Center for Scholarly Publications/Hastings College of the
Law/University of California, paper, $14.95 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; More than 50 years in the news business has brought Daniel Schorr
some enviable enemies (the Kremlin, the CIA, the FBI) and some fans
willing to nominate him for journalistic sainthood. In ``Forgive Us
Our Press Passes,'' a collection of 21 homilies on the news media,
Schorr, now a senior news analyst at National Public Radio,
forgives the sins of others, including two former employers, CBS
News and CNN. He forgives even Richard M. Nixon, who put him on the
``enemies list'' and during Watergate ordered an investigation of
Schorr that was cited in the ``Articles of Impeachment'' report
that preceded Nixon's resignation. And yes, Schorr confesses his
own sins -- once he withheld a story that probably would have
prevented thousands of Jews from slipping secretly out of the
Soviet Union; at another time he asked CBS News to pull back a
sensational story about European royalty. He makes clear that
integrity -- not some textbook version of objectivity -- has always
been his primary obligation, and requires that he offer an
uncompromising version of himself as well as the news. _ FORD

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE
</HEADLINE>
  The Queen's Pirate 
 By Harry Kelsey 
 Illustrated. 566 pp. New Haven: Yale University Press. $35 
 ------ 
 THE PIRATE KING 
 By N. A. M. RODGER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heroes attract biographers, but it is a long time since they
attracted scholars. No modern university historian could possibly
write the life of a famous hero and hope to preserve his
reputation, unless he destroyed that of his subject. This has been
true for so long that the supply of intact, undemolished heroes is
virtually exhausted. Sir Francis Drake (1540-96) is certainly not
one of the survivors, which presents Harry Kelsey with a problem.
He avoids it by attacking what he insists is still a living
tradition: Drake as the pious Protestant whose exploits saved his
country from the horrors of Roman Catholicism and founded the
British naval tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey's central point, endlessly repeated, is that Drake was a
pirate. This refers to a very old controversy. Victorian popular
writers like Charles Kingsley and Sir Henry Newbolt, the creators
of the image that Kelsey wants to destroy, were embarrassed at the
suggestion that their ideal of manly Protestant patriotism might
have been a common criminal. They therefore took pains to stress
that though Drake began his career raiding the coasts and shipping
of Spain, with which England was then at peace, he had legal, or at
least moral, justification for his actions, and no sordid motive
like making money. There may possibly be a few elderly readers
left, who read Kingsley and Newbolt when they were young and have
read nothing since, for whom Kelsey's discovery will come as a
salutary shock. Everyone else will be somewhat puzzled at the
revival of this long-dead issue, for no popular biographer of Drake
for generations has denied what he was doing in the 1560's and
'70s, and no scholarly historian has ever done so.
</P>
<P>
   If it was worth reviving the piracy issue, it was in order to
draw out the ways in which the legal and moral situation in the
16th century differed from that of our day. It would be helpful to
explain what reprisals were under marcher law, what the meaning of
the Spanish word corsario was (not at all the same as the English
``pirate'') and what the legal implications of the ``lines of
amity'' that supposedly divided the Spanish and Portuguese empires
from the rest of the world were technical stuff, perhaps, but
important to specialists, and necessary in order to understand
Drake's world. Unfortunately, Kelsey, who teaches history at the
University of California, Riverside, makes no attempt to paint in
this background, and his one reference to reprisals makes it clear
that he does not understand them at all.
</P>
<P>
   This is the great defect of what is in many respects the most
scholarly life of Drake yet. The focus is exceedingly close:
anything that cannot be seen through a microscope is not seen at
all. There is nothing to explain the political and social situation
of 16th-century England, nothing on the international and
diplomatic context that generated the English-Spanish war, nothing
on the development of shipbuilding, navigation, naval tactics and
strategy. The result is that Drake is implicitly judged not against
his standards but ours. Here is a candidate whom no respectable
faculty club would dream of admitting, a white male suspected of
misbehavior toward women and minority races. Moreover, Kelsey
argues, Drake's contemporaries felt somewhat the same way about
him. He had no great reputation in England in his lifetime; the
Drake myth was all the work of later generations. Queen Elizabeth,
the author repeats, refused to trust him with an important command.
Thus Kelsey writes out of his history the 1585 and 1595 Caribbean
expeditions and the 1587 Cadiz raid, all three of which Drake
commanded with the Queen's commission, and the 1588 Armada
campaign, in which he was second in command. To be fair, these
events are not literally written out of the book, but they are
treated hastily and carelessly, and it is clear that the author is
not interested in Drake's later career, a period of open war in
which he acted under the Queen's orders and cannot easily be
accused of piracy (though he is here).
</P>
<P>
   The real focus of Kelsey's minute attention is Drake's early
life: his obscure origins, his time as a young follower of Sir John
Hawkins and his famous voyage round the world, which takes up
nearly a third of the book. On Drake's birth and upbringing Kelsey
has lavished wide reading (including the work of modern scholars)
and careful research in a variety of English archives, both of
which are markedly lacking later in the book. On the
round-the-world voyage Kelsey's meticulous approach and his work in
Spanish archives are at their best, and he has new things to say,
especially about the cartographic evidence, that will be of great
interest to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   AT the least, ``Sir Francis Drake'' is going to be important to
scholars for its detailed findings on Drake's early career. What it
does not do is give us the whole picture. To condemn a man of the
16th century for failing to conform to the standards of the 20th is
as illiberal and unhelpful as to condemn a man of the 20th for
having the wrong color skin. Of course Drake was keenly interested
in making money from war at sea, and none too scrupulous in how he
did so. So were all his English contemporaries, from the Queen
downward. Naval officers well into the 19th century were in it for
the money, among other things, but we do not find it necessary to
accuse Admiral Nelson of being incompetent or weak or unpatriotic
merely because he had prize money on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   It is useless to write Drake off as a leader with a paranoid
suspicion of disloyalty without describing the situation of a
commander of humble origins in an age when all authority was based
on birth, and he had gentlemen serving under him who had every
reason to expect to be in charge. It is easy enough to find
16th-century witnesses who attacked Drake, for he had many personal
enemies and professional rivals. What the modern reader needs to
know is why he was attacked, and to what extent we should believe
his enemies. To answer that, an author has to take his eye away
from the microscope and look around.

CASANOVA IN LOVE
</HEADLINE>
  By Andrew Miller 
 272 pp. New York: Harcourt Brace &AMP; Company. $23 
 ------ 
 THE RAKE'S PROGRESS 
 By LORNA SAGE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Death, ``ultima linea rerum,'' wrote Casanova in his ``Histoire
de Ma Vie.'' Which may be roughly translated as ``Death is the
bottom line.'' Going back over his life as a seducer, gamester and
confidence man, he saw his whole career to be a pursuit of the
absorbing freshness of sensation, of the art of living in the
moment. His answer to Descartes was, ``I have lived because I have
felt.'' Writing it out, he relived it a little in his bleak and
bilious old age. (``By recollecting the pleasures I have had . . .
I enjoy them a second time.'') He confessed, but didn't repent a
jot. And if he was making a bid for immortality, he denied it: ``I
have lived without dreaming that I should ever take a fancy to
write the history of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   For Casanova, writing was a bit like death. But Andrew Miller's
second novel, ``Casanova in Love,'' takes the old boaster up on his
declared love of life and yet more life _ his picaresque ethic of
onward, ever onward, let's jump in the coach and gallop off to the
next episode _ to make him a writer manque much earlier in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Miller does have some clues to go on, some threads to tease out
and unravel from his man's own story. Death caught up with the
historical Casanova 200 years ago, in 1798, when he was 73; but it
was, he said, on his trip to England in 1763 that he began to die.
``What a change was worked on me in London, though I had attained
the age of 38. Here closed the first act of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   England is largely a write-off for Casanova _ he doesn't speak
the language, they use paper money to gamble instead of gold and
his main amorous adventure turns into a humiliating farce when
Marie Charpillon and her mother and aunts and grandmother _ a
household of harpies he'd already come across once in Paris _ trick
him into investing in their fake elixir, the Balm of Life, in
exchange for the never-fulfilled promise of possessing the young
woman he refers to simply as ``the Charpillon.'' She becomes an
object of obsessive pursuit; he buys her many times over without
getting anywhere. In fact, she works a mirror image of his own kind
of sting, gives him pause, reveals an edge to the world that he
just may fall off. He won't adventure farther west. (He travels
next to Moscow.)
</P>
<P>
   Miller treats the ``real'' Casanova of the memoirs as a kind of
moral flat-earther who tried to deny his London revelation. In
Casanova's own account, he turned his back on his obsession, simply
wore it out like an old coat. His final gesture before crossing the
Channel was to buy a parrot, teach it to say (in French, of
course), ``The Charpillon is a bigger whore than her mother,'' and
put it up for sale for 50 guineas on the Exchange. In Miller's
novel, Casanova teaches his bird to say ``Je t'adore.'' Here his
decay (and reconstruction) is far advanced; he is becoming deeper
and more mysterious to himself, a student of pain. He is also
becoming a would-be novelist and playwright _ and a day laborer and
a country dweller _ none of which he was in reality. The apocryphal
English life that Miller gives to his hero alienates Casanova from
his own habits, his language for living, and turns him into a
citizen of a new world where change is serious. This is no land for
libertines; it's an alien, earnest place. For Miller's Casanova, it
is indeed like dying and going to hell, if hell is ennui, the loss
of your appetite for more:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he envisaged a hell tailor-made, as all hells should
be, in which he rattled from city to city . . . pursuing women,
pursuing money; never at peace, never still, never able to put his
feet under the table and say 'This is Home.' An eternity of faro
games and lewd outings, of lecherous old ladies, jealous husbands,
of vermin and insatiable sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Casanova in Love'' might well have been called ``Casanova in
England,'' for it records a conversion to the recalcitrant, ambient
real, for all the world as if the country itself were a kind of
pragmatical penance. Miller's Casanova meets Dr. Johnson at Inner
Temple Lane. In the house Casanova rents somewhere in the West
Country, he savors the death-in-life aura of rural existence: ``On
the walls of the corridors were pieces of shot fauna and paintings
of country scenes, of . . . hounds larking woodenly beside their
expressionless young masters. . . . The two sides of the L formed a
kind of courtyard and a walnut tree grew and a sundial stood dumb
under the clouds. . . . Everywhere there was the smell of mice, of
too much weather.'' This is the style of sensation Miller revels in
as a writer _ the frisson of mortality and the sense of being a
stranger in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's much-praised first novel, ``Ingenious Pain,'' also set
in the 18th century, on the dark side of the Enlightenment, had the
same sort of plot: the awakening of sensibility in a temperament
that had previously been immune, untouched, never taking experience
in as experience. In that book, the hero was a freak of nature, a
man who couldn't feel physical pain until it was awakened in him by
a witch. Here the elusive Charpillon performs the same agonizing
operation on Casanova, rescues him from the theatricality of his
world by revealing to him how very threadbare it is.
</P>
<P>
   Miller bends his subject against his own grain by first making
him bored (``nothing now but 20, 30 more years of being Casanova'')
and then taking him out of himself, setting him slumming,
experimenting with these other lives he never had. If you stand
back, it's implausible to a degree. But that's precisely the
confidence trick Miller is so good at, conjuring the phrases that
get sensation onto the page, keeping you in obsessive, close-up
focus, whether you're with Casanova in old age in his ``Bohemian
boneyard, tangling place of the winds'' or London, ``that bruised
honeycomb of a town,'' which becomes a replica of Venice,
Casanova's home, when the streets are flooded in a freak downpour.
It's no accident that this Casanova is reborn as a writer: ``Over
Venice too the sun was rising and a boy would open his eyes and
find himself possessed of a world in which almost anything might
happen, like a writer leaning over a sheet of paper . . . his mind
suspended in the intoxication of the possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Life rolled off the real Casanova like water off a duck's back.
Miller's Casanova, ingeniously translated to our own fin de siecle,
is a New Age narcissist _ so observant, so chastened, that
self-love can save him after all.

  Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero 
 By David Remnick 
 Illustrated. 326 pp. New York: Random House. $25 
 ------ 
 THE CHAMP 
 By BUDD SCHULBERG 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this reviewer's library are no fewer than 16 books on the
singular life, boxing career and now spiritual journey of the
once-brash Louisville amateur whose motormouth equaled the speed of
his gloved hands and booted feet, and whose mind _ before he was
even in his teens _ was aflame with his dreams of glory. How does
one respond to a 12-year-old who wins a split decision in a dinky
hometown ring and already pronounces himself the Greatest?
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali is our black Paul Bunyan, except that Bunyan's
superhuman exploits were fables and Ali's are real. He is not
merely our most famous heavyweight champion; indeed, with all
respect to Joe Louis, Michael Jordan, Babe Ruth and Jackie
Robinson, the most venerated of our celebrated athletes, he managed
to reach a level of global idolization in a manner that can only be
described as transcendental. Who could have predicted in the late
1960's, when Muhammad Ali was reviled by the sporting press and
most of white America as a black racist, a mouthy troublemaker,
that he would be the obvious choice to light the torch at the 1996
Olympic Games in Atlanta, as a symbol of international
understanding, peace and love? What would all the name-callers be
thinking now, we wondered, as the puffy-faced, middle-aged icon
stood there with torch held high in that famous right hand that
delivered some of the most punishing right crosses of the 20th
century?
</P>
<P>
   Following his auspicious debut as the author of the Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``Lenin's Tomb,'' in ``King of the World'' David
Remnick brings to his reading of the Ali scriptures a helpful sense
of recent boxing history, inseparable from political history; since
all champions after the 1950's were black, their lives reflected
the social forces at work on them. By choosing to focus on Ali's
two predecessors as champions, first Floyd Patterson, then Sonny
Liston, the author nicely sets the scene for the impact the
Greatest would make when he was ready to shove them aside to take
center stage.
</P>
<P>
   In a discerning and sensitive portrait, Floyd Patterson _ surely
the most unlikely man ever to wear the crown _ is the good Negro,
an approachable and strangely fearful man, a deferential champion
of civil rights, integration and Christian decency. So anxious
about losing was Patterson in his first fight with the stone-faced
Sonny Liston that he brought a disguise to the dressing room to
escape incognito from his anticipated humiliation. ``He was
champion in the sense that Chester A. Arthur had been President,''
Remnick sums up in a particularly felicitous phrase. Some other
beauts: Patterson's haunted mentor, Cus D'Amato, is ``a cross
between the Emperor Hadrian and Jimmy Cagney'' (``a 10!'' this
reader scribbled in the margin) and, a few pages later, ``the only
modern psychoanalyst who carried a spit bucket in his hand and a
Q-Tip in his teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   If Patterson was, in Norman Mailer's words, ``a liberal's
liberal,'' the tamed Negro literally reformed in reform school,
passive, polite and nice, Sonny Liston was the perfect
counterweight, the big, bad, black stereotype in every fearful
white man's nightmare. One of a dozen children, Liston progressed
from overgrown 10-year-old petty thief to knee-breaker for the St.
Louis teamsters and the mob that owned them as naturally as a white
middle-class child moves up from elementary school to junior high.
It was the only possible career move for this precociously physical
muscle boy who couldn't read or write but could knock opponents
down with a left jab and cripple them with jaw-breaking rights. By
the end of the 1950's Liston was ready for the big time, which
meant he was afforded the opportunity to turn over virtually 100
percent of his future earnings to Mr. Gray, otherwise known as
Frankie Carbo, acknowledged commissioner of boxing without
portfolio. But who needs a portfolio if you run the fight game for
the Lucchese family?
</P>
<P>
   WITH racy scholarship, Remnick traces what would seem an
unlikely liaison between Mr. Gray (or Mr. Fury, as he was sometimes
called) and James Norris, head of the International Boxing
Commission and heir to a grain and real estate fortune worth
hundreds of millions. Madison Square Garden and the top fighters in
every division were in their pocket, and this odd couple controlled
the fight game until the Feds finally caught up with Mr. Gray
(while Mr. Norris, as befitted a scion of Chicago society, was
exonerated). But, as Remnick concludes, ``through one false front
or another, with a succession of ostensible managers, Liston never
moved far from the shade of Frankie Carbo.'' How could he? He knew
no other world. In a defining moment that Remnick makes poignant,
Liston flies back to Philadelphia after he takes the championship
away from Patterson, expecting a triumphant welcome _ and nobody
shows up. The story of his life. Deep into this carefully written
book, Remnick quotes the cynically literate fight promoter Hal
Conrad, who knew Lucky Luciano as well as he did Floyd, Cassius and
Sonny. His chilling epitaph for Liston: He died the day he was
born.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-ALI-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: was born.)
</P>
<P>
   Like a good playwright setting up the entrance of his hero in
Act 2, Remnick gives us Floyd the Good (Victim No. 1) and Sonny the
Bad (Victim No. 2) to prepare us for Cassius the Baaad, the upstart
champion young blacks and their white hippie allies could relate
to. Born in still-segregated Louisville, ``wounded by the
accumulated slights
</P>
<P>
   of midcentury American apartheid,'' lying in his bed at night
crying ``as he wondered why his race had to suffer so,'' young
Cassius was on his way to becoming the symbol of a different kind
of black man, whose role model was neither Booker T. Washington nor
Martin Luther King. Malcolm X was more like it.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Ali created a new style of heavyweight boxing, ``on the
principle that a big man could borrow the tactics of a smaller
man,'' a man like Sugar Ray Robinson, he created a new style of
black man who went on to shock the world with a challenge both
divisive and unifying. With Hegelian logic, in time there would be
a synthesis, but when in the mid-60's Cassius Clay embraced Elijah
Muhammad's black separatist Nation of Islam, his ``I don't have to
be what you want me to be'' spoke to the white power structure in a
way it had never been spoken to before. While Ali's conversion came
as a surprise to fight fans and to the public at large, one of the
most effective chapters in this book, ``Secrets,'' traces the
teen-age Clay's attraction to the Black Muslims well before he won
the gold medal in the 1960 Olympics. It was the increasingly bitter
confrontation between pro- and anti-Vietnam War factions that moved
the young black champion from the sports pages to the front pages.
Teen-agers in Watts wore his famous face on their buttons, and the
``Don't tread on me'' of black rebellion became ``The Cong don't
call me nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   If Remnick has not come up with new material for ``King of the
World'' _ no small task after a score of books on the subject _
he's drawn wisely from that body of work to define the arc of Ali's
ascendancy from superconfident adolescent to Islam-inspired but
ecumenical spiritual ambassador (only Ali was multidimensional: he
could reach out to the world like Mother Teresa, but as they say in
Gleason's Gym, she couldn't lick Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier and
George Foreman).
</P>
<P>
   Remnick _ who broke in as a sportswriter at The Washington Post
and is now editor of The New Yorker _ explores the difference
between the civil rights movement, founded on democratic
principles, and the self-sufficient, fiercely independent Black Is
Beautiful movement that caught fire with Ali, captured the
imagination of his generation and gave him the courage to refuse
the draft, thereby sacrificing his precious championship, facing
the prospect of five years in jail and, while appealing his case on
the grounds of conscientious objection, being deprived of the
license without which he could not ply his trade. The cost to Ali
in dollars was in the millions. But there were rewards. From
Bertrand Russell came this message of encouragement: ``In the
coming months there is no doubt that the men who rule Washington
will try to damage you in every way open to them, but I am sure you
know that you spoke for your people and for the oppressed
everywhere in the courageous defiance of American power. . . . You
have my wholehearted support. Call me when you get to England.'' As
Remnick quotes the poet Sonia Sanchez: ``It's hard now to relay the
emotion of that time . . . when hardly any well-known people were
resisting the draft. It was a war that was disproportionately
killing young black brothers, and here was this beautiful, funny,
poetical young man standing up and saying no!''
</P>
<P>
   How Ali finally won vindication in the Supreme Court of the
United States, 8-zip, how he came back to the ring slower and
inevitably more hittable but winning his title back again, and how
after the tide turned against our Vietnam misadventure the
unpatriotic sinner of the 60's each year grew in stature as a man
of honor and respect _ maybe only a prophet could have foreseen
these events. As Remnick ties it all together in ``King of the
World,'' building on all those books and articles and transcripts,
along with personal interviews, it doesn't read like the case
history of a man (although the man is here in living colors,
sometimes funny as hell) but of a comic and cosmic superman who
accepts the mission of standing up for Mohammed, Allah and the
human race.
</P>
<P>
   While Remnick's firsthand description of Ali's current physical
condition is disturbing _ not least, as he notes, ``because it is
an accelerated form of what we all fear, the progression of aging,
the unpredictability and danger of life'' _ his (our) Ali is ``an
American myth who has come to mean many things to many people: a
symbol of faith, a symbol of conviction and defiance, a symbol of
beauty and skill and courage, a symbol of racial pride, of wit and
love.'' That's a lot of symbols for one man. But if ever there was
a mighty army of men fused into one, it's the young Cassius Clay
self-created as Muhammad Ali. If Sonny Liston died the day he was
born, here's a fine book to remind us again that Ali was born with
a gift for living (and believing) in a world without end.

BECH AT BAY
</HEADLINE>
  A Quasi-Novel 
 By John Updike 
 241 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $23 
 ------ 
 SETTLING OLD SCORES 
 By JAMES SHAPIRO 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One's spirits, however initially well disposed toward one of
America's more carefully tended reputations, begin severely to sag
under the repeated empathetic effort of watching Mr. Bech, page
after page, strain to make something of very little.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't write that. An English critic named Raymond
Featherwaite, who appears in ``Bech Noir,'' the wildest story in
this volume, did. And John Updike sees to it that in revenge for
this cursory dismissal of his alter ego, the novelist Henry Bech,
Featherwaite is crushed to death under the wheels of a New York
subway car. Featherwaite, whose end is swift, is luckier than other
reviewers who had nasty things to say about Bech's fiction: one is
poisoned, another driven to suicide, a third has his oxygen supply
cut off. I began to have doubts about taking this assignment when I
discovered that next on the hit list was ``a guy who teaches at
Columbia . . . an English professor, or whatever they call it now,
who really got my goat in the Book Review.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bech at Bay'' is the third, and probably the last, in the Bech
series. Sixteen years have passed since ``Bech Is Back'' (1982) and
over 30 since Updike started publishing the stories that were first
gathered in ``Bech: A Book'' (1970). Henry Bech is getting on in
years (he reaches his mid-70s here), and much has changed in the
literary culture that Updike has been gently satirizing through
this picaresque and resilient hero. When Updike began writing about
Bech, he tried, he has said, to make Bech as unlike himself as
possible. Where Updike was suburban, married and Christian, Bech
was a New Yorker, single and Jewish. Where Updike was prolific,
Bech was the classic blocked writer; and where Bech could undertake
a novel with the presumptuous title ``Think Big,'' Updike's
literary output was more in line with the view defended by Virginia
Woolf in ``The Common Reader'': ``Let us not take it for granted
that life exists more fully in what is commonly thought big than in
what is commonly thought small.''
</P>
<P>
   The early Bech served several ends. As Updike has acknowledged,
it allowed him to work off various grudges, to purge his system of
slights. Writing about Bech also allowed Updike to channel his
anxieties about being overwhelmed by the Jewish American writers
whose work he clearly admired but who also dominated the literary
scene at a time when he himself was (unfairly) written off as a
representative WASP. Bech began as a sort of golem, fabricated out
of pieces of Updike's rivals. As he himself notes in a
tongue-in-cheek foreword (addressed to Updike) in ``Bech: A Book'':
``My childhood seems out of Alex Portnoy and my ancestral past out
of I. B. Singer. I get a whiff of Malamud in your city breezes, and
am I paranoid to feel my 'block' an ignoble version of the more or
less noble renunciations of H. Roth, D. Fuchs and J. Salinger?''
</P>
<P>
   The heyday of the Jewish American novelist is long past, and
Bech and Updike now have more in common with that cohort than with
the literary crowd that followed. Updike makes much of this
intergenerational gulf in the trenchant and often hilarious story
``Bech Presides.'' Here the aged members of a distinguished society
of writers, painters and musicians over which Bech presides refuse
to nominate any younger members. When Bech is asked, ``Can you read
any of these kids? I mean, the ones under 60?'' he confesses: ``New
fiction makes me tired. All that life that isn't mine. All that
clamoring 'Look at me!''' Another member makes the exasperation
with minimalists and memoirists even more explicit: ``There are
these facts, this happened and then that happened, all told in this
killingly clean prose. They have advanced degrees in creative
writing; they go to these workshops and criticize each other, there
is nothing left to criticize, but something is missing, I don't
know what it is _ a love of the world, some hope beyond the
world.'' The story succeeds in part because of the fun Updike has
at the expense of the old and lost too; the joke, it turns out, is
on Bech as well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things about the earlier Bech books was Updike's
skill in puncturing the excesses of corporate publishing. If he is
less successful at it this time around it's probably because Bech's
gentle satire is too blunt an instrument to inflict much damage on
publishing today, which, as these stories make clear, totters
dangerously on the verge of self-parody. All Bech can do is imagine
writing acceptance speeches that he might give but in the end
rejects, for they sound too much like cranky jeremiads: ``The
printed word? The book trade, that old carcass tossed here and
there by its ravenous jackals? Greedy authors, greedy agents,
brainless book chains with their Vivaldi-riddled espresso bars,
publishers owned by metallurgy conglomerates operated by glacially
cold bean counters in Geneva.''
 &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BECH-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: Geneva.'')
</P>
<P>
   Bech's Jewishness is also not the lightning rod it once was.
Cynthia Ozick, in an essay called ``Bech, Passing,'' famously
chided Updike for portraying a Jew lacking any historical
consciousness of his Jewishness, lacking, too, the religious
introspection with which Updike so richly endowed so many of his
gentile characters. For Ozick, ``Bech-as-Jew'' was a failure, an
``Appropriate Reference Machine,'' in which Updike simply fleshed
out Bech's Jewishness with little more than stereotypic words
(shiksa, zaftig), or physical characteristics (dark curly hair, big
nose).
</P>
<P>
   While Updike doesn't go so far as fulfilling Ozick's wish (she
hoped that we might next meet Bech working his way through Rashi's
commentary and Graetz's multivolume history of the Jews), in ``Bech
in Czech,'' the first story in ``Bech at Bay,'' he goes a long way
toward answering her criticism. Visiting the cemetery where Kafka
is buried in Prague, Bech is let in by two young workers who
recognize him and are fans of his novels. When Bech points to
Kafka's grave and says ``Very great Czech,'' one of the two smiles
and corrects him: ``Not Czech. Zid. Jude.'' The narrative
continues: ``It was a simple clarification, nothing unpleasant.
'Like me,' Bech said.'' No, the other Czech admirer quickly
reassures him in broken English, ``You . . . wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to confront issues of Jewishness in a European
context; another to deal with them in an American setting, and here
_ as elsewhere in these pages _ Updike pulls his punches. There's a
fraught moment in ``Bech Noir'' when Orlando Cohen, a noted Jewish
American critic (who according to Bech ``sucks up to WASP's'' and
whose name hints at the uneasy conjunction of Western culture and
Jewishness), attacks Bech on the ground that ``you were Jewish and
tried to pretend . . . you were American.'' When Bech asks, ``Can't
you be both?'' Cohen replies: ``Bellow can. Salinger could, once.
Mailer, alternately . . . never both at once. Malamud . . . I don't
know.'' Cohen is a familiar figure in 20th-century letters _ the
first-generation Jewish American critic who sees himself as the
``ultimate adjudicator'' of American literature and, by extension,
of what it means to be American. Updike is clearly on to something
here, but having raised the issue of the cultural authority of
these critics he backs away from questioning it, uneasy, perhaps,
about probing too deeply into this taboo subject.
</P>
<P>
   The best moments in the five stories in this ``quasi-novel'' are
ones in which Updike chooses not to hold back. Too often a powerful
sense of nostalgia (at times sincere, at times with a hint of
irony) displaces confrontation, and Updike, all too gently, pulls
up short (most disappointingly in ``Bech Noir''). It's telling that
when Updike writes elsewhere about Philip Roth's edgy alter ego,
the writer Nathan Zuckerman, he concludes that ``Zuckerman is
definitely not a nice boy.'' Updike's Bech is.
</P>
<P>
   Reading ``Bech at Bay,'' watching the distance between character
and creator gradually collapse, you get a sense that Updike has
become a bit too fond of Bech: indeed, in the closing two stories
he is finally rewarded with the personal and professional blessings
that have long eluded him. Like the earlier Bech books, ``Bech at
Bay'' also leaves the strong impression that Updike has written it
for himself as much as for his readers. Updike hints at this in the
epigraph he takes from Wallace Stevens's 1934 preface to William
Carlos Williams's ``Collected Poems 1921-1931'': ``Something of the
unreal is necessary to fecundate the real.'' Stevens's sentence
actually goes on to say that ``something of the sentimental is
necessary to fecundate the anti-poetic.'' I take this opaque
epigraph to mean that the sentimental, unreal universe of Bech is
as vital to Updike's literary sensibility as the real, anti-poetic
universe of Rabbit Angstrom. Without Bech there can be no Rabbit.
I'm grateful for both.

   Imagine a cross between Holden Caulfield and Bertolt Brecht, and
you'll have a sense of the Austrian novelist, playwright and
screenwriter Peter Handke, whose alienation from the phony and
harmful adult world is as pure as his esthetic purity is
purposefully alienating.
</P>
<P>
   Handke first attracted attention in 1966 when he ambitiously
denounced Gunter Grass, Heinrich Boll and others for, as Handke saw
it, compromising the novel by pressing it into the service of
social criticism. Like certain French novelists and theorists who
were active at the same time, Handke believed that the novelist had
to enact the radical subjectivity of perception. Novelists should
do this, he argued, by registering, austerely and precisely, the
world of experience as it is grasped by the conscious mind.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of molding character, Handke folded character into
language's fluttering veils; instead of constructing a plot, he
noted life's plotlessness; instead of telling a story, he
(eventually) began to tell a nonstory about how a writer goes about
storing up sense impressions for the telling of a story.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Handke ended up writing social criticism with a
vengeance. Throughout the turbulence of the 1960's and 70's, he
composed plays like ``Kaspar,'' which has society brutally
manipulating the protagonist by means of language and convention.
Handke's novels from that period were, however, subtler creations.
``The Left-Handed Woman,'' ``The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty
Kick,'' ``Short Letter, Long Farewell,'' though to some degree
time-bound tales of angst, have a pained, mysterious beauty. Their
alluring tension lies in the little war they prosecute between
eloquence of expression and rage at the loss of meaning. (Handke
writes a gorgeous, mesmerizing German, simultaneously winding and
spare.)
</P>
<P>
   Memorable writers always have a countertendency pushing their
dominant tendency into richer realms. In the 1970's, Handke's
unsettling fiction had his narrative powers pushing against his
philosophically grounded self-consciousness. The result on the page
was the spectacle of ordinary life alternately bruised and
entranced by ultimate questions.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1980's, with ``Slow Homecoming,'' ``Across'' and
``Repetition,'' Handke mostly abandoned his storytelling impulse,
as well as the atmosphere of suspense that thrived uncannily in his
work without the dramatic occasion for suspense. These qualities
gave way to layers of reflection on meaning, on language, on the
act of reflection itself. Such heightened self-consciousness was
partly due to Handke's involvement in filmmaking. In the 1970's,
Wim Wenders directed a screen version of ``The Goalie's Anxiety at
the Penalty Kick,'' and Handke himself filmed ``The Left-Handed
Woman.'' Later, Handke co-wrote the screenplay for Wenders's
``Wings of Desire,'' a stunning movie about angels who descend to
earth. Film's contraction of expansive meaning into an arresting
image and its shuffling of time frames into an eternal present
tense seemed to sharpen Handke's impatience with traditional
literary techniques.
</P>
<P>
   What all this led to was the old post-modern cul-de-sac.
Handke's distrust of storytelling brought him to an exhaustive
scrutiny of his own experience as a storyteller. It was as if, for
Handke, the conventions of fiction had long silenced the writers of
fiction. No longer, in Handke's view, would they be forced to
imagine other people's stories. Novelists, he declared, have their
own stories to tell. They will speak truth to fiction! Thus
Handke's novel ``The Afternoon of a Writer,'' which appeared in
English in 1989, offered the tremendously unexciting account of . .
. the afternoon of a writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Year in the No-Man's-Bay,'' first published in German in
1994, is a sequel to ``The Afternoon of a Writer.'' And it takes up
the meditation on writing fiction that Handke also pursues in his
essays.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's structure is as breathtaking as its content is
taxing. Shortly before Easter, a 55-year-old writer sets out to
recall the yearlong artistic and spiritual ``metamorphosis'' he
underwent two decades earlier in the same suburb where he currently
lives. (His name is Gregor Keuschnig _ Gregor K. for short _ meant
as a jab at Kafka, one of Handke's pet aversions.) Gregor,
obviously a stand-in for the author, first came to the suburbs, he
tells us, because he had grown disaffected with the city and with
the country's natural landscape, which have provided the setting
for the traditional novel.
</P>
<P>
   Gregor has chosen to live in a suburb just outside Paris. He
uses the French word for ``suburb'': banlieue, which could mean
``outlaw place.'' Thus the novelistically neglected universe of the
suburb is, for him, the perfect spot to discover a ``New World,'' a
pristine terrain unpolluted by the linguistic and narrative
conventions of traditional fiction. (Apparently, there are no
Updikes or Cheevers in France or Austria.) For this reason, he
considers the suburb more of a ``no-man's-bay'' _ a nameless body
of water _ than inhabited land.
</P>
<P>
   GREGOR writes at length about the writer's quandary. He explains
that he feels most connected to people when he is away from them.
Absence refreshes his imagination the way nameless things replenish
his language. So after recalling his life up to the year of
metamorphosis _ 1999, to be exact _ he imagines the stories of
seven traveling friends and of his peregrinating son, Valentin.
After these brief accounts, Gregor again sets about trying to
describe the year of metamorphosis. But he really can't. He gets
too absorbed by what he calls ``prehistories.'' So he describes the
decade leading up to the special year. When he gets down to the
year itself, he gets sidetracked once more and recounts preceding
events.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he arrives at the novel's last section, ``The Day,''
you realize that Gregor has collapsed all time together. The year
of metamorphosis could be the year he is writing about, or it could
be the year he is writing in. It could, for that matter, be the
year of his friends' and his son's journeys, since they all amount
to pilgrimages that end in metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
   And because shapeless life itself has constantly intruded on and
become part of Gregor's project of recollection, the act of writing
and the act of living have blended into one. After all,
``no-man's-bay'' in German is Niemandsbucht, and Buch means
``book.'' Thus the boundary between the territory Gregor the writer
lives in and the territory he imagines is of no consequence.
Writing, for Gregor, is the writer's ``synchronized breathing,''
his oneness with the objects he observes. He is convinced that only
a precise description of experience filtered by perception can
outlast the fluidity of time and identity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BAY-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: and identity.)
</P>
<P>
   THAT is why ``My Year in the No-Man's-Bay,'' when not taken up
with Gregor's interminable introspections, consists of one
carefully observed image after another expanding into a
cinematically eternal present tense. (Krishna Winston's clumsy and
overliteral translation doesn't help make such tedious cataloguing
more interesting.) In a sense, then, Handke's novel is an argument
for the superiority of film to the novel.
</P>
<P>
   Though at times intellectually bracing, this can make for pretty
arid reading. And Handke's attempts at elevating his epic of
self-regarding banality often make matters worse. Rejecting
character, plot and psychology as mere fictions, he relies on an
ostentatious thematic framework that winds up being more
implausible than any old-fashioned novelistic trick.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, there are some fanciful touches that work
wonderfully well. Heraclitus, who believed that life is perpetual
flux, is one of the novel's presiding spirits. One illustration of
such flux is Gregor's Catalonian wife, Ana, whose palindromic name
hints at the way she storms in and out of his life on an infinite
wave of passion.
</P>
<P>
   But Handke's organizing allusions are mostly strange,
narcissistic embellishments. His esthetic rebellion has overripened
into spiritual pretension. He likens both Gregor and Valentin to
Christ. He invokes St. Paul and St. John again and again as kindred
spirits, and he identifies Gregor's metamorphosis with Christ's
resurrection. After celebrating the writer's ability to conjure
away time, Handke has a prophetic character make a speech at the
novel's conclusion proclaiming that ``a savior of mankind would be
the great forgetter.'' Having reduced the tale to the teller,
Handke seems to have acquired a messiah complex.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he has taken the deserved success of ``Wings of Desire''
a little too seriously. Throughout the novel, references to angels
and wings abound. When Handke wants to suggest a character's
spiritual breakthrough, he says that he is buoyed up by ``balls''
of air ``rolling in his armpits.'' Such airborne imagery is the
cloying conceit of a still very alienated, though now
much-rewarded, author.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, one realizes that every character in this book
resembles Gregor or refers to a character in Handke's previous work
_ or is so impossibly abstract as to be a figment of Gregor's
imagination. Trying to slay the novel, Handke has almost entirely
killed off the human element in his fiction. His angels need to be
rescued by people.

  Hammatt Billings of Boston, 1818-1874

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fame does not guarantee immortality. An artist renowned in his
or her lifetime may be obliterated from history books. That is the
case with Hammatt Billings, a 19th-century artist, architect and
designer. Yet, as James F. O'Gorman points out in ``Accomplished in
All Departments of Art: Hammatt Billings of Boston, 1818-1874,''
this now-forgotten man was once thought a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Billings was impressively versatile. He designed churches,
commercial buildings, colleges and houses in and around Boston. He
also created furniture, organ cases, statuary, monuments (like the
National Monument to the Forefathers at Plymouth) and even
fireworks. He illustrated the first edition of ``Uncle Tom's
Cabin'' in 1852, along with books by Hawthorne, Alcott, Whittier
and others. And he drew historical scenes for magazines, painted
portraits and rendered urban vistas for various publications. Ralph
Waldo Emerson cited ``Billings the architect'' among a group of
Boston notables including Horatio Greenough, Daniel Webster and
Margaret Fuller. James Jackson Jarves, a collector and critic,
extolled Billings for ``the fine taste, imagination, fancy and pure
feeling'' of his illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   So why did this ``jack-of-all-designs'' disappear from public
memory? O'Gorman chooses not to speculate much about the weak link
between fame and immortality but presents a well-documented
argument for Billings's place in the history of culture. He almost
drowns the reader in facts to prove his case, but the exacting
effort is buttressed by his conviction that this range of
accomplishment makes Billings as deserving of our interest as
esthetic triumphs would have.
</P>
<P>
   His goal reflects an increasingly influential orientation in
historical research. It questions the canonization process,
postulating that immortality has been determined too often by the
selective vision of scholars who construct a unified narrative of
development. That narrative generally values those who are first or
foremost in new ideas, forms, materials and techniques. Those whose
work does not ``represent the cutting edge of architectural
innovation and achievement'' are given short shrift. O'Gorman
suggests, ``We owe it to the past and to ourselves to at least
begin our interpretation with what the past thought about itself.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Gorman, who teaches art history at Wellesley College, also has
another mission: his interest in Billings was sparked in the 1970s
by the research of a student in architectural history, Lee Ann
Clements. Her untimely death spurred him to enlarge the
investigation, conducted over the last two decades while he wrote
on other architects like the superfamous H. H. Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Howland Hammatt Billings did not come from the patrician
set of Bostonians. His family had operated a tavern in Milton,
Mass., since the 17th century. The oldest of six children, he
apprenticed himself to a Boston illustrator, Abel Bowen, and by 18
was working for Asher Benjamin, a respected neo-classical
architect.
</P>
<P>
   His success as an illustrator owed something to his just being
in Boston _ in the 1850s the cultural center of America and home to
a great array of book and periodical publishers. In architecture
Billings often collaborated with his younger brother, Joseph, who
evidently had a background in civil engineering. By 1846, when
Billings was only 28, he and his brother had completed the Boston
Museum on Tremont Street. The precisely articulated arch-windowed
granite structure represented a ``fine early example of the
Renaissance Revival in America,'' O'Gorman writes, and contained
one of the ``most dramatic interiors of mid-19th-century Boston.''
Unfortunately, it was demolished in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Other architectural commissions demonstrated Billings's command
of assorted revival styles from Greek to Gothic, as well as
Picturesque. Yet many of his 52 buildings for which O'Gorman found
records were not built or were destroyed. The ``crowning
achievement'' of his architectural career, College Hall on the
Wellesley campus, burned down in 1914. The eclectic red brick
building contained student and faculty lodgings, plus a dining
room, chapel, gymnasium, science rooms, a hospital, art gallery,
library and a dramatic, skylit central hall surrounded by tiers of
Corinthian columns.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for architects to remain famous if too much
evidence of their talent disappears. And it helps if the architect
lives long. Billings died at 56. He was treated better in the
histories of illustration, where he does have a small but
reasonably secure place. Nevertheless, even in his lifetime he was
accused of spreading himself too thin. O'Gorman suggests such
diversity is appealing, compared with our obsession with
specialization. But architecture has a better chance than
illustration of remaining visible in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   Why resuscitate Billings's career and not that of others?
O'Gorman piles on many facts about Billings's accomplishments but
does not address why Billings was considered so good then, and why
he should be venerated now. I want to know. Although O'Gorman
states he is not trying to assess Billings's oeuvre on esthetic
grounds, that is the way architecture was evaluated in his time,
and often still is. O'Gorman gives an enlightening esthetic
analysis of the skylit center hall in College Hall at Wellesley but
not one of the baronial library, an imposing double-height space,
lined with smaller alcoves on both levels and glowing with black
walnut carving and Pompeian red walls. Since scale, proportion,
harmony and rhythm were so important to 19th-century notions of
taste and beauty, the reader could benefit from more explanation of
Billings's compositional flair. Granted, criteria of evaluation
change, but that issue too could be examined.
</P>
<P>
   Still, O'Gorman's thorough ``introductory study'' provides fine
material for the formation of a new and expanded social, cultural
and architectural history. One hopes that future historians will
take up the challenge to integrate his findings into a more
critical framework. What the past thought about itself is
important. So is grappling with what we think about the past
thinking about itself. In that context, the question about ``why
Billings'' might find a clear answer.

THE LIFE OF THOMAS MORE
</HEADLINE>
  By Peter Ackroyd 
 Illustrated. 447 pp. New York: Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $30 
 ------ 
 PUBLIC MAN, PUBLIC FAITH 
 By ANDREW SULLIVAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any biography of Thomas More has to answer one fundamental
question. Why? Why, out of all the many ambitious politicians of
early Tudor England, did only one refuse to acquiesce to a simple
piece of religious and political opportunism? What was it about
More that set him apart and doomed him to a spectacularly avoidable
execution?
</P>
<P>
   The innovation of Peter Ackroyd's new biography of More is that
he places the answer to this question outside of More himself. He
is able to see More not as an early individualist (as in Robert
Bolt's gorgeously anachronistic play, ``A Man for All Seasons''),
or as an early ultramontane absolutist (in the vein of much
19th-century Roman Catholic hagiography) or even as a twisted and
conflicted bigot (as in Richard Marius's biography, ``Thomas
More''). Rather, Ackroyd sees More simply as a particularly
sensitive, and elegantly playful, representative of a vibrant,
late-medieval, Catholic England. The key word here _ and the core
of Ackroyd's analysis _ is vibrant. For Ackroyd, More's Catholicism
_ the faith he died for _ was a tangible, sensual, dynamic way of
life, a way of both being in the world and of not being in it, a
culture that had by no means run out of steam by the 1530's. What
More's death meant, then, was a simple and understandable
resistance to vandalization, a refusal to accept the wrecking of a
successful and beautiful civilization for the banal sake of a royal
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   What was this civilization about? Ackroyd, both a biographer and
a novelist, begins his book with an immersion in it. The prologue
is inspired, for it tells us entirely what is to come. It gives us
the first truly significant thing that happened to More. And it is
a baptism:
</P>
<P>
   ``At the church door, the priest . . . made a sign of the cross
on the infant's forehead, breast and right hand. He placed some
salt in the baby's mouth according to custom; then the priest
exorcised the Devil from its body with a number of prayers. . . .
The priest spat in his left hand and touched the ears and nose of
the child with his saliva. Let the nose be open to the odor of
sweetness. It was time to enter the church itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The publicness of this religion is something Ackroyd intuitively
grasps. He has an ear and a nose for physicality, and he deploys
his expertise in the history of London to illustrate this faith.
Rather than condescending to medieval Catholicism, Ackroyd
empathetically observes it. This is the first biography of More to
have absorbed the small revolution in Reformation scholarship of
the last 20 years _ pioneered by historians like Christopher Haigh
and Eamonn Duffy _ and is able to see England, through the mists of
Protestant and Whig propaganda, as one of the most authentically
Catholic countries in the history of Europe. In an early chapter,
Ackroyd evokes the meaning behind the sacrament of the eucharist as
well as any theologian I have ever read. Or take his evocation of
the city of Coventry's Corpus Christi plays of the 14th and 15th
centuries:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell mouth was characteristically a painted set of gaping
jaws, perhaps on a separate smaller wagon wheeled in front of the
main pageant; the unfortunate victim could then be seen to be
devoured alive to the sound of pipes, drums and gitterns. . . . It
was a highly embellished dramatic art, with certain scenes played
out in the street with noise and bustle, while others were
presented in the solemn stillness of a holy picture. Adam and Eve
wore white leather costumes to symbolize their nakedness, the
prophets wore golden wigs while Judas was conventionally adorned
with one of flaming red; yet, on the whole, the actors wore
contemporary dress. The Corpus Christi play was not an historical
entertainment, but a restatement of the eternal truths and episodes
of the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the simple concreteness of this religion that makes its
exponents, like More, so alien to us. Ackroyd's sharpest insight in
this regard relates to More's legendary sense of irony. It is
because belief was so entrenched, Ackroyd argues, because the
medieval secular world was so richly saturated with spirituality
that More (and others) could entertain such whimsy about it, could
play with words, and humor, and wit, in a way that mocked the
transience of everything mortal. So for the first time we can read
``Utopia,'' for example, and see its sense of play as fully
integral to its meaning. It is a book, after all, narrated by a man
called Raphael Hythlodaeus, a name derived from the Greek for ``one
who is cunning in nonsense or idle gossip.'' Utopia (``no place'')
contains a river Anydros (``river without water''), a city,
Amaurotum (``dark or dimly seen'') and a ruler, Ademus (``one who
has no people''). It's in this context that More's fierce attack on
political utopianism can be fully understood (as powerful in its
way as that of Plato, to whose ``Republic'' More's treatise owed
much). These kinds of games, these subtle hints at meaning and
nonmeaning, are premised on a small band of elite readers and a
political order in which settlement is assumed. And it's only when
we can see the depth and power of that settlement that we can see
the true nature of the irony with which More famously greeted the
world, a man who spoke, according to a contemporary, so soberly
that ``few could see by his looke whether he spoke in earnest or in
jeaste.''
</P>
<P>
   By showing us the fabric of that political and religious
settlement, Ackroyd successfully delineates the vast complexity of
More's faith. This perspective alone can help us understand how
More could engage, as he did, in brutal court intrigue, while
flogging himself at night for spiritual penance; how he could be
such an effective and funny lawyer, while longing for monasticism;
how he could have been the author of sometimes vicious, crude and
unsparing diatribes against new heresies, and yet also of such
profound and subtle texts as his final ``De Tristitia Christi'';
and how he could have succumbed to martyrdom with such
understatement and yet such resolve. These were not contradictions.
They were modulations of a man who saw absurdity and contingency
everywhere because he saw God everywhere. And they were dramatic
shifts that reflected the seismic shock that More's England was
experiencing in the early 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-THOMAS-MORE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: 16th century.)
</P>
<P>
   Not that Ackroyd is deaf to the Machiavellianism of More's
career. (It's quite likely that More read Machiavelli and was
appalled by him.) Ackroyd details More's enmeshment in the power
structure of London's merchant elite and the country's legal
system. He is a little soft on More's factional maneuvering in the
Henrician court, especially his plotting on behalf of Henry's first
wife, Catherine of Aragon. But he is effective in detailing the
last years of More's life as an essentially political
marginalization, even while More clung to every last, frayed thread
of power he could. The fascination of More, of course, comes from
the fact that he wasn't simply a saint or a writer. He was actually
Lord Chancellor of England, a cunning protege of Thomas Wolsey and
no innocent ingenu in London politics.
</P>
<P>
   One odd innovation of this book is Ackroyd's insistence on
reproducing all quotations from the period in their original
spelling and grammar. At first, this irritates. But as Ackroyd
folds the reader into More's world, you begin to see the reason.
Ackroyd is intent on showing why More was for a long time seen as a
truly powerful literary presence, regarded as one of the most
accomplished poets of the early 16th century. Ackroyd also wants us
to see More as a gutter polemicist, a Londoner steeped in the
vernacular and able to deploy the low in defense of the high.
More's ``Confutation of Tyndale's Answer'' is a classic of this
vituperative genre. By the time it is written, much of what More
loved was under threat, and so he wrote accordingly. In it, More
constructs an imaginary dialogue with the Protestant Bible
translator William Tyndale that makes our contemporary political
invective seem positively benign and humorless:
</P>
<P>
   Tyndale: Marke whyther yt be not true in the hyest degree. . . .
</P>
<P>
   More: Tyndale is a great marker. There is nothynge with hym now
but marke, marke, marke. It is pitye that the man were not made a
marker of chases in some tenys playe. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Tyndale: Iudge whyther yt be possible that any good sholde come
oute of theyr domme ceremonyes and sacramentes.
</P>
<P>
   More: Iudge good crysten reader whyther yt be possyble that he
be any better than a beste oute of whose brutyshe bestely mouth,
commeth such a fylthye fome.
</P>
<P>
   More's descent into vulgarity, as with his descent into
persecution of heretics, must be seen, Ackroyd persuasively argues,
in the context of More's singular judgment of what was going on in
England in the 1530's. More gambled that Henry's divorce was far
more than a simple adjustment of political power. Unlike most of
his contemporaries, he clearly saw what he believed to be the end
of Christian civilization as he knew it. He glimpsed, precisely and
methodically, what the assertion of secular authority over church
law meant. He foresaw the vandalism that would soon sweep across
the English church, the first truly totalitarian attempt by a
modern state to expunge not just political but spiritual resistance
to its hegemony. And he saw it first.
</P>
<P>
   None of this fully explains, however, More's contemporary
luster. Ackroyd's biography became the best-selling book in England
for a while, in part, perhaps, because it arrived at an apposite
time. It's easier now to see, in the wake of the pseudoreligion of
the Diana cult, how great a loss was the kind of popular, tangible
religiosity Ackroyd evokes and More defended.
</P>
<P>
   It's also easier to see now, at the twilight of the
nation-state, that national sovereignty, as More understood it, may
not possess the final word in the history of Europe. As England
finally moves to undo its legal and political separation from
Europe, over 400 years after Henry VIII began it, it is easier to
see More as perhaps prescient, rather than reactionary. And as
cynicism grows on both sides of the Atlantic about political
leaders, it is hard not to long for More's principled interaction
of politician and writer, believer and fool, lawyer and prophet.
More's sanctity was flint-edged, to be sure, and Ackroyd captures
this with a historicism as punctilious as Holbein's portraits. But
More was also more than a saint. He was a believing ironist and a
politician who chose death over the splitting of legalisms. Less a
man for all seasons, perhaps, than a tonic for ours.

THE LAST DINOSAUR BOOK
</HEADLINE>
  The Life and Times of a Cultural Icon 
 By W. J. T. Mitchell 
 Illustrated. 321 pp. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. $35 
 ------ 
 HEAVY SYMBOLISM 
 By MARK C. TAYLOR 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Images of dinosaurs are everywhere; we are in the midst of what
can only be described as ``dinomania.'' But why? In ``The Last
Dinosaur Book,'' W. J. T. Mitchell maintains that dinosaurs are
symptoms of what the literary theorist Fredric Jameson labels ``the
political unconscious.'' Contrary to expectation, the figure of the
dinosaur indirectly discloses the changing economic forces that
have shaped modern society and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, a professor of English and art at the University of
Chicago, analyzes what he describes as the ``cultural icon'' of the
dinosaur. An icon, he explains, is an ``imagetext'' or
``combination of verbal and visual signs'' that is symptomatic of
psychological, social and economic processes. With Darwin, Freud
and, most important, Marx as his guides, Mitchell unearths the
historical origin and development as well as the psychological and
social functions of icons. The analysis of the dinosaur yields rich
insights because it is ``the totem animal of modernity.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on Claude Levi-Strauss's influential account of
totemism, Mitchell insists that the dinosaur is ``a thing to think
with, not of.'' When the totem is an icon, we think with imagetexts
that collapse the distinction between the conceptual and the
visual. The imaginative dimension of all reflection obscures the
supposedly clear lines separating natural sciences, social
sciences, arts and humanities. Mitchell sides with those who reduce
nature to culture: ``Nature is culture; science is art. We don't
ever 'see nature' in the raw, but always cooked in categories and
clothed in the garments of language and representation.'' What
makes the dinosaur a particularly rich resource for thought is its
hybrid character: the dinosaur ``is a figure in constant symbolic
motion, shuttling between science and fantasy, nature and culture,
the image of the other and a mirror of the self.'' The ambiguity of
the dinosaur provokes ambivalent responses.
</P>
<P>
   To support his interpretation of these hybrid creatures,
Mitchell creates a hybrid work. The book consists of 40 brief
chapters, a coda and two superfluous appendixes. It is amply
illustrated with images from popular culture, and its inventive
design gives it the feel of a comic book. The chapters are numbered
sequentially but can be read in any order. Mitchell attempts to
persuade as much by amassing material as constructing arguments.
However, as examples and illustrations proliferate, this dinosaur
threatens to collapse under its own weight. When he finally admits
that this ``shape-shifting, transitional figure . . . can seem to
mean almost anything one minute and almost nothing the next,'' the
point of the analysis appears to vanish.
</P>
<P>
   But shift this apparently arbitrary assemblage of words and
images ever so slightly and another figure takes shape. Like all
good stories, Mitchell's narrative has a clear beginning, middle
and end. Mitchell's deepest sympathies lie with Marx or, more
precisely, the neo-Marxist brand of criticism popularized by
cultural studies. The image of the dinosaur, he says, ``stands for
the fate of the human species within the world system of modern
capitalism.'' Far from monolithic, modern capitalism evolves
through three distinct stages, identified by Fredric Jameson as
market capitalism (1848-1890's), monopoly capitalism
(1890's-1940's) and postindustrial or multinational capitalism
(1940's-present). Without noting his source, Mitchell appropriates
this narrative. There are three chapters in the story of dinosaurs:
early modern (1840-1900), modern (1900-60) and post-modern
(1960-present).
</P>
<P>
   Though ancient creatures, dinosaurs are a modern invention. In
the 1840's the English paleontologist Richard Owen coined the term
``dinosaur.'' For him dinosaurs were antediluvian monsters
resembling ``terrible lizards,'' an image popularized by
iron-and-concrete fabrications displayed in the Crystal Palace in
1854. In the second image, a dinosaur appears as a giant, erect
reptile. Mitchell sees in this familiar icon a ``cultural
allegory'' of monopoly capitalism: ``Giant corporate entities
headed by gigantic individuals'' engage in life-and-death power
struggles. But in a world governed by laws of social and economic
Darwinism, colossal size is not always an advantage. In contrast to
``swamp-bound monsters of sluggish disposition,'' the birdlike
raptors of the film ``Jurassic Park'' represent ``the new stage of
post-modern capitalism, of 'downsizing,' flexibility, rapid strike
forces, teamwork, adaptability.'' Acknowledging the importance of
the information revolution for the third stage of capitalism,
Mitchell labels one chapter ``The Age of Biocybernetic
Reproduction.'' Computer technology and genetic engineering create
a prospect of old monsters in new guises. The difference between
Tyrannosaurus rex and the agile raptor is that between G.M. and
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ``The Last Dinosaur Book'' is a disaster story about
imminent extinction of the human race. In the dinosaur we see our
own dark future. The destructive monster out of control is
capitalism, whose voracious appetite is satisfied only by
proliferating instantly obsolete products. At the end of the
millennium, this wasteful process threatens to become an omnivorous
beast that consumes itself. Bound to a neo-Marxist perspective,
Mitchell says biocybernetics ``is not a revolutionary break with
the past like mechanistic modernism was'' but is an extension of
the most pernicious aspects of consumer capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   This one-sided critique fails to do justice to the complexity,
diversity and novelty of the digital revolution. Without
underestimating the destructive potential of new technologies, it
is possible to imagine their constructive deployment. The obsolete
narrative structure of this book is nearing the dinosaur's state --
extinction. That does not imply that Mitchell has not made a
contribution, for, as he writes, dinosaurs are not only good to
think of but are also good to think with. By thinking with ``The
Last Dinosaur Book,'' we are able to see creative possibilities in
our historical moment that Mitchell overlooks.

 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: THE FACT GAP 
 By ALAN WOLFE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Shape of the River,'' William G. Bowen and Derek Bok _
former presidents of Princeton and Harvard Universities _ seek ``to
build a firmer foundation of fact'' under America's affirmative
action debate. Amen. Facts have been sorely missing in accounts of
the role played by race in admissions to institutions of higher
education. To some degree the fact gap exists because both those
who defend affirmative action and those who oppose it argue from
positions of high principle: a commitment to diversity on the one
hand or a defense of individual merit on the other. When principle
is at stake, facts become conveniences to be cited when helpful and
to be explained away when harmful.
</P>
<P>
   But the absence of hard information is also due to the policies
of educational institutions themselves, which keep secret the kinds
of data which would shed light on who gets admitted to them and who
does not _ and why. (Even Bowen and Bok are obligated not to reveal
the names of the five institutions whose admissions policies they
examine in detail.) With the publication of their book, and of
``The Black-White Test Score Gap,'' edited by Christopher Jencks,
the Malcolm Wiener Professor of Social Policy at Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government, and Meredith Phillips, an assistant professor
of policy studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, the
fact gap has closed considerably. Both volumes are masterly in
their technical use of data and sensitive to the limits of what
data can reveal. It detracts nary a whit from the accomplishments
of either to say that even with the facts they present, the roles
race should and does play in college admissions will remain hotly
contested.
</P>
<P>
   As Thomas J. Kane, who teaches public policy at Harvard's John
F. Kennedy School of Government, points out in his contribution to
the Jencks and Phillips collection, roughly 60 percent of America's
institutions of higher education admit nearly all who apply and
therefore do not give preference to any particular race. At the
best schools, by contrast, efforts to diversify the student body
translate into a 400-point bonus for minority students on the SAT
tests. The bonus is so large because, in 1995, 70 African-Americans
scored over 700 on the verbal portions of the SAT; 221 more scored
over 650. (The corresponding numbers for whites were 8,239 and
16,216.) The five or six most competitive colleges, in other words,
fight over the 300 or so African-Americans with the highest scores;
the next 20 or 30 colleges, still top ranked, have to drop down to
those scoring in the 1200's or below if they want their student
bodies to reflect the percentage of the population that is black or
Hispanic _ all the while rejecting many white applicants with much
higher scores.
</P>
<P>
   One effect of taking race into account into account in the
admissions process is that among applicants with combined SAT
scores in the low 1200 range, a black applicant is three times as
likely to get into an elite college as a white applicant. Bowen and
Bok argue that both the colleges and the black students who attend
them still benefit. We ought not to forget, they write, that
although whites with very high scores may be ``spectacularly well
qualified'' for college, blacks with somewhat lower scores are
anything but unqualified. In addition, SAT scores, while important,
are not a one-to-one stand-in for merit; not only do they predict
academic performance poorly, they also say little about who will
contribute most to other students or will become eventual leaders
in their fields.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of affirmative action say that it is unfair to black
students to be forced to compete against whites who are better
prepared for demanding academic work. Some of the evidence
collected by Bowen and Bok confirms this; in less selective
institutions, black graduation rates six years after entering
college are significantly lower than white graduation rates. Black
students nearly always perform less well than white students, and
also perform below the levels predicted by their SAT scores. A
chapter in the Jencks and Phillips collection calls this
``disturbing'' and adds that ``most sobering of all, the
performance gap is greatest for the black students with the highest
SAT's.'' A co-author of that chapter is William G. Bowen. Still,
Bowen and Bok conclude that the overall picture proves that
minority students are not ``overmatched'' in comparison with whites
admitted with much higher SAT scores to the nation's top schools.
The picture improves even more if one examines the years after
college. Despite their lower SAT scores, black graduates of the
nation's selective colleges are active participants in civic life.
They report high degrees of satisfaction with their experiences in
college.
</P>
<P>
   In their most impressive finding, Bowen and Bok show that of the
700 or so black entering students from the class of 1976 who would
not have been admitted to one of the nation's more selective
institutions had strictly race-neutral criteria been applied, 225
obtained professional or graduate degrees, 70 became doctors, 60
became lawyers, 125 became business executives; and as a body, they
earned an average of $71,000 annually. Bowen and Bok interpret
these facts to mean that an increase in the size of the black
middle class justifies racial preferences. They may well be
correct. There is no more important step to be taken along the road
to racial justice than building and strengthening a black middle
class. Every African-American who enters a profession or buys a
house in the suburbs gives the lie to two pervasive cynicisms _ one
that blames black Americans for their own inequality and the other
that in blaming white racism for all the ills of America ends up
excusing self-defeating black isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be wrong to conclude from ``The Shape of the
River'' that affirmative action works. What Bowen and Bok have
proved is that going to a top college works. Their book
unintentionally fuels rather than quenches the passions over
affirmative action. For if a degree from a top college benefits
those who receive it as much as Bowen and Bok clearly demonstrate,
then those passed over for admission to those colleges really do
have cause for complaint.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-RACE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: complaint.)
</P>
<P>
   And because Bowen and Bok's data are limited to the more
selective institutions, they have little to tell us about the fates
of minority students who never make it to the level of applying to
those colleges. The material assembled by Jencks and Phillips helps
explain why that group is so large. A gap between blacks and whites
on intelligence tests appears when children are 4 years old. By the
age of 6, black vocabulary scores match those of whites who are 5.
By the age of 17, black scores are equal to those of white
13-year-olds. This means that African-Americans who show up in the
Bowen and Bok study have already won some of life's biggest
battles. By scoring in the 1200 range on SAT tests, they are most
likely either middle-class already or will push themselves into the
middle class through their determination and effort.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem arises among those black high school graduates
who never fully recover from their initial disadvantage in testing
and who therefore wind up scoring in the 800-1000 range on SAT's.
The best of these students will attend colleges that are somewhat
selective, and which therefore still exercise some degree of racial
preference in admissions. But while the preference is smaller than
at the most selective colleges, the impact on many students is
larger (Thomas Kane's data indicate that black and Hispanic
students receive an 8 percent to 10 percent preference at the most
academically selective fifth of four-year institutions, but only a
3 percent preference at schools ranked in the fourth of the five
tiers). Getting into and graduating from one of these colleges may
well play a more significant role in the life prospects of a
medium-range SAT scorer of either race than graduation from a top
college plays for a high scorer of either race, for these are the
colleges that historically made it possible to move from the
working class into the middle class. The benefits gained by
minority students at the top colleges, in other words, could come
at the price of greater conflict between black and white applicants
to those less selective colleges where middle-class aspirations
meet head on.
</P>
<P>
   An even greater number of minority high school students will
score so low on the SAT's or equivalent tests that they will not go
to college at all or will attend technical schools and community
colleges. Should they lose out because they test so badly? Are the
tests biased? There is, as Jencks points out, a ``labeling'' bias:
``People hear statements like . . . 'blacks have less academic
aptitude than whites' as claims that blacks are innately
inferior.'' The pervasive use of such tests, he adds, constitutes a
``selection system bias,'' because relying on the tests rather than
performance will invariably discriminate against blacks and
Hispanic applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Jencks writes, ``the skill differences that the
tests measure are real.'' They also matter. In their chapter in
``The Black-White Test Score Gap,'' William R. Johnson, who teaches
economics at the University of Virginia, and Derek Neal, a
professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison,
show that wage differentials between black and white male workers
can be attributed largely to differences in the acquisition of
basic verbal and mathematical skills. Between 1971 and 1996,
according to Meredith Phillips and her colleagues, the gap between
black and white test scores narrowed considerably, even though
minorities were still underrepresented at the very highest levels.
This closing of the gap, moreover, was due to rising black scores,
not falling white ones, indicating that something _ perhaps the War
on Poverty, perhaps increased black expectations, perhaps improved
schooling, especially in math _ was working. If such improvements
dramatically undercut genetic explanations of intelligence, the
fact that the gap appears once again to be growing is a great
puzzle for social policy.
</P>
<P>
   Chapters in ``The Black-White Test Score Gap'' explore the
influence of parents, teachers, peers and society as a whole in
explaining why blacks and whites perform differently on such tests.
Firm conclusions are hard to come by, and some of the authors
disagree with the hypotheses suggested by others. Still, the bulk
of the material in this book leaves the reader with the sense that
the causes are deep and difficult to overcome. As Phillips and her
colleagues point out, we could eliminate at least half, and
probably more, of the black-white test score gap at the end of the
12th grade by eliminating the differences that exist before
children enter first grade. Such is the disparity between the races
that a frightening number of African-Americans lose a good shot at
entering the middle class even before they enter kindergarten.
There are nonetheless good reasons to do our best to overcome this
gap. ``Eliminating racial differences in test performance,'' Jencks
and Phillips write, ``would also allow colleges, professional
schools and employers to phase out the racial preferences that have
caused so much political trouble over the past generation.'' Of all
the facts presented in these two sobering books, the most important
is this: When we debate using racial preferences to admit more
black and Hispanic students to the nation's best colleges, we are
considering the fate of a shockingly small number of people.

A DANGEROUS PROFESSION
</HEADLINE>
  A Book About the Writing Life 
 By Frederick Busch 
 245 pp. New York: St. Martin's Press. $23.95 
 ------ 
 ODD JOB 
 By ELIZABETH HANSON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick, name this job: You work by yourself, usually in your own
digs, with no regular salary, no benefits, no paid vacations or
pension, no regular praise or recognition for your efforts; you
might not receive any payment for your product, though it could
have taken years or even a decade to finish; and meanwhile, others
earn fantastic sums as well as public accolades for what you know
is inferior, shoddy work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dollars damn me; and the malicious Devil is forever grinning
in upon me, holding the door ajar. . . . What I feel most moved to
write, that is banned _ it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the
other way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my
books are botches.''
</P>
<P>
   The quotation is from the young Herman Melville in 1851 _
``Moby-Dick'' was about to be lanced by the critics. A jolly career
indeed, to be a writer of fiction; in his collection of essays ``A
Dangerous Profession,'' Frederick Busch shows us how difficult,
thankless and downright depressing this dangerous profession is.
``There is no satisfaction, because writing does not offer that
emotion,'' Busch, the author of 18 works of fiction, writes. ``The
talent that drives a writer, the ambition to publish, the energy to
continue _ these are why he or she must write. The gift, if it is
that, is also the goad. It is an appetite that feeds itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The first section of the book concerns Busch's own experiences
as a writer, including the requisite poverty and struggle in the
early years, when he wrote perched on the edge of the bathtub,
typewriter on a table in front of him, because there was no other
private space in the tiny apartment he shared with his wife. During
this time he read and reread the list of illustrious publishers who
rejected the manuscript of ``Under the Volcano''; he also kept a
parallel list of publishers who had rejected his first novel, to
remind himself that he and Malcolm Lowry ``were brother sufferers
and therefore brother writers.'' He acknowledges his wife's loyalty
and support in his essay ``The Writer's Wife'': ``You have seen
them, smiling in crowded gatherings at no one because no one talks
to them for very long except to say, 'Oh, you're Mrs. Him? How
wonderful!' '' Busch quotes Dickens, writing as David Copperfield:
he wished ``my wife had been my counselor; had had more character
and purpose, to sustain me and improve me by; had been endowed with
power to fill up the void which somewhere seemed to be about me.''
</P>
<P>
   The second section comprises a series of essays about several
books and their authors. Busch chooses a sad and sometimes suicidal
group of writers (including Melville, Dickens, Graham Greene and
Hemingway) who were driven by their need to make sense of a
darkness that haunted them. Dickens, for example, ``does what all
novelists do: He resists time by rowing backward, against the
current, into his life. Like all serious artists, he takes the
matter of his art as a matter of life and death. The writer, he
believes, must succeed or die.''
</P>
<P>
   Another essay in this section, ``Bad,'' takes on political
correctness. An essential ``bad'' is the phenomenon of black
writers being only black, lesbian writers only homosexual, white
writers only white. Literature professors, Busch rants, tolerate
writers, though they know that if Chaucer were to apply for a job,
he would not be hired ``because he is a dead white European male
and because his degree isn't good enough, and because he doesn't do
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in this book suggests that there is any way to be a
fiction writer except with a considerable amount of recurring
anguish. Read this book if you are a beginning writer who wants the
assurance that others, too, have written, submitted and been
rejected over and over again. Read it if you are an established
writer and want to see the continuing doubt and despair of those
who have produced great books. And if you think you'd like to be a
novelist to partake of glamour, fame and fortune, then read on, so
that you can persuade yourself to veer quickly into another line of
work. Busch clearly believes that either you have a call to the
writing vocation or you don't; the only reason to continue to write
is because you can't not do it.

MY GERMAN QUESTION
</HEADLINE>
  Growing Up in Nazi Berlin 
 By Peter Gay 
 206 pp. New Haven: Yale University Press. $22.50 
 ------ 
 DISPLACED PERSON 
 By FRANK KERMODE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the many works of Peter Gay, a prolific cultural
historian, the best known may be the learned five-volume study
called ``The Bourgeois Experience: Victoria to Freud,'' which, like
his new book, is much influenced by his interest in psychoanalysis.
His writing is idiomatically smooth, a sound historian's
instrument, and no one reading it would guess that when he arrived
in the United States as an adolescent named Peter Frohlich he had
only a little English, his native language being German.
</P>
<P>
   Times were hard enough, but the Gays were not complainers and
despised the deracinated German immigrants they called ``Byunskis''
because they so often said ``Bei uns in Deutschland war alles
besser'' (``At home in Germany everything was better''). As a newly
arrived American, Gay, in the time-honored manner, did all sorts of
jobs _ shipping clerk, magazine distributor, stamp dealer _ before
winning a scholarship to the University of Colorado. He was 23 when
he got his B.A., whereupon he began his academic career as a
graduate student at Columbia. There, and later at Yale, he
established his scholarly name and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like an arduous ascent, and so it was; but the young
man's qualities were such that it seems to have been relatively
pleasant. Gay has always given thanks for his extraordinary good
fortune, not only in getting out of Germany with his family but in
making it to America, the place he most wanted to be. But nobody
who spent his or her formative years as a Jew in the Berlin of the
1930's could simply forget that past. A new name and a new language
might bury but could not abolish it. Only now, in his still active
retirement, have Gay's memories grown urgent enough to demand
expression. The result is ``My German Question,'' which the author,
who confesses that he normally enjoys writing, calls ``the least
exhilarating assignment I have ever given myself or received from
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the public events he describes are all too familiar, but
this is primarily a personal history, and the remembered reactions
of a sensitive boy, as recalled by a writer of keen Freudian
beliefs, give the book its individuality. Why, he wonders, was he
such a well-behaved child? Was his goodness a cover? Was it that he
really wanted to be very bad? He certainly has, to this day, acute
memories of minor infantile delinquencies, and of later sins,
especially the sin of anger. But these seem to have been few and
unalarming, and mostly he just went on being well behaved. However,
he confesses, without reservation, that his hatred for all things
German persisted for years; and it was long before he could be
induced to set foot in Germany. And he remains just as angry with
people, whatever their nationality, who express facile wonder that
German Jews didn't all get out when the Nazi threat was obvious and
while the going was good.
</P>
<P>
   One purpose of this book is to explain the behavior of families
like his own, apparently so imperceptively dilatory. Roughly
speaking, they were unable to believe that oppression of the Jews,
already evident without seeming to be life-threatening, would
quickly grow worse; that the Munich agreement would offer the Nazis
a free hand, and that human beings, fellow Germans, fellow
townsmen, could be so outrageously and unpredictably cruel. Indeed,
they had been deluded into believing that anti-Semitism was waning,
at least in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Gays were not observant Jews, and apart from one or two
inherited customs, might have been accepted, and seem to have
thought of themselves, as virtually assimilated _ might even, with
their blue eyes and fair hair, have passed for non-Jews. They took
their modest part in the business and cultural life of a city to
which they felt a strong attachment. Jews made a large contribution
to its life: indeed, as Gay remarks, Berlin, with the departure of
the Jews, lost one of the mainstays of its bourgeois culture, and,
as Willy Brandt lamented, their contribution has not been replaced.
Kristallnacht was inconceivable until it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Gay records his memories of daily life in the city and of the
life of the family, in apartments that shrank in size as they came
down in the world. The most disastrous change occurred in 1933,
when, as Gay expresses it, they suddenly became Jews. Yet even this
ultimately catastrophic change seems at first to have made little
difference. There was growing anxiety, but after all one still had
to go on buying groceries, trying for good grades, going to the
dentist; and for a while nobody interfered in these modest
liberties. But eventually the conditions of life grew stricter,
with the boycott on Jewish stores and the law excluding Jews from
public employment.
</P>
<P>
   Gay was relatively lucky, having at his school some teachers who
were not Nazi, and he largely avoided persecution at the hands of
the other boys. And for a while this small-business family (unlike
Jewish actors, lawyers, professors) prospered surprisingly under
the Nazi regime. But the threat did not go away. The young Gay
reacted to it by idealizing America. He came to loathe Germany,
worshiped Jesse Owens and was wildly happy when the German women's
relay team dropped the baton at the Berlin Olympics of 1936, a
disaster he still calls ``one of the great moments in my life. . .
. Schadenfreude can be one of the greatest joys.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits to several eccentric enthusiasms, regarding them as
survival strategies; they included stamp collecting and an
improbable passion for the London soccer team Arsenal, whose
fortunes he follows still, commending Nick Hornby's ``Fever
Pitch,'' a record English best seller, as the best study ever
``about the peculiar symptomatology of being a fan.'' In the long
run these defenses were inadequate. A better defense, not available
to the Frohlich family, was to be proudly Jewish, to be Zionist.
But they were neither, merely ``Jews by Nazi edict.'' In spite of
the Nuremberg Laws they still regarded themselves as German. But
the pressure grew more and more outrageous, and they began, at
first without much urgency, to talk about getting out.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-GERMAN-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: getting out.)
</P>
<P>
   The grim year 1938 climaxed with the Munich Pact and
Kristallnacht, that ``degradation ritual'' that had the effect of
at last making it necessary to leave, and soon. Tentative plans for
departure already existed but were speeded up. Gay's father wrote
to people named Frohlich in England and America, where he had rich
relatives. Application to the British Consulate was refused, a
decision Gay now calls fortunate. The United States had a strict
quota system, and Gay's father was classified as a Pole, which gave
him very little chance. In the end the family made it to America
via Cuba, not without crises, and some virtuous and desperate
trickery. Thereafter, despite early struggles to make a living, all
was about as well as any future, founded on such a past, could be.
</P>
<P>
   Gay's story could hardly be other than interesting, and one is
glad about the happy outcome of his family's afflictions and his
own feeling that his life has been ``an astonishing gift.'' There
are occasional inaccuracies; for example, one doesn't have to be
upper class to watch cricket. But slips like these are of small
importance.
</P>
<P>
   What is odd about the book, given its subject, is the persistent
blandness of Gay's writing. ``Interest'' tends to be ``absorbing
interest,'' and it is difficult to be fortunate without being
``immensely fortunate.'' The prose seems unusually gentle, without
consistent animus, and that is probably a reflection of the
author's temperament. When his anger erupts, and he wishes some
ancient enemy disgraced or dead, the effect is, for a moment,
particularly surprising, as if such sentiments had no place in the
story, though of course they have, and were the main reason for its
being written. And it may be that this, too, is a true reflection
of a quietly remarkable character, civilized, learned, yet
incapable of wholly forgetting or forgiving the hideous cruelties
that threatened his life as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering those days he also recalls with affection the life
of the family _ his mother, now lodged deep in his superego,
commenting on his errors, his untidinesses, his leaving tasks
incomplete; his agnostic and resourceful father, his various uncles
and neighbors, nearly all pleasant and helpful. He remembers with
admiration the way they went on with their decent lives as the
nightmare descended on them. He is clearly a man capable of a civil
happiness as well as of just anger. And one closes his book with
the agreeable feeling that he has dwelt more upon the welcome and
the opportunities offered him by America than on the foulness of
the country that forced him to flee there, to run, as it turned
out, from terror to contentment.

THE ART OF LIVING
</HEADLINE>
  Socratic Reflections From Plato to Foucault 
 By Alexander Nehamas 
 283 pp. Berkeley: University of California Press. $29.95 
 ------ 
 THE EXAMINED LIFE 
 By JONATHAN LEAR 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the core of Western civilization is emptiness. As Socrates,
the most important figure in Western philosophy, explains at his
trial, when he heard the Delphic oracle say that no one was wiser
than he, he was puzzled, for the one thing he knew was that he knew
nothing. He set out to cross-examine wise men and poets to
determine what in the world the oracle could mean. And everywhere
he looked, he could find only the pretension to knowledge, not
knowledge itself. In the end, Socrates recognized oracular irony:
he was indeed wiser than others precisely because he understood
that he lacked wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Socrates' famous method of refutation _ the elenchus _ tended to
induce the experience of emptiness in others: an interlocutor would
begin thinking he knew what justice or courage or piety is, and in
the course of the conversation would be reduced to confusion and
self-contradiction. For his own part, Socrates was the ancient
Hellenic version of the Cheshire cat, fading away into his own
smile. Socrates himself had no alternative view to put forward, and
thus he left his interlocutor with an experience of a gap in
understanding where once he felt he had something. In short,
Socrates had an uncanny gift for bringing others to the brink of
anxiety. In the give-and-take of a short exchange, he was able to
lead his conversational partners to a recognition that although
they took their lives to be incredibly important, they did not
really understand what they were doing, or why, or why it was a
good idea for them to be doing that rather than something else.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the interlocutor would typically rush off,
supposedly called back to the concerns of daily life. Concern about
getting ahead in life _ closing a business deal, winning a court
case, getting into the right school _ would be used to distract one
from the more profound anxiety that one had no idea what a truly
successful life might be, and thus one had no idea what ``getting
ahead'' meant. Socrates is the only figure who is willing to stand
still. He alone can tolerate the anxiety of not knowing. He asks
questions and refuses to move in any direction until he knows where
he is going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Art of Living'' is Alexander Nehamas's own joyful attempt
to stand still. Philosophy, for him, can be seen as made up of two
very different ways of responding to the figure of Socrates. The
dominant tradition follows the later Plato and tries to provide
answers to Socrates' questions. Philosophy in this mode is made up
of theoretical, impersonal arguments about our obligations to
others, the nature of the good life, what we can know and what
there is. But Nehamas is out to invigorate another neglected mode.
In this Socratic mode, there is an enhanced emphasis on what kind
of life one leads, what kind of self one becomes, when one lives
with the question of how to live. For Nehamas, Socrates' ``major
accomplishment is that he established a new way of life, a new art
of living,'' and in so doing constituted himself as the unique
individual he became. The question for Nehamas is: how can one
possibly follow suit?
</P>
<P>
   There is no easy answer to this question. As Nehamas points out,
one cannot simply ask questions a la Socrates: that is to become a
banal imitator. Rather, if one is truly to follow in this Socratic
mode, one must invent one's own art of living. Nehamas's book is a
study of the struggles of prominent members of this tradition _
Plato himself, Montaigne, Nietzsche and Foucault _ each to become a
philosophical self unlike any other. But this is not simply a
theoretical or historical survey. Nehamas, who is the Edmund N.
Carpenter 2d Professor in the Humanities and a professor of
philosophy and comparative literature at Princeton, wants to create
his own art of living, and this is his stab at it. His writing thus
takes on a compassionate engagement, which is unusual in a
scholarly book. Nehamas suffers from the philosophical variant of
the anxiety of influence, and he deals with it by writing about the
apprehensions of some of the most anxious members of the
philosophical tradition. Author and subjects have it in common that
they turn toward and away from Socrates to grapple with the problem
of their own individuality. If one would like to be introduced to
these thinkers, it is hard to come up with a better organizing
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The chapter on Platonic irony is particularly brilliant. Nehamas
argues that in addition to the much-discussed Socratic irony, there
is a higher level of irony in which Plato both seduces and abandons
his readers. The dialogues are written in a theatrical style, and
thus the reader will naturally, though un-self-consciously, tend to
take up the position of audience. For its part, an audience tends
to assume that it is looking on the dramatized reality from the
perspective of the truth. All the characters on stage may have
partial and distorted perspectives, but the audience, as it were,
has an absolute perspective on all of this.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-LIVING-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: all of this.)
</P>
<P>
   So on a first reading we cannot help smiling at, say, the absurd
confidence of Euthyphro, in the dialogue named for him, that he
knows what piety is. Thus Plato lulls us into re-creating in our
own souls the very smug sense of superiority that we (smugly) look
down on in Euthyphro. Should we read the dialogue, close the book
and get on with our lives, we are doing exactly what Euthyphro did
in response to Socratic questioning _ absolutely nothing. For
Nehamas, Plato allows us to think we are viewing the drama from
Plato's perspective, thus inviting an inevitable sense of
superiority to Socrates' interlocutors, only to whip that
assumption away and leave us barefaced and embarrassed at our
vanity. Plato himself disappears beyond the horizon of his
characters. Indeed, Nehamas makes a claim that has come to haunt my
thoughts since I read it: that Plato did not understand his own
literary creature. The Socrates of the dialogues remains opaque to
his author, and this helps to explain the sense of verisimilitude
and realism we feel when we encounter him.
</P>
<P>
   I find myself in strongest disagreement with Nehamas's chapter
on Socratic irony, interesting though it is. Ever since Kierkegaard
published ``The Concept of Irony With Continual Reference to
Socrates,'' it has been more or less required for interpreters to
come to grips with Socrates' irony. Nehamas takes up this
tradition, criticizes it to good effect and then goes on to offer
his own unpersuasive account. Let me simply state, without
argument, that irony is one of Socrates' least important features.
What is important is that others take Socrates to be ironic _ both
figures inside the dialogues, like Alcibiades and Thrasymachus, and
figures outside the dialogues, like Kierkegaard, the renowned
American philosopher Gregory Vlastos and Nehamas himself. Socrates
says at his trial that were he to tell the truth about why he
cannot stop doing philosophy (he would be disobeying God's
command), he would be taken by the court to be speaking ironically.
To be sure, he makes that point with a certain irony, but over all
he warns his audience against the temptation of attributing hidden
layers of meaning to him.
</P>
<P>
   Should one succumb to this temptation, one can then put the
putative irony to various illusory uses: one can see Socrates as
masking a mysterious something (Alcibiades) or as masking a
mysterious nothing (Kierkegaard) or as meaning the opposite of what
he says (Vlastos) or as expressing an essential uncertainty
(Nehamas). What is almost impossible for us to hold on to is the
idea that everything about Socrates is right there on the surface.
It remains a fascinating question about us _ why we cannot help
attributing depth to him.

</HEADLINE>
  A Life of Counsel and Controversy 
 By Arthur L. Liman with Peter Israel 
 Illustrated. 386 pp. New York: Public Affairs. $30 
 ------ 
 HIS DAY IN COURT 
 By ADAM LIPTAK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If an image of Arthur L. Liman still lingers in the popular
consciousness, it is a caricature: the rumpled New York lawyer
presiding over the Iran-Contra hearings. His very physical presence
_ the shy, crooked grin, the brooding features, the epic comb-over
_ seemed designed to contrast with the pressed and polished
soldiers who appeared before him as witnesses, jaws jutting,
unencumbered by doubt. Liman's role in this piece of political
theater was as straight man, foil. He was earnest, tireless,
skeptical and yet strangely ineffective. In Hollywood, they call
this a fish-out-of-water story.
</P>
<P>
   Liman, who died last year, was far more in his element in
corporate litigation. He was a trial lawyer, rare among the classy
litigators to whom rich men and corporations turn when they are in
trouble. While he proudly called himself a rainmaker for the firm
he helped to build, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison, Liman
also did the work: he mastered the documents, interviewed the
witnesses, picked the juries and tried the cases. He ground out
victories and good settlements from this attention to detail and
the incremental concessions he coaxed from hostile witnesses
through methodical cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of his memoir is devoted to these trials. Liman plainly
took pleasure, even decades later, in recollecting the details. The
reader's pleasure is less intense. While the anecdotes are told
crisply and with occasional verve, their cumulative effect is to
convince one, if there existed doubt, that there is no such thing
as an interesting securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Liman seems uneasy writing about another aspect of his very full
public life. He was a counselor to many powerful and controversial
executives, an unusual role for a litigator. The things Liman
offered his clients _ absolute loyalty, authentic affection,
discretion _ do not allow him to examine their characters and
escapades in anything but a superficial and one-sided fashion.
Liman gave his clients tough and independent advice, but he
properly keeps their secrets here.
</P>
<P>
   Liman also often found time for public service of the most
demanding sort. He was chief counsel to the McKay Commission, which
investigated the Attica prison riots, and of the Senate Iran-contra
committee. He devotes only a few short chapters to the latter
investigation, which is a pity. He was plainly frustrated by the
perception that the hearings were a failure, and he offers
detailed, if dry, responses to his critics.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling passages about the hearings are brief excerpts
of a diary not discovered until after Liman died. Written in the
heat of battle and with an acid tone absent from the rest of the
book, he sketches nasty portraits of John Nields, his counterpart
in the House of Representatives, and Lawrence Walsh, the
Iran-contra independent counsel. These flashes of another side of
Liman are as illuminating as anything else in ``Lawyer,'' and
publication of the entire diary would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Liman does not seem to have been a particularly reflective man.
His legal philosophy is only hinted at, and those hints rarely rise
above bar association platitudes. He did, though, have an almost
religious faith in the courts _ in contrast, he notes, to the
generation of lawyers who preceded him, products of the New Deal
and its commitment to the executive and legislative branches.
</P>
<P>
   At Yale Law School, where he graduated first in his class, he
learned an approach to the law known as legal realism. Skeptical
and pragmatic, legal realism recognizes that judges often rule
first, basing their decisions on ideology or sympathy, and
manufacture reasoning later. Though generally thought to be a
descriptive critique, legal realism was understood by Liman to be a
call to arms, an inspiration to judges to shake off ``archaic rules
that would have prevented them from compensating victims,
nullifying unconscionable contracts, or insuring civil liberties.''
The courts are, he writes, an instrument for social change, and in
his career he looked to them to resolve all manner of social and
political issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Liman's Iran-contra experience may ultimately have caused
him to amend his views a little. He ends the book by questioning
the wisdom of unqualified faith in the judicial process to reform
society and by criticizing Congress for shifting ``responsibility
for politically difficult and complex decisions to the courts.''
His greatest public moment may have, ironically, disturbed the
convictions that underlay a lifetime in the law.

THE MEMOIRS OF FRAY SERVANDO TERESA DE MIER
</HEADLINE>
  Edited by Susana Rotker 
 Translated by Helen Lane 
 242 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $30 
 ------ 
 NO JAIL COULD HOLD HIM 
 By FREDERICK LUCIANI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Dec. 12, 1794, a young Dominican friar gave an impassioned
sermon to a distinguished audience in Mexico City. Fray Servando
Teresa de Mier proposed a remarkable thesis: nearly a millennium
and a half before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Apostle Thomas
had preached the Gospel in the New World, although the Indians
later lapsed into idolatry. Moreover, the image venerated in Mexico
as the Virgin of Guadalupe did not date from her 1531 appearance to
the Indian Juan Diego. It was impressed on St. Thomas's cape and
left in Mexico by the apostle to be rediscovered with the advent of
the European colonizers.
</P>
<P>
   The mistaken idea of a pre-Hispanic evangelization was not new,
but the Virgin of Guadalupe corollary was. And with winds of
revolution blowing from North America and France, the entire thesis
had political implications. Mier's generation of enlightened
Creoles (born in the colonies of unmixed European blood), chafing
under colonial rule, was eager to revise Mexican history and
identity according to its own designs on power. Church authorities
took the sermon as a provocation. They detained the friar, revoked
his license to preach and sentenced him to a 10-year monastic
imprisonment in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began Mier's quarter-century of wanderings in Europe and
the Americas, punctuated by many incarcerations and jailbreaks,
flights across borders, intellectual congress with great minds and
misadventures enough for several lifetimes. His pro-independence
agitation became more overt, and he was hounded by an Inquisition
that had become an instrument of political containment. His
tribulations did not end when independence came; he ran afoul of
Iturbide, the self-proclaimed Mexican Emperor, and suffered
imprisonment again before his final vindication in a free and
constitutional Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mier is a foundational figure of his nation, and scholars have
pored over his political writings. But his life, more than his
thought, has captivated readers ever since his autobiographical
writings were gathered and published in this century. These served
as the basis for ``Hallucinations,'' a novel by the Cuban writer
Reinaldo Arenas. Now a significant portion of Mier's memoirs has
been well translated by Helen Lane, and readers in the
English-speaking world can become directly acquainted with a figure
whose life was almost as bizarre as it was in Arenas's fantastic
vision.
</P>
<P>
   The greater part of the translated memoirs recounts Mier's
experiences in Napoleonic Europe from 1800 to 1805. For all the
bitterness of years in exile, in prison or on the run, and in
search of maddeningly elusive legal vindication, the memoirist's
tone is often one of ironic amusement. Mier was a born adventurer,
and he narrates his jailbreaks and time on the lam with brio. His
sense of humor is sharp and ribald; he never passes up an
opportunity to insert a salty story. As a memoirist, as in life, he
was also well served by a curious and tolerant nature, the origin
of some of the most agreeable pages of his story _ like those that
evoke his amiable sojourn with the Jewish community of Bayonne.
</P>
<P>
   Mier was a man of the world, a combative showman, a bit of a
rogue. His memoirs cover much geographical but no psychological
terrain. His sense of self, in fact, seems rudimentary. He insists,
a bit irritatingly, on his noble birth, his guileless nature (this
from an accomplished escape artist) and his softheartedness: ``So
as not to crush little ants underfoot it is my habit to hop lightly
from one foot to the other when I am on the road.'' His sufferings
do not evoke existential musings or expressions of faith. He
survived prison, apparently, by plotting, not by praying.
</P>
<P>
   The memoirs offer vivid appraisals of regions of France, Italy
and Spain that the beleaguered friar came to know. Italy and France
inspire a certain admiration, but Spain draws unrelenting scorn.
Its priests are ignorant, its Queen is a trollop, its people are
brutalized and degenerate, its institutions are corrupt. Madrid is
a dirty backwater where in winter, Mier asserts rather improbably,
``the cold is greater than in any other country of Europe, except
Petersburg.'' In the heat of summer, ladies promenade in the
streets with their breasts entirely exposed. The hallways of
apartment houses are littered with sewage and copulating couples.
</P>
<P>
   Mier's vision of great men and events seems, at times, similarly
impaired. Of his cohabitation in Paris with Simon Rodriguez _
Bolivar's tutor, an important figure for South American
independence _ he tells us mostly that his roommate got all the
credit for their collaboration on a Spanish translation of
Chateaubriand's ``Atala.'' The eminent Baron von Humboldt, whom
Mier also met, is mentioned in passing as someone who agreed with
his thesis about St. Thomas. He devotes a sole paragraph to the
Battle of Trafalgar, into which he blundered by boarding the wrong
boat while fleeing to Portugal. Admittedly, he wrote at little
temporal distance from events. Even so, how could he have such a
tin ear for the music of history?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he did not write for the ages. He wrote in prison, in
the midst of his nation's struggle for independence. His spirit,
fundamentally cheerful, lucid and generous, was blighted by decades
of lost battles. That, surely, is what restricts his historical
vision, distorts his perceptions and at times mires his
autobiographical narrative in self-serving polemic. When he rails
against his persecutors, he is shouting in a bureaucratic echo
chamber made of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Mier failed to record important periods of his life: his time in
Catalonia among volunteers battling Napoleon in 1808, his residence
in England from 1811 to 1816 and his travels in a United States
whose government Mexico was to emulate. Moreover, he made little
effort to explain his own evolution as a political thinker and
historical player. That is a task for a new biography, one very
much called for. For now, these entertaining memoirs offer a lively
portrait of their author. They are as eccentric, partisan and
slippery as Fray Servando himself.

 DON'T LOOK DOWN 
 By DAVID WILLIS MCCULLOUGH 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there a novel in this? Two women take off in an aging blue
biplane on a hot August morning in 1933 intending to fly in
monotonous counterclockwise circles over the Toronto lakefront for
25 days, breaking the world flight endurance record.
</P>
<P>
   By now we should know there can be a novel in anything. And in
the hands of Helen Humphreys, a young Canadian poet, what could be
a minor footnote becomes a novel so beautiful in its reticence and
insight, featuring characters so seemingly fragile and endangered,
that readers may well find themselves becoming curiously protective
about the whole enterprise. They will also feel the tension
building as the final chapters approach, much like the sensation
baseball fans recognize in the eighth inning of what might turn out
to be a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   Will something go wrong to spoil everything? Something, that is,
in the writing and the storytelling, not in the flying, where a
good deal has already gone wrong. It gives nothing away to say
right now that Helen Humphreys delivers her perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   The two women who fly the tiny Moth called Adventure Girl (the
name is painted on the fuselage in honor of the magazine that's
sponsoring the flight) could not be more unlike _ except for their
love of flying. Grace O'Gorman, known to the public as Air Ace
Grace, is 33 years old, married, the holder of a number of flying
records and famous for her airborne stunts. Willa Briggs is 10
years younger, an inexperienced and unknown flying instructor who
sleeps in a ramshackle cabin behind an airplane hangar. Grace signs
Willa on at the last minute when her original co-pilot breaks her
wrist; she thinks so little of Willa that she forgets to invite her
to the pre-takeoff dinner.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few flying records Grace hasn't broken is the one for
endurance; it is held by her husband, Jack Robson, the man who
first taught her how to fly. If Grace and Willa stay aloft for 25
days, they'll destroy Jack's only claim to fame _ other, that is,
than being Grace's husband. It is Jack's job to fly up every eight
hours in his own plane to rendezvous with the women, deliver food
and messages and, in a tricky midair maneuver, refuel Adventure
Girl.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Willa finds herself filled with wonder, awed by the
ever-changing views below her and the honor of flying with Grace.
They have no radio; because of the noise and the wind in their open
cockpits, they cannot easily speak to each other. Since Willa is
seated behind Grace, they rarely even make eye contact. After their
note pads are ruined in a rainstorm, they are no longer able to
write notes to each other. Partly out of necessity and partly out
of boredom, they develop a private language of signs and gestures,
a means of communication that is all their own.
</P>
<P>
   As the days pass, Grace and Willa's contact with the earth
becomes more and more tenuous. They are too high to recognize
individual human figures on the ground. Jack drops off no messages
with their sandwiches, only copies of the local newspaper featuring
his highly fanciful articles about their adventures, articles in
which Grace always seems terribly vulnerable and plucky Willa
always saves the day. Gradually, the two women stop reading the
papers and spend less and less time looking down. Their only human
contact lies in their unspoken gestures, their occasional touches.
</P>
<P>
   The third woman in the story _ actually, she's a 12-year-old
girl _ is Maddy, the daughter of a Scottish merry-go-round operator
and a Jewish fortuneteller who live in an amusement park over which
Adventure Girl flies its seemingly endless circles. As the sound of
the plane drones on night and day, Maddy, whose bedroom wall is
decorated with a picture of the Air Ace, begins to believe that
Grace is her real mother, that her true identity has been kept a
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Through Maddy, the novel acquires a sense of the times. The
Great Depression is not quite over. Camps for workers have been set
up near the city. Hitler is becoming a disturbingly familiar name.
A gang of pro-Nazi blueshirts roams the amusement park midway.
Maddy's mother's brother is a prizefighter who wears a Star of
David on his trunks. (Willa has taken boxing lessons from him, in
exchange for flying lessons.) After he defeats a German, the
blueshirts take their revenge by beating up Maddy's mother and
burning down her fortune-telling booth.
</P>
<P>
   As 10, 11, 12 days pass, life in Adventure Girl becomes more and
more removed from reality. Willa is not always sure how many days
they have still to go. There's engine trouble. The fabric on a wing
is badly torn (and crudely mended) during an especially difficult
refueling. Willa begins to fear that Jack may be intentionally
sabotaging the flight. Down below, Maddy is collecting bits and
pieces thrown from the plane and saving them as relics: chicken
bones, orange peels, a note Willa wrote to Grace on a scrap of
newspaper and threw away before she dared to pass it on. Maddy
treasures it as a love note from her true mother. It's not long
before Maddy's world and Grace and Willa's become one.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Humphreys writes remarkably spare, uncluttered prose; she
has a great knack for evoking unspoken love and finding stark
beauty in matters as diverse as the sight of a burning ship at
night or the creation of a silent language. The very first image of
the novel illustrates her ingenuity, blending toughness with an
almost housewifely tidiness as the ``masculine'' sport of flying is
hemmed into place with the ``feminine'' art of sewing: ``The plane
slips from a spool of blue, stitches a confident loop in the sky.
Willa stands by the hangar as the Moth roars above her head, growl
of open throttle.''
</P>
<P>
   There are few wasted words or incidents in ``Leaving Earth.'' In
fact, it is a novel that ends just before the most important words
of all are finally spoken. But there is room in it for sly humor
(particularly in Jack Robson's newspaper dispatches) and for some
startlingly lyrical cadenzas, like the scenes of Maddy being given
riding lessons by her father. The horse is her favorite
merry-go-round steed. Its name _ we shouldn't be surprised by this
_ is Amelia.

  A Novella and Stories 
 By Lan Samantha Chang 
 191 pp. New York: W. W. Norton &AMP; Company. $22 
 ------ 
 'A HOLE IN OUR HOUSE' 
 By CLAIRE MESSUD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The final story in Lan Samantha Chang's elegant debut collection
closes with a resonant image, as a Communist soldier in wartime
Shanghai executes the narrator's wealthy master: ``The soldier
raised his arm again, and the sharp blade sliced all our lives in
two.'' This story is the only one in the book that takes place in
China, but the bifurcation it describes encapsulates the
experiences of all the Chinese-American families who people Chang's
work. Her stories constitute a delicately calculated balance sheet
of the losses and gains of immigrants whose lives are stretched
between two radically different cultures.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Unforgetting,'' Ming Hwang, his wife, Sansan, and their
young son, Charles, settle in eastern Iowa, where they build a
wholly American life: ``The Hwangs forgot what they no longer
needed. . . . They forgot what they could no longer bear to hope
for. . . . They learned what they needed to know.'' Ming puts aside
his dream of becoming a scientist in order to prosper as a
photocopier repairman, and Sansan learns to cook cream of tomato
soup. Thoroughly Americanized, Charles flourishes academically and
prepares to leave home; only then must his parents confront what
they have lost: ``Nothing remained of the stories and meals and
people they'd known, nothing but what they remembered. Their world
lived in them, and they would be the end of it. They had no solace,
and no burden, but each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hwangs, for all the regret that is woven into their lives,
are more fortunate than others, particularly the motherless family
in ``The Eve of the Spirit Festival'' or the fatherless narrator of
``San'' _ or, most notably, the Sung family, whose fierce
disappointments are the subject of the collection's powerful title
novella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunger'' is narrated from beyond the grave by Min, the wife of
Tian Sung and the mother of Anna and Ruth. Raised in Taiwan, Min
met Tian when she was working in a Chinese restaurant in New York
and he was a promising violinist. Their union was, according to
Min's mother, yuanfen, ``that apportionment of love which is
destined for you in this world.'' But their lives, distorted by
Tian's private grief and by his failure to secure a permanent
teaching position, are not meant for happiness. Anna, their elder
daughter, turns out to be tone-deaf and is consigned to the role of
mother's helper, while beautiful and rebellious Ruth is brutally
coerced by her father into mastering the violin. Although ``there
was a hole in our house, like a great mouth, filled with love words
and lost objects,'' there is, for a time, some redemption in Ruth's
playing. Her music is ``like a great rope of silk, smooth and
shimmering, shot through with glints and shades of beautiful
light.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang has a fine gift for such evocative concrete descriptions
of the abstract; her prose, while generally as restrained as the
characters to whom it belongs, occasionally bursts into rich blooms
of imagery. Brownstones in late 1960's Brooklyn stand ``in patient
rows, like tablets in a soldiers' graveyard, crumbled and soft
around the edges''; in Iowa, Ming Hwang senses ``the rolling fields
that pressed upon their house. Mutinous seeds opposed the lawn:
tall leaves of pale new wheat, foamy milkweed, Queen Anne's lace.''
</P>
<P>
   Less successful are Chang's explicit renditions of family
altercations, with their blunt, overly familiar dialogue: ``You
will stay in this house!'' storms Tian to Ruth in ``Hunger.'' ``I
am not staying!'' she replies. ``You can't keep me from leaving!''
In ``The Eve of the Spirit Festival,'' the father rails at his
daughter: ``What are you doing that for? You can't go out tonight.
. . . Dressing up in boys' clothes, with paint on your face.'' And
Sansan Hwang, in ``The Unforgetting,'' yells at her husband: ``You
have ruined me! You have trapped me into this life!'' Such
platitudes are perhaps inevitable, since many of Chang's characters
are like Sansan, who ``in English . . . seemed to hide from her
more complicated thoughts.'' Nevertheless, they weaken these
otherwise luminously elegiac stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunger'' is the melody upon which the rest of the collection
provides graceful variations. Chang offers no easy or reassuring
resolution to the tortures of the immigrant experience: complex and
rueful, her fiction gives voice to internal struggles, withheld
catalogues of loss. As Min notes: ``Some Chinese make their
fortunes in America. Tian and I were not among them. Perhaps we
lacked the forgetfulness that is essential to moving on.''

SILK AND INSIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  By Yukio Mishima 
 Edited by Frank Gibney 
 Translated by Hiroaki Sato 
 219 pp. Armonk, N.Y.: East Gate/M. E. Sharpe. Cloth, $44.95. Paper,
$19.95 
 ------ 
 RAW MATERIAL 
 By MARK MORRIS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time Yukio Mishima destroyed himself in 1970, he had
behind him a quarter-century of writing: stories, longer fiction,
plays, critical essays, personal reflections and, especially toward
the end, pamphlets blending ultranationalism and esthetics with
deadly efficacy. Several times during these decades, Mishima turned
away from his luxuriant imagination and tore his gaze from the
mirror long enough to experiment with capturing dramatic aspects of
contemporary society in fiction.
</P>
<P>
   He tried this first in 1950 with the unsuccessful ``Blue
Period,'' the story of a gifted student who turns loan shark amid
the confusion and corruption of the early postwar years. The
protagonist, like his creator, ends up a suicide. Arguably, Mishima
was not so much jumping on the bandwagon of a social scandal as
attempting to extend his range beyond the lyricism of his 1949
masterpiece, ``Confessions of a Mask.''
</P>
<P>
   Another figure taken by Mishima and other contemporaries as
emblematic of their inescapable existential disarray helped Mishima
shape ``The Temple of the Golden Pavilion'' (1956). A deeply
disturbed young Buddhist acolyte had burned down one of Kyoto's
most beautiful temples. But that bit of reality provided only the
framework for this extended meditation on being _ and being part of
the generation that came too late _ and the esthetics of
destruction. The distance Mishima achieved by exteriorizing many of
his own lyrical impulses through a quasi-historical protagonist no
doubt accounts for the control he maintained throughout that book,
his final great work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silk and Insight'' appeared in 1964, when Mishima's reputation
had begun to slip. It seems clearly to have been an attempt to
repeat the success of an earlier novel, ``After the Banquet,''
which had tackled the unpromising topic of Tokyo politics. In
reconstructing the campaign waged by Noguchi, a veteran politician,
and his new wife, a restaurant proprietor with a colorful past,
Mishima sailed close enough to reality to find himself involved in
Japan's first invasion-of-privacy litigation. Yet the book is
perhaps his most novelistic work, with a degree of earthiness and
warmth rare in his fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silk and Insight'' replaces the world of politics with that of
silk textile manufacturing. Mishima dramatizes a moment in the
labor struggles of the 1950's. The politician of ``After the
Banquet'' is replaced by an old-fashioned factory owner, Komazawa,
and the politician's formidable wife, one of Mishima's few
believable female characters, transmogrifies into a retired geisha,
Kikuno, whose very presence in the plot is, like her eventual
self-abnegation before her boss and lover Komazawa, difficult to
credit.
</P>
<P>
   An even less believable character is Okano, a political operator
who spouts Heidegger and Holderlin. He functions as a mediator
between the different social spheres of the main characters and
manipulates the situation at the factory to the point where
Komazawa loses his paternalistic hold and dies a broken man while
Okano takes over the business.
</P>
<P>
   In his biography of Mishima, John Nathan recalled with bitter
humor his despair in 1964 when, having accepted the job of
translating ``Silk and Insight,'' he finally opened the book. One
reading led him to change his mind. This first English translation
does not suggest that Nathan misjudged. The book conveys certain
aspects of the contradictions of older and newer forms of
capitalist production in that era. But a reader has to pay a steep
price for such peripheral information; this translation of a poor
original is a shambles. Any page may sprout handfuls of problems:
idioms rendered with deadly literalness, tortured syntax trying to
bundle one long Mishima cascade of overripe imagery into a single
English sentence, and more. Equipping it with an editor _ whose
efforts are to my eye invisible _ and a subtitle to plead that
``Silk and Insight'' really is ``a novel'' cannot rescue even this
respected translator of Japanese poetry from a translation too far.

  A Novel of Mythic Proportions 
 By Daniel Wallace 
 180 pp. Chapel Hill, N.C.: Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $17.95 
 ------ 
 DOG COMES IN A BAR 
 By JAMES POLK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many sons, William Bloom doesn't really know his father.
For years, any attempt to probe beneath the senior Bloom's surfaces
have been met by a stream of tired jokes of the
dog-walks-into-the-bar variety. For years, none of that mattered
much. But now Edward Bloom is dying; suddenly it matters a great
deal.
</P>
<P>
   William's increasingly desperate attempts to draw his father
out, to make contact with the man during this ``journey to the end
of his life,'' are only met by more old jokes. So what does he do?
Within his own imagining, he makes Edward into a myth, a quietly
heroic figure standing astride the lives of all who know him. Even
to those who merely brush against him in passing he becomes a
benevolent colossus _ a truly Big Fish.
</P>
<P>
   In his son's construction, the father's story becomes Homeric.
In one episode, a catfish as big as a man drags him through a
community of dead souls at the bottom of a lake. As a youth leaving
home in rural Alabama, Edward successfully makes it through a sort
of purgatory of lost dreams, where the grand ideas of countless
others have crumbled against the easy temptations of the familiar.
</P>
<P>
   He tames a giant ``as tall as any two men, as wide as any three
and as strong as any ten.'' He performs tasks that, although not
exactly Herculean, have perhaps more resonance in the modern world
_ cleaning out a veterinarian's kennels, selling a girdle to an
impossible customer at a department store, rescuing a child from
the jaws of a massive dog _ because he knows he must ``perform many
great labors before he assumed his rightful place.'' At least his
rightful place in his son's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Moving smoothly from unlikely triumph to unlikely triumph (early
on, he comes up with the phrase ``Buy one, get one free''; later,
he purchases an entire town), this invented Edward Bloom grows tall
in his son's reckoning, but the reality of the man remains as
elusive as ever. ``How I wish I knew him better,'' laments William,
even as the hero of his imagining assumes ever grander stature,
``how I wish we'd had a life together, wishing my father wasn't
such a complete and utter goddamn mystery to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In this first novel, Daniel Wallace begins with a nearly
exhausted topic from men's groups everywhere (guys can't share
emotions or boil water). He adds legends and folk tales from the
Southern backwoods, throws in a smattering of Greek myth and
attaches a few of his own inventions. Applying all of these to a
life that might have been _ for all we really know _ quite ordinary
has resulted in a story that is both comic and poignant.
</P>
<P>
   While at times ``Big Fish'' is a bit too cute, with some
exaggerations simply too excessive and others slightly off the
point, most of it strikes the right notes. By the end, the figure
that William's imagination creates somehow encompasses the actual
man even while transcending the Edward Bloom who endures the bumps
and bruises of the everyday.
</P>
<P>
   That, after all, is a nice encapsulation of the complexity with
which many sons view their fathers. They begin as mythical
creatures, the first adult male the child encounters, moral and
physical giants who can do no wrong. The flaws come later, as the
son begins to glimpse the imperfections. In this novel, however,
the son chooses to go back before the flaws, to embrace and enlarge
the myth. As he does, swimming upstream under water (to use one of
the author's recurring metaphors), William is able to reach past
the funny stories and the evasions to grasp at the humanity
underneath.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the father? Sadly, even after all of William's
efforts, and even though the novel ends on a note of mutual regard,
Edward's understanding of his son falls short, recalling the punch
line to one of his more familiar jokes:
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Jesus at the gates of heaven, an old man tells the story
of his wondrous son. Christ embraces him and exclaims, ``Father,
father!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinocchio?'' asks the bewildered old man.

PAUL MARCHAND, F.M.C.
</HEADLINE>
  By Charles W. Chesnutt 
 144 pp. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. $20 
 ------ 
 WHITE LIKE ME 
 By ARNOLD RAMPERSAD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The publication of Charles W. Chesnutt's ``Paul Marchand,
F.M.C.'' (the initials stand for ``Free Man of Color,'' a not
uncommon term in Louisiana before the Civil War) marks another
milestone in the return of Chesnutt's reputation from the grave. At
one time, long ago _ around the turn of the century _ Chesnutt was
not only the most acclaimed of African-American fiction writers but
also the first one to enjoy something like a national reputation.
In 1899, after placing several short stories and articles in
surprisingly prominent magazines, notably The Atlantic Monthly, he
published two collections of short tales: ``The Conjure Woman'' and
``The Wife of His Youth.'' Chesnutt then followed this sparkling
debut with three novels _ ``The House Behind the Cedars'' (1900),
``The Marrow of Tradition'' (1901) and ``The Colonel's Dream''
(1905). All of these books were published by prominent American
publishing houses; Houghton Mifflin brought out the first four;
Doubleday, Page published the last.
</P>
<P>
   By 1905, however, Chesnutt's once-promising literary career, for
which he had given up his practice as a legal stenographer in his
native Cleveland, was in irreversible decline. He continued to
write and to enjoy a degree of prestige as an aging lion in black
literary society, such as it was; but with the hardening of Jim
Crow practices in the new century, most publishers on the whole no
longer wanted his work or that of other black writers. Although he
lived to see the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920's, when the Negro
came briefly into vogue, that movement had little to offer him
beyond patronizing bows. When he died at the age of 74 in 1932,
Chesnutt was virtually unknown except among black American readers.
</P>
<P>
   Six decades later, his work is at last receiving its due. Among
several highly respected scholars of American and African-American
literature, Chesnutt has emerged not only as a pillar of the black
American literary tradition but also, as in the judgment of the
scholar Eric Sundquist, ``among the major American fiction writers
of the 19th century.'' All of the stories he published in his
lifetime are back in print; William L. Andrews, the author of an
important book on Chesnutt, has edited his collected stories;
Richard Brodhead has edited his often fascinating journals. Of the
six unpublished novels Chesnutt left behind, three have been
published recently or are about to be published: ``Mandy
Oxendine,'' from his early years as a writer, and ``The Quarry''
and ``Paul Marchand, F.M.C.,'' which were written after his moment
of fame. The recent proliferation of scholarly articles,
dissertations and books about him suggests that his new prestige is
likely to endure. The American Literature Association now includes
the Charles Chesnutt Society.
</P>
<P>
   This revival is hardly an accident. The melodramatic and
sentimental elements of Chesnutt's craft that once made him seem
second-rate, if interesting, no longer faze scholars and students
who look beyond conventional notions of art in evaluating a text;
and his sometimes glittering insights into the subtleties of racial
consciousness among not only blacks and whites but among those
people who fall between the two groups more than make up, in the
minds of such readers, for his ``faults'' of form. In an
intellectual age that insists on race as primarily a social, not a
biological, construction, and that is freshly fascinated by
theories of hybridity and biracialism, cultural liminality, the
dynamics of postcolonialism and so on, Chesnutt's work seems in
retrospect to have been nothing less than prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   And in his person he indeed embodied many of the most puzzling,
and even vexing and painful, aspects of race in the United States.
Chesnutt was, as he himself put it, a ``voluntary Negro'' _ white
enough to pass across the color line. At 17 he confided in his
journal his determination to do so. ``I believe I'll leave here,''
he wrote about the South, where he had grown up, ``and pass anyhow,
for I am as white as any of them.'' He in fact left the South,
first for New York and then for Cleveland, where he lived the rest
of his life, but he married a black woman and passed only on
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   As an apprentice writer he did not advertise his racial
background but soon discovered that race was his true subject, to
which he brought an artistic vision bordering at times on the
revolutionary. In 1887, when The Atlantic Monthly published ``The
Goophered Grapevine,'' Chesnutt broke new ground with the white
reading public not only by his uncommon use of black folklore
surrounding ``conjuring,'' or the occult, but, more important, by
his cool though quite determined challenge to perhaps the key tenet
of the popular ``plantation'' school of writing _ that the main
fictional voice telling about Southern racial reality, past and
present, had to be white. Chesnutt's hero, Uncle Julius McAdoo, a
former slave (of mixed blood, we are told) and as disarming as he
is shrewd and even devious in his self-interest, took over that
essential task quietly but firmly. In creating this character,
Chesnutt upended other plantation-school tenets, especially one
that held that the years of slavery had been the Golden Age of the
South. To be sure, he was not alone in attacking the plantation
school. His onetime mentor and friend, the accomplished white
writer George Washington Cable, had led the general assault and had
suffered accordingly; but Chesnutt, in an entirely historic way,
carried the flag of black identity in ways even Cable had not
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The House Behind the Cedars'' and ``The Marrow of
Tradition,'' both set in the Carolinas, Chesnutt left behind the
plantation, and also humor, in order to probe more deeply the lives
of mixed-blood characters living in the middle-class world of W. E
.B. Du Bois's ``Talented Tenth'' of black Americans, from which the
solutions to the endemic racial crisis, and the leaders of the
race, were supposed to come. The heroine of ``The House Behind the
Cedars'' passes for white, entrances a white man, is exposed and
comes to an unhappy end. ``The Marrow of Tradition'' links two
families, one black and the other white, united by blood but almost
hopelessly divided (although not quite) by racism and the obsession
of whites with crushing even the most legitimate ambitions of
blacks in the aftermath of the Civil War. So trenchant was
Chesnutt's analysis of Southern society that many white readers in
the North as well as the South questioned his basic objectivity;
this lack of sympathy translated into weak sales and doomed
Chesnutt's ambition to live by his writings.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that ``Paul Marchand, F.M.C.,'' which Chesnutt finished
in 1921, was rejected by Houghton Mifflin, Harcourt Brace and
Alfred A. Knopf is not hard to understand _ just as it is easy to
see why its publication now, with an excellent introduction by
Matthew Wilson, who teaches the humanities and writing at the
Pennsylvania State University, is a boon not only to Chesnutt
studies but to our understanding of the questions raised by his
art. Still inspired by these questions, Chesnutt had ventured into
another fictional investigation of the tension between nature and
culture that is at the heart of our American understanding and
experience of race.
</P>
<P>
   This novel is, in its essence, about a man, Paul Marchand,
brought up to think of himself as a black _ or, more accurately, as
a man of mixed blood _ who discovers as an adult that he is in fact
white. Suddenly, too, he becomes the wealthy and powerful head of
an extended white family that has little sympathy for mixed-bloods
and blacks. The question _ whether Marchand should discard his
mixed-race wife, whom he loves but who has no legal standing in
Louisiana society _ is piquant but not nearly as important as the
question of whether he can ever hope to overcome the feelings of
inferiority and psychological turmoil conditioned in him. Can such
a man ever become whole, and wholesome?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions concerning race still resonate with us, and
certainly resounded in the 1920's, when racial ``science'' was in
its heyday in the United States; and Chesnutt answers them again,
as in the past, in provocative ways. In 1921 he was still ahead of
his time _ although in other ways his art was outmoded. In
developing his characters, setting and plot, he had reached
arthritically into the past of local-color writing for a too-shiny
Louisiana tale of French Creoles, alabaster maidens, haunted
octoroons, desperate duels, miraculous wills and letters, and the
like. White editors and publishers uneasy with his disquieting
perspective on race (as the liberal Richard Watson Gilder and
William Dean Howells, for example, had been earlier in his career
even as they sought to help and guide Chesnutt) perhaps saw a
relatively easy way out, and took it _ they rejected the book.
Nevertheless, behind the tired literary devices are a vibrant
intelligence and an astute cultural sense on which we can draw as
we continue our own wrestling in the brier patch of race.

BREAKING NEWS
</HEADLINE>
  By Robert MacNeil 
 406 pp. New York: Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $24.95 
 ------ 
 WE TAKE YOU LIVE 
 By ERIC ALTERMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I did not expect to be charmed by a novel written by a former
PBS news anchor any more than I expected to learn a bit of Yiddish
from someone named Robert MacNeil. But one ought not complain about
life's more pleasant surprises _ particularly when they come from a
man whose program prided itself, in the words of Judy Woodruff, on
its daring willingness ``to be boring.'' ``Breaking News,''
MacNeil's third novel, is not only far from boring, it is also a
provocative cri de coeur aimed at what one character calls
``information/entertainment television.''
</P>
<P>
   MacNeil's hero, Grant Munroe, is facing a life crisis and a
professional crisis simultaneously. He is nearing 60 and musing
over a possible face lift, worried about both his job as network
anchorman and his dignity. Raised on Walter Cronkite, Munroe is a
hard-news man, whereas his producer, Marty Boyle, is younger,
hipper and more in tune with the times. When Grant suggests leading
the evening broadcast with Middle East peace talks, because ``it's
the most important thing that happened today,'' Marty replies:
``Sure, you're right. But we've got pictures of the little girl in
Wyoming who was raped and found dead in the woods; great family
videos of her, cute and poignant as hell. What do you show for the
Mideast? Guys in suits walking in and out of offices. Maybe for
excitement some have no ties on?''
</P>
<P>
   Upon accepting one of those awards anchormen always seem to be
receiving, Munroe delivers a prime time J'accuse to his own
profession. Munroe likens himself and his colleagues to ``Gadarene
swine . . . in our new and insane competitiveness; in our rising
desperation for ratings; our prurient glee in discussing the
President's sex life; in our rush to report unsubstantiated rumor,
leaks and gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   The outburst inspires an editor at Time magazine to assign a
cover profile of Munroe, just as his twin crises are getting into
gear. This plot device gives MacNeil an easy short cut into
Munroe's various depressing thoughts about the state of broadcast
news today. But it also inspires the higher-ups at the network to
wonder whether ``Grant is beginning to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel tells a grown-up story about a group of privileged
people whose days are dominated by the never-ending news cycle and
whose evenings are spent on the Upper West Side, bordered by Cafe
Des Artistes to the south and Fairway and Citarella to the north.
MacNeil has a Canadian's eye for the many conceits of American
media celebrity, and he uses it to great effect here. If you ever
wondered what it must be like to be rich, handsome, famous and
pampered, to be in late middle age but have beautiful young airline
attendants throw themselves at you just the same, a few hours in
the company of Grant Munroe will tell you, and you will even come
away liking and admiring him.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``Breaking News'' is a bit complicated, sometimes
overly so. It's easier to make sense of it if you substitute
real-world identities for each of MacNeil's main characters. For
Grant himself, think Dan Rather (without the weird,
frequency-related questions for ``Kenneth''). For Munroe's network,
whose news ratings are in the toilet, think CBS. For the
celebrity-chasing, prime time star the network is seeking to lure
to goose its ratings, think a younger, more Machiavellian Barbara
Walters. Some of the inventions are distinct improvements over
their real-life counterparts. Instead of the ghoulish Matt Drudge,
for instance, we get a black drag-queen cybergossip who calls
herself ``Hollygo.'' ``Want to know what I look like, honey?'' she
says. ``Think Ru Paul . . . on a bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   By the novel's end, MacNeil has delivered some extremely
disheartening news about the state of our national news media
wrapped neatly in a shiny literary package. Jim Lehrer's loss is
fiction's gain.

SEDUCTIVE JOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
  American Tourists in France From Jefferson to the Jazz Age 
 By Harvey Levenstein 
 Illustrated. 378 pp. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. $30 
 ------ 
 LIBERTE, EGALITE, INFIDELITE 
 By DEIRDRE BAIR 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost everyone who has ever tried to keep a travel diary seeks
the perfect opening statement, one that sets the tone for the
memorable sights and scenes that follow. But who could possibly top
Robert Johnson, a young Connecticut lawyer on a grand tour of
France in 1792-93, who ``on the 21st of January, the second day of
my arrival . . . mixed with the citizens and saw Louis XVI
beheaded''?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's is one of the many travel diaries culled by Harvey
Levenstein, an emeritus professor of history at McMaster
University, for ``Seductive Journey.'' He has combined the pithy,
amusing and sometimes embarrassing comments of Americans writing
about France with new insights into the cultural history of going
abroad. He explores how our experiences and expectations of foreign
countries and cultures are shaped by who we are and where we come
from, and the result is a thoroughly readable and highly likable
book.
</P>
<P>
   Levenstein separates American tourists in the years 1786-1848
into two groups that could be loosely defined as ``Jefferson''
versus ``Adams.'' Jefferson was ``violently smitten'' with
everything French, whereas Adams did not like ``any Frenchman''
because ``they are not a moral people.'' His wife, Abigail, enjoyed
her friend Jefferson's company on sightseeing jaunts but she shared
her husband's views, especially about sexual matters. To her,
Levenstein says, the easy acceptance of adultery by the French
higher classes was an indication of ``general moral and societal
disintegration.'' Even more distressing was what she saw as a
feeble commitment to family life, exemplified by the French
family's three or four children, whereas Americans often had eight
or nine.
</P>
<P>
   Americans in these years boarded unsafe ships for uncertain
journeys of three to six weeks, enduring violent seasickness and
frequently dying in shipwrecks. Emerson thought it ``strange that
the first man who came to sea did not turn round and go straight
back again,'' but a wealthy New Yorker, Philip Hone, noted
accurately that ``all the world (our world) is going to Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans who traveled to France between 1848 and 1870
represented the shift from ``cultural'' to ``recreational''
tourism, Levenstein writes. Previously, travel had been reserved as
an educational experience for men, but now women crossed the ocean
in ever growing numbers. These nouveaux riches went not only to
experience art and culture but also (and more important) to shop _
when they were not scheming for introductions to the ``dubious
monarch'' Emperor Napoleon III and his ``ersatz aristocrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Harriet Beecher Stowe, the ``archpriestess of middle-class
morality,'' derided her countrymen as the ``parasites of
parasites'' for the way they jostled to become ``hangers-on and
applauders in the train of that tyrant who has overthrown the hopes
of France.'' This led the old rich to ``keeping away from the
Joneses,'' exemplified by elaborate suites on ever larger luxury
liners, private railway cars and private houses or apartments far
from the parvenu crowd. It also resulted in ``the feminization of
American tourism,'' when women became the primary transmitters and
appreciators of high culture and all things artistic. Yet by
holding women responsible for the ``feminization of art
appreciation,'' men had an excuse to enjoy themselves in other
ways, since visiting museums and galleries was no longer considered
``a mark of distinction among cultivated males.'' Mark Twain was
representative when he called da Vinci's ``Last Supper'' ``dark,
dirty and damaged by Napoleon's horses'' and thought that most of
the masterpieces he saw in Europe ``came nowhere near matching''
the reproductions he saw at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leisure'' tourism began around 1870 and ended with World War I
in 1914. Writing of the seemingly aimless and endless wanderings of
rich men dragged across the Continent by their virago wives,
Levenstein describes how these ``prisoners of leisure'' followed
the ``year-round international upper-class tourist circuit'' from
Paris to the Riviera or Biarritz, then back for another season at
Chantilly and Longchamps, then to various Channel resorts.
Seventeen trunks of clothes were considered normal for a woman on
this ``veritable orgy of conspicuous consumption of clothing and
leisure.''
</P>
<P>
   But the middle class also took to traveling in ever increasing
numbers. Unmarried women in search of adventure (and romance) were
soon joined by groups like the ``Masons from Allegheny City,
Penn.,'' who took the first ``Cook's tour'' in 1871. By the Paris
Exposition of 1889, Cook's had solidified its reputation and
financial success by focusing on the middle class, especially
summer tours for teachers, with which the company would be
associated in the public mind for many years to come. Steamship
companies took notice as well, and many ocean liners were fitted
with a preponderance of second- and third-class compartments.
</P>
<P>
   In his concluding section, ``The Invasion of the Lower Orders:
1917-30,'' Levenstein shows how every previous attitude toward
travel in France coalesced in the behavior of the doughboys, some
of it good, but most of it bad. France had come to be seen by
Americans of every social class as ``the pleasure capital of the
world,'' and despite warnings from the military newspaper, Stars
and Stripes, not to treat it as ``a universal pleasure resort,''
many did, in the most appalling ways. The ugly American had been
born.
</P>
<P>
   The writer Kathleen Howard noted that instead of ``women of
exceptional elegance, men of large affairs, with a goodly supply of
lace-collared, flat-heeled schoolteachers,'' a different class of
people was coming to postwar Paris, referring to what Levenstein
lumps together as ``Americans pursuing other kinds of pleasures.''
He discusses these briefly but succinctly, from the artistic (jazz,
modern art, literature) to the sexual (``France's growing
reputation as a center of lesbianism'').
</P>
<P>
   Mme. de Stael called foreign travel ``one of the saddest
pleasures in life''; the inimitable Malcolm Muggeridge abhorred it,
saying, ``Travel narrows.'' But Americans, predominant among the 50
million tourists who each year visit a country whose population
barely surpasses that number, think of France as the ``center of
the American tourist's universe.'' ``Seductive Journey'' does much
to remind us why.

WORKING WITH EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE
</HEADLINE>
  By Daniel Goleman 
 383 pp. New York: Bantam Books. $25.95 
 ------ 
 IT AIN'T WHAT YOU KNOW 
 By WARREN BENNIS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's beyond me!'' an enraged talk-radio caller screamed into
his car phone recently. ``It's just beyond me that a guy with all
that political savvy, brains and ambition could be so stupid. I
just don't get it.'' He was talking, of course, about Bill Clinton.
Having spent a lifetime studying exemplary and not so exemplary
leaders, I have to confess that I wasn't all that astounded, though
no less angry.
</P>
<P>
   My loss of innocence came a long time ago, when I was asked to
evaluate the No. 2 executive in a large global corporation for the
firm's top post. Let's call him Ed. He seemed ideal: energetic,
ambitious and super-smart. It took me about six months to come to
the conclusion that though Ed looked perfect, he lacked a crucial
ingredient of leadership _ integrity. Nobody trusted him, and I
couldn't help him. The board ignored my advice, and when the
incumbent chief executive officer had a heart attack, in a
collective panic it elevated Ed. He was summarily discharged only
12 months later. A conservative estimate of his cost to the company
was over $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   I included this story in one of my books, and to this day get
letters telling me, ``Ed's my boss.'' If I'd had Daniel Goleman's
``Working With Emotional Intelligence'' back then, I could have
saved that company $5 million for only $25.95. Maybe Ed could have
been saved too.
</P>
<P>
   Goleman is writing about a subject most of us think we know a
great deal about: maturity, emotional health, ``grownupness'' _ and
about how those qualities, which help make up ``emotional
intelligence,'' affect our own and others' careers and job
performance. And he does this with such clarity, convincing data
and literary power that few readers will view the personal and
social undercurrents of organizations in quite the same way again.
</P>
<P>
   Goleman, also the author of the hugely popular ``Emotional
Intelligence,'' among other books, and a former contributor to The
New York Times, is now the chief executive officer of Emotional
Intelligence Services, a consulting company. He has based this new
book on data collected on more than 500 companies worldwide and on
interviews with professionals and employees from all walks of life.
The essence of his findings can be summed up simply: emotional
intelligence, more than any other factor, more than I.Q. or
expertise, accounts for 85 percent to 90 percent of success at
work. In effect, he confirms what we know in our bones.
</P>
<P>
   Goleman argues that I.Q. leaves about 75 percent of job success
unexplained at best, and at worst, 96 percent. He cites a study of
Harvard graduates working in law, medicine, teaching and business
that found that scores on entrance exams, the equivalent to I.Q.,
had zero or negative correlation with their career success. In
those fields, and many others I have studied, emotional
intelligence is much more powerful than I.Q. in determining who
emerges as a leader. I.Q. is a threshold competence. You need it,
but it doesn't make you a star. Emotional intelligence can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working With Emotional Intelligence'' lays out the framework
Goleman proposed in his earlier book. ``Personal competence''
includes self-awareness (knowing one's internal states),
self-regulation (managing one's internal states) and motivation
(emotional tendencies that help one reach goals). ``Social
competence'' has two major dimensions, empathy (awareness of
others' feelings) and social skills (adeptness at getting desirable
responses from others). For each of the five dimensions of
emotional intelligence, Goleman identifies five key skills. He
refers to these as ``emotional competencies.'' To take just a few
examples, under self-regulation he includes self-control (managing
one's disruptive emotions) and trustworthiness (maintaining
standards of honesty and integrity). Empathy includes understanding
others, leveraging diversity (which Goleman defines as
``cultivating opportunities through diverse people'') and political
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Goleman's framework is illuminating, but how he applies it is
even more important. In one of his most creative chapters he sets
forth an original model for enhancing emotional competencies,
establishing detailed guidelines for developing each of them.
Goleman understands all too well that most of the dollars spent on
executive training and development are devoted to the cognitive
area of the brain, the neocortex. These courses are very like the
ones we took in college, favoring the ``thinking brain.'' And
indeed, fitting new insights and data into the neural circuitry may
be helpful for many technical jobs. What Goleman calls ``the
billion dollar mistake'' comes in failing to engage the emotional
circuitry. In fact, it's worse than that. It's a $250 billion
mistake, the amount spent annually, according to Linkage Inc., a
management consulting firm, on executive development. I now think
of it as the Great Training Robbery.
</P>
<P>
   I do have one or two problems with the book. Goleman argues that
his five encompassing emotional competencies are hierarchical: that
is, self-awareness is crucial for self-regulation, and empathy and
its four competencies are crucial for social skills. But let's look
at President Clinton's behavior, which so inflamed the talk-show
caller. If emotional competencies are indeed hierarchical, how
could Clinton skip self-regulation (including impulse control and
trustworthiness) without hampering his fabled empathy and social
skills? I also have difficulty believing that the 25 competencies
are of equal value, as Goleman contends. Isn't integrity more
salient for high office than, to take one example, leveraging
diversity?
</P>
<P>
   In making his case, Goleman may also play down the importance of
effective systems or structure in an organization's success. He
tells us about a high-flying executive search firm where everyone
is paid on the basis of overall, not individual, performance. The
average salary of the consultants was $908,000, almost double the
industry average; Goleman attributes the company's outstanding
performance to the collective emotional intelligence of its top
officers. But I can't help wondering if a reward system that
encouraged collaboration wasn't at least as important.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in leadership and the health of human
institutions should get a copy of this book. In fact, I recommend
it to all readers anywhere who want to see their organizations in
the phone book in the year 2001.

   Matt Scudder has certainly calmed down since the old days. The
life-scarred New York veteran of 13 city-wise crime novels by
Lawrence Block shows up for action in EVERYBODY DIES (Morrow, $25)
in a contented fog. Wry and ruminative by nature, the aging shamus
hasn't entirely lost his edge, but still: he's happily married,
he's been off the sauce for 16 years, he has his private
investigator's license, he eats mushroom-and-tofu stroganoff
(``with a big green salad''), and he carries an umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a setup, of course, for the devastating events that
teach him a sobering lesson: people die and he can't do a thing
about it. The first deaths _ the execution of two hired hands who
worked for Scudder's gangster friend Mick (the Butcher) Ballou, the
``bloodthirsty but somehow engaging'' owner of the last great Irish
saloon in Hell's Kitchen _ don't really register. But when mobsters
bomb the saloon, drive Mick underground and mow down Scudder's A.A.
sponsor trying to kill him, he gets the message. Scudder keeps
saying that this is Mick's story, and in the sense that this
colorful and complicated rogue is responsible for all the trouble
(and much of the grand dialogue), it is. But it is Scudder who
ponders the metaphysics, striking the tone of loss, resignation and
acceptance that makes this one of the most harrowing yet most
rewarding chapters in the education of a hero.
</P>
<P>
   The air of dreamlike menace that hovers over TRICK OF LIGHT
(Putnam, $24.95), David Hunt's second thriller (after ``The
Magician's Tale''), transforms San Francisco from a daytime city of
brilliant color and clarity into an eerie nether world ``enveloped
in fog, swaddled in mystery and mist.'' This enigmatic aura comes
filtered through the perspective of the narrator, a profoundly
color-blind photographer named Kay Farrow, who sees subtlety and
shadow and infinite gradations of truth where others see only the
blinding hues of reality. ``Night's my time,'' Kay tells us, the
time when her light-sensitive eyes can focus on the negative images
that absorb her imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Kay's beloved mentor in a fishy hit-and-run
accident takes her to the seedy Mission District, where the older
woman was working in secret on a project involving naked women and
men in suits. Caught by the feeling of ``menace, depravity, even
evil'' in the murky photographs her teacher left behind, Kay
searches for their ``implicate order _ that which is implicit yet
hidden from view.'' Following her own vision (and nudged on by
Hunt's hypnotic prose), Kay conducts an investigation that goes
down some very dark alleys and leads to some very bleak truths. But
in the inverted imagery of this strange world, the blacker it gets,
the lovelier it looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like it used to be'' _ the nostalgic whine of New
Yorkers fretting over the changes in their old ethnic neighborhoods
_ conveys something more sinister in S. J. Rozan's latest Lydia
Chin mystery, A BITTER FEAST (St. Martin's, $23.95). Although
Chinatown still functions as the patriarchal big-city village that
Lydia knew as a child, the feudal political structure has shifted
in ways that the freelance private eye fails to notice until four
restaurant workers disappear and the office of their upstart labor
union is firebombed. Working undercover as a dim sum waitress,
Lydia learns that the Cantonese elder statesman who hired her (a
godfather figure who reminds her partner, Bill Smith, of the Wizard
of Oz) is engaged in a nasty power struggle with the leader of the
new immigrants from China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
   Rozan, who won the Shamus Award for the best private-eye novel
of 1995 with ``Concourse,'' brings a great deal of freshness to the
formula conventions _ if you can overlook certain corny routines,
like Lydia's girlish skirmishes with her mother and her strained
sexual banter with Bill. The smart, crisp writing makes up for such
lapses, as does the remarkably sharp sense of place. The rich
sights, sounds and textures of daily life in Chinatown are a
sumptuous feast for jaded palates.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Evans, the sweet-tempered constable who keeps watch over
the little Welsh village of Llanfair in a new series of cozy
mysteries by Rhys Bowen, knows little of the world and less of
women. But he proves his bravery twice over in EVAN HELP US (St.
Martin's, $21.95), first by simultaneously fending off the advances
of the local barmaid and a sexy number just arrived from
Manchester, and then by venturing to London in the course of a
murder investigation. ``I grew up in Swansea, which I always
thought of as a big city,'' he tells his sergeant, ``but it's
nothing compared to this.'' Unlike the humor in the tart country
series that M. C. Beaton sets in a quarrelsome village in the
Scottish Highlands (and which Bowen seems to be emulating here),
the jokes don't get any racier than this. The characters don't get
any more complicated either. Indeed, the pleasure of visiting
Llanfair is that nothing, not even murder, can ruffle its placid
composure.

   ``Art restoring is a vicious business,'' Iain Pears informs us
in DEATH AND RESTORATION (Scribner, $22), another gleeful excursion
into the cutthroat art world for Pears's esthete-sleuth, Jonathan
Argyll, and his companion, Flavia di Stefano, a senior investigator
for Italy's Art Theft Squad. Most of the legwork falls to Flavia
when an icon is stolen from a rundown monastery in Rome and a
French dealer (``the oldest and canniest icon man in the
business'') is discovered floating in the Tiber. This frees up
Jonathan to sprinkle his acidic wit on art experts and thieves like
Dan Menzies (``the Al Capone of restoration''), who has been
engaged by the monastery to apply his savage artistry to its
dubious Caravaggio. By anchoring his subject in a sturdy plot and
sublime setting, Pears offers more reason to delight in the
articulate characters and erudite art commentary that give his
books _ including the best-selling ``Instance of the Fingerpost'' _
their high style.

FRIENDLY FIRE
</HEADLINE>
  By Kathryn Chetkovich 
 116 pp. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press. Paper, $15.95 
 ------ 
 DUCK! 
 By ROSS FELD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kathryn Chetkovich's first collection of stories is knitted with
a very open weave. Based more on situations than plots, it spreads
out lazily rather than trace tortured lines. Chetkovich is a
sharp-eyed observer, which has a lot to do with this open feel; the
world always seems bigger when someone brings along a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical passage from the title story, a group of women are
at the end of one of their regular eat-and-schmooze evenings. The
hostess's son enters the house with some friends: ``Our hellos
chirp and bob, and Todd's uneven voice slides under them like a
shovel scraping pavement.'' Or consider this, from ``My Real
Life'': ``The song, which I had never heard before, was filled with
disorienting pauses and German lyrics, giving it the quality of an
overseas phone call with a poor connection.'' Chetkovich is
especially good about clothes, describing in ``Magic Acts'' a woman
who often looked as though she had been ``dressed by children, or
birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout ``Friendly Fire,'' Chetkovich modestly inserts
herself into her characters' wry, bright realizations. In ``Magic
Acts,'' a character riding in a car and watching the pedestrians
(``a picture of inefficiency somehow _ each person coming from a
place someone else needs to go'') is led to understand that ``being
healed does not always require finding the cure.'' Yet it's odd:
such wise, level-headed characters have a way of draining out some
of the pleasure for the reader. On an excursion with passengers who
make such effortless sense of their experiences, what's left for
you to do? Your own skills rust.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, these stories attempt to be about the decency of not
having the final, be-all-and-end-all word. They forgo brilliance
and spectacular turns. Even their sentences sometimes toggle,
wanting to stay pliable: ``I found myself wondering where he had
been tonight and who the flowers had been for. Whom.''
</P>
<P>
   The title story is illustrative. Fire here doesn't consume; it
warms in an amiable manner in a gentle, plotless evocation of
supportive women friends. The women are friends, however, very much
in the television sit-com mode: they're somehow commodified,
friends as party mix. The more nettling dimensions of their
relationships are left alone: friends who challenge, who have the
bad manners to remind you how much they remember of your failures.
</P>
<P>
   In aggregate, there's a lot of inert not-quiteness to the
situations of the characters in these stories. Friends without
claims; childless couples; grown children beginning to see their
parents fail _ all this can be poignant, but it also suggests
wheels spinning in place. Better are two stories that simply go
one-on-one, with a man and a woman more or less alone.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Damages,'' a married man's tryst is given accidental
meaning when, out with his about-to-be-mistress, he scrapes a
parked car. The woman he's with wants him to own up to the action _
to any action, really. This he's reluctantly prepared to do, but
when he knocks on the door of the house he can hear that he's
interrupting a scene of uncomplicated family happiness. He backs
away.
</P>
<P>
   In the collection's most beguiling story, ``As Needed,'' a
chance meeting on the subway leads to uncertain attraction, maybe
even love. A man flirtatiously rests his briefcase on a woman's lap
as he juggles to hold on to the overhead bar, then accidentally (or
maybe not) leaves the case behind. The woman must figure out a way
to return it.
</P>
<P>
   The story manages to wind itself around the mystery of how much
of life is scripted to desires we broadcast without even realizing
them. In doing so, both it and ``Damages'' satisfyingly edge toward
the shadows, under which they pick up weight. They're a lot more
impressive than Chetkovich's stories of plucky but becalmed social
sandwiching.

ADDIE
</HEADLINE>
  By Mary Lee Settle 
 237 pp. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press. $24.95 
 ------ 
 GRANDMA IN A TREE 
 By ANGELINE GOREAU 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early one West Virginia summer afternoon, on the cusp of the
Great Depression, Mary Lee Settle's grandmother woke her from a
porch nap with the news that ``the Catholic Church is the Whore of
Babylon in the Book of Revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   Having delivered herself of this observation, Miss Addie sat
back in her rocker and proceeded to tell 8-year-old Mary Lee her
version of a hitherto unadmitted family scandal. The story begins
with Addie's first marriage, at 15, to a very ``devil'' of a coal
miner and ends three years later with the young wife up a tree,
terrified of her drunken husband prowling below, and hearing the
voice of Jesus. ``Addie,'' He tells her, ``you are nuthin but a
damn fool. Ain't you ever heard of divorce?''
</P>
<P>
   That Mary Lee Settle, at the age of 79, has chosen to cast her
own autobiography in the form of a memoir of her grandmother seems
entirely appropriate to the writer we have come to know through her
novels. She is, famously, a restless seeker of the larger view: the
Beulah Quintet, her epic fictional investigation into the meaning
of being an American, begins with a single image of a woman lost in
the Endless Mountains and follows the consequences of that scene
first forward, then back in time.
</P>
<P>
   Settle had already published ``O Beulah Land,'' whose events
unfurl in the two decades leading up to the American Revolution,
and ``Know Nothing,'' set in the years before the Civil War, before
deciding that another novel needed to come before them. Layering
and expanding, adding forebears to explain the original characters,
she circled back, more than a decade after writing the first book,
to summon up another beginning, giving us in ``Prisons'' the
17th-century Puritans and Cavaliers whose experiences seem crucial
to an understanding of the pioneers of 18th-century Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it isn't surprising that ``Addie'' should open with
the following words: ``An autobiography that begins with one's
birth begins too late, in the middle of the story, sometimes at the
end.'' The beginning of Settle's story, then, is not necessarily
what simple chronology might suggest. Rather, it is the most
important moment, the moment from which consequences pool out in
ever-widening circles, shaping the choices made by those who come
after. As in her novels, chronology derives from meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the turning point of Settle's life comes well before her
birth, with the divorce Addie finally owns up to on that summer
afternoon in 1927 _ though the facts of the case, unearthed by her
granddaughter from court records, differ substantially from Addie's
recall. She may well have heard Jesus from the top of the tree,
advising her to seek legal redress, but she was in fact 26 years
old, not 18, and already pregnant by the man she would marry only
three years later. The child of that interstice was Mary Lee
Settle's mother. In her turn, Settle's mother would refuse to own
up to the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   The principal focus here is not, as in so much recent
autobiography, revelation or reproach. Rather, Settle is interested
in the way one understands truth by indirection. ``It had been one
of the first divorces in West Virginia, but the facts are misty,
the legends crossed, and I saw more truth if not more fact in the
way Addie told it that day,'' Settle writes. Later on in the book
she remarks that ``the false has to be weighed for its elements of
truth.'' Through all her novels, Settle returns again and again to
the subject of memory's distortions, both personal and collective.
</P>
<P>
   Addie and the grandfather in question, whom she always called
Mr. Tompkins, not only scandalized turn-of-the-century West
Virginia by their out-of-wedlock doings; they also represented an
unwelcome (socially unwelcome) grafting of classes. Mr. Tompkins
was the petted scion of local gentry and Addie the wife of a coal
miner. She had never lived in a house with more than one story.
That he was siphoning off the remains of a once-impressive fortune
into drink and horseflesh mattered little.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tompkins's relatives _ and neighbors _ conspired to freeze
Addie out, mainly by treating her as an invisible person. Mr.
Tompkins was invited to balls and weddings and dinners as before,
but hosts never made mention of his wife. Addie, with her country
ways, ``rattled their gentility.'' Mr. Tompkins's brother Charlie
even dared to cadge an invitation to freeload at their house when
he was short of cash, but noted in his letter, ``I must have your
assurance that I won't have to speak to that woman.'' According to
her granddaughter, Addie found the letter in Mr. Tompkins's office
and rushed off with it, throwing herself on a pile of laundry and
crying: ``Lord! . . . You promised that you would make my enemies
my footstool. WHEN?''
</P>
<P>
   Without Settle's careful excavation of the Tompkins family
pretensions, we could hardly appreciate the irony of the situation.
Addie's tormentor was the son of a man who began life as an
apprentice gunsmith: ``New rich only 40 years before,'' Settle
tells us, ``by the 1880's the Tompkins family were old rich. They
owned land for literally miles along the narrow valley of the
Kanawha River,'' and they ``saw themselves as gentry.'' Their
gentility, though somewhat tarnished by the defeat of the
Confederacy, was nevertheless defended by eschewing ``lace curtains
and ice water'' as well as the ``city-tacky'' ways of nouveau riche
Yankees who had dinner at night rather than the proper hour of 3
o'clock in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Their most vicious assault on Addie, however, involved removing
the corpses of their hallowed Presbyterian ancestors _ William
Tompkins and his wife _ from their Etruscan-style tomb on the
grounds of the family mansion, presumably to avoid contamination by
the low-class interloper their brother had married.
</P>
<P>
   Addie took her revenge by returning to the Church of God Holy
Rollers and wearing poke bonnets of her own manufacture.
Nevertheless, Settle remarks, ``there was a core of suffering that
Addie had been handed and she handed it on to her children as
surely as if it were part of their genes.'' Some of her suffering
was also caused by her daughter, Rachel, Settle's mother, who
cleaved ferociously to the very society that had cast out Addie.
Rachel became her mother's rival for Mr. Tompkins's affections and
attention, and secretly visited his ``nice'' relatives, religiously
taking up their pretentious ways and mythologizing the family past.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel grew up to be someone whose obsession with propriety
effectively prevented any real connection to her own daughter.
``Touch made her flesh crawl,'' Settle writes. ``I learned it early
when I fell against her by accident, half-asleep in the car when I
was 3, and she recoiled.'' It was Addie who provided real
affection, comfort, a ready ear. She shaped the core of Settle's
inner self _ the self one writes novels out of. ``What informed the
largest work that I have done, the Beulah Quintet, lay so deep
within,'' Settle tells us, ``so early sown, so dependent on Addie,
her voices, her world, that I was unconscious of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In excavating the circumstances that sent Addie up that tree to
talk to Jesus, Settle moves skillfully from the first inhabitants
of the valley to the coming of the railroads and coal mines to the
Civil War and the riots incited by Mother Jones and the Great
Depression, then turns back to herself as a young writer
discovering tea chests of pioneers' scalps in the basement of the
British Museum as she is imagining the Kanawha Valley as a
fictional place she calls Beulah Land.
</P>
<P>
   There is, as in many family stories, plenty of abuse and
betrayal, scandal, failed love, disappointed expectation. There is
even, more exceptionally, murder and suicide. But Settle's wide
empathetic grasp, her layering of context, her persistent search
for meaning put them in perspective _ they are part of the story,
but not the point.
</P>
<P>
   That she has brought her considerable skills and vision as a
novelist to the writing of autobiography is reason enough to feel
grateful. But, in addition, Mary Lee Settle has preserved for us a
moment in the South's history palpable as the trumpet vines and
rocking chairs of a long-departed front-porch afternoon.

MAX LERNER
</HEADLINE>
  Pilgrim in the Promised Land 
 By Sanford Lakoff 
 323 pp. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. $25 
 ------ 
 TABLOID PHILOSOPHER 
 By DAVID GREENBERG 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Max Lerner, who died in 1992 at 89, was a public intellectual of
the variety whose passing everyone loves to lament these days. ``It
can safely be said,'' Sanford Lakoff safely says in ``Max Lerner:
Pilgrim in the Promised Land,'' ``that no American writer in the
century wrote for as many different audiences.'' Academic and
journalist, teacher and critic, Lerner contributed to both social
science periodicals and Playboy magazine, highbrow opinion journals
and The New York Post. His erudition ranged over law, economics,
history, culture and foreign affairs _ all touched on in his 1957
magnum opus, ``America as a Civilization'' _ and he wrote regularly
into his final year.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner, however, was no boring egghead. Well into his golden
years, he caught people's fancy not just with his political columns
but with his frank embrace of the sexual revolution, frequenting
free-love communes in the early 1970's and befriending Hugh Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   A life as colorful as Lerner's poses a special challenge to a
biographer. Should you focus on the rich story of the man's
intellectual development or explore his psyche? Lakoff, a professor
emeritus of political science at the University of California, San
Diego, and a former student of Lerner's, has gamely attempted both
in his concise and thoughtful new biography. Strong as an analysis
of Lerner's ideas, it is somewhat less so as a portrait of the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trajectory of Lerner's change of political views,'' Lakoff
writes, ``is an illuminating index to the shift in thinking among
many public intellectuals in 'the American century.' '' A radical
foe of capitalism in his youth, Lerner became a spokesman for
mainstream liberalism in his middle years and a cranky
neoconservative as he aged. Lakoff doesn't challenge this common
appraisal, but he does complicate it. He argues, for example, that
Lerner, even in his youth, was drawn less to Marx than to the
sociologist Thorstein Veblen, whom he admired as ``a
tongue-in-cheek agitator, more Mencken than Lenin.'' Lakoff also
shows that if, as some have charged, Lerner was slow to acknowledge
the brutality of Stalin's Soviet Union or to see the folly of the
Vietnam War, he was prescient in calling for American entry into
World War II and recognition of Israel. Less adequately explained,
however, is the civil libertarian's embrace of anti-flag-burning
laws.
</P>
<P>
   While the book generally succeeds as intellectual biography, it
disappoints a bit as a character study. To his credit, Lakoff
recognizes the significance of his subject's private life, from the
affairs he had with his students as a young Sarah Lawrence
professor to the goings-on at the Playboy mansion. But he never
really takes us into Lerner's inner life, perhaps because he seems
never to arrive there himself. He sterilizes Lerner's
countercultural escapades by dwelling on their intellectual aspects
_ by explicating, for example, Lerner's opinions about Freud and
Norman O. Brown. Topics such as Lerner's second marriage or his
relationship with his children get only passing attention,
depriving us of seeing critical sides of Lerner's personality.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the dangerous territory of the links between private
behavior and public persona, Lakoff lays out a plausible
correlation between his subject's intellectual and sexual ardors;
both, he suggests, grew out of the same craving for experience.
``In my own case,'' he quotes Lerner as writing, ``the hunger for
erotic acceptance, still unsated, and the impulse to storm the city
and conquer the domain of ideas and letters . . . were connected in
a circuit.'' For Lerner, as for Freud, eros was a life force. And a
key to understanding this most ambitious and vital of public
intellectuals is appreciating his intense and passionate engagement
with the world.

   1. LICENSE TO KILL : OSAMA BIN LADEN'S DECLARATION OF JIHAD A
little-noticed declaration of jihad by Osama Bin Laden in an Arabic
newspaper underscores the Islamist's main grievance : infidel U.S.
troops in Arabia. By Bernard Lewis. From Foreign Affairs magazine.
2,500 words. 2. ISRAEL AFTER HEROISM Israel turned 50 with a
midlife crisis. The peace process, though flagging, is still
pushing Israelis closer to a reckoning with the Palestinians, their
original rivals for the land. Americanization is giving a country
built by austere pioneers an identity crisis. Tensions between
religious and secular are increasingly bitter, and even the army no
longer unites Israelis the way it used to. As the myths fade,
Israel is deciding whether a Jewish state can ever truly be normal.
By Eliot A. Cohen. From Foreign Affairs magazine. 1,500 words. 3.
THE TESTING OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY We recommend the following
series, adapted from ``The Testing of American Foreign Policy,'' by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, from Foreign Affairs
magazine : Part I: RULES OF THE ROAD FOR AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY
Part II: SANCTIONS ARE JUST ONE TOOL Part III: FIVE MAJOR TESTS OF
AMERICAN LEADERSHIP Part IV: FREEDOM IS AMERICA'S PURPOSE Please
contact us for more details. 4. From NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW A.
BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY : Robert Bly (author of the best-selling
``Iron John'') and Jungian analyst Marion Woodman want men to
explore the feminine and vice versa. Karen Lehrman reviews their
book ``The Maiden King : The Reunion of Masculine and Feminine.''
B. THE PLAGUE THAT CHANGED MINDS : So far, Andrew Sullivan says in
his book ``Love Undetectable: Notes on Friendships, Sex and
Survival,'' AIDS has conferred greater dignity on gay people and
more compassion on others. Review by Andrew Delbanco.

ANTI-ANXIETY DRUGS MAY INCREASE DRIVING ACCIDENT RISK Drivers
taking some of the most commonly prescribed anti-anxiety drugs
significantly increase their risk of being in a car crash,
according to a new study. The researchers estimate that drivers who
use some of these drugs increase their risk of being in an accident
by about 50%. They conclude that patients should not drive while
they are using these medications. By Michael McCarthy. The Lancet
News Service. 1,000 words.

PLACEBOS PROVE SO POWERFUL EVEN EXPERTS ARE SURPRISED Scientists
are uncovering a host of biological mechanisms that can turn a
thought, belief or desire into an agent of change in cells, tissues
and organs. They are exploring the spooky fact that much of human
perception is based not on information flowing into the brain from
the outside world, but what the brain, based on previous
experience, expects to happen next. By Sandra Blakeslee. New York
Times Science Times. 1,950 words + graphic. 7. SCHOOLDAYS IN THE
COMPUTER ROOM In the Golden Age of ASCII, kids could be king,
writes David S. Bennahum. ``In the school computer room, all the
worries of the real world faded away, replaced by the exhilaration
of the quest, a gleeful sense of discovery, and the joy of being
best at something.'' From Wired magazine. 1,500 words. (N/A Japan.)
8. IS THE PRIORITY PEACE OR RIGID JUSTICE? The instinctive reaction
to word that Chile's Augusto Pinochet has been arrested in London
and faces extradition for crimes against humanity is : good, at
least one bloody dictator can be held to account. But it isn't a
simple issue, and the simple answer can have very bad consequences.
By Flora Lewis. 800 words.

VITAL SIGNS: SNOWED ``They came to the hospital emergency room
within days of each other. Each patient was young, well-dressed and
employed. The illness they shared was simple, in a sense, but not
straightforward ... `` Tony Dajer writes about treating abusers of
the drug cocaine. From Discover magazine. 1,200 words + photo.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: There's hope yet for prudes in Congress on sex
policies
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never mind what its members may do off-camera, you'd be
hard-pressed to find a riper bunch of public prudes than those of
the Congress of the United States. Congress is the home of
hair-trigger moral indignation, with ready rules for how other
people ought to live their sex lives. (Which is hardly at all.
Congress is the anti-Kama Sutra.)
</P>
<P>
   Count it, then, a notable breakthrough that Congress, after
years of pointedly refusing to do so, has ordered that the health
insurance of female federal employees cover contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be a long-overdue twitch toward policies that can
accelerate the drop in teen pregnancy and lower the abortion rate?
There is more cause to hope so than to think so, but hope is at
least something.
</P>
<P>
   Even this minor concession required months of backstage
scurrying and had to overcome the efforts of Republican leadership
to quash it. Too, the change prospered in no small part because
gentlemen legislators who were not about to forbid Viagra coverage
found themselves shamed into covering contraceptives for women, but
the double-standard argument isn't elastic enough to stretch over
very many related policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   More encouraging, the House vote found a few anti-abortion
lawmakers trying out a pro-contraceptive stand.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-choice folks have argued for years, to scant effect, that
birth control ought to be common ground for both sides of the
abortion issue. If more anti-abortion legislators can now be
persuaded to decouple abortion and birth control, the way would lie
open for properly treating sex, for policy purposes, as a public
health issue.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially so in the matter of teen pregnancies, where we
appear poised to make dramatic gains if we wish to.
</P>
<P>
   The teen pregnancy rate has dropped to its lowest point since
1975, a decline of 14 percent since 1990. Teens are having sex a
bit later, less often and with fewer partners. And many more are
using birth control. The percentage of teenage girls who use
contraceptives at their first intercourse has jumped from 48 to 78
since the early '80s. New long-lasting injected or implanted
contraceptives are making a big difference for the better,
especially with minority teens.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. teen pregnancy rate is still about five times west
Europe's. That, according to a recent study for Advocates for Youth
by the University of North Carolina, is because west Europe
provides open, unembarrassed access to information and
contraceptives, with explicit instruction on responsible sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its timid gesture on health insurance, Congress
continues funding family planning clinics at levels far below
inflation, directly funds only abstinence programs for teens and
this year for the first time dangerously let legislation escape
from committee that would require parental consent for teen
contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Congress continues to suspect that it alone stands between the
American people and sexual incontinence. Hey, wait a minute. Isn't
narcissism a sin? Or at least a vice?

   GULF-SYNDROME (Undated) _ A little-noticed provision in the new
federal budget may give Gulf War veterans the answers to the
mysterious health ailments that have plagued them since the 1991

exposure. By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN.

   STREHLI-MUSIC- PROFILE (Houston) _ The B.B. King song title

   WILLIAMS-FILM-PROFILE (Toronto) _ When actor and poet Saul
Williams entered the prison where much of ``Slam'' was filmed, he
got a warning: Stick close to the guards. ``The first thing the

Rice is tied with Art Monk for most consecutive games with at least
one reception, at 183. With 78 touchdown catches as a combination,

   ``JOHN FRANKENHEIMER TESTS HIS METTLE WITH `RONIN.''' From W
magazine. One B&AMP;W photo. Director John Frankenheimer is
refreshingly forthright about the ups and downs of his
motion-picture career: It peaked with such major films as ``All
Fall Down,'' ``Birdman of Alcatraz,'' ``The Manchurian Candidate,''
``Seven Days in May'' and ``Black Sunday,'' and then went into a
slow decline over the last two decades. In recent years, the
downturn was reversed by an unlikely savior: cable television. Now,
Frankenheimer will test his mettle on the big screen once again
with the film ``Ronin,'' starring Robert De Niro, Jonathan Pryce,
Jean Reno and Natasha McElhone. An interview.

   ``JOHN FRANKENHEIMER TESTS HIS METTLE WITH `RONIN.''' From W
magazine. One B&AMP;W photo. Director John Frankenheimer is
refreshingly forthright about the ups and downs of his
motion-picture career: It peaked with such major films as ``All
Fall Down,'' ``Birdman of Alcatraz,'' ``The Manchurian Candidate,''
``Seven Days in May'' and ``Black Sunday,'' and then went into a
slow decline over the last two decades. In recent years, the
downturn was reversed by an unlikely savior: cable television. Now,
Frankenheimer will test his mettle on the big screen once again
with the film ``Ronin,'' starring Robert De Niro, Jonathan Pryce,
Jean Reno and Natasha McElhone. An interview.

ZIPPY CHIPPY GOES FOR RECORD IN FUTILITY STAKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moved in ``a'' news file.) 
(th) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARMINGTON, N.Y. _ No one here seems to understand why Zippy
Chippy cannot win a race.
</P>
<P>
   Zippy has pedigree: he's a grandson of Northern Dancer, who won
the Kentucky Derby and Preakness in 1964. He has spirit: at the end
of a losing race, he will prance cockily and spin around as if it
were he who belonged in the winner's circle. He has drive: he has
finished second 6 times and third 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   He just cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, at Finger Lakes Race Track here, he tied the
American thoroughbred record for futility by losing his 85th race
without ever having tasted the proverbial thrill of victory. Even
that dubious feat has not deterred his owner and trainer, Felix
Monserrate.
</P>
<P>
   As fervent as Mark McGwire was in his pursuit of a diametrically
different record, Monserrate wants to try yet again, risking the
possibility that Zippy Chippy could be crowned the losingest horse
of all time.
</P>
<P>
   But during the last two weeks Monserrate has been unable to find
a track willing to let Zippy Chippy race. Even Zippy's usual
jockey, Benny Afanador, has told Monserrate he no longer wants to
ride Zippy because the horse ``is making me look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   What has made Zippy particularly resistible of late is the
embarrassing problem he has had in those last three races, a
problem known as dwelling. When the starting gates have snapped
open, Zippy has lingered for crucial seconds, letting the other
horses get a jump on him before he takes off.
</P>
<P>
   In his last race, on Sept. 8, he finished 37-and-a-half lengths
behind the winner and so angered the stewards who police the
track's racing integrity that they banned him from ever running at
Finger Lakes again. ``It's for the protection of the public,'' said
Rick Coyne, the Finger Lakes Racing Association steward.
</P>
<P>
   Monserrate is as baffled as anyone about why Zippy Chippy
dawdles at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to figure it out,'' said Monserrate, who has
been in the horse racing business since he came to the United
States from Puerto Rico in 1963. ``The horse likes to run. It's not
a horse that's unhappy. It's happy all the time. He bites you. He
plays around all the time. He's a regular horse like everybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Zippy is as much a topic of conversation at
Finger Lakes Race Track as Monica Lewinsky is in Washington. He has
cultivated a sentimental following of bettors who have thrown away
their money in mankind's timeless romance with underdogs and lost
causes. One member of this fan club wore a T-shirt that said
``Zippy Chippy My Favorite.'' Another asked Monserrate to sign a
color newspaper picture of Zippy so she could give it to her
grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people here wish he would keep running,'' said Bob
O'Connor, a Brooklyn-bred lawyer who was drinking a glass of beer
at the race track's lounge. ``There aren't many things of interest
here, and Zippy is of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Finger Lakes course, in the rolling countryside 20 miles
southeast of Rochester, is an off-the-beaten-track kind of track,
with far smaller purses than celebrated ovals like Belmont Park and
far fewer noble steeds.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has held as many as 11,000 fans, Finger Lakes ekes
by in the era of off-track betting with weekday crowds of a
thousand or so, many of them retirees who watch the races on
television sets in the smoky betting areas under the grandstand. It
has a languid atmosphere perfectly suited to a hapless horse like
Zippy.
</P>
<P>
   Many bettors, including people of moderate means like Priscilla
Grabowski, a Cornell University receptionist, own a horse or two,
knowing that their hobby is affordable as long as the horses win a
few races a year to pay roughly $10,000 a year for training and
upkeep. So it is understandable that fans have affection for a
horse with heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horses are like people,'' said Ms. Grabowski, who has a
3-year-old filly, Go and Goodbye. ``They don't feel like running
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Zippy is a homely 7-year-old gelding with dark bay coloring and
a face as guileless as a toddler's who has just taken a bite out of
the perfectly frosted cake meant for guests. He behaves well,
Monserrate said, eats regularly and in recent workouts has run
respectable times and has broken from the gate. But something seems
to happen in actual races.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three times, he wants to see the horses out in front
and then he goes after them,'' Monserrate said.
</P>
<P>
   Like his horse, Monserrate is something of a race track
character. A slightly built man of 53, he started work as an
exercise hand at Belmont Park in Nassau County and at tracks in the
Miami area.
</P>
<P>
   Monserrate came to Finger Lakes 15 years ago to work as a
trainer for Scardino USA stables and acquired Zippy in 1995 from a
trainer who swapped the horse for Monserrate's battered white Ford
van. Three years ago, he tried to sell Zippy but found no takers.
Riding stables, he said, found Zippy too temperamental for handling
children, and horse show organizers were put off by Zippy's looks,
which Monserrate's wife, Emily, describes as ``drab and plain.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Monserrate has grown so fond of Zippy that he says, ``There
is no money in the world to buy Zippy Chippy from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Through second- and third-place finishes, Zippy has earned his
owners a lifetime total of $28,157. Monserrate calculates that
Zippy has paid for his feed and upkeep _ the owner does not pay
himself trainer fees _ and has been to his family ``like a pet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can be a winner all the time,'' he said. ``I don't want
somebody to kill him and take him to the glue factory. To me, a
horse is like family.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, the Zippy Chippy fan, says that at tracks in and
around New York City, a horse named The Boz'n has lost 66 races but
has earned $118,353 in second-, third- and fourth-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it may not be a good idea to bet him,'' O'Connor said,
``it's not a bad idea to own him.''
</P>
<P>
   Monserrate also knows something about the other two horses that
lost 85 races in a row: Gussie Mae and Really a Tenor. Howard Bass,
a manager at Thoroughbred Racing Communications, an industry
information group, says that both horses won their 86th starts,
Gussie Mae in 1995 at Atlantic City and Really a Tenor in 1990 at
River Downs in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the odds of two horses winning their 86th races after
losing 85?'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   Monserrate may be having trouble finding a track willing to let
Zippy run because there has been some publicity, including a
humorous spot on the Comedy Central cable channel. Monserrate is
hoping there may be less reluctance out of state. Although
Philadelphia Park has turned him down, racing officials at Penn
National outside Harrisburg, Pa., have not given him a definite no.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely, though, that Zippy will run _ eventually. Larry
Swartzlander, the general manager of Eureka Downs in Eureka, Kan.,
has invited Monserrate to bring Zippy out for the 10-week season
that starts next May. Swartzlander thinks Zippy could provide a
challenge for older maidens _ horses that like Zippy have never won
a race _ and he is not too worried about Zippy's dwelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse could be a little rank,'' he said, explaining that
some horses sour on racing and need to take a sabbatical. ``If you
do something routinely, you can get a little fed up with it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Zippy does not succeed as a racer, Swartzlander is willing to
buy him because he thinks he would make a good jumper for horse
shows. He may also realize that a horse who holds the national
record for losing races holds a kind of perverse public appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Monserrate is not ready to part with Zippy, who, he says,
continues to teach him some valuable horse sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that you can never be sure a horse is going to do
exactly what you want it to do,'' he said. ``By the time you think
you're going to win a race, the horse goes bad. In the racing
business, nothing is ever sure.''

<P>
   FARMINGTON, N.Y. _ No one here seems to understand why Zippy
Chippy cannot win a race.
</P>
<P>
   Zippy has pedigree: he's a grandson of Northern Dancer, who won
the Kentucky Derby and Preakness in 1964. He has spirit: at the end
of a losing race, he will prance cockily and spin around as if it
were he who belonged in the winner's circle. He has drive: he has
finished second 6 times and third 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   He just cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, at Finger Lakes Race Track here, he tied the
American thoroughbred record for futility by losing his 85th race
without ever having tasted the proverbial thrill of victory. Even
that dubious feat has not deterred his owner and trainer, Felix
Monserrate.
</P>
<P>
   As fervent as Mark McGwire was in his pursuit of a diametrically
different record, Monserrate wants to try yet again, risking the
possibility that Zippy Chippy could be crowned the losingest horse
of all time.
</P>
<P>
   But during the last two weeks Monserrate has been unable to find
a track willing to let Zippy Chippy race. Even Zippy's usual
jockey, Benny Afanador, has told Monserrate he no longer wants to
ride Zippy because the horse ``is making me look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   What has made Zippy particularly resistible of late is the
embarrassing problem he has had in those last three races, a
problem known as dwelling. When the starting gates have snapped
open, Zippy has lingered for crucial seconds, letting the other
horses get a jump on him before he takes off.
</P>
<P>
   In his last race, on Sept. 8, he finished 37-and-a-half lengths
behind the winner and so angered the stewards who police the
track's racing integrity that they banned him from ever running at
Finger Lakes again. ``It's for the protection of the public,'' said
Rick Coyne, the Finger Lakes Racing Association steward.
</P>
<P>
   Monserrate is as baffled as anyone about why Zippy Chippy
dawdles at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to figure it out,'' said Monserrate, who has
been in the horse racing business since he came to the United
States from Puerto Rico in 1963. ``The horse likes to run. It's not
a horse that's unhappy. It's happy all the time. He bites you. He
plays around all the time. He's a regular horse like everybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Zippy is as much a topic of conversation at
Finger Lakes Race Track as Monica Lewinsky is in Washington. He has
cultivated a sentimental following of bettors who have thrown away
their money in mankind's timeless romance with underdogs and lost
causes. One member of this fan club wore a T-shirt that said
``Zippy Chippy My Favorite.'' Another asked Monserrate to sign a
color newspaper picture of Zippy so she could give it to her
grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people here wish he would keep running,'' said Bob
O'Connor, a Brooklyn-bred lawyer who was drinking a glass of beer
at the race track's lounge. ``There aren't many things of interest
here, and Zippy is of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Finger Lakes course, in the rolling countryside 20 miles
southeast of Rochester, is an off-the-beaten-track kind of track,
with far smaller purses than celebrated ovals like Belmont Park and
far fewer noble steeds.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has held as many as 11,000 fans, Finger Lakes ekes
by in the era of off-track betting with weekday crowds of a
thousand or so, many of them retirees who watch the races on
television sets in the smoky betting areas under the grandstand. It
has a languid atmosphere perfectly suited to a hapless horse like
Zippy.
</P>
<P>
   Many bettors, including people of moderate means like Priscilla
Grabowski, a Cornell University receptionist, own a horse or two,
knowing that their hobby is affordable as long as the horses win a
few races a year to pay roughly $10,000 a year for training and
upkeep. So it is understandable that fans have affection for a
horse with heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horses are like people,'' said Ms. Grabowski, who has a
3-year-old filly, Go and Goodbye. ``They don't feel like running
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Zippy is a homely 7-year-old gelding with dark bay coloring and
a face as guileless as a toddler's who has just taken a bite out of
the perfectly frosted cake meant for guests. He behaves well,
Monserrate said, eats regularly and in recent workouts has run
respectable times and has broken from the gate. But something seems
to happen in actual races.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three times, he wants to see the horses out in front
and then he goes after them,'' Monserrate said.
</P>
<P>
   Like his horse, Monserrate is something of a race track
character. A slightly built man of 53, he started work as an
exercise hand at Belmont Park in Nassau County and at tracks in the
Miami area.
</P>
<P>
   Monserrate came to Finger Lakes 15 years ago to work as a
trainer for Scardino USA stables and acquired Zippy in 1995 from a
trainer who swapped the horse for Monserrate's battered white Ford
van. Three years ago, he tried to sell Zippy but found no takers.
Riding stables, he said, found Zippy too temperamental for handling
children, and horse show organizers were put off by Zippy's looks,
which Monserrate's wife, Emily, describes as ``drab and plain.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Monserrate has grown so fond of Zippy that he says, ``There
is no money in the world to buy Zippy Chippy from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Through second- and third-place finishes, Zippy has earned his
owners a lifetime total of $28,157. Monserrate calculates that
Zippy has paid for his feed and upkeep _ the owner does not pay
himself trainer fees _ and has been to his family ``like a pet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can be a winner all the time,'' he said. ``I don't want
somebody to kill him and take him to the glue factory. To me, a
horse is like family.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, the Zippy Chippy fan, says that at tracks in and
around New York City, a horse named The Boz'n has lost 66 races but
has earned $118,353 in second-, third- and fourth-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it may not be a good idea to bet him,'' O'Connor said,
``it's not a bad idea to own him.''
</P>
<P>
   Monserrate also knows something about the other two horses that
lost 85 races in a row: Gussie Mae and Really a Tenor. Howard Bass,
a manager at Thoroughbred Racing Communications, an industry
information group, says that both horses won their 86th starts,
Gussie Mae in 1995 at Atlantic City and Really a Tenor in 1990 at
River Downs in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the odds of two horses winning their 86th races after
losing 85?'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   Monserrate may be having trouble finding a track willing to let
Zippy run because there has been some publicity, including a
humorous spot on the Comedy Central cable channel. Monserrate is
hoping there may be less reluctance out of state. Although
Philadelphia Park has turned him down, racing officials at Penn
National outside Harrisburg, Pa., have not given him a definite no.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely, though, that Zippy will run _ eventually. Larry
Swartzlander, the general manager of Eureka Downs in Eureka, Kan.,
has invited Monserrate to bring Zippy out for the 10-week season
that starts next May. Swartzlander thinks Zippy could provide a
challenge for older maidens _ horses that like Zippy have never won
a race _ and he is not too worried about Zippy's dwelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse could be a little rank,'' he said, explaining that
some horses sour on racing and need to take a sabbatical. ``If you
do something routinely, you can get a little fed up with it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Zippy does not succeed as a racer, Swartzlander is willing to
buy him because he thinks he would make a good jumper for horse
shows. He may also realize that a horse who holds the national
record for losing races holds a kind of perverse public appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Monserrate is not ready to part with Zippy, who, he says,
continues to teach him some valuable horse sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that you can never be sure a horse is going to do
exactly what you want it to do,'' he said. ``By the time you think
you're going to win a race, the horse goes bad. In the racing
business, nothing is ever sure.''

BIG BOARD POSTS A 1.4 PERCENT DROP IN ITS UNCOVERED SHORT SALES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Open positions on the New York Stock Exchange fell by
1.4 percent last month, to 4.15 billion shares, the exchange
reported Wednesday. On the smaller American Stock Exchange,
uncovered short sales decreased by 4 percent, to 195.4 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Open positions of short sales are those shares that have been
borrowed and sold, but not yet covered by repurchase. If the share
price falls, an investor can profit by buying shares at a lower
price to replace the borrowed ones.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, the short interest figure for the month ended
Oct. 13 was equal to 1.7 percent of the total shares listed on the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Dutch Petroleum shares had the largest increase in short
interest on the Big Board. The number of shares sold short totaled
41.4 million, compared with 6.5 million the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest decrease in Big Board short interest was for shares
of Tyco International Ltd., which fell to 8.4 million, from 26.7
million the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in the short position in a company's shares may
indicate a rise in bearish sentiment among investors toward that
company. But a short position could also increase because of
complex trading strategies, especially those related to arbitrage
activity. &QL;

 &HT;    `If my movie could be accused of anything, it's being overly
sentimental'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A modern fable-maker responsible for ``Big'' and ``Dave,''
screenwriter Gary Ross, 42, turned to directing for his
comedy-drama ``Pleasantville.'' It's the tale of twin 1990s
siblings, played by Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon, who get
zapped into a cardigan-and-warm-milk '50s sitcom called
``Pleasantville,'' where their new ``parents'' are Joan Allen in a
Donna Reed dress and William H. Macy as a father who may not know
best but expects his dinner to be waiting. Introducing '90s
attitude (and a little sex) into the black-and-white landscape, the
youngsters bring color to the town ... and suspicion to those who
don't like for things to change. Ross recently spoke to Cox writer
Steve Murray about his movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the seed for a story about two '90s kids getting
stuck in a '50s TV show?
</P>
<P>
   A: I grew up on this stuff, like a lot of people did. But my dad
(Arthur A. Ross) was a blacklisted screenwriter, so my view of the
'50s was different from other people's. It was this idealized time
that I longed for too, with these perfectly manicured hedges and
white picket fences and everyone was happy.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't a utopia by any means. Listen, how many drop
drills did they have in ``Ozzie and Harriet''? You didn't have that
episode where Ozzie and Harriet took Ricky and David to the bomb
shelter and told them how they would live if there was nuclear
fallout. Isn't it wild that we grew up with this specter of
annihilation, and at the same time believed in this happy
patriarchy that underscored this illusion of permanence? There
couldn't be two more disparate messages, really. ...
</P>
<P>
   Then (in the 1980s), when that sort of nostalgia was evoked as a
solution for our problems, ``a kinder, gentler'' time or ``building
a bridge'' to the past _ all those bromides struck me as false or
hollow. At the same time, it was really seductive and appealing.
Memory makes things perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Knowing that your father was blacklisted explains the
witch-hunt elements in the second half of ``Pleasantville.''
</P>
<P>
   A: He wrote ``Creature From the Black Lagoon,'' ``The Creature
Walks Among Us,'' ``Brubaker,'' ``The Great Race,'' and he used to
do a lot of television. Thousands of people were blacklisted in the
'50s and early '60s. He was never a member of the Communist Party,
and felt they were stupid. But he was involved in liberal causes,
which was enough to make you lose work. The blacklist was very
fluid. I learned more about the pain it caused much more
retrospectively. But it's not like I grew up in Nazi Germany. I
lived a very happy life as a kid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think ``Pleasantville'' is especially timely now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure; don't you? Maybe six months ago, the way it flirts with
issues of tyranny and oppression might have seemed more abstract.
But whatever you think of Bill Clinton's behavior, we're very close
to reversing the constitutional process, albeit through a
constitutional mechanism. And 67 percent of Americans say they
don't want that to happen. I think beneath a lot of the
Clinton-Starr tug of war is a real morals debate. If this had been
littering he'd lied about under oath, I'm not sure any of this
would be going on. It's a puritanical backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your movie is a Garden of Eden parable, really. Whose
painting is that you use in the movie, of Adam and Eve?
</P>
<P>
   A: Masaccio, ``The Expulsion of Adam and Eve From the Garden,''
from a fresco in the Brancacci Chapel in Florence. It's the first
time anybody painted with a single light source, the first
realistic figures, and the full perspective. Masaccio literally
means ``messy little one,'' and he was a pure consumed artist who
traveled around. He was like Pig Pen in ``Peanuts.'' And he only
lived to 24. I lived in Florence for a while, and that was a
favorite painting of mine, because it was the start of the
Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's interesting how sex plays such a catalyst in the movie,
for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   A: I tried very hard to not stack the deck. But there are
consequences. Joan (Allen's character) is in turmoil when she turns
into color for the first time. She's not liberated and joyous _
that would have been the postcoital beach montage. There's conflict
and strife and prices to be paid. I think that, beyond a statement
about diversity or tolerance or racism or sexism or fascism, what
the movie says is that real feelings are worth the messy reality
that comes with them. Even if they unlock frightening things, it's
better than living in a bland utopia. These days we avoid feelings
through cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And irony, too.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's so on-the-nail. People use irony as if being against
something is the same as having a viewpoint. It keeps you totally
safe and doesn't force you to commit. You're defending yourself
against your own hope and disappointment. If we're edgy and cynical
and distant and hip, somehow we're safe. But we're being hurt every
day for what we're missing, for not addressing these longings.
</P>
<P>
   I think culturally what happens is that we pour stuff out into
the culture, we put out a cynical message, and the public reacts
cynically. I think if you make an attempt to break that cycle and
engage people emotionally, their beliefs, desires or idealism, its
funny how fast that cycle can break. If my movie could be accused
of anything, it's being overly sentimental. (He laughs.) But that's
something I'm willing to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This was J.T. Walsh's last movie. That's a loss.
</P>
<P>
   A: He was phenomenal. He brought something special to every
movie he was in. I'm glad it's a final performance people look at
and notice. J.T. was very hard on himself as an actor, anguished in
some ways. You'd think someone that consummately talented would be
secure. But he gnashed about it. That was sort of his process. He
described the movie better than anybody else. He said these kids
(Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) were like the sand in the
oyster, because out of the irritation they brought finally came a
pearl.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what do you do for fun?
</P>
<P>
   A: I haven't had much fun in the past year. My wife is always on
me. It's my mantra: ``When the movie's over, when the movie's
over.'' I have two little kids; they're 3, so they're a huge amount
of fun. I have twins, a boy and a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Just like Tobey and Reese in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, when I found out I was having twins, I decided to make
the brother and sister in the script be twins. My kids are
literally the same age as the movie.

 &HT;    `Apt Pupil' director Bryan Singer is committed to original ideas
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas -- If anyone has doubted the cultlike fascination
that ``The Usual Suspects'' exerted on a generation of teenage and
twentysomething film dweebs, they need only to have witnessed a
recent scene in the lobby of a local theater after the screening of
Bryan Singer's latest flick, ``Apt Pupil.'' The dweebs _ starry
eyes, goatees, baseballs caps and all _ were out in force, pinning
against a table the lionized director.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happens when you're an impossibly young and hugely
successful director of hip, violent and overly clever crime
thrillers. This is what happened to Quentin Tarantino. And, a
little later, what happened to the 32-year-old Singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Usual Suspects,'' filmed when Singer was 28, was a solid
box office success and landed its screenwriter, Christopher
McQuarrie, and supporting actor Kevin Spacey Academy Awards in
1995. Its stylish bravado _ testosteronic bloodletting, flashy
visuals, hairpin structure _ marked the arrival of an audacious new
filmmaker. (Singer's first feature was ``Public Access,'' in 1992.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Apt Pupil,'' opening today, is Singer's long-awaited
follow-up. It's a creepy thriller based on a Stephen King novella
about a teenager (Brad Renfro) who blackmails an elderly Nazi war
criminal named Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellen), who has been living
incognito in town. The screenplay is by first-time scripter Brandon
Boyce.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Singer, a diminutive man who looks no
older than many of his fans, spoke about his work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What attracted you to ``Apt Pupil''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, the idea that this awful thing that happened so long
ago, the way Stephen King viewed it as a collective evil, almost
like a golem, almost like a monster in itself and how it crept
through the decades into contemporary society. That interested me,
and how it manifested itself in this young boy through (the
character) Dussander. I found that fascinating. It was a real
horror film as opposed to a supernatural one, though I do love
supernatural horror films. My favorite horror film is by far ``The
Exorcist.'' This is a horror film to me; a more psychological
horror film. If you had to coin a new phrase, you could perhaps
call it a ``social horror film.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think it's risky at this point in your career to
continue to work with first-time writers?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have faith in people and my ability to work with writers. I
work very closely with writers from Page One. I think Brandon
exhibited himself well in the prose he had written and his overall
intelligence as a human being, and I had faith that he could write
the script. Ultimately he wrote some scenes and we did some work
together on spec so we could establish that it was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You knew Brandon before this?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've known Brandon since he was 11 years old. He was my
family's paper boy. He was delivering newspapers one day, and we
struck up a friendship when I was very young. We fell out of touch
for about six years when he moved, and then he popped up at USC
while I was attending school there. We ran into each other in a
dining hall and we struck up a more real friendship and have been
friends ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does your upcoming movie ``The X-Men'' fit into your
vision ?
</P>
<P>
   A: Again, it's a very original idea and original concept and a
very effective and important one. It's all about the
disenfranchised, people who are looking for an identity, a place in
the world, and are trying to find it amidst prejudice. I think it's
an important concept, yet it's presented in a comic book universe,
which allows it to reach so many young people, and that's a key
audience for that kind of ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any idea where you're going with your career,
what kind of body of work you're trying to forge?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just original movies, original ideas. When I say ``original''
I don't mean my ideas, I mean things we haven't seen before. Now,
they may incorporate things we have seen before _ we've seen film
noir, we've seen bits and pieces of this movie. But the idea of a
child blackmailing a Nazi to hear of his past, or the idea of five
criminals who end up being the figment of some guy's perpetuation
of his own myth, or X-Men, a group of reluctant superheroes _ you
know, they're all very unique, very special. They're not cast from
molds that we've seen before.

 &HT;    Love story unfolds in full gloom
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The meet-cute tradition of Hollywood love stories has nothing on
the real-life introduction of British painter Francis Bacon (Derek
Jacobi) and George Dyer (Daniel Craig). A part-time burglar, Dyer
plunges through Bacon's skylight into his studio. Instead of
calling the police, Bacon tells the intruder to take off his
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   He does, beginning the affair that is the focus of ``Love Is the
Devil.'' Writer-director John Maybury's dissection of the
sadomasochistic power dynamic between working-class Dyer and
upper-class Bacon offers the thesis that the painter's life was as
violent, dark and haunted as one of his ``Screaming Pope''
canvases.
</P>
<P>
   The film unfolds as a flashback after Dyer's death, as memories
of the relationship hit Bacon ``like a bomb exploding in reverse
... a cruel pastiche of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   We see Bacon having his burglar lover tailored for a proper
wardrobe, then squiring him like a prize into the Colony Club, the
bar where all his art cronies hang out. As Bacon puts it in typical
sardonic fashion, ``Welcome to the concentration of camp.'' In this
den of swinging '60s archness, Dyer the boy-toy lug doesn't stand a
chance. Even in the couple's happier days, one friend cracks, ``If
they're getting on, they're unhappy _ that's what love means.'' And
when Dyer tells Bacon he loves him, the artist snaps, ``Where do
you get your slogans from, George, off the television?''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship is a car crash waiting to happen. It's no
coincidence that Bacon happily recalls ``the beauty of it'' when he
once saw an upturned vehicle on the road, necklaced with bodies,
blood and shattered glass. He also likes to giggle, watching the
bloody Odessa Steps sequence of ``The Battleship Potemkin.''
</P>
<P>
   That Bacon is the submissive partner in bed but the ruthless
dominant in the world is the movie's most compelling paradox. But
``Love Is the Devil'' doesn't bother with easy psychologizing, much
less traditional biographical narrative. Maybury seems to
understand that there's something iconic and inexplicable about the
Bacon-Dyer dynamic. It's something we've seen before in other
doomed-from-the-start couples in which one was famous, the other
not (Joe Orton and Kenneth Halliwell or Tennessee Williams and
Frank Merlo).
</P>
<P>
   Without using any of Bacon's actual work in the film, Maybury
creates claustrophobic tableaux that recall Bacon's diptychs and
triptychs. He shoots through distorting bottles and glasses, or off
warped metallic surfaces. Many of the supporting actors seem chosen
for their asymmetrical or cubist features. Through shock cuts, slow
motion and pixilation, the film creates a fragmented nihilistic
mood that matches the visceral impact of Bacon's work. ``Love'' has
something in common with another new release, ``Pleasantville.''
Both movies are visual wonders (in very different ways) that
compensate for ellipses in the script.
</P>
<P>
   Maybury's movie loses steam after its first hour. After limning
the airless, excessive lives of Bacon and Dyer, it never deepens
into a more complex, probing portrait. The movie lives up to its
subtitle: ``Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon.'' It's a searing
fragment, but incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Scrubbing his teeth with bleach and streaking shoe polish into
his hair, Jacobi delivers a daring performance as a queen with
sharp fangs (Bacon is dubbed ``her ladyship'' by his circle). Like
his turn as Claudius in ``Hamlet,'' this is one of Jacobi's key
performances, pitched between monstrosity and guilt. Craig matches
his pyrotechnics with a performance that summons sympathy from
Dyer's inarticulate presence, in Bacon's word ``a combination of
amorality and innocence.'' The supporting characters seem to blur
together in a funhouse haze, which seems to be intentional.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely not for all tastes, ``Love Is the Devil'' works as an
homage to Bacon's world view. It's rivetingly, beautifully
grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Is the Devil''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Derek Jacobi and Daniel Craig. Written and directed by
John Maybury. Unrated, but contains violence, frontal nudity,
simulated sex, substance abuse and profanity. Lefont Plaza. 1 hour,
30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: As rivetingly dark, cruel and untidy as one of
Francis Bacon's paintings.

 &HT;    Morehouse graduate snares breakout role
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're looking for some close-to-the-bone reality in a movie,
you can't get much better than Saul Williams' prison-yard scene in
``Slam,'' the breakout film from this year's Sundance Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a poet jailed for drug possession, Williams disarms a
menacing gang of fellow inmates by launching into one of the
high-charged verbal riffs that, in real life, won the Morehouse
College(Ga.) graduate the 1996 Grand Slam Championship at New
York's spoken-word mecca, Nuyorican Poets Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Director Marc Levin recruited 16 prisoners to work with Williams
on the scene, and got permission to shoot in the jail recreation
yard for two days. On the first day, that meant the other prisoners
weren't allowed to come out of their cells. On Day Two, the warden
allowed everyone out while Levin and Williams shot the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say some of these guys weren't too happy about having
missed their rec time the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The warden ``didn't tell the other people we were shooting a
film,'' Williams says on a recent visit to Atlanta. ``She just
said, `This camera's out there, and if you don't want to be shot,
stay against the wall.' Pretty soon they figured out the camera was
following me.'' (If you watch this scene in the movie, you can see
a prisoner make a vulgar gesture at the lens.)
</P>
<P>
   When the time came for Williams to be surrounded by the gang,
more than the 16 recruited guys converged on the actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really scared, because there was so much adrenalin
already,'' Williams recalls. ``I'd pumped myself up about the power
of the word. I knew they would stop.'' And they did, listening,
awed, as he rattled out his poetry.
</P>
<P>
   A double major in drama and philosophy while at Morehouse
(1990-94), Williams was in town this summer, performing his poetry
at the Variety Playhouse during the National Black Arts Festival.
Theatergoers may remember him in 7 Stages' acclaimed production,
mounted twice, of ``My Children, My Africa!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was me without any hair,'' Williams quips, now boasting
long dreds.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in upstate New York, he's lived in Manhattan for the past
four years. He went to grad school at NYU, and while there first
became aware of the new spoken-word movement, a legacy of the Beat
generation and '60s poets such as Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez and
Nikki Giovanni. ``You don't just write, you compete,'' he says.
``There's this whole braggadocio element.'' He first started
writing rhymes in the fourth grade, hoping someday to be a rapper.
</P>
<P>
   When he was approached about doing ``Slam,'' he says, ``I was
entering my third year at NYU, and I'd just gotten to the point
where I needed to fuse what was happening with me in the poetry
world with what was happening me in the acting world. I was about
to create this one-man show when I got the call (about `Slam'). It
was the perfect fusion. It was a glass slipper that fit my foot
perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, Williams will continue his role as a performing chameleon.
He's writing songs for a record with Sony's American Recordings.
His producer is a guy who has produced the Red Hot Chili Peppers,
the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J and Run-DMC. ``He's got a few
credits,'' Williams says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The writer-actor-musician gets back to Atlanta at least once a
year to see friends. And he wouldn't mind moving here with his
girlfriend and their child. ``I have a 2-year-old daughter, and I'm
not certain I want to raise her in New York City. I want her to be
able to commune with nature.''

 &HT;    `Apt Pupil' falls short as study of Nazi evils
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The evil that filmmaker Bryan Singer (``The Usual Suspects'')
tackles in his new movie, ``Apt Pupil,'' makes his Keyser Soze look
like Donnie Osmond.
</P>
<P>
   Working from a Stephen King novella written 16 years ago, Singer
takes us face to face with the hell that Hitler built: the Aryan
grand design of extermination known as the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   High school senior Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a model student
obsessed with the Third Reich in general and the Holocaust in
particular. His fascination helps him recognize that the alcoholic
recluse who calls himself Arthur Denker (Ian McKellen) is actually
Kurt Dussander, an infamous death camp commander who has managed to
keep his past secret for decades. Now Bowden shows up, threatening
to expose Denker/Dussander unless ... unless he relates in
excruciating detail the atrocities he committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' demands Todd. ``Everything they're afraid to
tell us in school.''
</P>
<P>
   So the old man, between healthy slugs of whiskey, does just
that. How long it took for the poison gas to kill; how the victims
vomited and defecated on themselves; how the children were always
found at the bottom of the heaps of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   These facts provide the movie's most chilling moments,
especially as related by McKellen, whose booze-soaked wariness
reminds us that, old, alcoholic and alone though he may be, he
could still prove a formidable foe. Todd is nibbling at the edges
of an ancient evil that, when provoked, will bite back. Hard.
</P>
<P>
   What evolves is a symbiotic love/hate relationship between the
two in which each tries to maintain the upper hand, through
blackmail, threats, deception, double-crosses, whatever's handy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apt Pupil'' sets out to teach us that evil knows evil, a
lesson it imparts well. The early scenes are the most unsettling,
because we can't quite read what Todd is getting from all this _
aside from lower grades and a low-grade sexual dysfunction. Is he
repulsed, titillated or both? Renfro, who provides a good match for
the peerless McKellen, makes a convincing cipher: the innocent
seduced or the impish seducer.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the plot itself is a bit wheezy. As the stakes
escalate, the movie doesn't know where to take us. We're left with
the feeling of a psychological horror show interrupted by a generic
suspense thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some excellent touches. The way Todd's
windshield wipers sound like marching jackboots. Or how easily his
well-meaning guidance counselor (a surprisingly effective David
Schwimmer) can be manipulated into powerlessness when the boy and
Denker double-team him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did it feel like?'' Todd asks. Later, Denker/Dussander
asks him the same thing. That's what's missing from the core of
this otherwise impressive film. We never quite learn what it feels
like _ for Todd, for Denker, or for the millions just like them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apt Pupil''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen and Brad Renfro. Directed by Bryan Singer.
Rated R for violence, language and disturbing material. At metro
theaters. 1 hour, 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A flawed but chilling lesson about the infectious
nature of evil.

 &HT;    `Marius' a tres sentimental bonbon
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a Woody Guthrie folk song, ``Marius and Jeannette'' is a
winning bit of populism _ full of sympathy for the working class.
</P>
<P>
   A sleeper hit in France where it was nominated for seven Cesars
(their Oscar), the film was written and directed by Robert
Guediguian, who clearly has the gentle romanticism of '30s
filmmaker Marcel Pagnol in mind. He's even named his male lead
after one of the films in Pagnol's famed Marseilles-set trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   Guediguian's movie is also set in Marseilles, in Estaque, a
charmingly idealized blue-collar neighborhood where the residents
share their feelings while shelling peas or drying dishes. That
they are meant to represent a microcosm of the world is
demonstrated by the enchanting opening shot: a plastic globe
floating downriver until it docks at Estaque.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Jeanette (Ariane Ascaride, the director's wife), a
40-ish single mom with two kids, lives. She's just lost her job as
a checkout clerk at a supermarket for mouthing off to the boss.
</P>
<P>
   Marius (Gerard Meylan) is a taciturn, gimpy-legged, middle-aged
security guard at a semi-demolished cement factory. They meet when
she tries to steal a couple of cans of discarded paint from his
work site. He makes her put them back, but also has to endure a
tongue-lashing about fascist factory owners who barely miss their
former employees, let alone some cans of paint.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he turns up at her home with the paint. He stays
to help and things proceed from there.
</P>
<P>
   As the title indicates, their slowly-emerging romance is the
film's central relationship. That, in itself, is immediately
appealing _ the opportunity to watch two normal, reasonably
attractive (as opposed to Hollywood airbrushed) adults risk falling
in love.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``Marius and Jeannette'' is more than just a love
story. It's also an engaging study of a community. As Marius gets
to know Jeannette's assorted friends and neighbors, so do we. The
constantly squabbling married couple (she still won't forgive him
for having voted for the Far Right in the last election); the
outspoken Marxist who survived the concentration camps but still
gets riled when Castro puts on a suit to court the capitalists; the
gentle retired schoolteacher who passes along his thoughts on
religious tolerance to Jeannette's Muslim son.
</P>
<P>
   Guediguian's picture of proletarian bliss is perhaps a tad too
rosy. Everyone is so well-intentioned, so good-humored, that you
almost expect them to break into song. But his vision of a mutually
nourishing neighborhood is also immensely appealing. And while some
scenes may be cloying and others clumsily comic, overall, the
community offered in ``Marius and Jeannette'' strikes you as a nice
place to live and an even nicer one to visit on an easygoing
afternoon at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marius and Jeannette''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ariane Ascaride and Gerard Meylan. Directed by Robert
Guediguian. Not rated, but contains sexuality and strong language.

 &HT;    Leary shines in tales of the 'hood
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Jaws'' and ``Star Wars'' may have set the commercial stakes,
and ``The Godfather'' saga may end up on more all-time-great lists.
But as far as independent filmmaking in the 1990s is concerned, the
most influential movie of the 1970s could well be ``Mean Streets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monument Avenue'' is a bleak, gritty Irish variation on Martin
Scorsese's timeless theme of lifelong buddies whose ties to one
another and to the old neighborhood are strangling them.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Charlestown, a working-class section of Boston separated
from encroaching gentrification by the title street, the film
focuses on Bobby O'Grady (Denis Leary), a thirtysomething
small-time hood who still lives at home with his mother. No wonder.
He and his lifelong buddies _ Mouse (Ian Hart), Digger (John Diehl)
and Teddy (Billy Crudup) _ are caught in a kind of extended
adolescence. When they aren't stealing cars or breaking into houses
_ a nice bonus of the ever-nearer yuppies _ they get drunk, snort
cocaine, play street hockey and talk about which movie stars they'd
like to sleep with.
</P>
<P>
   New to the group is Bobby's younger cousin, Seamus (Jason
Barry), fresh off the boat from Dublin. But he soon learns the
ropes: Don't cross the neighborhood's unofficial crime boss, Jackie
O'Hara (Colm Meaney), and keep your mouth shut when the local cop
(Martin Sheen) starts asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   One night, one of Bobby's cronies is shot dead while downing a
few at the neighborhood pub. Everyone knows the hit was ordered by
Jackie. But adhering to their misguided notions of honor and
manhood, they keep the code of silence. When Sheen shows up,
everybody was in the restroom when it happened. As usual.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby provides the movie's moral fulcrum. We see his rage and
pain when Jackie attends the wake to comfort the victim's grieving
mother. We also see how deeply this dead-end existence has claimed
him. Is he truly any better than Jackie? In the picture's most
harrowing scene, he instigates the kidnapping of an
African-American who has committed the unpardonable sin of walking
on his turf.
</P>
<P>
   Director Ted Demme purposely emphasizes the random, episodic
nature of Mike Armstrong's script, which in turn reflects the
random, episodic nature of these men's purposeless lives. It can be
a little wearing, but stick with it. There's a payoff.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is uniformly strong, especially Meaney, who oozes
self-satisfied complacency in a cashmere coat. But the standout is
Leary, who creates an indelible portrait of a guy too smart to be
stuck where he is and too stuck to figure a way out. Leary doesn't
back away from Bobby's ugly side _ the racism, the drugs, the sheer
street-bred meanness _ but he also shows us someone whose
conscience won't shut up.
</P>
<P>
   Demme's use of old photos of Bobby and company when they were
kids is a familiar technique, but it works unusually well in this
case. How, we wonder, did these grinning little boys in cowboy hats
grow up to be these grinning, useless thugs? It's a question the
movie keeps asking and one that, sadly, goes unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monument Avenue''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denis Leary and Colm Meaney. Directed by Ted Demme. Not
rated, but contains vulgarity, violence and drug use. Tara. 1 hour,
30 minutes.

   The verdict: Boy-o's in the 'hood, with a standout performance
by Denis Leary.

 &HT;    `Orgazmo' an impotent comedy fare
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the joke: A pious Mormon boy needs to raise money so he
can marry his sweetheart in the Tabernacle back in Salt Lake City.
How does he get the cash? He becomes a porn star.
</P>
<P>
   That's the one-yuck plot behind ``Orgazmo,'' Trey Parker's
second feature. (He also directed the movie, ``Cannibal! The
Musical,'' adapted by Dad's Garage for its current stage run.) If
you like the dumb scatology of Parker's ``South Park,'' you'll
probably enjoy the movie's frat-house silliness. But just so you
know, 10 minutes of the Comedy Central cartoon tends to have more
cutting pop-culture satire than all of ``Orgazmo,'' which probably
could have told its story in a third of its actual running time.
</P>
<P>
   Parker plays Joe Young, a gosh-darn nice fellow devoted to his
toothpaste-commercial-ready girlfriend Lisa (Robyn Lynne Raab).
Stumbling into the porn ring run by Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean
Jacobs), Joe is lured by the ready cash, and is soon donning the
superhero costume of the porn star Orgazmo. His sidekick,
Choda-Boy, is played by MIT graduate Ben (Dian Bachar), who fends
off screen criminals ... with sex toys. In his spare time, Ben has
developed a real life ``orgazmorator,'' a firearm that causes
instant, um, satisfaction in anyone who gets zapped by it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the level of the humor. The movie is surprisingly sweet
and goofy, but runs through its thin gimmick fast. By the way, the
NC-17 rating isn't for the simulated (comic) sex, but for frank
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orgazmo''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Trey Parker and Dian Bachar. Written and directed by
Parker. Rated NC-17. Phipps Plaza Theater. 1 hour, 35 minutes.

Shot.''

 &HT;    Passion colors town in film fable of the '50s
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a sexy tumble with his girlfriend in the back of a jalopy,
high school jock Skip (Paul Walker) comes home and notices a dusky
red rose swaying in the night breeze outside his house. What makes
it so unusual is that it's the only blush of color in the
black-and-white world of ``Pleasantville.''
</P>
<P>
   In his directing debut, Gary Ross, the screenwriter of ``Big''
and ``Dave,'' continues his knack for cinematic fables with a tale
of two 1990s kids zapped into the 1950s TV sitcom of the title.
It's a place of tidy picket fences, kittens trapped in trees, and
mass consumption of milk, malts and mounded breakfast platters
loaded with enough cholesterol to bring down a football team.
</P>
<P>
   David (Tobey Maguire) and twin sister Jennifer (Reese
Witherspoon) are transported there, via a plot device that doesn't
bear much scrutiny. (It involves Don Knotts as a TV repairman with
superpowerful remote control.) Aghast at their suddenly
monochromatic skin and '50s 'dos, they meet their new
Ward-and-June-Cleaver-like parents, Betty (Joan Allen) and George
(William H. Macy), who refer to them as ``Bud'' and ``Mary Sue.''
</P>
<P>
   If the teenagers' culture shock is bad, it's nothing compared to
what the town is in for. David warns his sis to go with the flow
until they figure how to get out. But vampy Jennifer starts
parading around in her angora sweater with the kind of attitude
that makes everyone on the basketball team miss their hoops. Soon,
her girl-power freedom is unleashing, gasp, color into
Pleasantville, as schoolmates and neighbors discover the unknown
pleasures of modern art, controversial literature and, natch, sex.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Truman Show,'' the movie teases with our
understanding of the rules of television. But it also pulls in
big-screen references. It plays like a sly revision of the original
``Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' only in reverse: Instead of
emotionless pod people infiltrating the idyllic town, it's the
passionate people. And the cheerful, bland Pleasantfolk _ led by
the mayor, Big Bob (the late J.T. Walsh) _ want this color seepage
to stop, before it turns them all fully human (flaws and all).
</P>
<P>
   Here's where ``Pleasantville'' starts to lose its light touch.
Ross turns the last act of his movie into a metaphor about the
struggle between safe but deadly conformity and the risky pleasures
of free will. When townsfolk start to talk about the ``coloreds,''
the flick becomes heavy-handed. And the last half-hour could use a
few judicious edits.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, though, it's a lovely, imaginative work, powered by the
luscious digital blend of color and black and white. Randy Newman's
bittersweet score also helps. Witherspoon, who has few peers in the
sardonic sexpot category, offers sharp work, sitting down with
``mom'' Betty to explain to her the facts of life. Too bad
Witherspoon's role gets smaller as the movie unreels. Maguire
(``The Ice Storm'') is appealing, playing a young man who prefers
to watch things from the sidelines, reserving judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful relationship in the film is between David/Bud
and his sitcom mom. Ideally cast, Allen raises the stakes
emotionally as her feelings for malt shop owner Mr. Johnson (Jeff
Daniels) turn her, almost literally, into a scarlet woman. And the
indispensable Macy brings bewildered bluster to his role as a man
who can't fathom the notion that his wife may not always be waiting
for him at home. His sputtering wail of ``Where's my dinner?''
becomes the fulcrum of ``Pleasantville,'' where the absence of a
meal becomes the symbol for a world tilting (for better and worse)
into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

   Starring Tobey Maguire, Joan Allen, Reese Witherspoon, William

 &HT;    `Slam' finds pure poetry behind prison bars
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though it's not quite the grand slam that its Grand Jury prize
at the Sundance and Camera d'Or at Cannes film festivals suggest,
``Slam'' is still something quite special. Documentarian turned
feature filmmaker Marc Levin grapples with such media-familiar
topics as the prison system, the violence of rap culture and the
endangered black male, but he does so with a vitality and freshness
that demand our attention.
</P>
<P>
   Ray (Saul Williams), a talented street poet from the slums of
Washington, is busted for selling a very small amount of marijuana.
His court-appointed lawyer, also African-American, points out that
he'll probably do less time if he cops a plea than if he fights the
charge. That's simply how the system ``works'' _ an irony
underscored when Washington mayor and former convict Marion Barry
turns up as the judge at Ray's arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   Behind bars, Ray finds what movie heroes always find: violence,
threats, rival gangs, more drugs, bad-guy guards, worst-guy
inmates, etc., etc. But he also discovers something else: the power
of words, as weapons and as liberation. As more than one character
points out, the real prison for these young men is the one inside
their heads, built out of rage and despair.
</P>
<P>
   The mostly non-professional cast and Levin's cinema-verite style
give the film a convincing veneer of truth that mitigates any
lingering cliches. More powerful still is its star. Williams, a
Morehouse College graduate, has the bearing of a king and a voice
fit for Shakespeare. He also has a camera-friendly quality that
gives even his stillest moments a kinetic charge. His presence and
energy are mesmerizing _ all the more so because they seem so
unforced.
</P>
<P>
   Williams provides a center for the movie's hang-loose narrative.
Another good touch: He's the receiver of wisdom as much as the
dispenser. His situation is so ambiguous that, when we finally
leave him, we really don't know what he'll do next.
</P>
<P>
   But the film is bigger than Ray's predicament. Without becoming
all social-worker self-righteous, it quietly insists that we
recognize a system that's become little more than sour chaos. Ray's
friend, blinded in a shooting, puts it bluntly: He hurts and the
only way he can feel better is if someone else hurts too. And so
the cycle continues.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider this moment from a poetry class taught in prison by
a passionate young woman (Sonja Sohn). She asks her pupils to
recite a poem they've written, and one guy, who looks as if he's
been doing hard time since he was 16, volunteers. His poem is
called ``Why'' and goes something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I shot three men but I don't know why.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I just wanted to see something die.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't hear stuff like that in a Sly Stallone prison movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slam''
</P>

   Grade: B

   Starring Saul Williams. Directed by Marc Levin. Rated R for
violence, language and drug use. At metro theaters.
</P>

   The verdict: This raw but powerful film insists that stone walls
do not
</P>

   a prison make.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel and Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Antz G
</P>
<P>
   A visual picnic, a so-so script. This computer-animated feature
tells of worker ant Z (voice of Woody Allen) whose love of Princess
Bala (Sharon Stone) lands both of them in the scary world outside
the ant colony. It's fun, but the story is as predictable as the
spectacular visuals are not. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Apt Pupil R
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from a Stephen King novella, Bryan Singer's flawed but
chilling lesson in the infectious nature of evil stars Brad Renfro
as a teenager obssessed with the Holocaust who discovers an
infamous Nazi war criminal (Ian McKellen) living in his
neighborhood. In exchange for not turning him in, the boy makes him
recount in detail the atrocities he committed. Their well-acted
symbiotic love/hate relationship balances the ultimately wheezy
plot. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   While ``Deep Impact'' treated a similar let's-save-Earth story
with sobriety, ``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global
annihilation get in the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with
Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a
summer popcorn movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard
flick ``Godzilla.'' And you'll see the reported $165 million budget
onscreen in the impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the
movie good for you? Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster
action, implied sex and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C
</P>
<P>
   Beloved R
</P>
<P>
   An A-list epic that inadvertently proves that Toni Morrison's
novels are unfilmable. Oprah Winfrey plays Sethe, a former slave
haunted by the ghost of her dead daughter, who takes in the
mysterious stranger Beloved (Thandie Newton). Too faithful to
Morrison's magic-realist prose, the movie substitutes mood for
emotional power and narrative clarity. 2 hours, 52 minutes. (SM)
Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Blade R
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't cut it. Wesley Snipes stars as the half-vampire,
half-human hero who can handle sunlight but also has a taste for
blood. Armed with an arsenal of sci-fi gadgets, a really cool
leather coat and Kris Kristofferson (a kind of high-tech Gabby
Hayes), Blade is devoted to wiping out all vampires. Especially a
strutting bloodsucker played by Stephen Dorff. Alas, all the
non-stop slash 'n' gnash action becomes more repetitive than
anything else. Rated R for extreme violence and strong language. 2
hours. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Bride of Chucky R
</P>
<P>
   Chucky is back, thanks to his doll of a girlfriend, who recites
incantations from her book, ``Voodoo for Dummies.'' The malevolent
dolls' voices are provided by Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly. 1
hour, 33 minutes. Not reviewed. Grade: NR
</P>
<P>
   Clay Pigeons R
</P>
<P>
   A good indy cast, including Joaquin Phoenix as a framed,
small-town everyman, Janeane Garofalo as a dry FBI agent, and
especially Vince Vaughn as a giggling, psycho good ol' boy can't
save this arch, overplotted ``Fargo'' wannabe. 1 hour, 44 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Cube R
</P>
<P>
   A neat little brain tease of a movie in which assorted
characters try to escape from a seemingly endless maze of identical
cubicles. The catch: Some are safe while others harbor lethal booby
traps. The hokey dialogue and overheated confrontations are
drawbacks, but the basic puzzle premise is hard to resist. And
you're really going to wish you'd paid more attention in math
class. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Dead Man on Campus R
</P>
<P>
   Some passable laughs, but it doesn't make the honor roll. Two
college students (Tom Everett Scott and Mark-Paul Gosselaar) hope a
kamikaze frat boy (Lochlyn Munro), will share their dorm suite.
And, preferably, kill himself in one of his misadventures. That's
because an odd clause at their college gives students an automatic
4.0 average if their roommate offs himself. Rated R for drug use,
language and crude sexual humor. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 36
minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing Behavior R
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly lame. This teens-in-peril flick is a high-concept
pitch with zero follow-through _ it's ``The Stepford Teens'' with a
touch of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' James Marsden plays a
newcomer to a small-town high school who encounters a band of
frighteningly clean-cut students. With the help of the school
psychiatrist (Bruce Greenwood), these fascist Archies ``recruit'' a
new classmate into their group every few days. Rated R for
profanity, violence and sex. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. 1 hour, 30
minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Ever After PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After'' proves you can teach an old doll
new tricks. Re-inventing the Cinderella story in a way that targets
``Titanic''-loving teens more than Barney grads, the movie stars
Drew Barrymore as its spirited heroine, Anjelica Huston as her
scheming stepmother and Dougray Scott as a prince who's more than
just another trophy husband. Jeanne Moreau, doyenne of the French
New Wave, contributes a classy cameo. Rated PG-13 for emotional
situations (death of a father) and some violence. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. 44 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Fakin' da Funk R
</P>
<P>
   A message movie that's weakened a bit by heavy reliance on
stereotypes and a predictable plot. An adoption agency mistakenly
gives Ernie Hudson and Pam Grier a Chinese baby. (Their last name
is Lee). They keep it. And he, in turn, adopts the notion that he
is black. But when the Lees move from Atlanta to South Central Los
Angeles the boys in the hood are quick to tell Dante Basco he's
``Fakin Da Funk.'' 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Sonia Murray) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   54 R
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan nightclub Studio 54 was a late-1970s blast of
neo-Roman decadence where everyone could be fabulous. Unfortunately
writer-director Mark Christopher gives us a tired, creaky fable
about a small-town stud (Ryan Phillippe) who gets seduced by the
limelight, almost loses himself, but gets saved by the right girl.
The movie is as meek as Studio 54 was outrageous. 1 hour, 33
minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Holy Man PG
</P>
<P>
   A mild comedy-drama that wastes Eddie Murphy's talents as a New
Age drifter who brings big sales and enlightenment to home shopping
producer Jeff Goldblum and media analyst Kelly Preston. It's
Hollywood's latest reduction of spiritual values to ``give somebody
a hug.'' 1 hour, 53 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This movie never flies, but never sinks, either. Sandra Bullock
teams up with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for
this affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town
home to lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. 1 hour, 54
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Impostors R
</P>
<P>
   Flawed as it is, this slight, silly film is impossible to
dislike. It's too full of talented funny people such as Lili
Taylor, Campbell Scott, Dana Ivey and Steve Buscemi. Stanley Tucci
and Oliver Platt star as two out-of-work actors who stow away on a
luxury liner. The '30s setting reflects the movie's screwball
aspirations, which it never quite achieves. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Lolita R
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Lyne's version of Vladimir Nabokov's acclaimed novel
about a grown man (Jeremy Irons) sexually obsessed with a
pre-pubescent girl (Dominique Swain) is neither a triumph nor a
travesty. It's just OK, which, given the source, suggests that the
director had little affinity for the material besides its name
value. The result is an overlong, sometimes sluggish film that opts
for Victoria's Secret gauze over the black comedy of Stanley
Kubrick's 1962 version. 2 hours, 5 minutes. (ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Love Is the Devil NR
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jacobi stars as Francis Bacon in this rivetingly dark,
fractured drama about the painter's sadomasochistic relationship
with a young burglar (Daniel Craig). Often hard to watch, and more
of a study than a portrait, the movie is impressive in its way of
finding a cinematic equivalent for the painter's grotesque work.1
hour, 30 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Marius and Jeannette NR
</P>
<P>
   Not a major film but a minor delight. A slowly-evolving romance
between a forty-ish single mom (Ariane Ascaride) and a taciturn,
middle-aged security guard (Gerard Meylan) is the film's focus, but
French director Robert Guediguian has also delivered an upbeat and
endearing study of a mutually nourishing working-class
neighborhood. It's a nice place to live and an even nicer place to
visit on an easy-going afternoon at the movies. Subtitles. 1 hour,
42 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right. Our men in black are Anthony Hopkins and
Antonio Banderas, who double our swashbuckling pleasure and double
our fun as dual Zorros, saving California and Hopkins' beautiful,
spirited daughter (Catherine Zeta-Jones) from the evil schemes of
one Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). It's an expert blend of panache,
romanticism and supple, tongue-in-cheek humor. 2 hours, 16 minutes.
(ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Kieran Culkin's mighty mite is just one plus in this fine family
film that manages to be down-to-earth and magical at the same time.
Culkin is an undersized genius suffering from a degenerative
illness who bonds with a lonely 13-year-old giant (Elden Henson)
with self-esteem problems. The surprisingly strong supporting cast
includes Sharon Stone, Harry Dean Stanton, Gena Rowlands and
Gillian Anderson. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Monument Avenue NR
</P>
<P>
   An Irish variation on ``Mean Streets,'' this is a bleak, gritty
look at some pals who grew up together in a blue-collar section of
Boston and whose ties to each other and to the old neighborhood are
strangling them. They spend their time drinking, snorting coke,
stealing cars and adhering to false notions of honor and loyalty.
The film reflects their random, episodic, purposeless lives. Colm
Meaney, as the boss thug, and Denis Leary, as the movie's moral
fulcrum, provide stand-out performances. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Negotiator R
</P>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller, Samuel L. Jackson plays a
hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department who is framed
for embezzlement and murder. Desperate to clear his name, he takes
four members of the department hostage, then asks another
negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to act as a mediator between himself and
his fellow officers. The film's main kick is the engrossing duel of
bluffs and counterbluffs between Spacey and Jackson. They make us
believe in the high stakes of the situation. Rated R for violence
and profanity. 2 hours, 15 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   A Night at the Roxbury PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Those head-bopping, nightclubbing brothers from ``Saturday Night
Live'' are out in a full-fledged story. Well, as full-fledged as
you can get when your central characters are a couple of clueless,
would-be coolsters whose dream is getting into, and then owning,
the hottest club in town. Lots of groaningly funny lines and a
surprisingly coherent story line make this a fun, thankfully
concise viewing experience. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska)

   One Tough Cop R
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Baldwin stars as a New York detective torn between duty
to his badge or to a childhood pal (Mike McGlone) who is now a
member of a crime family. This solid cop procedural is fact-based
but plays like a dozen fictional flicks you've seen before. 1 hour,
30 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   One True Thing R
</P>
<P>
   Strikes too many false notes. Renee Zellweger plays a career
journalist who goes home to care for her dying homemaker mother
(Meryl Streep). Streep's performance is terrific, but the movie
suffers from generic slickness. 2 hour, 7 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Orgazmo NC-17
</P>
<P>
   A pious Mormon boy (writer-director Trey Parker) raises money
for his wedding by acting in porn flicks. That's the one-joke
premise of this movie, which has a few laughs for Parker's ``South
Park'' set. But the Comedy Central show packs more laughs and
pop-culture satire in only half an hour.1 hour, 35 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-

<P>
   Pecker R
</P>
<P>
   Edward Furlong plays a Baltimore kid whose grainy photos bring
him New York art scene fame in John Waters' new comedy. Like all
Waters' films, it's a very mixed bag of raunch and sweetness, smart
satire and dumb comedy. 1 hour, 27 minutes. (SM) Grade C+
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not Perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealhy
wife`s lover to kill her. 1 hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Pleasantville R
</P>
<P>
   Two '90s kids (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) are zapped
into a '50s sitcom, and slowly bring sex, color and rock `n roll to
the black-and-white world. The movie gets preachy in its second
half. But the performances (in a cast including Joan Allen and
William H. Macy) and the lustrous mix of monochrome and color keep
you hooked. 2 hours, 4 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Practical Magic PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman play dissimilar sisters with
one strong bond: They're witches. In the lively film version of the
Alice Hoffman novel, the two deal with backfired spells and that
most unpredictable magic, love. Co-starring Aidan Quinn and Dianne
Wiest, it's lightweight but works like a charm. 1 hour, 45 minutes.
(SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Ronin R
</P>
<P>
   The title suggests a close friend of Rodan or Godzilla, but it
actually refers to shamed samurai who, having lost their master,
are for hire. Robert De Niro and Jean Reno lead some modern-day
``ronin'' _ Cold Warriors without a war _ hired to snatch a
mysterious suitcase. Director John Frankenheimer (``The Manchurian
Candidate'') and an unbilled David Mamet (``The Spanish Prisoner'')
bring a cool professional touch to this crackling
action-suspense-thriller that's fun and smart. 1 hour, 58 minutes.
(ER) Grade: A-

<P>
   Rounders R
</P>
<P>
   Director John Dahl (``The Last Seduction'') has a couple of very
hot aces up his sleeve _ Matt Damon and Edward Norton _ in this
nifty movie about the addictive lure of high-stakes poker. Damon is
a former card sharp who's managed to kick the habit and concentrate
on his law studies. Norton is his old friend, fresh out of jail,
who lures him back. A pungent, character-rich picture that's a lot
less about where it goes than how it gets there. Rated R for nudity
and language. 2 hours. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Rush Hour PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Kung Fu king Jackie Chan and fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker
play two cops whose clashes go way beyond cultural differences.
Thrown together by FBI agents who don't want either mucking up
their search for a kidnapped child, the pair drive each other
crazy, at first. You'll howl as Chan and Tucker learn to work
together, in part by imitating (sometimes badly) how the other one
works. 1 hours, 37 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska, c. 1998 Cox News
Service) Grade: B

   Saving Private Ryan R
</P>
<P>
   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad (and excellent
ensemble cast) on a mission to find a private (Matt Damon) whose
three brothers have already been killed in combat. Hanks'
performance is a miracle of decency and subtle emotion, but kudos
all around here. And the opening D-Day sequence is the most
powerful combat footage ever created on film. Rated R for extreme
violence and some vulgar language. 2 hours, 50 minutes. (ER) Grade:
A

<P>
   Scream 2 PG
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 2'' takes scary sequels as its target this time around.
Neve Campbell returns as our beleguered heroine Sidney, now
enrolled in picturesque Windsor College (it's actually Agnes Scott
College(Ga.)), where a masked killer is prowling around with a
butcher knife. ``Scream 2'' can't recapture the bracing experience
of the first film. But it gets as close as you could hope for. 2
hours. (SM) Grade: A-

   Simon Birch PG
</P>
<P>
   A little movie with big problems. In the early 1960s, a
pre-adolescent dwarf named Simon Birch (Ian Michael Smith) is
convinced he will one day be a hero while his best pal (Joseph
Mazzello) tries to solve the mystery of his real father (Ashley
Judd is Mazzello's closemouthed mom). The movie is clearly a labor
of love; alas, it's also a labor to sit through. Rated PG for
violence (a scary bus accident) and sexual innuendo. 1 hour, 50
minutes. (ER) Grade: D-
</P>
<P>
   Slam R
</P>
<P>
   This raw but powerful film _ a ``drama verite'' according to its
director, former documentarian Marc Levin _ insists in its own
rough, streetwise way that stone walls do not a prison make. Sent
to jail on a minor drug charge, an inner-city poet (rivetting
newcomer Saul Williams) discovers that the power of words is one
way to fight the sour chaos of a ruined legal system. Though not
the grand slam its many festival prizes would suggest, this is
still a special film. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Slums of Beverly Hills R
</P>
<P>
   A vivid, very funny look at coming of age on the fringes. Vivian
Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne) is the odd girl out in a post-divorce
family led by a father (Alan Arkin) who, every three months or so,
skips out on rent and moves his brood to another fleabag on the
edge of Beverly Hills. Director Tamara Jenkins re-creates the daily
humiliations of adolescence with wince-inducing accuracy. And
Lyonne is terrific at navigating the waters of teen angst. Rated R
for nudity, profanity, sexual situations. 1 hour, 31 minutes. (SM)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Small Soldiers PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Action- and violence-packed movie is heavy on computer-generated
effects but woefully light on plot twists or interesting characters
(either flesh-and-blood or plastic). Borrowing liberally from too
many other movies, action figures come alive, start warring with
each other (and any human who gets in their way) and destroy an
idyllic small-town neighborhood. 1 hour 49 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Snake Eyes R
</P>
<P>
   Oscar winner Nicolas Cage and Brian De Palma are always worth
gambling on; while they don't come up total winners here, they're
hardly losers either. Cage plays a crooked Atlantic City cop who
finds himself in the middle of an assassination plot during a
heavyweight boxing match. Part detective story, part
action-thriller, the picture loses steam near the end, but De
Palma's wired camerawork and Cage's strutting energy help hold it
together. Rated R for violence and language. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Soldier R
</P>
<P>
   After being left for dead by his genetically engineered
replacements, a soldier fights back. This sci-fi story about men
genetically selected and trained to be soldiers stars Kurt Russell
and Jason Scott Lee. Not reviewed. Grade: NR
</P>
<P>
   A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries R
</P>
<P>
   Family matters and more are examined in this thoughtful
adaptation of Kaylie Jones' semi-autobiographical book about
growing up in the '60s and '70s (her father was writer James
Jones). The scattered, vignette-ish approach may bother some _ the
movie is like a personal memoir divided into three separate but
equal short stories _ but the film's sense of memory as an
emotional tapestry made up of many people and incidents rings true.
2 hours, 4 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary R
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious. Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high
school senior who suffers a bathroom mishap that keeps him from
attending his prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz).
Thirteen years later, the still-obsessed Ted hires a gumshoe (Matt
Dillon) to track her down. The movie is liberating in its
scatological, slapstick way. But the easy-to-offend should find
something more polite to watch. 1 hour, 58 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Urban Legend R
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Witt and Jared Leto star in the latest knockoff of
``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.'' The
college-campus, teen-kill thriller is slickly made, well played,
instantly forgettable. 1 hour, 39 minutes. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   What Dreams May Come PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Imagine ``Ghost'' directed by Terry Gilliam and you'll have some
idea of this tear-jerker phantasmagoria. Robin Williams stars as a
doctor exploring aspects of the afterlife after he's killed in a
car crash. Annabella Sciorra is his widow; Cuba Gooding Jr., his
spiritual guide. The movie is emotionally and visually stunning, a
little simplistic story-wise. But sometimes simplistic can be
startlingly close to primal. Check your cynicism at the door and
bring a box of Kleenex. 1 hour, 46 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Why Do Fools Fall in Love R
</P>
<P>
   This dark, dramatic biopic stars Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and
Lela Rochon as the women who were married to doo-wopper Frankie
Lymon, and whose court fight over his royalty ``estate'' clues us
to the singer's sorry life. Boasting some great late '50s and early
'60s rock sounds, this film, unfortunately, spins back and forth
narratively. Rated R for language, sex scenes and drug use. 2
hours, 3 minutes. (The Hollywood Reporter) Grade: B

   (``If a man can write a better book, preach a better sermon, or

house in the woods, the world will make a beaten path to his
door.'' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson)

of the Templeton funds, built his fortune on his legendary ability
to perceive value that others overlooked. In his column, he urges

<P>
   Ralph Waldo Emerson, in many of his masterful essays, pondered
this formula: ``Make yourself necessary to the world and mankind
will give you bread.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been expected to follow in the steps of his father and
grandfather as a Unitarian minister. Although he did become an
ordained minister, Emerson was not content to minister in the ways
of his forefathers. He recognized his gift was different.
</P>
<P>
   On fire with enthusiasm to reveal his ideas on morality,
self-reliance, and the soul, Emerson began to write. His ideas were
new to many people, and his audience began to grow. Before long he
met with success, and today Emerson's essays may be found in many
bookstores and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson was true to his own formula. He bravely stepped forth
and created a need for what he had to give the world by making his
talent available.
</P>
<P>
   What activities bring you great joy? What activities do you
perform well? What flows easily for you? If you could do whatever
work you desired and had some assurance that you wouldn't fail,
what would you do?
</P>
<P>
   What are your goals? You may wish to revisit them and think of a
way people could benefit from what you have to offer ... and then
offer it. You might find, as did Emerson, that what it takes is a
taste of something good -- something you have to offer the world --
and people will find themselves hungering for more.
</P>
<P>
   With the sheer driving force of advancing technology, it becomes
increasingly clear that opportunities are available in many areas
for those who feel an inner pull to be of service.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the environment, the physical sciences, the
economy, health and medicine, education, communications media,
religion, charity, philanthropy, volunteerism are but some of the
advancing technologies. The evolution of humanity and the universe
seems to be vast in its conception, yet curiously experimental and
tentative, a truly creative work in process.
</P>
<P>
   If you choose, you can be a conscious part of that creative
process. You are necessary!
</P>
<P>
   We have come a long way from the cave shelters of the Ice Age,
but it may well be, in God's great plan, that we have vastly
further to travel. Science is beginning to reveal a creation of
awesome magnitude, intricacy, beauty and order, and we sense that
what lies beyond our instruments is vastly greater still.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, my friend, there are abundant opportunities for the one who
elects to make himself, or herself, necessary to the world. The
rewards are not only the ``bread'' provided, but an inner awareness
of your contribution to God's purpose and to the uplifting of the
human race through loving service.

 &HT;    Procedure involves lots of pressure but usually little pain
 &HT;    By Sarah Franquet
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our experts: Dr. Kristine Thayer, a Palm Beach County surgeon
who specializes in breast diseases, and Melanie Nielsen, a
radiologic technologist and manager of the Comprehensive Breast
Center at Good Samaritan Medical Center in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What exactly is a mammogram?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is an X-ray of the breast that can detect cancers. There
are two kinds. Screening mammograms are for routine maintenance and
can detect cancers before they can be felt. A diagnostic mammogram
is for a woman who has felt a lump or has other complaints such as
tenderness, dimpling, breast pain, swelling or nipple discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When should I have my first mammogram?
</P>
<P>
   A. The American Cancer Society and others recommend you have a
baseline mammogram (your first one, used for crucial comparisons in
later tests) at age 40 and have one screening mammogram every year
after. These recommendations are controversial; some groups
recommend mammograms every two years for women 40 to 49. But Thayer
says plenty of scientific evidence shows that yearly screening
reduces the number of breast cancer deaths. She also says tumors
grow more quickly in younger women, so early detection is crucial.
(For all women, a monthly self examination is recommended.)
</P>
<P>
   If you have a first-degree relative (mother, sister or daughter)
who has had breast cancer, ask your doctor when you should start
having regular mammograms. el3
</P>
<P>
   Q. How much does it cost?
</P>
<P>
   A. Mammograms usually run from $75 to $125. Unfortunately, many
women won't spend that kind of money on themselves. But Thayer says
they need to keep in mind that it's for the whole family. ``They
are the caregivers, and if something happens to them, it affects
the whole family,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   (Also, during October, National Breast Cancer Awareness Month,
many facilities offer reduced rates.)
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do I choose a facility?
</P>
<P>
   A. Whether you have a mammogram at a hospital, a women's center
or your gynecologist's office, make sure the facility has Food and
Drug Administration and American College of Radiology
certifications. This ensures that basic standards are met.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society (phone: 616-9370) has a list of
accredited facilities and information on reduced-rate screenings.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions to ask: How does the facility handle your
results? Do you know right away?
</P>
<P>
   Does the facility offer breast examinations along with your
mammogram?
</P>
<P>
   About how long is each patient there? Are they efficient at
getting women in and out?
</P>
<P>
   Who can I talk to if I have questions or need more information?
</P>
<P>
   Q. What exactly is going to happen during my visit?
</P>
<P>
   A. Melanie Nielsen describes a visit to Good Samaritan's center.
As you check in, you'll fill out a patient history form. Questions
include: Do you have any family members with breast cancer? At what
age did you start your menstrual period? Have you ever had breast
surgery?
</P>
<P>
   At this point, a breast examination by a nurse practitioner is
offered. (This is called a Clinical Breast Examination and, along
with self-examination and mammograms, is an important part of a
woman's health care.) You can also watch a video or get private
instruction on how to perform self-exams.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the technologist will perform a screening mammogram,
which gives radiologists two views of each breast. You will undress
from the waist up, and the technologist will place your breast on a
Plexiglas plate, gently pulling the breast tissue away from your
chest walls. Keep in mind that breast tissue extends from your
clavicle to your bra line and from your sternum to your lymph nodes
underneath your arm. That's a lot of chest to cover.
</P>
<P>
   The top Plexiglas paddle will move down to flatten your breast
(the latest machines let the technologist control this with a foot
pedal). She will ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds
while she takes the image. Once the exposure is over, the
compression automatically releases. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   A radiologist will look at the X-rays, interpret them and make a
report. The radiologist is looking for the unusual _ asymmetry,
masses or anything that stands out from normal breast tissue. At
Good Samaritan, they try to give you the report right away. If the
radiologist is unavailable to read the X-rays, the center will
notify you later that day, or the next morning. They will also give
a report to your doctor, and you will receive a letter explaining
what was found.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The big question. Does it hurt?
</P>
<P>
   A. Some women may tell you it hurts. Others say it's a piece of
cake. Most admit it can be a little uncomfortable. It involves
pulling and compressing your breast, but it feels different for
every woman. Nielsen says the majority of women have no problem at
all. A good technologist knows this is high-anxiety time and is
very sensitive to you and your body. So are the newest machines,
which are designed to help eliminate a lot of the discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   If it does becomes painful, tell the technologist. She can work
with you more and try to make adjustments. But the main point here
is to get adequate compression. If that doesn't happen, you will
have gone through this for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how several women describe the feeling:
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it didn't actually hurt. It just feels a little weird
because your breast usually isn't squished like that. I didn't know
my breast could be flattened so much. There's pressure, but pain?
No. It's not fun, but it's no huge deal. Look at it this way:
having a PAP smear is a little uncomfortable, too, but you have
those annually, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's painless. My breast tissue is fibrous and thick and it
takes a little longer for the X-ray part. I'd describe it as firm
pressure. It did feel a little weird having a woman fondling my
breasts, though!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't hurt. It's very uncomfortable though. Pressure is a
good word. Part of the concern is that this huge cold machine is
compressing and you don't know when it's going to stop. And, you're
not used to your breast being handled like that. It's all pretty
impersonal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just feels like you're being smushed between two cold
plates. But it didn't hurt. You're hugging this big piece of
machinery and being smushed. It's just more awkward than painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do women ever bruise?
</P>
<P>
   A. It can happen, but not usually. This can depend on any
medication you're taking. Aspirin or certain prescription
medications can cause you to bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do smaller- or larger-breasted women have more discomfort?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Nielsen hears comments all the time from small-breasted
women who think large-breasted women will have more pain, and
vice-versa. But size doesn't matter. It all depends on the
sensitivity of your breasts. If you have lumpy breasts, you may
have a little more discomfort. Nielsen says it may help to avoid
caffeine two weeks before your mammogram is scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Q. For very flat-chested women, it seems there's really nothing
there to compress. How does that work?
</P>
<P>
   A. Keep in mind, even men can get mammographies. Everyone has
skin and some amount of breast tissue. ``We just work with the
patient,'' says Nielsen. There is always something to compress.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the radiation harmful?
</P>
<P>
   A. Twenty years ago, that was a legitimate concern. Now, you are
exposed to more radiation on a transcontinental flight than during
a mammogram.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm really nervous. What can I do to make this whole thing
easier?
</P>
<P>
   A. A few things to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
   Technologists are trained to give you the maximum privacy and to
treat you with sensitivity. Some techs strike up a conversation and
before you know it, it's all over. So tell her you're nervous and
talk to her about your fears.
</P>
<P>
   The first time is the hardest because it's all a little unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Wear a two-piece outfit. That way, you have to undress only from
the waist up.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule your appointment after your period when your breasts
are not so tender.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have implants. Does that affect my mammogram?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. Extra views of the breast are taken and a specialized
technique is used so the entire breast can be imaged. But implants
do not affect your ability to get a good mammogram. Also don't
worry about the process rupturing an implant. There's not enough
pressure involved. In fact, mammograms can be used to detect
abnormalities with your implants.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What if they find something?
</P>

   A. If an abnormality does show up, the radiologist may recommend
more views be taken or an ultrasound given. It all depends on what
the area in question looks like. The radiologist would call your
doctor, and you would all discuss the next step.

   This fear too often keeps women from having a mammogram. But
Thayer emphasizes that finding something is not a bad thing. ``It
used to be that we couldn't do anything,'' she said. ``Now, we
can't prevent breast cancer from happening, but if we catch it
early, you don't have to die from it anymore.'' FACT BOX: Breast
cancer facts 95 percent of breast cancer cases occur in women age
40 and over. In Florida, 27 percent of women over the age of 40
(almost 1 million) have never had a mammogram. Breast cancer is
usually found in the upper, outer part of the breast, but it can
occur anywhere in the breast. Most women _ about 80 percent _ who
get breast cancer do not have a sister or mother who has breast
cancer. Nearly 97 percent of women who are diagnosed with breast
cancer at an early stage survive for more than five years. In 1998,
11,800 women in Florida will be diagnosed with breast cancer and
2,900 women will die. These high numbers can be partly attributed
to demographics _ nearly 1.9 million women are over 60, and more
than 65 percent of all breast cancers occur in women age 60 and
over. 72 percent of the breast cancers diagnosed in Florida are
found in the early stages of the disease. Source: American Cancer

   BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. _ When the photographer asks her to take off
her jacket, Renee Riedl says, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he is gone, Riedl walks over and lifts the jacket, and
her shirt, and her bra.
</P>
<P>
   And she looks at where her 34C breasts used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it looks like,'' she says. ``Nothing. There's
nothing there.''
</P>
<P>
   Riedl found a lump in her left breast on St. Patrick's Day,
1990, and a lump in her right breast on Dec. 17, 1996. Breast
cancer, both times.
</P>
<P>
   Two matching mastectomy scars _ horizontal lines about four
inches long _ have replaced them. Even her nipples are gone.
</P>
<P>
   She drops something from the left cup of her bra and hands it
over. It is a prosthesis, squishy and a too-orange color.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a smaller size, 34B. She could have asked for any
size, Riedl says. ``But I was so thin when I went to get it they
asked, `Why not go down?' Stupid me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid'' because she's no longer 120 pounds and a size 4.
After her second mastectomy and chemotherapy, her body went bonkers
and she gained 34 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   She can list her post-chemo problems without tripping over an
``itis.'' Lupus, autoimmune hepatitis, vasculitis. In short, her
immune system is shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate my body,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But Mel loves it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Mel is Riedl's husband. He is 70, she 53. They met in a Pompano
Beach ballroom when Renee, 27, walked into his beginners' rhumba
class. They have been dancing together ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wouldn't let me go,'' Mel says. ``You girls are tough, I
tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel's a talker. While Renee is busy with the photographer, he
offers to show the photos of her that he keeps in the trunk of his
car. ``She's got a body, I swear to God, that could be Miss
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel, this is embarrassing to me. Tell her why you have
pictures of me in the trunk of your car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to show people how nice you looked when you were
30.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes to the pool room and pulls out those pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel shows a photo of the two of them on the dance floor.
``That's when she had a nice figure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she throws a prosthesis at him when she gets mad at
him.
</P>
<P>
   Renee and Mel, who once made a living dancing and instructing,
have 13 dance routines. They have performed on cruise ships and in
country clubs and ballrooms throughout South Florida. Now Mel goes
to ballrooms alone. He doesn't want Renee catching anything from
other people.
</P>
<P>
   But one night Renee said to hell with it. She and Mel performed
at a charity event in Dade County, doing a whirling, stomping dance
called the paso doble.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work. Renee got tired. ``Mel just looked up at the DJ
and said, `She has to stop,''' Renee says.
</P>
<P>
   She wants her body back. They are both out of work (he has heart
problems), they traded their house on Lighthouse Point for a
$525-a-month apartment, and they've traded the Chryslers and
Mercedes for one 1995 Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their old lifestyle, people think they are
millionaires or something, Renee says. They now get $800 a month in
disability payments.
</P>
<P>
   But Renee won't part with her $1,000 ballroom dresses, even if
they don't fit her anymore. She wants to dance again. xo
</P>
<P>
   Her tango dress is her favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Black lace on top. Sleeveless. Fitted to the hips. Ruffled skirt
with a slit up the left leg. Silver sequins along the edges. ``Then
long black gloves, you know, and long red earrings.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing black stretch pants, curled up in a chair, she watches a
tape of herself and Mel doing the merengue. This was between
mastectomies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Note the legs,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Thin, graceful on 2 1/2-half-inch heels. ``I can't dance in
anything less.''
</P>
<P>
   When she says she hates her body, Mel says, ``Don't be
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't feel sensual or sexual,'' she says. ``My
husband will love me until the day I die, but this has got to
affect him to some degree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't dance with her,'' is all he says.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Renee went to get her lymph nodes biopsied. If all
goes well, she will ask to be placed on immunosuppressants, which
should take care of the water weight.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, she says, she will get reconstructive surgery.
She says it is covered by Medicare. Mel is impressed. Free surgery?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they can dance again.
</P>
<P>
   Renee says the last time they danced was April 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she got all fat and heavy,'' Mel says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel ... ''
</P>
<P>
   He gets up and walks across the room and hugs her around the
head.

 &HT;    In final months, lesbian made breast cancer fight a public
crusade
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dennie Doucher was so comfortable as a lesbian, it was
unthinkable that she would feel uneasy about telling others she was
(cq she's deceased) gay.
</P>
<P>
   But many unthinkable things happen when you have cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Doucher was diagnosed with breast cancer, the
native Atlantan was thrust into a culture that identifies breast
cancer with heterosexual women.
</P>
<P>
   Support groups, normally nurturing, put Doucher on the
defensive. She felt like an outsider when members spoke of losing
their breasts and how their husbands or boyfriends reacted. She
hated having to explain her sexuality, instead of having her
illness explained to her.
</P>
<P>
   With characteristic verve, Doucher set out to learn as much
possible about her disease. She found that, far from being an
affliction only of straight women, breast cancer is thought to be a
greater problem for lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   She also found that healing would take much more than doctors
and pills.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer doctors have long suspected that lesbian women are at
greater risk for breast cancer, from anecdotal evidence that they
tend to be heavier, undergo cancer screenings only sporadically and
have children late or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   But no one had tested this hypothesis until September, when
researchers completed the first study to compare breast cancer risk
factors of lesbian and heterosexual women. The study, which
involved 1,019 women from 1995 to 1997, concluded that lesbians
indeed have higher weight-height ratios and fewer pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still too early for us to develop specific mammography
guidelines for lesbians, but our study shows the importance of
encouraging lesbians to seek medical care on a regular basis,''
said Dr. Stephanie Roberts, medical director at Lyon-Martin Women's
Health Services in San Francisco, where the study was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recommend a mammogram every year for women after turning
40. Regardless of sexual activity, women 18 and older should have
annual gynecological and clinical breast exams conducted by a
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But many lesbians visit a gynecologist rarely or never, thinking
the annual exams are for women at risk of getting pregnant or
catching a sexually transmitted disease from a male partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many lesbians report that it's been over three years since
they had their last Pap smear,'' said Dr. Jocelyn White of the Gay
and Lesbian Medical Association, a national organization with 2,000
members.
</P>
<P>
   The Pap smear, which shows cervical abnormalities, and other
regular tests can detect cancer in its earliest stages, when it is
easier to treat. Finding cancer at a later stage generally means a
poorer chance for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Another breast cancer risk factor is not having children, or
having them at a later age, as many lesbians do. Being pregnant has
health benefits: During pregnancy, the body's levels of the female
hormone estrogen drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many cancers, specifically breast cancer, are
estrogen-dependent,'' said Linda McGehee, (cq) a close friend of
Doucher's and a faculty member at Georgia State University's
nursing school. ``Lesbians who choose not to have children, or have
them later in life, have more exposure to estrogen.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting lesbians into doctor's offices may take more than
convincing them they should go.
</P>
<P>
   Health care costs are a major barrier. Lesbians generally can't
join spousal health insurance plans, and women typically earn less
money than men. Annual gynecological exams cost $125 to $175, and
mammograms can add $100 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many lesbians fear discrimination and poor treatment if
they reveal their sexual status.
</P>
<P>
   Bev Baker, executive director of the Mary-Helen Mautner Project
for Lesbians With Cancer in Washington, has heard some appalling
tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesbians have been abused in the health care system,'' Baker
bluntly said. ``Once their health care providers find out they're
lesbians, many women have been left flat on their backs, feet in
the stirrups.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviewing lesbians with cancer about their health care
experiences, McGehee found that women felt either very good or very
bad about how their doctors treated them and their partners.
Sometimes the patient's partner was ignored; in other cases, the
doctor made special efforts to talk to the partner and educate her
about her loved one's illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical community needs to address these issues,'' White
said. ``Until physicians can work effectively with lesbians, they
won't be able to work with all patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians also need more information, specifically about the
incidence of breast cancer among lesbians. Only further studies can
determine this statistic, because current tracking methods such as
the National Tumor Registry don't differentiate by sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco study found that lesbians are more than twice
as likely as heterosexual women to require breast biopsies
performed on lumps, to determine whether they are cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the study didn't find that lesbians were more
likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than straight women _ but
the overall average age of the women in the study was 43. The risk
of breast cancer increases with age, with 77 percent of new
diagnoses occurring among women 50 and older, according to the
American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   The lead researchers themselves say their study had significant
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Future study needs to be done that gets at different economic
groups, different geographic areas,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and her research team will soon begin a three-year study
of 5,000 lesbian and heterosexual women, funded by California's
Breast Cancer Research Program. The study will target women older
than 40.
</P>
<P>
   Lesbian health specialists are anxiously awaiting a report on
lesbian health research priorities by the Institute of Medicine, a
part of the National Academy of Sciences. The report, expected in
November, will address the extent of knowledge of rates of cancer,
STDs, hypertension and substance abuse among lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``That report is very likely to shape how we look at lesbians'
health over the next decade or two,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Doucher couldn't wait for more research; she needed help and
answers immediately. Luckily, she had extraordinary initiative and
enormous support, from her family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   But she strongly felt that other lesbians with cancer shouldn't
have to struggle to get support and information.
</P>
<P>
   ``She felt she had had to go through it alone at first,'' said
friend Jill Ruhlman. ``She didn't want anyone else to have to go
through that.''
</P>
<P>
   So Doucher conceived a support group for lesbians with cancer
and their partners. Co-founded with McGehee and another friend,
Sherry Hale, the Atlanta Lesbian Cancer Initiative began holding
weekly support groups meetings in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Doucher was among five national breast cancer
activists, including entertainer Rosie O'Donnell, who were
recognized for their work by the National Breast Cancer Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than 2 years old, the Atlanta initiative is thriving.
In addition to the support group, it holds a series of monthly
workshops on grief and bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, it published the metro area's first lesbian-,
gay- and bisexual-friendly physician list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physician list goes beyond the scope of AIDS and cancer
and will hopefully help people in our community make choices about
health care providers,'' said McGehee, the organization's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   The group also recently presented its first community award: the
Dennie Doucher Healing Angel Award, to Dr. Janice Galleshaw, a
metro oncologist.
</P>
<P>
   Despite removal of her right breast in 1992, Doucher's cancer
refused to go away.
</P>
<P>
   The second time it appeared, it attacked her bones. Doucher
underwent chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant. She tried
alternative treatments, including a macrobiotic diet and Chinese
herbs. The third time, cancer struck her brain. She underwent
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, cancer reappeared in her brain and spread
to her liver. On Feb. 12, she died, at age 46 _ by all accounts a
soul at rest, a healed spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even some lesbians ask me why we need a separate support
group,'' McGehee said, wryly. ``It's because lesbians don't need to
face potential negative reactions when they're going through a
life-threatening illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``All their energy needs to go toward healing.

their breasts and how their husbands or boyfriends reacted. She
hated having to explain her sexuality, instead of having her
illness explained to her.
</P>
<P>
   With characteristic verve, Doucher set out to learn as much
possible about her disease. She found that, far from being an
affliction only of straight women, breast cancer is thought to be a
greater problem for lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   She also found that healing would take much more than doctors
and pills.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer doctors have long suspected that lesbian women are at
greater risk for breast cancer, from anecdotal evidence that they
tend to be heavier, undergo cancer screenings only sporadically and
have children late or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   But no one had tested this hypothesis until September, when
researchers completed the first study to compare breast cancer risk
factors of lesbian and heterosexual women. The study, which
involved 1,019 women from 1995 to 1997, concluded that lesbians
indeed have higher weight-height ratios and fewer pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still too early for us to develop specific mammography
guidelines for lesbians, but our study shows the importance of
encouraging lesbians to seek medical care on a regular basis,''
said Dr. Stephanie Roberts, medical director at Lyon-Martin Women's
Health Services in San Francisco, where the study was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recommend a mammogram every year for women after turning
40. Regardless of sexual activity, women 18 and older should have
annual gynecological and clinical breast exams conducted by a
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But many lesbians visit a gynecologist rarely or never, thinking
the annual exams are for women at risk of getting pregnant or
catching a sexually transmitted disease from a male partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many lesbians report that it's been over three years since
they had their last Pap smear,'' said Dr. Jocelyn White of the Gay
and Lesbian Medical Association, a national organization with 2,000
members.
</P>
<P>
   The Pap smear, which shows cervical abnormalities, and other
regular tests can detect cancer in its earliest stages, when it is
easier to treat. Finding cancer at a later stage generally means a
poorer chance for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Another breast cancer risk factor is not having children, or
having them at a later age, as many lesbians do. Being pregnant has
health benefits: During pregnancy, the body's levels of the female
hormone estrogen drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many cancers, specifically breast cancer, are
estrogen-dependent,'' said Linda McGehee, (cq) a close friend of
Doucher's and a faculty member at Georgia State University's
nursing school. ``Lesbians who choose not to have children, or have
them later in life, have more exposure to estrogen.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting lesbians into doctor's offices may take more than
convincing them they should go.
</P>
<P>
   Health care costs are a major barrier. Lesbians generally can't
join spousal health insurance plans, and women typically earn less
money than men. Annual gynecological exams cost $125 to $175, and
mammograms can add $100 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many lesbians fear discrimination and poor treatment if
they reveal their sexual status.
</P>
<P>
   Bev Baker, executive director of the Mary-Helen Mautner Project
for Lesbians With Cancer in Washington, has heard some appalling
tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesbians have been abused in the health care system,'' Baker
bluntly said. ``Once their health care providers find out they're
lesbians, many women have been left flat on their backs, feet in
the stirrups.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviewing lesbians with cancer about their health care
experiences, McGehee found that women felt either very good or very
bad about how their doctors treated them and their partners.
Sometimes the patient's partner was ignored; in other cases, the
doctor made special efforts to talk to the partner and educate her
about her loved one's illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical community needs to address these issues,'' White
said. ``Until physicians can work effectively with lesbians, they
won't be able to work with all patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians also need more information, specifically about the
incidence of breast cancer among lesbians. Only further studies can
determine this statistic, because current tracking methods such as
the National Tumor Registry don't differentiate by sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco study found that lesbians are more than twice
as likely as heterosexual women to require breast biopsies
performed on lumps, to determine whether they are cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the study didn't find that lesbians were more
likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than straight women _ but
the overall average age of the women in the study was 43. The risk
of breast cancer increases with age, with 77 percent of new
diagnoses occurring among women 50 and older, according to the
American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   The lead researchers themselves say their study had significant
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Future study needs to be done that gets at different economic
groups, different geographic areas,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and her research team will soon begin a three-year study
of 5,000 lesbian and heterosexual women, funded by California's
Breast Cancer Research Program. The study will target women older
than 40.
</P>
<P>
   Lesbian health specialists are anxiously awaiting a report on
lesbian health research priorities by the Institute of Medicine, a
part of the National Academy of Sciences. The report, expected in
November, will address the extent of knowledge of rates of cancer,
STDs, hypertension and substance abuse among lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``That report is very likely to shape how we look at lesbians'
health over the next decade or two,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Doucher couldn't wait for more research; she needed help and
answers immediately. Luckily, she had extraordinary initiative and
enormous support, from her family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   But she strongly felt that other lesbians with cancer shouldn't
have to struggle to get support and information.
</P>
<P>
   ``She felt she had had to go through it alone at first,'' said
friend Jill Ruhlman. ``She didn't want anyone else to have to go
through that.''
</P>
<P>
   So Doucher conceived a support group for lesbians with cancer
and their partners. Co-founded with McGehee and another friend,
Sherry Hale, the Atlanta Lesbian Cancer Initiative began holding
weekly support groups meetings in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Doucher was among five national breast cancer
activists, including entertainer Rosie O'Donnell, who were
recognized for their work by the National Breast Cancer Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than 2 years old, the Atlanta initiative is thriving.
In addition to the support group, it holds a series of monthly
workshops on grief and bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, it published the metro area's first lesbian-,
gay- and bisexual-friendly physician list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physician list goes beyond the scope of AIDS and cancer
and will hopefully help people in our community make choices about
health care providers,'' said McGehee, the organization's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   The group also recently presented its first community award: the
Dennie Doucher Healing Angel Award, to Dr. Janice Galleshaw, a
metro oncologist.
</P>
<P>
   Despite removal of her right breast in 1992, Doucher's cancer
refused to go away.
</P>
<P>
   The second time it appeared, it attacked her bones. Doucher
underwent chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant. She tried
alternative treatments, including a macrobiotic diet and Chinese
herbs. The third time, cancer struck her brain. She underwent
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, cancer reappeared in her brain and spread
to her liver. On Feb. 12, she died, at age 46 _ by all accounts a
soul at rest, a healed spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even some lesbians ask me why we need a separate support
group,'' McGehee said, wryly. ``It's because lesbians don't need to
face potential negative reactions when they're going through a
life-threatening illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``All their energy needs to go toward healing.

 &HT;    Procedure involves lots of pressure but usually little pain
 &HT;    By Sarah Franquet
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our experts: Dr. Kristine Thayer, a Palm Beach County surgeon
who specializes in breast diseases, and Melanie Nielsen, a
radiologic technologist and manager of the Comprehensive Breast
Center at Good Samaritan Medical Center in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What exactly is a mammogram?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is an X-ray of the breast that can detect cancers. There
are two kinds. Screening mammograms are for routine maintenance and
can detect cancers before they can be felt. A diagnostic mammogram
is for a woman who has felt a lump or has other complaints such as
tenderness, dimpling, breast pain, swelling or nipple discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When should I have my first mammogram?
</P>
<P>
   A. The American Cancer Society and others recommend you have a
baseline mammogram (your first one, used for crucial comparisons in
later tests) at age 40 and have one screening mammogram every year
after. These recommendations are controversial; some groups
recommend mammograms every two years for women 40 to 49. But Thayer
says plenty of scientific evidence shows that yearly screening
reduces the number of breast cancer deaths. She also says tumors
grow more quickly in younger women, so early detection is crucial.
(For all women, a monthly self examination is recommended.)
</P>
<P>
   If you have a first-degree relative (mother, sister or daughter)
who has had breast cancer, ask your doctor when you should start
having regular mammograms. el3
</P>
<P>
   Q. How much does it cost?
</P>
<P>
   A. Mammograms usually run from $75 to $125. Unfortunately, many
women won't spend that kind of money on themselves. But Thayer says
they need to keep in mind that it's for the whole family. ``They
are the caregivers, and if something happens to them, it affects
the whole family,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   (Also, during October, National Breast Cancer Awareness Month,
many facilities offer reduced rates.)
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do I choose a facility?
</P>
<P>
   A. Whether you have a mammogram at a hospital, a women's center
or your gynecologist's office, make sure the facility has Food and
Drug Administration and American College of Radiology
certifications. This ensures that basic standards are met.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society (phone: 616-9370) has a list of
accredited facilities and information on reduced-rate screenings.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions to ask: How does the facility handle your
results? Do you know right away?
</P>
<P>
   Does the facility offer breast examinations along with your
mammogram?
</P>
<P>
   About how long is each patient there? Are they efficient at
getting women in and out?
</P>
<P>
   Who can I talk to if I have questions or need more information?
</P>
<P>
   Q. What exactly is going to happen during my visit?
</P>
<P>
   A. Melanie Nielsen describes a visit to Good Samaritan's center.
As you check in, you'll fill out a patient history form. Questions
include: Do you have any family members with breast cancer? At what
age did you start your menstrual period? Have you ever had breast
surgery?
</P>
<P>
   At this point, a breast examination by a nurse practitioner is
offered. (This is called a Clinical Breast Examination and, along
with self-examination and mammograms, is an important part of a
woman's health care.) You can also watch a video or get private
instruction on how to perform self-exams.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the technologist will perform a screening mammogram,
which gives radiologists two views of each breast. You will undress
from the waist up, and the technologist will place your breast on a
Plexiglas plate, gently pulling the breast tissue away from your
chest walls. Keep in mind that breast tissue extends from your
clavicle to your bra line and from your sternum to your lymph nodes
underneath your arm. That's a lot of chest to cover.
</P>
<P>
   The top Plexiglas paddle will move down to flatten your breast
(the latest machines let the technologist control this with a foot
pedal). She will ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds
while she takes the image. Once the exposure is over, the
compression automatically releases. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   A radiologist will look at the X-rays, interpret them and make a
report. The radiologist is looking for the unusual _ asymmetry,
masses or anything that stands out from normal breast tissue. At
Good Samaritan, they try to give you the report right away. If the
radiologist is unavailable to read the X-rays, the center will
notify you later that day, or the next morning. They will also give
a report to your doctor, and you will receive a letter explaining
what was found.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The big question. Does it hurt?
</P>
<P>
   A. Some women may tell you it hurts. Others say it's a piece of
cake. Most admit it can be a little uncomfortable. It involves
pulling and compressing your breast, but it feels different for
every woman. Nielsen says the majority of women have no problem at
all. A good technologist knows this is high-anxiety time and is
very sensitive to you and your body. So are the newest machines,
which are designed to help eliminate a lot of the discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   If it does becomes painful, tell the technologist. She can work
with you more and try to make adjustments. But the main point here
is to get adequate compression. If that doesn't happen, you will
have gone through this for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how several women describe the feeling:
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it didn't actually hurt. It just feels a little weird
because your breast usually isn't squished like that. I didn't know
my breast could be flattened so much. There's pressure, but pain?
No. It's not fun, but it's no huge deal. Look at it this way:
having a PAP smear is a little uncomfortable, too, but you have
those annually, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's painless. My breast tissue is fibrous and thick and it
takes a little longer for the X-ray part. I'd describe it as firm
pressure. It did feel a little weird having a woman fondling my
breasts, though!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't hurt. It's very uncomfortable though. Pressure is a
good word. Part of the concern is that this huge cold machine is
compressing and you don't know when it's going to stop. And, you're
not used to your breast being handled like that. It's all pretty
impersonal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just feels like you're being smushed between two cold
plates. But it didn't hurt. You're hugging this big piece of
machinery and being smushed. It's just more awkward than painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do women ever bruise?
</P>
<P>
   A. It can happen, but not usually. This can depend on any
medication you're taking. Aspirin or certain prescription
medications can cause you to bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do smaller- or larger-breasted women have more discomfort?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Nielsen hears comments all the time from small-breasted
women who think large-breasted women will have more pain, and
vice-versa. But size doesn't matter. It all depends on the
sensitivity of your breasts. If you have lumpy breasts, you may
have a little more discomfort. Nielsen says it may help to avoid
caffeine two weeks before your mammogram is scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Q. For very flat-chested women, it seems there's really nothing
there to compress. How does that work?
</P>
<P>
   A. Keep in mind, even men can get mammographies. Everyone has
skin and some amount of breast tissue. ``We just work with the
patient,'' says Nielsen. There is always something to compress.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the radiation harmful?
</P>
<P>
   A. Twenty years ago, that was a legitimate concern. Now, you are
exposed to more radiation on a transcontinental flight than during
a mammogram.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm really nervous. What can I do to make this whole thing
easier?
</P>
<P>
   A. A few things to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
   Technologists are trained to give you the maximum privacy and to
treat you with sensitivity. Some techs strike up a conversation and
before you know it, it's all over. So tell her you're nervous and
talk to her about your fears.
</P>
<P>
   The first time is the hardest because it's all a little unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Wear a two-piece outfit. That way, you have to undress only from
the waist up.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule your appointment after your period when your breasts
are not so tender.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have implants. Does that affect my mammogram?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. Extra views of the breast are taken and a specialized
technique is used so the entire breast can be imaged. But implants
do not affect your ability to get a good mammogram. Also don't
worry about the process rupturing an implant. There's not enough
pressure involved. In fact, mammograms can be used to detect
abnormalities with your implants.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What if they find something?
</P>
<P>
   A. If an abnormality does show up, the radiologist may recommend
more views be taken or an ultrasound given. It all depends on what
the area in question looks like. The radiologist would call your
doctor, and you would all discuss the next step.
</P>
<P>
   This fear too often keeps women from having a mammogram. But
Thayer emphasizes that finding something is not a bad thing. ``It
used to be that we couldn't do anything,'' she said. ``Now, we
can't prevent breast cancer from happening, but if we catch it
early, you don't have to die from it anymore.'' FACT BOX: Breast
cancer facts 95 percent of breast cancer cases occur in women age
40 and over. In Florida, 27 percent of women over the age of 40
(almost 1 million) have never had a mammogram. Breast cancer is
usually found in the upper, outer part of the breast, but it can
occur anywhere in the breast. Most women _ about 80 percent _ who
get breast cancer do not have a sister or mother who has breast
cancer. Nearly 97 percent of women who are diagnosed with breast
cancer at an early stage survive for more than five years. In 1998,
11,800 women in Florida will be diagnosed with breast cancer and
2,900 women will die. These high numbers can be partly attributed
to demographics _ nearly 1.9 million women are over 60, and more
than 65 percent of all breast cancers occur in women age 60 and
over. 72 percent of the breast cancers diagnosed in Florida are
found in the early stages of the disease. Source: American Cancer

 &HT;    Show's storyline about breast-feeding sparks info campaign
 &HT;    By A. Scharnhorst
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In brilliant color on network television, the
dead baby is rushed into a hospital emergency room _ starved to
death because the infant's breast-feeding mother didn't understand
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   The horrifying story _ which aired Wednesday night on the CBS
drama ``Chicago Hope'' _ may make gripping television drama, but
national and local breast-feeding advocates are incensed.
</P>
<P>
   The episode, titled ``The Breast and the Brightest,'' has
sparked a national counter-information campaign designed to assure
mothers that breast-feeding is not dangerous for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a national advocate spotted the storyline on the
``Chicago Hope'' home page on the Internet. The movement was born.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of WIC Directors _ the group for
administrators of federal Women, Infants and Children programs _
sent out an ``Action Alert,'' warning its members about the
potentially harmful effects of the episode. The national La Leche
League, an organization devoted to educating breast-feeding
mothers, posted a warning on its Web site. Locally, the Palm Beach
County Health Department urged local advocates to call CBS
affiliate WPEC-TV to express their concerns about the plot.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday afternoon, the television station had received up
to two dozen calls on the topic, said program manager Donn Colee.
Even before the calls started, the station had decided to produce
and air a segment on breast-feeding for its 11 p.m. news Wednesday,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good story that's going to run,'' he said Wednesday
afternoon. ``We went with...a lactation consultant on a visit with
the mother of newborn twins.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS encouraged local stations to run such items, as it often
does with Chicago Hope episodes, said a network spokeswoman who
refused to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   And, even if the local station does not do a news piece on the
issue, the Chicago Hope episode should not mislead parents, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The episode is not anti breast-feeding in any way,'' she said.
``It's fictional as is all television, and having viewed it, I'd
say it's pro breast-feeding.''
</P>
<P>
   But local breast-feeding advocates say it isn't as simple as
that. This fictional story could give breast-feeding mothers
unnecessary anxiety that they're harming their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public interprets things almost literally _ it is a
concern,'' said Lou Boyes, a board-certified lactation consultant
and WIC breast-feeding coordinator in Palm Beach County. ``Because
of the lack of knowledge out there, it may be misconstrued that
this is a huge danger and it's not a danger at all if the mother is
properly informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Breast-feeding advocates are frustrated by negative publicity
because they have been working for decades to reverse the post
World War II mantra that bottle feeding was best. Only in the last
five years have the percentages of breast-feeding mothers been on
the rise again in the United States, Boyes said. Breast-feeding is
healthier for most babies and mothers in the long term than bottle
feeding, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely mothers would watch their infants starve to death
without seeking help, said Boca Raton lactation consultant Marcia
Yolman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine times out of 10, these (mothers) will just give up
breast-feeding before they would let it get to that point,'' Yolman
said.

properly informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Breast-feeding advocates are frustrated by negative publicity
because they have been working for decades to reverse the post
World War II mantra that bottle feeding was best. Only in the last
five years have the percentages of breast-feeding mothers been on
the rise again in the United States, Boyes said. Breast-feeding is
healthier for most babies and mothers in the long term than bottle
feeding, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely mothers would watch their infants starve to death
without seeking help, said Boca Raton lactation consultant Marcia
Yolman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine times out of 10, these (mothers) will just give up
breast-feeding before they would let it get to that point,'' Yolman
said.

 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before you can check it twice, you have to make your
list.
</P>
<P>
   Now's a good time.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, now is an excellent time to start your holiday shopping
and squirrel away some gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the Thanksgiving push comes, it's boom! You are in
competition with the world for the same item, the lines are long
and it's not as much fun,'' warns Atlantan Robyn Freedman Spizman,
author of ``The Perfect Present: The Ultimate Guide for Every
Occasion'' (Crown Publishers, $16). ``Now, you can find specials,
save money and put more thought into your presents.''
</P>
<P>
   To warm up, we suggest starting with those presents you know
you'll need _ to give hosts and hostesses, to stuff into stockings
and to pull out when that unexpected person arrives bearing a gift.
</P>
<P>
   We've done some early scouting for you and offer these ideas,
all of them under $25. So go ahead; get going. You'll thank us in
December.
</P>
<P>

   Candy wrap: Help the hostess save her party frock with this
candy-striped apron. It'll look perfect on him, too, at next

</P>
<P>
   For the bar: For the thrill of the spill, a cocktail bar towel

 &HT;    Girl's letters to `big big world' yield book of intriguing
replies
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Coca-Cola Co. had printed menorahs on its soda cans
during the holidays, Naomi Shavin might still be waiting for her 15
minutes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   But Coke didn't, so now the 7-year-old from Sandy Springs is in
the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Naomi, who is Jewish, was feeling left out by
Coke's Santa Claus imagery. At the urging of her father, Mark, she
wrote the soft drink giant to ask why it didn't put Jewish symbols
on its cans. The company responded with a polite explanation: Coke
avoids religious symbolism, it said, and Santa's not religious.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi, then 5, was pretty impressed. She went on to write other
letters, typed by her dad for clarity, posing questions or making
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 58 letters later, Naomi has published a book called ``Naomi
Wants to Know: Letters From a Little Girl to the Big Big World''
(Fairview Press, $12.95). The book contains Naomi's letters, the
illustrations she drew to accompany them and the responses they
generated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Naomi asked Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: ``Are
you in charge of all the people in the United States of America?
Have you ever made a mistake?''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg replied: ``I am not in charge of all the people in the
United States, but I work hard to do my judging job well. And yes,
I have made many mistakes, but I try to learn from them so that I
will not make the same mistake twice.''
</P>
<P>
   _ She wrote to the National Labor Relations Board: ``I've got a
lot of problems with me and my little brother Adam. ... He talks
all the time. It keeps me up and I have nightmares that keep me up
and it's enough for me. Will you please try to solve my problems?''
</P>
<P>
   Chairman William B. Gould IV replied: ``I am not sure I can
solve the problems between you and Adam, but here are a few
suggestions. Since you are older than Adam and more grown up you
have a special leadership responsibility to show him the way. Maybe
if you are always willing to share your toys with Adam and never
hit him or pull his hair he will learn by your good example.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Naomi wrote to a homeless person at the Atlanta Union Mission:
``I want to give you a present. ... I'm sending a Barbie. I'd like
to give you toys every weekend, but I don't have that many to
spare.''
</P>
<P>
   A girl, Irece Martin, wrote back: ``I am the one (who) got the
Barbie you sent as a gift. I just like to write you back and thank
you so much for thinking about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Naomi met Irece at the mission, and the girls played
happily.
</P>
<P>
   _ She wrote to Sen. John Glenn: ``Here's a joke for you. My
grandmother is 80 years old. I can't imagine her driving a
spaceship because she can't drive a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn replied with what appears to be a form letter, telling
Naomi that she too could travel in space. ``As long as you continue
to study and work hard you can achieve anything.''
</P>
<P>
   _ She put a note in a bottle and floated it down the
Chattahoochee: ``What's it like down the river? Do you see any
canoes?''
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, fourth-grader Dale Bailey, who lives 100 miles
downstream, replied: ``I found your letter. ... I was with my Uncle
Glenn and my dad Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Naomi wrote back to Dale, asking him to send her a
picture of him. Which he did.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi's book will hit stores this month, but Naomi seems
unaffected by the attention it's generated among her friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really that excited. My dad doesn't want me to get the
big head,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But it might be kind of hard not to.
</P>
<P>
   She's already pocketed a $3,500 advance from her publisher and
flown to Hollywood to do ``The Roseanne Show.'' (cq) The star
treated Naomi to her first limo ride, her first plane ride, a
computer and a trip to Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi will hold her first book signing from 7 to 9 tonight at
Borders Books in the Perimeter Village shopping center in Dunwoody.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Shavin, an executive producer for Fox 5 News, encouraged
his daughter to write letters shortly after she learned the
alphabet. It was a way of bonding; When Dad went home from work, he
would help Naomi practice her writing skills.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her early success in publishing, Naomi said she doesn't
want to be a writer when she grows up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a mom,'' she said. ``I'm not sure what else.''

 &HT;    `Pleasantville' star involved for the substance, brilliance of
new film
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO, Ontario _ Jeff Daniels looks right at home behind the
ice cream counter in ``Pleasantville.'' As mild-mannered soda jerk
Mr. Johnson, Daniels discovers spontaneity, creativity and romance
when living color comes to the black-and-white world of a 1950s
television sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   And who better to personify artistic passion in smalltown
America than Daniels? More than 10 years ago, the actor abandoned
Hollywood to return to his hometown of Chelsea, Mich. There he
founded the Purple Rose Theatre Company, dedicated to developing
Midwestern playwrights, directors, designers and actors, while
continuing to expand his stage and screen career.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels calls ``Pleasantville'' the best movie he's ever made.
When your credits include the Oscar-winning ``Terms of
Endearment,'' Woody Allen's ``The Purple Rose of Cairo'' and
Jonathan Demme's ``Something Wild,'' that's quite a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a hotel suite prior to the film's premiere last month at the
Toronto International Film Festival, Daniels recalled how he passed
on other projects while waiting for first-time director Gary Ross
to roll the cameras amid repeated production delays. ``I'm turning
down work left and right to do this, because I wanted to be a part
of it,'' he explained. ``I loved what it said.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels' agents were screaming at him all the while, unable to
fathom his devotion to the comic fable by the Academy
Award-nominated screenwriter of ``Big and Dave.'' ``So I said,
`You'll see, you'll see. It's just something I'll be proud to be
in,' '' Daniels said. ``And I am. I really am.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' is a smart social satire in the guise of a
modern-day fairy tale about two '90s teens transported into a
``Leave It to Beaver'' -like television show. Ross wrote the film,
which opens today, in reaction to Newt Gingrich's Republican
``Contract With America.'' He also drew inspiration from his
father's experience as a blacklisted screenwriter during the
McCarthy era. What starts as an entertaining twist on ``Back to the
Future'' becomes a richly layered allegory about family values,
conformity, censorship and racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an intelligent response to the right-wing powers that be
that want to determine what pleasant is and why we should all
strive to achieve that,'' Daniels said. ``Which of course is a room
they're already living in. And Gary's script is going, `No, wait a
minute.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The film's genius is marrying its message to a mainstream
commercial hook instead of shouting it from a soap box, the actor
noted. Tobey Maguire (``The Ice Storm'') and Reese Witherspoon
(``Freeway'') are California twins who, while arguing over a
television remote control left by a mysterious TV repairman played
by Don Knotts, are beamed into the nostalgic sitcom,
``Pleasantville.'' Introducing the denizens of the fictional '50s
suburb to sex, art and ideas, they set off a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Johnson is the first to be affected, becoming a wildly
expressive painter after being exposed to vibrant works by Picasso
and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to make everything look like it's happening for
first time in whatever we do as actors, but here's a guy with no
life, no childhood, no background _ no other life other than what
his life is on that show, which is limited in all that he knows,''
Daniels said of his character. ``So here are all these things that
he's exposed to through Tobey Maguire's character, and you get to
realize it and feel it and see it for the first time on camera, all
the time. It was just a thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels was aware of similarities between ``Pleasantville'' and
``The Purple Rose of Cairo,'' in which he played a movie idol who
steps off the screen and into the real-life world of Mia Farrow,
but was so ``blown away'' by Ross' script that he didn't care about
any possible comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``Pleasantville's'' conscious symbolism is meant to
recall the McCarthy era, as well as recent attempts to sanitize the
National Endowment for the Arts, in hopes of awakening young
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want you to break rules. We want you to rebel. We want you
dig down and create new work of whatever. I just love that the film
speaks to that, and I hope long after people walk out that young
and old really just walk away with that. Even if it's some Dayton
housewife just going, `You know what, I'm going to start baking
apple pies again, because I was good.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it goes there!'' he exclaimed, laughing. ``Whatever!''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, 43, began his career in theater at Central Michigan
University before moving on to New York's famous Circle Repertory
Theatre. He earned a Drama Desk nomination for best supporting
actor as Jed in Lanford Wilson's ``Fifth of July,'' and won and
Obie Award for the Circle Rep production of ``Johnny Got His Gun.''
He most recently appeared in the Broadway production of Wilson's
``Redwood Curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels made his screen debut in the 1981 film version of E.L.
Doctorow's ``Ragtime.'' His nearly 30 films also include ``Speed,''
``Dumb &AMP; Dumber,'' ``Gettysburg'' and ``Fly Away Home.'' He will
next be seen in Disney's take on the '60s sitcom, ``My Favorite
Martian.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking stability for his family and thinking his movie career
would never last, Daniels returned to Chelsea, near Ann Arbor,
around the time of 1986's ``Something Wild.'' He founded his
theater company there seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our corner of the country, the Midwest, is so often
overlooked,'' he said. In addition to developing regional talent,
Purple Rose commissions plays written by or written about people
from the Midwest. Pulitzer Prize-winner Wilson faced the same
requirement _ plus Daniels' request for ``two jokes'' _ for his
latest play, ``Book of Days,'' whose world premiere was produced by
PRTC last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, write about us,'' Daniels pleaded. ``We're smart
people, too. We're not just something that you fly over on your way
to New York or LA. I mean, the joke is, the reason they invented
nonstops was because nobody wants to see the Midwest, and you start
to feel that way if you live there, which I do. So we created the
theater company to be about and for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're coming,'' he said. ``They're coming in droves.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels himself has written seven plays for Purple Rose,
including ``Escanaba in Da Moonlight,'' which he has adapted as a
screenplay and plans to direct next year. His latest play, ``Boom
Town,'' which he also directed, premiered last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   When not on a movie set, the actor can be seen around town,
driving his three children _ ages 7, 10 and 13 _ to school, or the
boys to hockey practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that,'' Daniels said, warmly. ``It takes me out of the
spotlight and puts it on them. But the theater company and the
creativity of being around Gary Ross and (``Pleasantville''
co-stars) Joan Allen and Bill Macy, people like that, it's
inspiring. It's a level, those kind of creative thinkers, I
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   That was part of the reason he created Purple Rose, he
explained, to gather the best creative people he could from around
Michigan, bringing them together in a small town not unlike
``Pleasantville.'' ``It's worked,'' Daniels said. ``It's made the
whole move to Michigan work.''

 &HT;    Antique ivory tusk bought from family for $11,300
 &HT;    By Cathy Mong
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Judy Bailey named it ``Nathan'' and hoped to keep
the antique ivory tusk in the family, but a private buyer paid
$11,300 Wednesday at auction for the rare, 11-pound Narwhal whale
tooth.
</P>
<P>
   The spiral tusk was auctioned by Kramer and Kramer at the Preble
County Fairgrounds in Eaton, along with hundreds of antiques and
remnants from 79-year-old Martha Bailey Horner's days as Brookville
Hardware operator and a homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   Auctioneer John Kramer emphasized that Horton's ownership
predated the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, allowing the
sale of the tooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had anything that's taken this much work in my 25
years as an auctioneer,'' Kramer quipped. Interest in the ivory
came from every corner of the United States, Asia and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding started at $2,000. Horton's son, Robert Bailey, 54, who
used to chase his older brother with the spear in his mom's shop,
flipped his numbered card at Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruner Arena crowd hushed as the price jumped $1,000 with
each hand signal or nod.
</P>
<P>
   At $10,000 Judy Bailey breathed, ``there goes my car . . . ''
and Horton, seated in a motorized wheelchair next to Bailey,
elbowed her son and shot him an admonishing look.
</P>
<P>
   At $11,300 Bailey shook his head and Barry Harper of Eaton, who
was bidding for someone who wants to remain anonymous, received
pats of congratulations from those around him.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Bailey sighed.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband shrugged, walked off and said, ``I hated to see it
go, but it's gone.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One banana, two bananas, three bananas, four.
Monkeys can count.
</P>
<P>
   That discovery, announced Thursday by scientists at Columbia
University, rattles the foundations of some long-held assumptions
on what it means to be human.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, scientists have believed that the ability to
distinguish between different quantities of things _ two bananas
are fewer than three bananas _ depended on the uniquely human
capacity for language.
</P>
<P>
   Although several different species _ pigeons, rats, parrots and
others, including infant humans _ have been shown to respond
differently to very simple differences in quantities of objects,
the ability to count was believed impossible without having words
like one-two-three-four-five to ``represent'' numerical value.
</P>
<P>
   While they don't do algebra, Rosencrantz and Macduff(cq), a pair
of rhesus monkeys in the university's Primate Cognition Laboratory,
earned passing grades on problems that clearly involved numerical
representation.
</P>
<P>
   In a report in Friday's edition of the journal Science,
researchers Herbert S. Terrace and Elizabeth Brannon describe a
series of training sessions in which the two monkeys were shown
groups of symbols displayed on a touch-sensitive video screen.
</P>
<P>
   Each group had from one to four symbols _ one triangle, two
bananas, three hearts and four apples, for example. Each time one
of the monkeys touched the pictures in ascending order _ such as
one square, then two trees, then three ovals, then four flowers _
he received a banana-flavored food pellet. If he made an error, the
screen turned black for several seconds and a new trial began with
different pictures.
</P>
<P>
   This ``video game,'' which the researchers say the monkeys now
clearly enjoy, trained Rosencrantz and Macduff to perform cognitive
serial tasks without verbal instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Each monkey's ability to correctly select the four quantities
was significantly above random, and improved with added lessons.
</P>
<P>
   But were they thinking _ and counting _ without language, or
simply learning to arrange the groups in four recognizable
categories?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, the psychologist introduced a new set of symbols in
groups of one to nine. Rosencrantz and Macduff never had seen
groups with five or more symbols.
</P>
<P>
   In the new exercises, the monkeys were presented with pairs of
grouped symbols, rather than sets of four.
</P>
<P>
   When each group in a pair had fewer than five symbols _ the
quantities the monkeys had learned to work with _ they picked the
smaller group first more than 90 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   When one group had four symbols or fewer and the other had five
or more _ such as two apples and seven chess pieces _ the monkeys'
ability to pick the smaller group first was still better than 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And when both groups in a pair contained more than five symbols,
the monkeys' scores still were above 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Their scores were significantly higher when the ``distance''
between numbers was greatest _ eight symbols and two symbols,
versus five and four, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Brannon and Terrace believe the experiment is strong evidence
that arithmetic and language evolved separately and that number
skills preceded human speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Language is a complex social skill, whereas counting can be
learned by the
</P>
<P>
   individual,'' Terrace observed. ``Counting is useful in foraging
for food,
</P>
<P>
   assessing a group of predators or ordering the number of
dominant males in
</P>
<P>
   one's group.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Terrace is director of the Primate Cognition Laboratory, and
Brannon is a graduate student researcher.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment ``elegantly'' showed that even without language,
the animals could ``represent'' numerical meaning, Susan Carey, a
psychologist at New York University, said in a commentary also
published in the scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This demonstrates that the monkeys were capable not just of
representation of numerical order, but also of the abstraction of a
numerical rule,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, nobody knows how they did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process or processes that a monkey uses to detect the
direction of ordinal disparities remains to be determined,'' said
Brannon and Terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Learning that will require further experiments, they added.

 &HT;    Added flights help American gain edge in Austin departures
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Southwest Airlines, with its cheap fares,
no-frills flights and Dijon-and-orange 737s, has long been the
market leader in Austin skies.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, for the first time in recent history, American
Airlines edged out Southwest in the number of passenger departures
from Robert Mueller Municipal Airport.
</P>
<P>
   It is a feat American accomplished, in large part, by adding new
service to Dallas Love Field and Houston Hobby _ popular business
destinations once the exclusive domain of Southwest on flights from
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   American had 32.3 percent market share for departing passengers
in September, compared with 32 percent for Southwest, according to
city figures. But when it comes to total market share _ service for
both departing and arriving passengers _ Southwest still has a
fractional lead over American, a lead that last month amounted to
about 120 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as close as you get to war in peace time,'' said Ed
Stewart, spokesman for Dallas-based Southwest, which has 41 daily
flights to Austin, including 14 to Love Field.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said that Southwest is not alarmed by American's
increased strength in the market and its move into Love Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen a major drop,'' Stewart said. ``It's a pimple
in the main scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the leader when it comes to (Love Field),'' he said.
``We always have been and we always intend to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But American has become more aggressive in Austin and the result
has landed a bigger chunk of business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, American's Austin market share was about 22 percent,
compared with Southwest's 39 percent, according to the City of
Austin Department of Aviation. In 1995, American had 24 percent of
the market, while Southwest had 35 percent. Last year, American
jumped to 27 percent, while Southwest had 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   American considers Austin one of a handful of ``focus cities'' _
non-hub cities where the airline has placed more emphasis. Other
focus cities include Boston, New York City, San Jose, Calif. and
Los Angeles, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, American has more than doubled its
daily departures from Austin, from 19 to 40. Some of these have
been sought-after nonstop flights to popular destinations such as
San Jose and Miami. Last month, the airline added daily one-stop
service to New York's LaGuardia Airport through Houston Hobby.
Austin business leaders long have sought nonstop service to
LaGuardia.
</P>
<P>
   In late summer, the airline launched its new service between
Austin and Dallas and Houston. Although it initially was more of a
defensive move on American's part to combat efforts by Southwest to
expand its number of interstate flights from Dallas Love Field, the
new flights are proving successful, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southwest is still carrying more people than we are into Love
Field,'' said Tim Smith, spokesman for Fort Worth-based American.
``We're the new kids on the block.'' In addition to more flights,
the airline has switched to larger planes on some routes to
accommodate demand. American may be the new kid, but it already is
making its presence known. Earlier this month, American Airlines
snatched away the contract for travel by Texas government employees
from Southwest. The contract is worth well in excess of $1 million.
American expects the contract to generate about 35,000 trips a
year.
</P>
<P>
   And while plans call for American to have five gates at the new
Austin Bergstrom International Airport when it opens next spring _
the same number as it has at Robert Mueller _ it's likely that it
will add others, said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Additional gates will be available,'' he said. ``We could go
to six, if there's the opportunity and the need.''

 &HT;    Intelliquest posts 3rd-quarter profit
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ IntelliQuest Information Group Inc. said
Wednesday that a year of restructuring allowed it to return to
profitability in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin company reported a profit of $701,000, or 8 cents a
share, on revenues of $13.8 million. During the same quarter a year
ago, the company earned $1.3 million, or 16 cents a share, on
revenues of $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a year of restructuring, we're beginning to see the
payoff on the bottom line,'' said chief executive Brian Sharples.
``The next thing we need to show is sustained profit growth on an
annual basis, and we expect to do that in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   IntelliQuest provides marketing services to the high-tech
industry. Its databases and software help companies track product
performance and customer satisfaction. It has 404 employees, 203 of
them in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The company ran into problems during the fourth quarter of 1997
when it failed to meet revenue expectations. IntelliQuest has lost
$3.26 million in the past three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock has fallen from a 52-week high of $18.25 on Nov. 5,
1997 to a low of $4.12 1/2 on Oct. 6. Shares were unchanged at
$5.50 on Wednesday in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the restructuring, the company has brought in new
senior management, eliminated unprofitable product lines and is
consolidating operations. For example, the company is in the
process of consolidating three market research centers into one
center in the former Southwood Mall at 1601 W. Ben White Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst who follows the stock said the company must show
consistent growth before it can win back Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been very inconsistent. They're going to have to build
some momentum before anything's going to happen with the stock
price,'' said Trace Urdan of BT Alex. Brown investment bank in San
Francisco. ``Right now their challenge is to reignite investors'
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharples agreed. ``It's going to take a few quarters of showing
people that when we say we're going to do X, we do X,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other changes, the company:
</P>
<P>
   Announced that Kit Webster will join the company as chief
financial officer. Webster formerly held the same position at
Austin-based Ross Technologies Inc., which is in the process of
being liquidated.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted a defensive measure, known as a poison pill, to ward off
potential takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Repriced the company's outstanding stock options, including
options granted to members of the board, at a new grant price of
$5.
</P>
<P>
   Repurchased 270,000 shares in the past two quarters. The
company's board recently voted to buy back 850,000 more.

 &HT;    In all their glorious variety, appetizers of Italy are an
enticement
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antipasto is singular. Antipasti is plural.
</P>
<P>
   There now. You're on your way to learning about Italy's great
appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   The country's range of antipasto dishes is great, and the
intricacies in regional varieties mind-boggling. But you don't have
to learn it all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Just know that by absorbing the following 10 terms, all adapted
from John Mariani's ``The Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink''
(Broadway Books, $17), you can begin to master antipasto in all its
forms:
</P>
<P>
   -- Affettato (ah-feh-TAH-toh) _ Sliced, cold meats, including
prosciutto and mortadella.
</P>
<P>
   -- Assaggio (ah-SAH-j'yoh) _ A taste of something, a morsel or
little bit.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bocconcini (boh-kohn-CHEE-nee) _ ``Small mouthfuls.'' Also
refers to small balls of mozzarella about 1 inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bruschetta (broo-SKEH-tah) _ Toasted bread, often rubbed with
garlic and drizzled with olive oil and spread with various
toppings.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bufala (BOO-fah-lah) _ As in buffalo mozzarella. Milk from
the water buffalo is the basis for Italy's best cheese.
</P>
<P>
   -- Crostini (kroh-STEE-nee) _ Thinner than bruschetta, they are
slices of toast with toppings. They are a Tuscan specialty.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gnocchi (N'YOH-kee) _ Dumplings, usually cooked in water or
broth, but also baked. They are made with flour (sometimes
semolina), egg and often potatoes, but also Parmesan, ricotta,
spinach, pureed pumpkin and more. For antipasto, they're often
served unsauced as finger food.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mortadella (mohr-tah-DEH-lah) _ Finely ground pork meat and
lard formed into large sausages. Think bologna, but a kind so
superior it could be stamped ``made in heaven.'' Usually flavored
with peppercorns and coriander.
</P>
<P>
   -- Parmigiano (pahr-mee-J'YAH-noh) _ Cow's milk cheese made in
wheels and aged. The best is Parmigiano-Reggiano, made only in the
morning and aged at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   -- Prosciutto (proh-SHOO-toh) _ Superior ham cured in a minimum
of salt for at least 300 days (it is forbidden to use nitrites,
sugar, smoke, water or additives in the curing process). It's
usually served in paper-thin slices.

   This Italian sausage ragu, from Lorenza De'Medici's ``Lorenza's
Antipasti'' (Broadway Books, $40), works well on bruschetta but
also can be used quite successfully as a fettuccine sauce.
</P>
<P>
   10ounces sweet Italian sausages
</P>
<P>
   7ounces lean boneless pork meat
</P>
<P>
   1small carrot
</P>
<P>
   1celery rib

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   6large slices coarse country bread, 1/2 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   Peel the sausages and crumble the meat into a bowl. Finely chop
the pork, carrot, celery and onion. Peel and chop the tomatoes.
Heat half the oil in a frying pan. Add the carrot, celery and onion
and cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly,
or until the onion is translucent. Stir in the sausage meat and
pork and cook for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, fennel seeds, wine,
thyme and salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan, lower the heat
to a minimum and cook for about 1 hour, stirring from time to time
and adding a little water if necessary to keep moist.
</P>
<P>
   Uncover and let the juices evaporate completely.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the bread
slices on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for about 5 minutes,
or until barely golden, turning them once. Brush with the rest of
the oil and arrange on individual dishes. Spread with the sausage
ragu and serve immediately while still very hot.

<P>
   This recipe, also from ``Lorenza's Antipasti,'' works well as an
antipasto with drinks because, De'Medici says, the semolina coating
will be crisp enough to allow the gnocchi to become tasty finger
food.

flour, egg, cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, stirring
until well-blended. Using your hands, shape the mixture into
walnut-sized balls and roll them in the semolina to coat.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Add salt and the ricotta
gnocchi, a few at a time. Remove with a slotted spoon as soon as

   2cups jumbo lump crab meat or imitation crab meat (see notes) or
1 cup jumbo lump crab meat or imitation crab meat and 1 pound
cooked fresh lobster meat
</P>
<P>
   6lemon wedges
</P>
<P>
   Rinse squid in a colander under cold running water. Separate
bodies and tentacles, as they must be cooked in different water to
keep the tentacles from coloring the rings. Place about 1 quart
cold water in a medium pot. Add squid bodies, 1/4 cup fresh lemon
juice and 2 tablespoons salt.
</P>
<P>
   Place about 1 quart cold water in another medium pot. Add squid
tentacles, 3/4 cup fresh lemon juice and 2 tablespoons salt. Bring
both pots to a rolling boil. Lower heat to a gentle boil and cook
until squid are very tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and
run cold water directly into each pot until water is cool. Drain
the bodies, pat dry and cut into rings. Holding the tentacles, run
warm water into the pan. Under the running water, gently rub
between the palms of your hands, pushing the black specks and
colored skin from the tentacles. Use a small paring knife to scrape
the skin, if necessary. Drain well and pat dry.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the rings and tentacles in a colander. Cover with a damp
cloth and set aside to drain for about 20 minutes. Refrigerate if
not using immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Peel, devein, remove tails and butterfly shrimp. Cover with
water and bring to a boil in a small saucepan. Immediately remove
from heat, drain and refresh in cold running water. Gently press in
a clean kitchen towel to dry well. Cut into quarters. If not using
immediately, cover with a damp towel and refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   In a nonreactive bowl, whisk together the oil, remaining lemon
juice, garlic, parsley and salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Add shrimp and squid to the oil mixture. Toss to coat. Using a
slotted spoon, remove seafood from oil mixture and place on a
serving plate.
</P>
<P>
   Add crab meat to oil mixture and very gently turn to coat. Using
a slotted spoon, remove crab from oil mixture and gently fold into
the shrimp-squid mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Add lobster to the oil mixture. Gently toss to coat. Using a
slotted spoon, remove lobster from oil mixture and place on top of
salad. Discard garlic from oil mixture. Pour remaining oil mixture
over salad and serve immediately, garnished with lemon wedges.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: When purchasing fresh, whole squid, always look for those
that are clear-eyed, smooth-skinned and very fresh smelling. Have
the fishmonger clean and cut the squid to your specifications. Some
fresh squid are sold precut into rings with the tentacles removed;
however, the rings and tentacles are usually sold together. As the
squid cooks, skim off the foam that accumulates at the top.
</P>
<P>
   To butterfly shrimp: Peel and devein, leaving the tail on for
most preparations and removing it only when called for in a
specific recipe. Using a knife, make a shallow cut from head to
tail along the center but not through the shrimp and remove the
dark vein. Lay the shrimp open, deveined side up, and make shallow
cuts diagonally out from the center on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Handle the crab meat carefully so that the lumps remain whole.
But do check for cartilage and shell remnants.

   The tartness of apples weds well with pungent Gorgonzola in this
dish from De'Medici's ``Lorenza's Antipasti.'' She cautions that
fresh Gorgonzola is quite white and not too smelly.
</P>
<P>
   6apples, such as Granny Smith
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   7ounces fresh Gorgonzola cheese
</P>
<P>
   6walnuts, shelled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   Peel, core and slice apples; arrange them on a platter. Sprinkle
with lemon juice so they do not brown. Put cream and Gorgonzola in
a pan over low heat and heat until it melts, stirring with a wooden
spoon. Leave to cool, then pour on top of the apples. Sprinkle with
the walnuts. Serve immediately.

   Michele Scicolone's autumn specialty, from her ``The Antipasto
Table'' (Ecco Press, 1991), is the Sicilian dish called Fegato dei
Sette Cannoli (Liver of the Seven Cannons). The resourceful
Sicilians used inexpensive squash to make it resemble a meat dish.
</P>
<P>
   Extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1butternut squash, small pumpkin or other winter squash, (about
2 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   1/3cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/3cup chopped fresh mint, basil or flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Generously brush two jellyroll pans
with olive oil. Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Scrape out the
seeds and membranes. Peel the squash and cut into 1/4-inch-thick
slices. Arrange the squash in the pans in a single layer. Brush the
slices with additional oil. Bake for 20 minutes. Turn the slices
and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender and lightly browned.
</P>
<P>
   In a small saucepan, heat the vinegar, sugar and salt and stir
until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Arrange a single layer of
the squash in a shallow dish. Sprinkle with some of the garlic and
mint. Continue layering the remaining squash, sprinkling each layer
with herbs. Pour the vinegar mixture over all.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours before serving.

 &HT;    
 Color slides and black and white photos of Roberto Benigni and
Giorgio Cantarini in scenes from Benigni's film, ``Life Is
Beautiful.''
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Life Is Beautiful.'' That's not my commentary on the state of
the world, which might seem entirely inappropriate in view of the
stock market, Russia, the Far East and Bill Clinton.
 &HT;    ``Life Is Beautiful'' (``La Vita e Bella'') is a new movie,
modestly budgeted and one of the best films to come along in years.
It opens throughout North America in late October and November but
look for it to be around at Oscar time.
 &HT;    It's Italian with English subtitles and is set in l939 as war
envelopes Europe. The picture stars comic actor Roberto Benigni
(sometimes labeled the Italian Woody Allen) who also wrote and
directed it. He plays the naive Guido who courts and marries the
beautiful teacher Dora (played by his wife of l8 years Nicoletta
Braschi) and dreams of owning his own bookshop. He ignores the
growing incursions of Fascism into his life and the new anti-Jewish
laws until the Nazi occupation sweeps him and his son into a
concentration camp. His gentile wife, refusing to be separated from
her husband and son, is also imprisoned.
 &HT;    It starts off like a Chaplin romance crossed with a Marx
brother's farce and ends up as the spellbinding story of a father's
all encompassing love for his son.
 &HT;    While the conjunction of comedy and Holocaust makes one wince,
Benigni miraculously manages to use humor as an essential element
in the story. For in order to protect his son from the real horrors
of the death camp, Guido pretends to the youngster that the whole
experience is merely a game with bizarre rules. If the boy can hold
out, can stick to the game plan, he and only he will win the grand
prize.
 &HT;    One can only marvel at a movie that makes you laugh when you
know the only sane response is to cry, a movie that makes you come
out of the theater with a smile on your face when you know you
should be in the grip of depression. A man who can do that is not
just an actor and director _ he's a magician.
 &HT;    He could also teach Hollywood a few things. Soon after I saw
``Life Is Beautiful,'' I also saw the Robin Williams extravaganza
``What Dreams May Come,'' which came with a phenomenal price tag of
$85 million and flounders in a sea of computer generated art and
banal dialogue.
 &HT;    Then I viewed Oprah Winfrey in ``Beloved,'' which valiantly
tries to take Toni Morrison's book about a runaway slave who has
killed her own children and translate it into screen material. The
result is ``The Exorcist'' tossed into the middle of a very serious
story. Some novels should simply remain on the page.
 &HT;    Both big commercial films were supposed to be about the infinite
capacity of the human spirit to rise above the miseries of the
world. ``Life Is Beautiful'' actually shows us how to do this.
 &HT;    Made at a fraction of the cost of ``Dreams'' and ``Beloved,'' it
depends entirely on the power of the imagination, on sheer talent,
ingenuity and a simple joy in living.
 &HT;    Benigni admits making this movie was a risky business but he
hoped the early slapstick humor in Guido's romance would make the
camp scenes even more deeply felt. ``I believe laughter saves us,
it forces us to consider the other side of things, the surreal
funny side,'' he says. ``Being able to imagine prevents us from
being reduced to ashes, from being crushed like twigs. It gives us
the sense to survive the endless night.''
 &HT;    Benigni noted his initial reluctance to make a comedy that deals
with the agony of the Holocaust. ``I knew my film would bring up
some very sensitive issues. When the idea first took hold of me, it
was very much like an illumination, a revelation, and my very first
reaction was to retreat. But then I realized the retreat was caused
by fear and in the end my feelings about the story won over the
fear.''
 &HT;    Benigni says he wanted to absorb as deep an understanding as
possible of the real experience of those who lived, loved and
suffered through the camps. He consulted survivor groups and
listened to dozens of personal accounts. ``With Guido I wanted to
create a character who was totally integrated into Italian society,
who lives his life, does his job, isn't the least interested in
politics and then with one blow, his life is suddenly over. That's
the way it happened to many people.''
 &HT;    ``Life Is Beautiful'' won't get the big studio blitz that
``Dreams'' and ``Beloved'' have been given. There won't be huge
billboards all over town, but it has already won top kudos in film
festivals from Cannes to Jerusalem to Montreal. It's an antidote to
the state of affairs around us.

   Nevertheless, I'm doing my patriotic best to prepare for the
millennium when computer clocks may launch us back to 1900.
</P>
<P>
   I've stocked up on food, water and ammo for my Model 1894
Winchester, and whatever else happens, I'm sure that in six years
I'll be fully prepared for the 1906 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   In a column a couple of months ago, I knocked all the year 2000
fuss as a soft-core scare tactic by computer consultants to sell
software and services. I made fun of all the television news shows
ominously predicting that our microwaves wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the hardship. We'd have to time our Swanson's with our
Swatches.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some two-digit computer clocks would get confused, but
wouldn't it be worth it? So much for a ``Terminator'' vision of the
future. So much for computers running our lives.
</P>
<P>
   So much for arrogant computer geeks, who suddenly turn into
glorified VCR clock-resetters. It's a reassuring vision.
</P>
<P>
   What thanks did I get for trying to stem the Y2K panic? To judge
by e-mail I received after that column, there are thousands of
cultists who almost count on the collapse of civilization when the
clocks strike 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One guy wrote: ``Just wait until your paper's computer crashes
and you don't get a paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   So what? That paycheck may look good by 1900 standards, but for
what the check is worth now I can wait a while for the bookkeeping
department to find a pen and write a check the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   One guy called me stupid. Well, maybe, but I can make toast if
the mainframe powering my toaster crashes. First, rub two sticks
together and set fire to your PC. ... If I'm stupid, what about the
geniuses who built computers with only two digits to represent
years?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they needed all the memory they could get then, but maybe
in the backs of their minds they never believed that their
cobbled-together systems and programs would last into the
millennium of Arthur C. Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Or else they thought computer-targeted ICBMs would blow up the
world first.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate types, scared by computer consultants, are nervous
about what will happen and are inundating their systems people with
memos and questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   The systems managers don't really know what they'll be doing on
New Year's Eve of 1999, but they're pretty sure that if they're
watching anything go down, it won't be the ball in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is fill-in-the-blanks sci-fi. A week ago an
episode of ``Millennium'' focused on Y2K cult killers. Don't ask me
the details. ``Millennium'' self-erases after watching. All you had
to know is that a predicted worldwide computer meltdown makes for
good cults.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K is practically a cult already. ``Repent, the end is near''
has been replaced by ``Reboot, 2000 is near.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is it I'm not scared? Is it because I have an iMac that's
Y2K compliant? Yes, downloading dominatrixes, an obedient little
computer is called ``compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   This week the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion took
out half-page ads in newspapers all over the nation asking
businesses ``Are you Y2K OK?'' The ad listed 159 sponsoring
organizations. They read like a Who's Who of ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   There was the National Turkey Federation. Hey, what turkey ever
lives beyond New Year's?
</P>
<P>
   There was the Internet Society. They would be concerned. The
Internet is filled with Y2K gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Council on Foundations. Hell, they'll join
anything.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.
Try to imagine a world without people talking to themselves in cars
and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Grocery Manufacturers of America. What really
scares me is that groceries are manufactured. Returning to 1900 may
not be so bad.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that my response to the question ``Y2K OK?'' is still
``Y2Care?''

A SEASON FOR THE RECORD BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ So where do these Yankees rank with the greatest
teams of all time? First? Third? Eighth? Twenty-first?
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, how does one make one of these Yankees even address
the question?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where we rank, in all honesty,'' pitcher David
Cone said, reeking of champagne and success. ``How do you compete
with Hall of Famers from years ago? How do you compare with the
ghosts of the past? I don't know if that one has an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   You may be sure, though, that as these Yankees retire and grow
removed from the rough-and-tumble immediacy of their
accomplishment, that they will have an answer for anyone who asks.
They'll sound the way Joe Morgan sounds when he defends the 1975
Reds, or the way Sal Bando sounds when he talks about the A's of
the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they will decide that, yes, they are the best team
of all time, and they'll have some pretty inspiring math to prove
it.
</P>
<P>
   They finished the work Wednesday night in fitting manner _ a 3-0
shutout over the San Diego Padres, with their fourth starter, Andy
Pettitte, beating San Diego's best starter, Kevin Brown. In doing
so, they swept a pretty good team _ not overwhelmingly, and not
because the other team was all thumbs and elbows, but because of
what Tony Gwynn said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``This winter is not going to be tough for me, because we got
beat by a better team,'' he said without rancor or hesitation. ``It
would be different if we played lousy. To be honest with you, this
makes it a little easier to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the one hard moment for the Padres to take Wednesday
night came in the eighth inning, when Paul O'Neill chopped a ball
to first baseman Jim Leyritz and barely beat Leyritz to the bag.
That play ultimately led to the two final Yankee runs, but for the
moment, it put Brown into a near apoplectic fit. He jumped in the
air, screamed at first-base umpire Tim Tschida, then got into a
chest-to-chest shouting match with second-base umpire Jerry
Crawford, who was trying to lead Brown away from Tschida, and
finally tipped his hat to Tschida in angry sarcasm when he walked
off the field at inning's end.
</P>
<P>
   And, fittingly, given the tone of the series, Tschida had made
the correct call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest with you, at the very moment it happened I'd
have sworn he was out,'' Brown said calmly afterward. ``And yeah, I
carried on about it. But you don't put in a year of work to get to
this point and not be emotional about a call that goes against you.
Now I haven't seen a replay, and if he was safe, then I apologize.
But I don't apologize for my reaction, because you have to allow us
to do that at a time like that. I guess I should thank them for
letting me blow off steam without throwing me out.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the one true turning point in a game the Padres could
never get a grip on, because of Pettitte's brilliant work. He
didn't pitch in New York because his father was ill and because he
was the fourth-best Yankee starter, so some people thought this
might be the Padres' best shot at prolonging the series.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he gave them nothing of value upon which to build their
game. He had only one moment's problem the entire night, loading
the bases in the second, but he drew Brown with two out and retired
him on a bunt. The next time the Padres threatened, in the eighth,
they were down three runs and staring down the barrel of reliever
Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   It was done, and they knew it. Everybody knew it. This was the
way it had to be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The postgame celebration was actually kind of muted for a team
that had just finished building a monument. Derek Jeter walked up
to owner George Steinbrenner with a full bottle of Sticky-And-Fizzy
'94, yelled, ``Hold up, there, hold up, there,'' and drenched the
owner, double-breasted coat and all.
</P>
<P>
   They gathered in one corner of the clubhouse and chanted,
``Straw Man!'' for Darryl Strawberry, back home and recovering from
cancer surgery. Then they chanted, ``Scot-ty Brosius!'' for the
series MVP.
</P>
<P>
   And then they considered their place in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I suppose it's fun to argue about, but we won 125 games
and lost 50, so I'd say we have to be up there, don't we?'' Jeter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had high expectations for ourselves right from the start,''
Chili Davis said. ``The owner had high expectations for us. The
media had high expectations for us. We were hearing about `Greatest
team in history' in the middle of the season. We had nothing to do
but lose, and we didn't. When you have the best record in baseball
ever, you gotta win it all, and we did. We met everybody's
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   They even met the Padres' expectations of them, which may be the
most remarkable thing of all, since the Padres were the last people
living in denial of what now seems so obvious.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a discouraging word from the Yankee side, it came
inadvertently from general manager Brian Cashman, who leaned
against a wall outside manager Joe Torre's office and said with a
shrug, ``I guess it's all downhill from here, eh fellas?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, it probably is. But downhill is a very relative term
when you're talking about the greatest, third-greatest,
eighth-greatest or 21st-greatest team of all time. And the
beautiful thing about it is, as time goes by, the '98 Yankees will
only look better. If you don't believe that, ask any of them in
about 15 years. They'll be glad to tell you how much better they'll
be by then.

THIEVES PREY ON SEATTLE MAILBOXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE HADLEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mail is being stolen so frequently from blue street
collection boxes in Seattle that the U.S. Postal Service is
advising customers not to use them.
</P>
<P>
   And it may be years before the Postal Service can make the
city's 1,600 boxes secure again, says Postal Inspector Jim
Bordenet.
</P>
<P>
   Thieves have stolen the master key for the boxes, giving them
access to checks they then take and forge. Often, victims aren't
aware their mail has gone astray until their bank accounts are
drained.
</P>
<P>
   But the Postal Service did not issue a public warning of the
danger until questioned by the Post-Intelligencer. The warning
advises people to avoid putting checks into any blue postal boxes,
including those outside post offices.
</P>
<P>
   A Post-Intelligencer examination of the problem also found that:
</P>
<P>
   _Banks consider the forgery of stolen checks almost routine.
Seattle police estimate that 70 percent of the hundreds of forgery
cases each year are related to mail theft.
</P>
<P>
   _Local police don't consider thefts from the federal mails
within their jurisdiction unless they catch the thief in the act.
</P>
<P>
   _Federal postal inspectors, the first line of defense against
theft of the mail, say they take mail theft seriously. But many
victims say they never respond to complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to get the feds too interested in this
because there's so much of it,'' King County Sheriff's Office
spokesman John Urquhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much mail is stolen is difficult to assess. Seattle
police do not keep statistics on mail theft, considering it a
federal crime. The postal inspection service reported 26,304
arrests nationwide for mail theft between 1993 and 1997. But it
will not release figures for the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   In other cities, mail thefts have been brought under control
with the arrest of a gang that has stolen a key. But in Seattle,
master keys appear to be in the hands of many people, making the
problem more difficult to fix, said John Brugger, a spokesman for
the Postal Inspection Service in Washington, D.C. Brugger said
Seattle is the only city having the counterfeit master key problem
at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Theater technician Gail Walls found out the hard way that
mailing her bills at a blue collection box is unsafe. She dropped
payments for her phone and other bills recently into a blue mailbox
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The envelopes were stolen from the mailbox, the ink washed off
the checks with a chemical solution, and the checks were then
forged. Just about all the money in Walls' bank account
disappeared, leaving her with unpaid rent and utility bills and no
money to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   Walls was shocked when a Postal Service employee told her she
should not put her mail into the blue mailboxes on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like `Excuse me,''' she said. ``Here we have these things
and we think they're safer than (home mail boxes). I know companies
that put everything in them. Nobody's ever said anything to the
general public about this.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of citizens are being victimized. And some are
so angry about it they are taking action.
</P>
<P>
   In two Seattle neighborhoods, irate residents have placed their
own warning signs on the postal boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Why have the street boxes at all if they're not safe?
</P>
<P>
   Bordenet says the Postal Service is retrofitting them with new
locks so they will be more secure. However, the retrofitting work
is ``a multiyear project'' and he doesn't know when it will be
completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want the convenience. They want the boxes on the
street,'' Bordenet said. ``We would create a tremendous amount of
public concern if we started removing street collection boxes en
masse. That's not the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution for the moment, he said, lies with citizens,
merchants and banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of our citizens have to change their
behaviors to take account of the threat,'' Bordenet said.
</P>
<P>
   The only safe approach is to do your mailing inside a post
office, Bordenet said. Merchants and banks need to be more careful
about what checks they accept.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for the National Federation of Independent
Business in Olympia, Wash., said the Postal Service should be
alerting businesses to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like if something like this happens, there should be
notice to businesses,'' said Carolyn Logue. ``They may catch the
criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Walls has not been pleased with the reaction to the theft.
</P>
<P>
   The bank indicated that check washing is ``a pretty normal
occurrence'' and that authorities probably wouldn't do much given
that such a small amount was involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't feel like they're ever going to see anybody do
anything,'' she said. ``They laughed and said nothing will ever
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle police told Walls it wasn't their jurisdiction and that
she needed to call federal postal inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   She did, leaving her name and number. But they never called
back.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Walls is out about $1,000. ``It's everything I had,''
she said. ``My rent check, my car payment, my electricity, my
phone. All those bills that I really, really need to pay. It was a
major blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Walls is particularly upset because the bank branch has
videotape of the woman who tried to cash the washed check, yet
authorities have demonstrated little interest in pursuing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Urquhart, the spokesman for the Sheriff's Office, wasn't
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Federal postal inspectors have to involve a grand jury and get
in line at the U.S. Attorney's Office to prosecute cases, Urquhart
said. They don't want to bother with small cases.
</P>
<P>
   But postal theft can be frustrating for local authorities to
prosecute, too.
</P>
<P>
   Urquhart said if the thief is caught in the act of stealing the
mail, it's theft. If a person is caught with the mail after the
fact, it's possession of stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   But the local penalties in either case are likely to be minor,
because the value of a stolen letter _ even if it contains a $2,000
mortgage payment _ is 32 cents, Urquhart said. That makes it a
misdemeanor akin to shoplifting.
</P>
<P>
   The value doesn't go up until the thief has actually washed the
check and tried to cash it. That makes it forgery, a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Federal penalties for stealing or possessing stolen mail are
much stiffer: up to five years or a fine of $250,000 for each piece
of stolen mail, Bordenet said.

   FILM-PUPIL (Undated) _ ``Apt Pupil'' is more unpleasant than

it.

</P>
<P>
   FILM-PLEASANTVILLE (Undated) _ The biggest drawback of Gary
Ross' trapped-in-an-inane-TV-show movie, ``Pleasantville,'' is that
it has basically the same premise and theme as ``The Truman Show,''
and it's not half as good. It's visually interesting, but
incredibly flimsy.

<P>
   FILM-SOLDIER (Undated) _ Kurt Russell's new sci-fi action movie,
``Soldier,'' is nothing to write home about, but it's a bit better
than the chest-pounding, G.I. Space-Joe epic promised by its
publicity _ and better than the dismal track record of its director
Paul Anderson (``Event Horizon'') might indicate.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-HAPPINESS (Undated) _ It may seem illogical, but
``Happiness,'' an ultra dark ``comedy'' from Todd Solondz, is oddly
sympathetic in its perversity. Even though it features a pedophile
as a primary character, the film manages to eke out some sense of
compassion for its wayward, lost souls.

of it all.

`SLAM' DRAMA FINDS REASON IN RHYME 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ When actor and poet Saul Williams entered the
Washington, D.C., prison where much of ``Slam'' was filmed, he got
a warning: Stick close to the guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing the warden said when she saw me walking with
(director) Marc Levin was, `You don't need to stray too far from
Marc, because you are going to get mixed up with these prisoners
and someone's going to drag you to their cell. You fit right in.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Williams soon concluded he fit in for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized it is not random when everyone in a prison looks
like you, is around your age, has a similar background,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, `Were you afraid in there?' No! I felt a
connection to those people inside. If anything, it made me fear the
outside that has whatever infrastructure that leads those people
who all look like me into this prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 26, sits cross-legged on a hotel couch with his shoes
off and his hands in his lap. In his loose purple pants and rough
cloth shirt, he looks much more the poet than someone's idea of a
criminal.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Slam,'' opening Friday, Williams plays a street poet named
Raymond who lands in prison on a drug charge. Before he is released
on bail to await trial, he meets an outside teacher who is trying
to help inmates learn to improve themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This woman helps him focus his poetic abilities, leading to his
participation in a poetry ``slam,'' where he finds an audience for
his artistic drives.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has participated in poetry slams _ he was
discovered for the part at a slam _ was concerned that many people
come away from the movie thinking a poetry slam is a certain type
of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A slam is a competitive poetry reading. Very simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like if I were to take Shakespeare and (Alfred, Lord) Tennyson
and e.e. cummings and throw them on stage and say, `OK, you guys
have three minutes each to recite a poem. The audience is going to
boo if they don't like it and yeah if they do, and we are going to
choose three members of the audience to judge you between the
scores of 1 and 10. May the best poet win.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all a slam is: It's a competitive poetry reading. It's
not a new style of poetry. It just puts time restraints on the
poetry you recite. You can get up and read prose, you can do an
entry from your journal, you can do rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a poetry reading for people with short
attention spans,'' Williams said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Although he no longer participates in slams, Williams, who has a
master's degree in acting from New York University, believes that
the growing popularity of these vigorous poetry events is a
positive development, partly because of the way it brings so many
people together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most diverse, multicultural scene I can imagine,''
Williams said. ``You'll find aging beat poets who are, like `Poetry
is back!' and an 18 year-old girl who just discovered she's gay.
You'll find everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimark, the film's distributor, has promoted the concept of
slams as a substitute for urban violence, and to some degree the
movie seems to present that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't think it's meant to be taken as literally as
that,'' Williams said, although he believes in the preventive power
of ``people investing in themselves.'' As such, he said, ``Art is
of the utmost importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people look into themselves and find whatever helps them
find their voice and have a way to channel the energies that flow
through them _ have some type of release _ then they are not
looking for that other (violent) release.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Williams wrote the poetry he recites in the film, as
did his co-stars, including the real inmates in several scenes. But
Williams was not too thrilled about it. Because his character was

BLONDE AND BLUE, ANGELA STREHLI HAS THE `DEJA BLUES' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The B.B. King song title ``Never Make Your Move Too
Soon'' pretty much sums up Angela Strehli's approach to putting out
albums.
</P>
<P>
   In a blues-singing career dating back more than 25 years, she
has released a grand total of three solo albums, plus the ``Dreams
Come True'' collaboration with fellow Texans Lou Ann Barton and
Marcia Ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take myself seriously for about 10 years, and then it
took another 10 years to get good at it,'' Strehli says with a
husky laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been in the last five years or so that I've been
happy with my performances _ my singing. You've got to get some
mileage on you before you have the authority to really put it
across.''
</P>
<P>
   Strehli's latest album, ``Deja Blue,'' conveys the kind of
soulful credibility that comes only with personal experience.
Released this summer on the House of Blues label, the album
features sessions recorded in California _ where Strehli now lives
_ as well as her former home of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday at Billy Blues in Houston, Strehli will make her
first Houston appearance in several years. She'll share the stage
with West Coast blues veteran Joe Louis Walker, who also has a new
album to promote: ``Preacher and the President.'' Both artists are
bringing their own bands.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Lubbock, Strehli hails from the same musical
generation of West Texans that produced Flatlanders Joe Ely, Jimmie
Dale Gilmore and Butch Hancock. Her brother, Al Strehli,
contributed a couple of tunes to Gilmore's ``Spinning Around the
Sun'' album.
</P>
<P>
   But while she grew up surrounded by folk, country and rock 'n'
roll, Strehli felt pulled toward the black blues and gospel music
she picked up on late-night radio from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I heard it, it really grabbed me,'' she says. ``I
had to find out what it was all about. That took a while.''
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Austin in 1966 to attend the University of Texas,
from which she graduated. She also began dabbling in music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a big fan,'' she says. ``As far as blues went, I
wanted to play bass and harmonica.''
</P>
<P>
   She eventually fell in with other like-minded musicians,
including Kim Wilson and Jimmie Vaughan, who went on to form the
Fabulous Thunderbirds, and Jimmie's younger brother, Stevie Ray
Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all of us started, people thought we were crazy,'' she
says. ``Blues was just real down, period. It was not hip in any
way, and you could hardly make a living at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why Clifford (Antone) built the club, Antone's, to turn
the general population on to the real masters of the blues and to
also allow the rest of us to open and be seen on a proper stage, so
people would realize what we were trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The young white blues players had to contend not only with the
indifference of Austin's music-going public, which, at the time,
was far more interested in cosmic cowboys and country outlaws. They
also had to deal with the backlash from so-called blues purists,
who chastised them for trying to rip off black music.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us, `Either you can't do it, or you shouldn't do it.
Take your pick,' '' says Strehli. ``The only ones who didn't feel
that way were the artists themselves, who saw that we were ready to
devote our lives to the form that they had created, and they were
glad to pass it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Strehli helped manage Antone's Blues Club in the early years.
She also co-founded the Antone's record label.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clifford had all these beautiful live recordings that nobody
else wanted to put out,'' she says, ``so it made sense for us to
start our own label.''
</P>
<P>
   Strehli made her debut for the label in 1987 with ``Soul
Shake.'' This was followed in 1990 by ``Dreams Come True,'' a
rhythm and blues ``girl group'' album with Ball and Barton. She
counts the latter project among the highlights of her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a miracle for us to be able sing together and have
it sound so good, because our voices are all so different,'' she
says. ``I just loved that. I would still be doing that if anyone
else wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Strehli married rock band manager Bob Brown
(Pablo Cruise, Huey Lewis &AMP; the News) and moved to Novato, 30 miles
north of San Francisco in Marin County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected to leave Austin,'' said the five-time winner
of the Austin Music Awards' poll for best female blues singer. ``It
was love.''
</P>
<P>
   When Strehli started working on ``Deja Blue,'' she didn't have a
record contract. (Her previous album, ``Blonde and Blue,'' came out
in 1993 on Rounder.) She wrote six of the album's 11 tracks,
reflecting her increasing confidence as a composer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that I've had to grow into,'' she says. ``It
would help if I played an instrument well enough to demonstrate
what I want. As it is, I have to eke it out. It helps that I have
great musicians working with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Deja Blue'' is a tour-de-force of blues styles showcasing
Strehli's powerhouse vocals, from the old-fashioned ballad ``A Man
I Can Love'' to the shuffle ``Hey Miss Tonya'' (which she wrote for
her dog) and the revved-up rocker ``Boogie Like You Wanna.''
</P>
<P>
   She is joined by Barton and Ball (``Still a Fool''); Doug Sahm
(Jimmy Reed's ``Close Together,'' Tarheel Slim &AMP; Little Anne's
``Too Late'') and Steve James (Willie Mae Williams' ``Where the Sun
Never Goes Down'').
</P>
<P>
   Even the blues fan seems satisfied by the album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel that I'm contributing to the genre,'' Strehli says.
``My songs aren't anything earth-shattering, but I think they're
appropriate _ just good blues songs. I feel I'm doing my part.'' &QL;

HALLOWEEN COSTUMES RANGE FROM `BILL AND MONICA' TO TELETUBBIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRISTINA MASUDA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ After celebrating previous Halloweens dressed as a
devil and belly dancer, Lisa Bates was undecided about her costume
for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to find the best outfit, the 30-year-old went to Just
for Laughs in northwest Houston for a little ``research.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration came before she even entered the store. In the
window, a female mannequin with a black wig and beret caught her
attention. It was paired with another male mannequin holding
presidential knee pads and wearing a mask covered with red lipstick
marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be really funny,'' said Bates, referring to the
Halloween party she will attend as Monica Lewinsky, the former
White House intern. Bates' boyfriend will don a Bill Clinton mask.
</P>
<P>
   But of the approximately $1 billion expected to be spent on
Halloween costumes this year, Monica and Bill won't be alone in the
moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   Both men and boys are clamoring to be Zorro. The dashing hero is
popular once again because of this summer's hit movie, ``The Mask
of Zorro,'' starring Antonio Banderas as the swashbuckler with a
sword.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Damewood, 34, will spend about $80 to rent a Zorro cape,
hat, mask, clothes, boots and a sword from Performing Arts Supply
Co. in the Spring Branch area of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to become Zorro because of his sex appeal,''Damewood
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would be looking for his Elena de la Vega, Zorro's
romantic partner, Damewood said that wouldn't be necessary. ``My
girlfriend, Brandy, will be dressed like a Mexican senorita.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Frost, owner of Southern Importers in downtown Houston,
said two things inspire Halloween costumes: current events and
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Just as O.J. Simpson masks were hot a few years back when the
former football star was accused of murder, the Clinton-Lewinsky
scandal is prime for Halloween masquerades.
</P>
<P>
   For the trick-or-treaters, however, the choices are cartoon
characters from the big and small screens, not the characters from
Washington's real-life drama.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see plenty of little Teletubbies, from the British
children's TV series on PBS, and Mulan, the female Disney hero, at
your door on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Teletubbies are the top-selling costume for children at Just for
Laughs. At Party City in northwest Houston, owner Rustom B.
Engineer has tried to get more of the yellow, green, red and blue
bodysuits for his small clients. All four characters quickly sold
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't prepared for such a good sale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And just as little boys want to be a hero as Zorro, little girls
have the same goal this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mulan, the Chinese heroine from the animated movie, was so
popular that it is already sold out at many stores.
</P>
<P>
   There are two options for the girls who choose Mulan and can
still find it at discount stores: a gown in pink and purple with a
flower hair ornament and a warrior costume, in blue and green, with
pants, scarf and hair tie.
</P>
<P>
   Zorro, Mulan and the Teletubbies are on the Home Sewing
Association's Halloween Top 10 list. Since 1995, the association
has predicted the hottest costumes for Halloween through a survey
of its 2,400 members _ mainly sewing stores and suppliers. Also on
the list: Beanie Babies, toy soldiers/military men, the Spice
Girls, South Park characters, Cinderella, Titanic-era dresses and
Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head.
</P>
<P>
   To store managers' pleasant surprise, the costume from the movie
``Scream'' continues to be a big hit this year. The movie's sequel,
``Scream 2,'' was released on video this summer. The stark mask
costs $9.99 at area stores.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no Monica masks on the market. The New York Times
reported that ``mask companies may have been wise to steer clear.''
An aide to Lewinsky told the Times no one had asked permission to
license a Monica mask, but that if anyone did, she would refuse.
The aide said the former intern's lawyers were looking for ways to
crack down on entrepreneurs who have used her picture on cookies,
T-shirts and postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a mask, the items needed to create the Monica look
include a black wig, black beret, bright red lipstick and oversized
cigars. The most difficult part will be the blue dress, as most
costume stores aren't stocking it.
</P>
<P>
   Sam McCabe, owner of Wear It Again Sam in Houston, said some
clients are ``staining'' their dresses with white candle wax.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have such a creativity when it's Halloween,'' McCabe
said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Leva, manager of Texas Theatrical Supply &UR;  &LR; just south of
downtown, agreed. ``Last week I saw a woman with blue dress and a
`DNA tested' tag.''
</P>
<P>
   To make a Lewinsky outfit, Leva sells a traditional beret for $8
and a version with a bow, especially designed for this Halloween,
for $24.50. A Clinton mask with lipstick marks can be purchased for
the same price.
</P>
<P>
   The lipstick-marked mask, named Wild Clinton, is sold out at
Party City, but a lipstick-free presidential mask is still
available for $16.99.
</P>
<P>
   While most stores are selling Lewinsky items individually,
Spirit Halloween Superstores offer a ``President's Intern Kit'' for
$14.99, complete with beret, pearl necklace, plastic lips and a
White House badge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of our best sellers, especially for women 20 to 30
years old,'' said regional manager Cory Marver, who oversees three
stores in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's Costume Co. owner Terrie Frankel finds Clinton and
Lewinsky costumes tasteless.
</P>
<P>
   This year, she's betting on romanticism, particularly Zorro and
Elena, as well as Jack and Rose from ``Titanic.'' With ``The Mask
of Zorro'' a success in the theaters, she knew it also would be a
hit this Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipated my clients' request and made many Zorro and
Elena costumes,'' she said. &QL;

DESIGNERS PRESENT DISPARATE COLLECTIONS IN PARIS SHOWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Anyone who tries to make sense of the world of fashion
has at one time or another experienced the following sensation: ``I
must be crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis in that statement falls not on the word ``crazy''
but on the pronoun ``I.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because fashion, like art or music or poetry, is best
understood by its creators _ who sometimes defy understanding. So
observers trying to fit square-hole _ or more often hexagonal _
fashions into some round-hole chart that explains how women can
expect to dress six months in the future should count on feeling
deranged.
</P>
<P>
   Take the following disparate designers' collections.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Issey Miyake &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inventive Issey Miyake has a new system of tube dressing that
allows the customer to cut out the dress, skirt or swimsuit she
wants. On the runway, his assistants snipped the stretchy fabric
into separate and distinctive pieces, followed by models in bright
green and turquoise examples.
</P>
<P>
   And how many Miyake models can squeeze into one bright red
caterpillar tube of fabric? Twenty-two, of course.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Paco Rabanne &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Paco Rabanne collection, where one would expect a tour de
force of metallics _ the materials from which this designer's
reputation was forged _ there were indeed dresses of linked metal
plaques or studded with silver. Out of the '60s? Yes, but they once
more looked modern.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Guy Laroche &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turn the fashion kaleidoscope and factor in the designs of Alber
Elbaz of Guy Laroche, who turned out one of the most cohesive
collections here.
</P>
<P>
   The show began with a reading of Edgar Allen Poe's poem
``Annabelle Lee'' and continued with soft music and a slow _ some
called it mournful _ movement of models through the audience. But
Elbaz's theme was flowers, and he executed it perfectly, sparing
what might have been a heavy hand.
</P>
<P>
   Slim, sleek suits with three-quarter sleeves bore a silk flower
on the lapel or at the neck of a shell blouse. A dress with a
flower at the neckline sported tiny pleats and tucks that appeared
as stems and leaves. Colors were soft or dark grays and pale or
bright flower shades, never garish.
</P>
<P>
   Elbaz begins designing ready-to-wear for the house of Yves Saint
Laurent Nov. 1. Dutch designer Ronald van der Kemp will take over
at Laroche.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Chloe &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stella McCartney, who stumbled last season with a collection of
tarty, sleazy satins, returned Chloe to pretty, girlish clothes for
spring '99. With cascades of chiffon ruffles, the thinnest knits
and air-brushed nature prints, her clothes were aimed at growing-up
girls who just want to have fun. On a sad note, the show was
dedicated to her late mother, photographer Linda McCartney. Former
Beatle Paul McCartney sat in the front row.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Emanuel Ungaro &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a radical departure, designer Emanuel Ungaro shifted gears
from his signature jackets and sent a bevy of softly clad models
around a pasture of green grass and weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Attired in flat, gold sandals by Ferragamo _ the company
controls the house of Ungaro _ models wore sweater sets, cardigan
jackets, long suede skirts and chiffons printed with dark floral
and foliage patterns.
</P>
<P>
   These were pretty, light, drapey designs, like lingerie, albeit
for adults. The image certainly tapped into the way Americans
dressed this past summer, in long bias dresses with pointelle
cardigans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with all the lace edging, hems dragging in the meadow and
sheer fabrics, what does one wear to work? But then, maybe Ungaro
clients don't. &QL;

 &HT;    75,000 CHINESE FACE FRIGID WINTER IN 'DUGOUTS'
 &HT;    With photos placed in the International folder on the Cox
Server.
 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of a map, Hujitumo is a small town 65 miles
west of the city of Daqing, China. The dugout camp is a few miles
west of the town center.
 &HT;    For Use Sunday, Oct. 25 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUJITUMO, China _ In one of the coldest reaches of China,
twenty-three-year-old mother Bai Ming Xia has been assigned to live
with her new baby through this winter inside a sandbagged shelter
dug into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Provincial flood-fighting officials in China's northernmost
Heilongjiang Province have decided that the best way to house Mrs.
Bai and 75,000 other victims of this summer's flood is in temporary
camps consisting of brick-lined ``dugouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Each dugout has sandbagged walls that rise a few feet above
ground level and are topped with a roof made of straw and plastic
sheeting. The only heating comes from a single brick hearth that
doubles as a cook stove.
</P>
<P>
   By January, the temperature on the windswept hillside where Mrs.
Bai's dugout sits is expected to slip to 22 below zero. And even
the government worries about finding enough fuel for the dugout
dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our duty is to ensure that no victim of the flood will starve
or freeze to death,'' Ma Shu Jie, the provincial deputy governor,
said in an interview with the Cox News Service.
</P>
<P>
   To Western ears, Ma's pledge may sound minimal. But
accomplishing even that much will be no small feat here in this
hardscrabble frontier region that is worlds apart from the glitz
and bustle of modern China's cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now working out plans to bring 100,000 cubic meters of
firewood from north of the province,'' Ma explained. ``But we don't
have enough money to pay for it.'' She would also like to transport
coal from province mines to the dugouts, but so far there are not
enough funds for that either.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the destruction of about 300,000 mud- and clay-walled
homes, Ma said, the peasants of Heilongjiang Province lost 186,000
head of livestock as well as crops and grasslands to the floods
that swelled over the banks of three major rivers -- the Heilong,
Songhua and Nen rivers.
</P>
<P>
   But Heilonjiang authorities say that not a single human life was
lost in the province of 36 million because of their insistent,
sometimes forcible, efforts to relocate local farmers in advance of
the cresting waters.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most dugout dwellers have accepted the government's
determination about their future with the kind of resigned stoicism
that has characterized China's farmers, now 900 million strong, for
most of the last 5,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bai, however, is an exception. She is hoping to go her own
way with her two-month-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby can't live in such cold in the winter. It's dark and
wet here,'' said Mrs. Bai, a round-cheeked young woman. ``I'll go
to my relatives' home. There isn't much room, but it will be better
than here.'' Her husband and his parents will weather the winter in
the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Across China, more than 5.8 million families lost their homes in
August and September floods that killed more than 3,600 people and
caused losses estimated at $30 billion. But outside this northern
province, the hardest-hit areas were in the warmer climes of
central and south-central China, where victims can expect a less
punishing winter.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Siberia of China, a province just south of the
Russian border whose broad farm and grass lands normally surrender
growth to snowfall by the close of October.
</P>
<P>
   It is a region of jolting contrasts, where wealth from the
Daqing oil fields allows even small cities luxurious indoor
swimming arcades and multi-storied department stores, while
hundreds of thousands of poor farmers live in mud houses without
plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 miles from Mrs. Bai's dugout, some recent visitors were
led to a nearly completed village of 112 solidly built brick duplex
houses. Local leaders said the houses will be assigned to flood
refugees, but probably not until next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Jiao Ming Zhe, head of the Hujitumo town propaganda committee,
said construction crews had not had time to put in the ceilings
meant to go under the roofs. What's more, the planned hook-ups for
water, electricity and cable television have yet to be installed.
</P>
<P>
   And in any case, Deputy Gov. Ma said the roughly 75,000 dugout
dwellers scattered in camps throughout western Heilongjiang do not
have first priority in obtaining the new brick duplexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victims in the dugouts are considered to be living in very
good shelters. The new houses should be used for people living in
other people's homes,'' she said, referring to the more than 1.4
million other homeless flood victims in this province, who are now
doubling up in mud farmhouses or tiny city apartments of friends
and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy governor said the Heilongjiang government has no
thought of moving the rural dugout dwellers into the hundreds of
vacant apartments in modern high-rise cities like Harbin, the
provincial capital of five million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victims are farmers,'' Ma explained. ``They have to be
near their land to prepare for farming next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The central feature of the shelters, which measure about 9-by-18
feet, is a plastic-covered brick platform used as a bed. One end
contains a wood-burning oven that not only provides for cooking,
but heats the platform bed and radiates some warmth into the room.
</P>
<P>
   Firewood is the biggest worry of the ``dugout'' refugees. They
know that is what will keep them from freezing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now what we need most is wood to make fires, because the trees
and the grass are all wet,'' said Chen Ling Ji, 52.
</P>
<P>
   Chen is from Jubaoshen, the same village as Bai, and like the
younger woman she was unemotional in telling how her family fled
and lost their home, then had to split up under the pressures of
refugee life.
</P>
<P>
   But finally Chen, too, reached the point when her personal
floodgate ruptured.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly weeping, she broke down and tightly gripped the hand of
a visiting journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very lucky to meet you,'' she said through tears. ``It's
the first time I have seen an American. It is very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Underneath Chen's courage was a vein of fear and a sense that
she and tens of thousands of other Chinese need a goodly dose of
luck on top of government promises that they will make it through
the winter.

RICE EAGER TO GET RECORDS OUT OF THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ In theory, Jerry Rice of the San Francisco
49ers can break one NFL record and tie another with a single catch
on Sunday in St. Louis. That catch would have to be for a
touchdown, however.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is tied with Art Monk for most consecutive games with at
least one reception, at 183. With 78 touchdown catches as a
combination, Rice and Steve Young are one behind the record of 79
set by Miami's Dan Marino to Mark Clayton from 1983-92.
</P>
<P>
   Rice began his consecutive-games streak in a big way against the
Rams on Dec. 9, 1985. He had 10 receptions for 241 yards and a
66-yard touchdown. His first touchdown catch from Young, for 46
yards, came on Nov.15, 1987, against New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Of all his 13 NFL records, Rice said breaking Monk's mark is
second in importance to surpassing Jim Brown's career record for
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored to be in that position,'' Rice said. ``I idolized
that guy (Monk). It means a lot to me. I would like to get it over
as quickly as possible. It can work as a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Both quarterback and receiver are eager to be done with the
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of tired of talking about it,'' Young said of the
combo record. ``We need to get some touchdowns to Jerry. I've
figured out where he wants the ball and when, what he likes and
doesn't like. Through the years we've become great friends and it
shows on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said, ``I would like to get this one over with. Steve and I
have developed a good working relationship. We're fortunate to be
in a position to break the touchdown record. Hopefully, it will
happen this weekend. It's been awhile since I've been in the end
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been nearly a month, as a matter of fact. Rice had two
touchdown receptions against Atlanta on Sept. 27. Since then, he's
been kept out of the end zone by Buffalo, New Orleans and
Indianapolis. For the 49ers, it's a disturbing trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are really determined to double me in the red zone,''
Rice said of the area inside the opponent's 20-yard line. ``I'll
have to score from 50 yards in. That's why Terrell (Owens) and J.J.
(Stokes), if they're singled, they have to make plays, and they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics bear that out.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is tied for the team lead in receptions with Stokes at 31,
but Stokes has the lead in touchdown catches with five, two more
than Rice. Owens is close behind with 26 and three TDs. However,
Rice's average gain per catch, 16.1 yards, is the highest it's been
since 1991. It reflects the 49ers' greater emphasis on downfield
routes.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said defensive backs are staying in contact with him more
often and farther down the field, beyond the legal 5-yard jam zone.
He usually encounters a safety downfield as well in what is
referred to in football jargon as ``Cover 9,'' not to be confused
with ``Plan 9 From Outer Space.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, only eight receivers in the NFL have more catches than
Rice at this point in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means he's getting himself open against double- and
triple-teams, everything,'' Young said. ``Look at the generations
of defenses _ whatever a generation is _ and he's still getting
open.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he's not, Rice has struck the classic ``I was wronged''
posture _ hands extended plaintively from his sides, hoping the
officials will throw a penalty flag based on who he is. A smart
ploy, that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more going on, but I got to let it go,'' he said.
``I can't turn around every time and look to the officials and
expect to get a flag. The game is a lot more physical. I want to do
more and right now teams are deciding not to let me. I've got to be
patient and the door will open.''

RAIDERS COACH APOLOGIZES FOR DUI CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SAMUEL CHI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ Coach Jon Gruden of the Oakland Raiders
apologized after he was charged with driving under the influence of
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've apologized to the organization, our team and Raiders fans
and anybody who might be offended by it,'' Gruden said. ``This is
now a legal matter and it's being handled by the legal counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruden was charged with misdemeanor drunken driving after the
blood test result taken after his arrest on Oct. 11 showed his
blood-alcohol level to be .10, above California's legal limit of
.08. Gruden was stopped by a California Highway Patrol officer who
spotted him straddling the lanes and traveling 15-20 mph over the
speed limit of 35 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Gruden was charged Wednesday by the Alameda County District
Attorney's Office. He is scheduled to appear in Alameda County
Superior Court in Pleasanton on Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, Gruden could lose his driver's license for 90
days, but he could be sentenced to six months in jail and fined
$1,000 if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League also could take disciplinary action
against Gruden, said Leslie Hammond, director of media services for
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's hard to say what action the league will take. We
don't want to speculate and it's too premature,'' Hammond said.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders players said they were not concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gruden's a big boy, he can handle it,'' said wide receiver Tim
Brown. ``We'll let him deal with his own problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Said quarterback Donald Hollas: ``I have no reaction, really.
It's a personal thing and that has no effect on what's happening
here.''

SPENDING BILL FUNDS GULF WAR ILLNESS STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A little-noticed provision in the federal
spending bill President Clinton signed into law may give Gulf War
veterans the answers to the mysterious health ailments that have
plagued them since the 1991 conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The provision requires the National Academy of Sciences to
detail the dangerous substances soldiers were exposed to during the
brief war and identify the illnesses that can be linked to that
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans organizations hailed the measure, saying the
investigation by the respected panel of scholars might help
separate fact from fiction in the discussion of Gulf War illnesses.
The groups long have criticized Defense Department research of the
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Under a $520 billion budget package that Clinton signed
Wednesday, the academy will identify biological and chemical
toxins, environmental hazards, preventive medicines and vaccines
connected to the war.
</P>
<P>
   The law includes a list of 33 possible causes, including sandfly
fever, a disease endemic to the Persian Gulf region; sarin, a nerve
agent; smoke from oil-well fires; and depleted uranium, a
radioactive and toxic metal fashioned into ammunition used by
American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The new law calls on the academy to review and evaluate existing
research on Gulf War illnesses, and, if needed, recommend further
research to solve the mystery of the ailments reported by
approximately 100,000 veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Science is a private, nonprofit group of
scholars that advises the federal government on scientific and
technical matters.
</P>
<P>
   The academy will give definitive answers to sick veterans, said
Paul Sullivan, executive director of the National Gulf War Resource
Center, a Washington-based coalition fighting for medical care for
veterans and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a year or two, when the research results start to come in
and the National Academy of Sciences issues its findings, we will
finally be able to separate fact from fiction,'' he said. ``We will
finally know whether exposure causes illnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan praised the last-minute maneuvering by Sen. Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., whose efforts ensured that the legislation included
a means for veterans to get free health care and disability
benefits for illnesses linked to toxic exposures in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the academy looks at the literature and decides that
exposure to depleted uranium causes lung cancer, a Gulf War veteran
with lung cancer can be service connected for that condition,''
Sullivan said. ``If the VA wants to deny the veteran's claim, it
has to prove why the illness is not connected to exposure in the
Gulf.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the burden of the proof has been on the sick veteran,
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan criticized the continuing research sponsored by the
Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs, saying
their studies focused too heavily on stress as the source of Gulf
War illnesses. ``They've avoided the hard questions _ like the
effect of exposing soldiers to the combination of pesticides and
experimental pills,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of the Special Assistant on Gulf War Illnesses, which
is overseeing the Pentagon's investigation, did not return phone
calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said the physical pain suffered by Gulf War veterans had
been compounded by the emotional stress caused by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``These veterans deserve medical care for the illnesses that
they contracted as a result of their service in the Gulf,'' Byrd
said. ``We should learn from our mistakes in treating Vietnam
veterans, and not delay medical treatment for our veterans for
another 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam veterans had to fight for more than 20 years to get
medical care and disability compensation for ailments linked to
wartime exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange.

<P>
   The new law also:
</P>
<P>
   _ Extends the VA's special authority to provide care for Gulf
War veterans at its hospitals through Dec. 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establishes a public panel, which will include Gulf War
veterans, to advise the VA, the Defense Department and the
Department of Health and Human Services on proposed research
studies, plans and strategies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requires that the VA, working with the National Academy of
Sciences, establish a mechanism for monitoring and studying the
effectiveness of treatments provided to Gulf War veterans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extends the authority of the VA to evaluate the health status
of spouses and children of Gulf War veterans through Dec. 31, 1999.

have to be funded later _ and even the first batch won't be hired
until next July. Some educators, already warning that school boards

IAN MCKELLEN SHINES IN GRIM `APT PUPIL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past decade, critics have been predicting England's
great Shakespearan actor, Sir Ian McKellen, would eventually escape
his classical typecasting to emerge as one of the movies' top
character leads. This year, the 60-year-old actor may finally be
doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   In November, he stars as horror film director James Whale in
``Gods and Monsters,'' a film that has so impressed pre-release
audiences that Variety has already predicted he will be a likely
Oscar nominee.
</P>
<P>
   He's also the top-billed actor of this weekend's ``Apt Pupil,''
an adaptation of a Stephen King novella directed by Bryan Singer
(``The Usual Suspects''). It's a grim, off-putting affair filled
with Holocaust imagery, but McKellen is undeniably riveting in it.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of a morbid, Nazi-obsessed high school senior
(Brad Renfro) who _ rather improbably _ recognizes and conclusively
identifies his elderly German-born neighbor (McKellen) as Kurt
Dussander, an infamous Nazi war criminal long on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of turning in the Nazi, the boy more or less blackmails
him, makes him relate all the horrific details of genocide, dress
up as an SS officer and storm around his living room, and otherwise
act as the puppet on his string.
</P>
<P>
   But the crafty fugitive soon turns the tables on the boy, makes
him understand that _ by not turning him in to the authorities _ he
has become his accomplice. The rest of the film chronicles a
cat-and-mouse game that develops between the old Nazi and his apt
pupil.
</P>
<P>
   The point that King and Singer make with not much subtlety is
that our world is full of potential Nazis. And the one thing you
can say about the film is that it definitely has the courage of its
convictions, and doesn't soften its blow with a cop-out ending.
</P>
<P>
   As the Nazi, McKellen _ playing a character considerably older
than he actually is _ gives a shrewd, often mesmerizing performance
of a man who is half Jean Valjean, half hideous monster who just
can't keep himself from such casual evil acts as throwing a
neighbor's cat in his oven, or murdering a passing homeless man.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Renfro is also effective as his adversary and budding
mirror image, though his character might have been more effective
if he had been written or played with a bit more sympathy and
charm. As it is, its hard to stay emotionally connected to a movie
populated with two such bleak, sociopathic characters.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the film makes a less than completely successful
follow-up to Singer's 1995 Indie smash, ``The Usual Suspects.''
Unlike that auspicious debut, ``Apt Pupil'' is more unpleasant than
thought-provoking, more repulsive than suspenseful or thrilling,
and utterly predictable _ a far cry from its predecessor's
irresistible puzzle structure.
</P>
<P>
   Apt Pupil. Directed by Bryan Singer. Screenplay by Brandon
Boyce. Cast: Ian McKellen, Brad Renfro, Bruce Davison, David
Schwimmer. Sony Pictures. 111 minutes. Rated R for scenes of strong
violence, language and brief sexuality.

`PLEASANTIVE' IS TOO MUCH LIKE TRUMAN SHOW, BUT NOT AS GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest drawback of Gary Ross' trapped-in-an-inane-TV-show
movie, ``Pleasantville,'' is that it has basically the same premise
and theme as ``The Truman Show,'' and it's not half as good. It's
visually interesting, but incredibly flimsy.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Truman,'' director Peter Weir took a one-beat ``Twilight
Zone'' situation, expanded it to feature length and somehow came up
with the year's most strikingly original film: an examination of
man's place in the cosmos that was, at once, witty, moving and
profound.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pleasantville,'' first-time director Ross (the co-writer of
``Big'' and ``Dave'') takes a similar situation _ two teenagers
trapped in a mindless '50s sit-com _ and unimaginatively exploits
it. It plays like a poor-man's blend of ``The Purple Rose of
Cairo'' and ``Back to the Future.''
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners are David (Toby Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese
Witherspoon), teenage brother-and-sister of a typically
dysfunctional '90s family. He's a terminally shy boy who retreats
into reruns of an insipid '50s TV show called ``Pleasantville'';
she's conniving and promiscuous.
</P>
<P>
   One evening, a mysterious TV repair man (Don Knotts) zaps them
into the alternate universe of the TV show: a black-and-white world
of utopian perfection, without sex, bodily functions or social
strife, where it's impossible to throw a basketball without scoring
a basket.
</P>
<P>
   The script chronicles the impact the two '90s teens have on this
phony world, which comes unglued and even begins to turn to color
as Jennifer spreads her gospel of the joy of sex and David
gradually inspires a '60s-like counterculture revolution.
</P>
<P>
   By far the best thing about the film is its frequent
juxtaposition of color and black-and-white images that fill the
screen as the drab world of Pleasantville gradually comes to life.
Though its been done plenty of times before, its never quite been
tried on such a grand scale.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hardly motivation enough to sit through this
surprisingly uninvolving and humorless comedy, which takes place in
a dimension that Ross's paper-thin script can give no rules or
consistency or sense _ even by the loose standards of a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Truman,'' ``Pleasantville'' is filled with annoying and
one-note performances _ Witherspoon is particularly hard on the
nerves. It's also often shockingly tasteless, as when the slutty
teenager teaches her TV mom (Joan Allen) how to masturbate.
</P>
<P>
   It also fails because it simply doesn't make its case _ that
destroying Pleasantville is a worthwhile endeavor. It may be that
the world of the late '90s _ which Ross depicts in his prologue as
a maelstrom of AIDS, angst, famine, overpopulation, broken families
and economic hopelessness _ is preferable to Mayberry R.F.D. But
this movie sure doesn't convince us.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Pleasantville'' fails on an even more profound level. It's
built on a completely false assumption: that '50s-'60s TV shows
were empty-headed lies. If Ross ever spent any time in TV-Land he'd
know that even the more insipid situation comedies of that era _
``Ozzie and Harriet,'' ``Father Knows Best'' _ were loaded with
subtle truths.
</P>
<P>
   Black-and-white TV of the '50s is beloved today not because it
was so false but because it managed to be so truthful within the
context of stylized innocence. Has there ever been, really, a
darker portrait of selfishness and frustration than Lucy Ricardo?
Think of Ernie Bilko, Ralph Kramden or (speaking of Don Knotts) the
tragically self-deluded Barney Fife?
</P>
<P>
   Sexless? Was there ever a more more sex-obsessed teenager in all
of literature than Dobie Gillis? Or a more bitter embodiment of
matronly sexual frustration as ``Our Miss Brooks?'' The audience of
the '90s loves ``Leave It to Beaver'' not because it's mindless pap
but because it so magically catches the vulnerability of childhood
and the hypocrisy of the adult world.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you read down the list of TV family situation
comedies for the years 1955-63 _ ``My Three Sons, ``The Andy
Griffith Show,'' etc. _ you'll find that none of them is anything
like ``Pleasantville.'' Indeed, they were considerably more
thought-out and better written than Ross' shallow, backhanded
homage to our kinder, gentler cultural past.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasantville. Directed, produced and written by Gary Ross.
Cast: Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Jeff Daniels, Joan Allen,
William H. Macy, J.T. Walsh, Don Knotts. New Line Cinema. 122
minutes. Rated PG-13 for numerous sexual references and language.

ULTRA-DARK `HAPPINESS' MANAGES COMPASSION FOR WAYWARD CHARACTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may seem illogical, but ``Happiness,'' an ultra dark
``comedy'' from Todd Solondz (his equally relentless first film was
``Welcome to the Dollhouse''), is oddly sympathetic in its
perversity.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it features a pedophile as a primary character, the
film manages to eke out some sense of compassion for its wayward,
lost souls. In this modern day, opines Solondz, the quest for
happiness leads to loneliness, alienation, isolation ... and
extreme behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in the city or its suburbs, happiness is a rarity.
Solondz focuses on three sisters who lead very different lives. Joy
Jordan (Jane Adams) is a do-gooder who wants to make her mark in
the world by helping the poor and huddled masses. She still lives
in her parents' house in New Jersey. But mom and dad (Louise Lasser
and Ben Gazzara) are having their own woes. After 40 years
together, dad wants a divorce so he can be alone and mom is looking
for love in a vial of pills and bottle of scotch.
</P>
<P>
   Joy's two sisters, the glamorous poet Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle)
and pert and perky housewife Trish (Cynthia Stevenson), gloat that
they have it all. But do they?
</P>
<P>
   Helen is relegated to empty one-night stands to prime the pump
to write. She even agrees to meet an obscene phone caller who turns
out to be her lonely neighbor Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Allen
is in therapy for his obsession and is being pursued by his own sad
suitor, Kristina (Camryn Manheim), who may not be as innocent as
she seems. Ironically, his therapist is Trish's husband, Bill
(Dylan Baker), an outwardly respected, stable father and husband
who secretly yearns sexually for his son's schoolboy friends.
</P>
<P>
   This menagerie of characters crosses paths in a myriad of ways _
all in search of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Solondz has a gift for interweaving his people's lives and the
film flows seamlessly. It's a cross-sectional urban myth where the
perception versus reality of what they have and what they believe
they should have blurs and creates even more misery.
</P>
<P>
   Therapy, valium, scotch, pornography, power ... these are the
instant remedies for all the aches and emptiness. And that's the
subtlety of this comedy, which walks a fine line between morality
and despair, attraction and repulsion. Solondz manages to horrify
us, make us laugh, yet still feel empathetic. There's a real agony
at the marrow of the film and it fulfills the old maxim that
tragedy and comedy are closely related. Most of the credit must go
to Solondz for not shying away from the distastefulness of human
folly or easing the path for any of his characters in the end.
</P>
<P>
   He manages to make a cogent statement about that elusive thing
called happiness, though the formula isn't neat or tidy. He's of
the mindset that is best summed up in one of Joy's mawkish folk
songs, ``Happiness, where are you? I've looked so long for you.
Happiness, what are you? I haven't got a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Happiness. Directed and written by Todd Solondz. Cast: Jane
Adams, Dylan Baker, Lara Flynn Boyle, Philip Seymour Hoffman,
Camryn Manheim, Cynthia Stevenson. Good Machine Releasing. 135
minutes. Rated R for sexual content, language, abuse of children.

`ORGAZMO' BRINGS BAD TASTE TO NEW LEVELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trey Parker didn't exactly hit a home run with his last movie,
``BASEketball.'' If anything, he seemed to slide by on the huge
success of his animated TV series ``South Park,'' which is known
for its crude comedy and offensive humor.
</P>
<P>
   It's a relief, then, to report Parker learned a lesson or two
from that shaky outing and has made a more satisfying second movie
_ although he earned an NC-17 rating in the process and reportedly
had a few scenes edited out due to content.
</P>
<P>
   However, the film's outrageous and irreverent premise never
makes good on its potential, even though the laughs are fairly
constant and a preview audience appeared to have a good time,
guffawing heartily at the silliness of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Orgazmo'' isn't for everyone. It takes bad taste a step
further than ``There's Something About Mary.'' It's a not so subtle
skewering of the Mormon religion, which it purports to disembowel
with zeal and glee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a superhero, I'm a Latter-day Saint,'' says Joe Young
(Parker), who's been sent to Los Angeles to do his ``recruiting for
Jesus'' mission work. In L.A., the mighty Joe stumbles into the
porno industry after he rings the doorbell of Maxxx Orbison
(Michael Dean Jacobs), king of the ``adult film'' world, who just
happens to be looking for a convert of his own to play Captain
Orgazmo in his latest sex-capade.
</P>
<P>
   Joe dukes it out with Maxxx's thuggish bodyguards, proving
himself an able martial arts Mormon. Maxxx hires Joe, who
reluctantly agrees to swing into action but refuses to go all the
way on camera because he's going to marry his virginal ``cupcake''
back in Utah. Fiancee Lisa (Robyn Lynne Raab) whispers to Joe,
``Jesus and I love you,'' when she signs off from nightly phone
talks and she desperately wants to be wed in the Mormon temple.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Joe is rolling about in front of the camera in order to
earn enough money to make Lisa happy. He cavorts with big-breasted
babes and zaps villains with his orgazmorator, a gun that
incapacitates criminals with an orgasm. With the help of his
sidekick, Choda-Boy (Dian Bachar), who uses sex toys as weapons,
the pair soon become the hottest thing in the industry. But Joe is
caught in a moral dilemma when he's pushed into a dark, underworld
plot. Before long, life imitates art and Joe and Choda-Boy take
their prowess to the streets in order to clean up the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orgazmo'' spoofs ``Boogie Nights'' with a vengeance but
doesn't take that aspect far enough. The idea of a Mormon stumbling
into porno is original but much of Parker's film falls flat because
his reach exceeds his grasp. It's never clear if he's making a
satire on religion or a crime caper that never takes off. It feels
like he got cold feet half way through and tried to pull back.
</P>
<P>
   By straddling the fence, he turned the film from what could have
been edgy satire into silly inanity.
</P>
<P>
   Orgazmo. Directed and written by Trey Parker. Cast: Parker, Dian
Bachar, Robyn Lynne Raab, Matt Stone, Michael Dean Jacobs. October
Films. 95 minutes. Rated NC-17 for nudity, language, sexual
content.

   Kurt Russell's new sci-fi action movie, ``Soldier,'' is nothing
to write home about, but it's a bit better than the chest-pounding,
G.I. Space-Joe epic promised by its publicity _ and better than the
dismal track record of its director Paul Anderson (``Event
Horizon'') might indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Russell plays Todd, a New Millennium mercenary, picked shortly
after his birth (1996) by nefarious government forces and brutally
trained and psychologically programmed to be a highly disciplined,
unfeeling, lean, mean fighting machine.
</P>
<P>
   At age 40 and after many galactic battles, however, Todd and his
colleagues find themselves replaced by a new generation of test
tube mercenaries who have been genetically engineered to be
stronger, and even more disciplined and unfeeling.
</P>
<P>
   After losing a gladiatorial bout with one of these new kids
(Jason Scott Lee), Todd finds himself dumped on a remote
garbage-dump planet and left for dead. But he's nursed back to
fighting trim by an ideal little community of space pioneers
stranded there years before.
</P>
<P>
   When the New Generation of mercenaries and their corrupt leader
(Jason Isaacs) land on the planet and decide to ruthlessly use
Todd's new friends for target practice, he defends them and
``Soldier'' turns into a ``Rambo''-like combat movie.
</P>
<P>
   It definitely has its weaknesses. It's too brutal for mainstream
tastes, its villain is too melodramatically evil to be taken
seriously, and British director Anderson _ who also directed
``Mortal Kombat'' _ just doesn't have the sensibility to raise the
proceedings out of the video-game movie genre.
</P>
<P>
   But it always looks terrific, employing the talents of an A-list
team that includes Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Ed Jones
(``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'', production designer David L. Snyder
(``Blade Runner'') and cameraman David Tattersall, who also
photographed the new ``Star Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   The script, by David Webb Peoples (who co-wrote ``Blade Runner''
and won an Oscar for writing Clint Eastwood's ``Unforgiven''), is
also dramatic, character-driven and clever in the way it works in
mythic elements of ``Shane,'' ``Spartacus'' and even ``Beauty and
the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   And star Russell, who has publicly stated that this will be his
action-movie swan song (too much wear-and-tear on his aging body),
could hardly be more effective. He plays his character without a
hint of tongue-in-cheek, and his transition to human being is
remarkably subtle and completely believable.
</P>
<P>
   Soldier. Directed by Paul Anderson. Written by David Webb
Peoples. Cast: Kurt Russell, Jason Scott Lee, Connie Nielsen, Gary
Busey. Warner Bros. 95 minutes. Rated R for violence.

HERB APPEAL: MEDICINAL PLANTS' POPULARITY GROWING  
 (ADV: SIDEBAR MATERIAL AT END. WITH HERBS-FOOD-ART) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Doctors still grimace at the mention of them.
</P>
<P>
   However, for the ever-increasing number of people who are
disillusioned with synthetic medicines and their often-harsh side
effects, herbal remedies have become more mainstream as the 20th
century comes to a close.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening in Montana is a prime indication of how
attitudes are changing about herbal medicines. Federal and state
land managers have been stunned over the number of plant hunters or
``diggers'' scouring the countryside in search of the most coveted
medicinal herb in the world right now, echinacea, the purple
coneflower.
</P>
<P>
   The echinacea root, traditionally used by Native Americans to
fight colds and the flu, is more recently believed to bolster the
body's immune system. Public-land managers say tens of thousands of
the plants have been ripped out of the ground illegally in Montana
and sold to pharmaceutical firms for $20 a pound. Botanists warn
that similar plunderings elsewhere across the Northern Plains have
placed echinacea and other slowly growing medicinal herbs at risk
of being wiped out in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Land managers and botanists are nonplused, but herbalists say
they saw it coming.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Hogan, ethnobotanist and owner of Winter Sun Trading Co.
in Flagstaff, Ariz., is not surprised over the mad grab for
medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest has been phenomenal the past few years,'' Hogan said.
``When I started my business in 1976, almost all my clients were
Native Americans or Mexican-Americans. Now, 80 percent of my
customers are Anglos.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan believes people have turned to plants because there are
``many different components'' to medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taken in their natural state you're getting minerals,
vitamins, alkaloids and nutrients,'' Hogan said. ``With synthetic
remedies, you're getting one main alkaloid, and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa, Ariz., herbalist Mica Steele also has noted the frenetic
interest in herbal medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they've ever been more popular since the advent
of synthetic medicines,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   She believes much of the herbal appeal is the way our bodies
process medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they're natural, they're gentler on your system,''
Steele said. ``There aren't the side effects you sometimes
experience with synthetic medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the modern medical community, which has viewed herbal
remedies as a kind of gypsy, unproven alternative medicine, is
taking a serious look at the power of medicinal plants.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year of 128 medical schools found that 43 require
students to take courses in alternative medicine and an additional
43 offer such courses as electives, according to the Association of
American Medical Colleges. Also, medical schools are offering
alternative medicine residency programs _ post-medical school
training programs, according to Columbia University's Rosenthal
Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the University of Arizona in Tucson launched its
Fellowship Program in Integrative Medicine, an innovative two-year
project that examines ways to combine modern and alternative
medical techniques, including herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Dr. Andrew Weil, a bestselling author and widely
recognized leader of the integrative movement in medicine, four
physicians have been participating fellows.
</P>
<P>
   One is Dr. Roberta Lee, who is a family practitioner and
third-generation Chinese-American who became involved in the
program to learn more about the herbs her grandfather used that
were supposed to hold wondrous healing properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that there are natural remedies, but I'm an
open-minded skeptic,'' Lee said. ``Just because something looks
promising doesn't mean it will really work when you come to the
science of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical profession examines medicinal herbs on an individual
basis over a significant amount of time before rendering an
opinion, Lee said. Two herbs that do get a thumbs up from empirical
scientists are echinacea and Saint Johnswort, which is used to
treat depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are well-documented,'' Lee said. ``Another one I'm
looking at right now is kava.''
</P>
<P>
   The kava root contains collective active ingredients called kava
lactones, which are purported to help with anxiety and insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it appears kava is better tolerated than medicines
I use in my practice today, like Valium, that sometimes have side
effects,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hogan said even herbs that have a proven track record are
more or less useless if not taken in the correct form. Fresh herbs,
she said, either consumed directly or brewed in a tea, have the
greatest benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell me all the time that they're taking herbs, but
they're not helping them,'' Hogan said. ``I then find out they're
taking encapsulated pills. Once it's ground into a powder and put
in a capsule, who knows how long it's been lying around? We don't
sell these inert forms, which are also like synthetic medicines, as
far I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hogan believes some pill forms are better than others.
She said freshly picked herbs that are freeze-dried before
encapsulating ``provide some benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele agrees fresh herbs are best but understands why people
turn to pill form, especially when it's difficult to pick the herbs
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, modern people don't like the tastes of herbal teas like
chaparral, that tastes pretty nasty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan believes it's better to just deal with the foul tastes
rather than buy processed pills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bitter tonics are something most people in this country
need,'' Hogan said. ``And once you get used to it, you crave it
like you would a grapefruit.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have the time or inclination to prepare your own
herbal remedies, Hogan suggests buying herbal tinctures, which are
very strong liquid concentrations of the herb, that require only a
few drops in a cup of hot water.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan said tinctures are more expensive ($7 to $14 an ounce,
compared with $2 to $4 an ounce for fresh herbs), but they last
longer and have an immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
   Both medical experts and herbalists agree it's a mistake to
believe medicinal herbs alone are a panacea for good health. In
fact, Hogan goes so far as to say that herbal remedies are not for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale, Ariz., allergist Michael Manning said he sees his
share of patients who are allergic to certain medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said mixing herbs with modern medicines also can cause
problems. Additionally, Lee said, liver toxicity has been detected
in some people after ingesting herbs such as chaparral. Chaparral,
also known as medicine chest plant because of its purported use by
Native Americans to cure a wide range of maladies, has been touted
as a cancer fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, you have to keep in mind that herbals generally have a
lower concentration of active ingredients,'' Lee said, ``so they
take a longer time to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan said you shouldn't expect a magic bullet from herbal
medicines. ``What we recommend is that people use nutrition and
herbs in a daily routine to prevent long-term degenerative
illness.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Forty years ago, Anne Fischer was served herb butter
on her bread in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `My goodness, what is that stuff, and how do I find
out about it?' '' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   She went to the library and checked out a book.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades and a lot of herbs later, Fischer is the author of
the Arizona Herb Association's ``The Low Desert Herb Gardening
Handbook,'' which focuses on planting, growing and harvesting herbs
in Arizona. She has learned a lot about cooking with herbs along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh herbs, everybody agrees, are one of the hottest culinary
trends around. And here's the real secret: You can use lots of
fresh herbs, even if you don't cook. &UR; Herbs are easy.
</P>
<P>
   You live on salads? Specialize in scrambled eggs for dinner?
Fresh herbs give each dish a different dimension.
</P>
<P>
   If you grow your own herbs, pick a couple of leaves or sprigs
from each plant until you have a little handful. Wash them, then
dry in a paper towel. Chop the herbs and sprinkle them on the salad
or into the eggs just before they're done.
</P>
<P>
   If you can make an omelet, sprinkle this little mixture on the
inside with a bit of cheese just before you fold it. Voila! If you
didn't use Velveeta, you have just made genuine gourmet food. Your
``omelette aux herbes'' can be ``la specialite de la maison.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading between the lines here?
</P>
<P>
   Fresh herbs are the ultimate in ease of cooking. You can use
them to jazz up commercial spaghetti sauce or bottled salad
dressing. Fresh herbs add flavor without fat or sodium. All you
need to know are a few tricks.
</P>
<P>
   First, most fresh herbs should be added to dishes just before
they're served. This is the opposite of dried herbs, which need
longer cooking to give off flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Add fresh chopped cilantro to salsa or sprinkle it on a cheese
crisp just before you serve it. Sprinkle chopped parsley or chives
over soup after you put it in bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The exception to the add-it-fresh rule: the handful of parsley
long-simmered in broth or stock. It's strained out with the other
flavoring vegetables. If you add fresh herbs at the beginning of
cooking a dish, you might want to add more at the end to make it
taste fresher.
</P>
<P>
   Another rule to remember is the substitutions formula: Fresh
herbs can be substituted for dried in almost any recipe. Use three
times as much of the fresh herb. If the recipe calls for 1 teaspoon
dried oregano, use 3 teaspoons (or 1 tablespoon) of fresh chopped
oregano.
</P>
<P>
   Heat activates the essential oils in fresh herbs, Fischer
explained. To make teas with fresh herbs, cover them while steeping
to keep essential oils in the container. If you can smell it, the
oils are escaping, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer makes lemongrass tea with fresh ginger almost every day,
using an 18-inch cutting of lemongrass, washed and wrapped and tied
up to fit in a container, along with five slivers of ginger. Pour
boiling water over and let steep 5 to 10 minutes, covered.
</P>
<P>
   She also makes a sun-type tea from Mexican mint marigold just by
cutting a big panful, washing it, and putting it in a gallon jug
with water in the sun. She serves it with no sweetener to guests if
they like licorice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everyone asks, `What is that?' '' Fischer said. ``It's
so good, so refreshing. It's not strong or overpowering.''
</P>
<P>
   She puts a bit of mint in the water she drinks, just to give it
a little flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Herb vinegars couldn't be easier. Store them in a cool, dry
place away from the sun and they will keep a long time. First, put
washed herbs in a bottle, then add vinegar, then steep in the sun
for two weeks, shaking it daily.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to make vinegar for a salad to use tonight, Fischer
said, pour heated vinegar over the herbs to draw out the essential
oils more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sage is great with gnocchi,'' or Italian potato dumplings,
Fischer said. (Look for them in freezer cases.) During a cooking
demonstration at a meeting of the Arizona Herb Association, a quick
sauce was made with butter in which two or three leaves of sage
were fried, then poured over cooked gnocchi, which then was
sprinkled with Parmesan.
</P>
<P>
   Nasturtiums, the flowers as well as the leaves, are good in
salads. Or use the whole leaves of herbs in green salads, an
especially good trick if you have unusual-color herbs, such as
purple basil.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer makes low-fat or no-fat dip by blending chopped fresh
herbs with yogurt. To make the yogurt more cheeselike, drain it
overnight in a strainer lined with cheesecloth. For a cup of
yogurt, Fischer recommends adding two cloves of chopped garlic,
maybe a tablespoon of two different herbs you like, plus maybe a
little cayenne pepper. Chives and onions or parsley and oregano
would be good. It's your choice. Serve the yogurt cheese on bread
or crackers.
</P>
<P>
   As for that softened butter that turned Fischer into an
``herbophile,'' she tries to make it early in the day so the
flavors will meld for a dinner party. Merely soften butter at room
temperature and mix in chopped herbs, preferably a couple of hours
before planning to serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again, if it's 10 minutes before 6 and you're doing this,
it's still wonderful,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   She makes it in a dish that has a lid so that if she has any
left over, she can put it back in the fridge and use it within a
week. It's great with eggs, meat, fish, chicken or on a savory
toast.
</P>
<P>
   You can treat fresh herbs like flowers to keep them longer. Put
the stems in a glass of water, cover loosely with a breathable
produce bag, and stick in the fridge. Or roll washed herbs lightly
in a paper towel, insert the towel in a produce bag, and don't
close tightly. Keep it in the produce bin for several days.
</P>
<P>
   What to do with extra fresh herbs? It's easy to dry them, even
if you don't own a dehydrator. You can tie them up in bunches and
just let them hang. Or dry them in a very low oven, at about 200
degrees, spreading the herbs around on a jellyroll sheet so each
piece can dry. Or just air-dry them on a tray in an airy, light
place, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Herbs are easy. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ Few men alive today can relate to John Glenn, America's
once and future space pioneer, the way Konstantin Feoktistov can.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone say, ``Space pioneer?'' Not only did Feoktistov
(pronounced ``fee-awk-TEE-stuff'') fly on one of the Soviet Union's
first missions in orbit, he played a leading role in designing the
spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking celebrity status? There was a time Feoktistov and
his fellow cosmonauts had to wear dark glasses and avoid public
places to keep from being mobbed by well-wishers,
autograph-seekers, and ordinary Ivans who wanted to know what it
was like up there.
</P>
<P>
   And if the topic is septuagenarian former astronauts who would
drop everything to experience space travel one more time, as Glenn
will at the Oct. 29 liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery, then
Feoktistov, 72, knows a bit about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``To fly into the cosmos is fascinating,'' Feoktistov said. ``I
understand Glenn for wanting to be there again. If I had a chance,
I'd go again without a moment's doubt. If I had the money, I'd pay
what it costs to put me on the space shuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to talk about the hope, nostalgia, and heroism
inspired by Glenn, count Feoktistov out.
</P>
<P>
   Feoktistov believes that the Russian and US manned-flight
programs have both been a big waste of time and money, a battle of
egos between two superpower adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being first became the only goal,'' Feoktistov said in an
interview in his roomy, three-story condominium in a secluded
compound the Soviet government built in northern Moscow for veteran
cosmonauts. ``I don't think we have done enough productive work in
space to justify what either country has spent on it. For nearly 40
years, astronauts young and old have been going into space, but
what do ordinary people on Earth have to show for it? Very
little.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable stance for the man who headed the group of
engineers who designed the Vostok spacecraft that launched Soviet
cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into orbit in 1961, setting off the race
that led to Glenn's maiden voyage 10 months later.
</P>
<P>
   But in Feoktistov's view, his country's efforts to compete in
space were an expensive luxury that the former Soviet Union could
afford, but that are disastrous for Russia today.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Russia's economy is in freefall and many regions
are threatened by hunger, Moscow has committed itself to be a major
partner in the ambitious $60 billion International Space Station
project.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmonauts who once panicked Americans are now mocked openly in
films such as ``Armageddon,'' which depicts a Russian cosmonaut as
frenzied, unshaven, wearing a fur hat and fixing glitches by
pounding on machinery with a wrench.
</P>
<P>
   These are different times from the heady days when Feoktistov
lobbied Sergei Korolyov, the father of the Russian space program,
to let him be the first engineer to fly in space. It took two
years; the Soviet military thought only fighter pilots like Gagarin
and Glenn had the right stuff. But after Feoktistov agreed to
convert Vostok into a three-man module, Korolyov grudgingly agreed
to let him fly.
</P>
<P>
   Like Glenn's voyage on Freedom-7, Feoktistov's flight in October
1964 was a rough-hewn affair. Cramped quarters aboard Voskhod-1
forced him and his two crewmates to wear simple woolen suits
instead of the pressurized space suits usually worn by astronauts
as a precaution against depressurization. They carried knives in
case they had to fend off wolves in the Siberian taiga after
touchdown. Unlike Glenn, Feoktistov was not sure until liftoff that
his country wanted to send him into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had many enemies who did not want me to make that flight,''
Feoktistov said. ``Once we took off, I remember thinking, `That's
it; no one can get me off this spaceship now!'''
</P>
<P>
   That first thought soon subsided as he felt the 10 million
horsepower thrust of Voskhod's booster rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we all have a bit of our ancestors' nomad instincts in
us,'' Feoktistov said. ``For me, it was a thrill to ride that
beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 34 years later, he vividly remembers the sights of that
single day in orbit: the northern lights; the way the sun rises
over the atmosphere; the way lakes on Earth have their own, unique
color; the way mountains look like sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Feoktistov never flew again, but he dedicated his next years to
the space race with the Americans, especially since the Russians
recognized the technological disadvantage they faced. Getting over
that hurdle was a special source of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Russians, we wanted to prove we had the know-how to be the
first,'' he said. ``And we did it, time and again. We were the
first to send a satellite and the first to send man into space. We
had the first in-space hookup of two crafts, and the first space
station.''
</P>
<P>
   But the competition caused both Russia and the United States to
make costly mistakes. The Soviet Union tried to beat the United
States to the moon and lost. It tried to develop a shuttle, Buran,
the prototype of which is now a $35-a-ride attraction among the
amusements in Gorky Park.
</P>
<P>
   Feoktistov, who left the Russian space program in 1989, now
teaches at a Moscow technical institute. He is no longer recognized
on the street, but he has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even 20 years ago, people were telling me, `What are you
doing? People go up; they eat; they produce garbage; and nothing
changes. It's a waste of time,''' Feoktistov recalled. ``I don't
see anything heroic in this.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Glenn, Feoktistov wishes him the best but is preparing
for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vikings used to believe that a warrior should die with his
sword in hand,'' he said. ``Glenn is a warrior, and if he dies in
space, it will be like the Vikings, and maybe that's what he is
thinking. That's great for him, but not so much for the people who
are sending him up.''

THE DIRTY WORD OF THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: HMO 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mere six months ago, Big Tobacco stood astride the American
political scene, the colossus of evil. Every Democratic politician
railed against it. Its public approval ratings trailed Linda
Tripp's.
</P>
<P>
   Then something funny happened on the way to the ballot box:
Democrats found themselves a new bogeyman to replace the tobacco
barons. The Dems' new ``merchants of death'': Health Maintenance
Organization bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 campaign's vilification of HMOs marks the culmination
of a remarkable and speedy collapse of the industry's image. Just
five years ago, HMOs were the golden children of the busted
health-care industry, imposing the cost controls and efficiencies
everyone agreed the system needed.
</P>
<P>
   But during this summer and fall, Democratic candidates have had
a field day telling HMO horror stories. HMO has become a synonym
for heartlessness and windfall profit, and political contributions
by health insurers are blood money.
</P>
<P>
   In the Missouri senate race, for example, a Democratic TV ad
declared that Republican incumbent Kit Bond would let ``insurance
company bureaucrats make your medical decisions'' because he had
accepted $200,000 from the insurance industry. An ad tarred
Illinois' Republican gubernatorial candidate George Ryan for
accepting contributions from ``exactly those HMOs that are charging
us more while providing us less.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Democrat Paul Johnson ran ads saying that incumbent
Republican Gov. Jane Hull ``has taken tens of thousands of dollars
from HMOs and big insurance companies and then steadfastly refused
to impose any meaningful reforms on an industry that is clearly out
of control.''
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Texas, Florida,
Ohio and elsewhere, Democrats have anchored their campaigns to HMO
reform and depicted opponents as shills for the health insurance
industry. The issue is the key to ``almost every race I'm involved
in,'' says one Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
   HMO horror stories have spread widely and rapidly:
``drive-through'' baby deliveries, the experimental chemotherapy
denied to a child with cancer, the accountant who proposed
permitting cataract patients to have surgery on only one eye
because you need only one eye to see. (Consumers for Quality Care,
an anti-HMO group, even picks an HMO ``Casualty of the Day.'')
</P>
<P>
   All this is fertile soil for Democrats. Republicans in the
Senate, after all, did just kill a (relatively modest) HMO reform
bill. Republicans are in the pockets of the HMO and insurance
industries. (Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's office told health
insurance executives to ``get off your wallets.'' And they did,
forking over millions to the GOP this election cycle.)
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats' proposed reforms are not elaborate and not
unreasonable: the right to sue your HMO, the right to appeal denial
of treatment, no gag rules for doctors and easier emergency room
access. One survey showed that 90 percent of Americans support such
changes, and 85 percent would favor a candidate who supports them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its political logic, this vilification of HMOs is a
dismaying manifestation of a common illness of American politics:
Something-for-Nothingism. Democrats have seized the HMO issue this
fall because it is classic entitlement politics.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are understandably ambivalent about health insurance.
When your child gets sick, you naturally despise the frugality that
made your HMO so attractive when you subscribed. Americans want _
no, expect _ health care to be both infinite and cheap. We should
have everything, paid for by someone else who shall remain
nameless.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, by pushing regulation without acknowledging its
costs, are feeding this impossible expectation.
(Something-for-Nothingism is, of course, the guiding philosophy of
almost all politics. There is no reason health care should be an
exception.)
</P>
<P>
   A principled Republican response to the Democratic anti-HMO
campaign _ and a response that a few Republicans are actually
making _ is to say: ``OK, if you want to have the right to sue your
HMO, you are going to have accept x percent higher premiums and
that's going to price y thousand customers out of the health
insurance market.''
</P>
<P>
   But most Republicans, who are as willing to pander as the next
guy (heck, more willing), are afraid to fight on the merits.
Instead, they are countering one bogeyman with another, claiming
that voters should reject anti-HMO Dems because they are beholden
to trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Such a response is too bad, because a fight on the merits is
exactly the way Americans could make an informed decision about how
much HMO regulation they want.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that
Americans in managed care plans are basically content with their
own care. But they are more worried about the future than those in
fee-for-service plans. Why? Largely because they have heard so many
alarming tales about HMOs. Never mind that no hard evidence exists
that American health care has actually deteriorated under managed
care.
</P>
<P>
   This is why managed care is a genuinely confusing issue: Should
voters believe the anecdotes, which are real and horrifying, or
should they accept the evidence that people are mostly happy with
their own insurance, happy to be paying less, and as healthy as
they have ever been? Both parties in the '98 campaign offer an easy
answer to that question.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty for voters is that neither answer is completely
right and neither is completely wrong.

PUBLISHERS KEEP SALES FIGURES A CLOSED BOOK
</HEADLINE>
  By JUDITH SHULEVITZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is said that publishing is not a business but an art. Movie
executives are famous for knowing their box-office grosses, dollar
for dollar, the day after the movie opens.
</P>
<P>
   Not book executives. ``I'll call an editor and ask how a
client's book is selling, and he'll say 'Oh, gee, I don't know! Let
me check with inventory,'' an agent told me recently. ``But of
course, all inventory can tell you _ when inventory finally gets
back to the editor, three days later _ is how many books have been
ordered, not how many have been sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until much later (as much as a year later), after bookstores
have returned all their unsold copies, can publishers compile firm
sales figures. And even then, the numbers are not particularly
helpful. Did a book sell better in Topeka or San Diego? In the
spring or in the summer?
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to answer those questions, but the book industry
doesn't seem all that interested in the answers.
</P>
<P>
   Bookscan, for instance, is a system made and marketed by
Soundscan, the company that brings you the music industry's
greatest-hits charts. Soundscan gets its numbers from a scanning
device installed at checkout counters at more than 85 percent of
all music outlets in America. Bookscan is trying to put a similar
gizmo into bookstores. So far, it hasn't caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Soundscan, which swept swiftly through the music business
after it was introduced, when Bookscan was unveiled last year, it
was dismissed by the American Association of Publishers, whose
official line on it was that it was too expensive. (Publishers
would have to pay Bookscan for the data.)
</P>
<P>
   Was that the real reason it was rejected? We don't know how much
Bookscan was charging, but wonder whether publishers really
factored in the savings they'd accrue from better-targeted
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   We asked around and came up with a few other theories of why
publishing is one of the last industries to seek the comfort of
hard numbers:
</P>
<P>
   1. Editors don't want to know exactly how well their books are
selling. It might force them to stop buying the kinds of books they
love publishing _ the serious books with limited sales.
</P>
<P>
   A corollary to this theory is that publishers don't want the
world to see how small the unit sales are for even world-famous
authors (they usually linger under 50,000) _ it might make the
whole industry seem a lot less glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   2. Hard sales data might eliminate a cash hoard publishers have
secured for themselves. It turns out that most contracts between
authors and publishers allow publishers to withhold as much of 40
percent of royalties against possible returns during the first year
of publication (and as much as 60 percent for paperbacks). Precise
point-of-sale data would obviate that clause, and force publishers
to fork over all royalties right away.
</P>
<P>
   3. The big chains have been quietly going into the business of
compiling book sales data themselves _ an obvious thing to do,
given their dominance of the retail market _ and don't want to give
up what amounts to a competitive advantage.
</P>

NO MEDICARE SCARE--YET 
</HEADLINE>
  By ATUL GAWANDE 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who'd have thought seniors would be clamoring to Congress,
``Please don't take my HMO away''? Only a year ago, politicians
were being castigated for ``herding the elderly into HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, as health maintenance organizations are suddenly
pulling out of dozens of Medicare markets, 400,000 elderly
customers are scrambling to find insurance coverage beyond the end
of the year and demanding that Congress do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Health policy debates tend to be eye-glazing, but there are two
reasons why casual observers should care about what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Medicare HMO program is a critical test case for
Clintonian ``Third Way'' thinking. Under policy changes passed last
year, Medicare has been transformed into an enormous voucher
system. It is the prototype of a still new and controversial idea:
</P>
<P>
   Government should finance a generous safety net, but competing,
private organizations should do the work. The government now
allocates to each senior in Medicare a fixed amount of money that
will buy coverage from either a private HMO or the traditional
government-run Medicare program _ thus fostering competition. If
HMOs refuse to participate, however, the whole reform plan is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Medicare savings are supposed to provide the major part
of the much-heralded deficit reduction projected for the next few
years _ $102 billion out of a total $127 billion from 1998 through
2002. And $50 billion of that is to come from savings expected in
the Medicare HMO program. If the HMO program fails, it will be an
economic as well as a social disaster.
</P>
<P>
   All signs, however, suggest that the immediate problems in the
program have been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   More HMOs are seeking to enter Medicare markets than are seeking
to withdraw. The pullouts affect just 400,000 of 6 million Medicare
HMO customers. Industry observers and HMO officials say that only a
few more HMOs are expected to leave the program.
</P>
<P>
   What Medicare is now suffering is not a calamity. It is the
inevitable turbulence and messiness of introducing choice and
competition to a major social program. In a voucher system, seniors
have a choice of plans, but the plans have choices, too. They
aren't breaking any promises if they decide to take their ball and
go home. The benefits, however, may still be worth this downside.
After all, regulations failed to control Medicare's costs
adequately. The hope and the logic is that competing HMOs might
have better success.
</P>
<P>
   The real cause for concern is that HMOs may fail to control
costs in the long term. Over half of managed care plans are now
losing money, and a major shakeout is underway. After several years
of remarkable success, insurers are having serious trouble
controlling the costs generated by doctors like me, and not just
for the senior population. New drugs, diagnostics, and other
technologies have accelerated costs far beyond the pace of
inflation. Insurers are seeking double-digit increases in premiums
from employers, who will then cut health benefits, wages, or both.
The government will face intense pressure to raise Medicare HMO
payments in future years. Suddenly, the current budget surplus
looks short-lived indeed.
</P>
<P>
   If HMOs, like regulators in the 1980s, fail to tame health
costs, we will be left with an ugly choice. Do we let the new
technologies _ with their promise of a longer and better life _
consume ever more of the nation's wealth and productivity? Or do we
ration them? More than anything, the current HMO troubles are
evidence that this could be the major domestic policy debate of the
coming decade.

STUDIED SERIOUSNESS WEIGHS DOWN `PUPIL'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time I encountered an excited young dude shouting
``I'm the King of the World'' wasn't in ``Titanic,'' but in Stephen
King's novella, ``Apt Pupil.'' So far, ``Different Seasons,'' four
collected stories by King, has been fertile ground for movies.
``The Shawshank Redemption'' and ``Stand By Me'' both grew out of
``Seasons.'' Each of them benefits from a lack of psychological
examination; King races along, allowing the moviemakers room to add
their own level of emotion (profound in ``Shawshank,'' sentimental
and winning in ``Stand By Me'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Apt Pupil'' director Bryan Singer looked to be the perfect
director for ``Pupil.'' Singer's previous film, ``The Usual
Suspects,'' with its focus on details that turn out to be
meaningless and its cynical ease, has the feel of one of the
stories from ``Seasons.'' The ``Suspects'' movie and the ``Pupil''
novella have the benign flintiness of a parlor trick, the kind of
material that has you asking yourself, in an appreciative manner,
``Wow _ how did I let myself get taken in by this?'' Such mastery
of a shallow craft is wonderful to behold.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Singer and his adapter take ``Apt Pupil'' much
too seriously. King's dissertation on the inevitability of evil has
a swift, ironic tone. The novella's a shaggy-dog story that flirts
with pretensions about a suburban princeling whose interest in
Nazism leads him to the crotchety old man around the corner _ who
turns out to be an escaped Nazi. It's King's turn on an urban
legend; didn't we all whisper that the mean old goat in the
tattered bathrobe was a Nazi/witch? And the kid who busts the Nazi
and picks up on all of the old man's secrets on the sly, all the
while becoming infected by them, was a bright-eyed, freckled-faced
cliche out of a Norman Rockwell painting.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Renfro matches up physically to that archetype. But he's
gulping and sweaty the first time he steps in front of the camera.
He's never allowed a moment of giddy triumph before his opening of
Pandora's box adds the weight of the world to his shoulders; he
already shoulders this burden. The movie ``Apt Pupil'' has a
heaviness of spirit that almost has to come about when the subject
of Nazis is brought to a movie. It can't exult in cheap cynicism
the way King could. The movie works best for Renfro when the
oppressiveness of the old man's evil suffuses his every waking
moment; Renfro looks appropriately haunted.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Ian McKellen gets to walk away with the
picture. His mouth is turned into a perpetual sour twist, as if
he's trying to work that one stubborn sesame seed out from between
his teeth. Because he doesn't have to have a conscience, he
dominates with a showy, cranky turn. He gets to enjoy the
performance, especially after he begins to peel away the civility
he has had to wear.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Apt Pupil'' plays out to its unsatisfying end, McKellen
works the picture like a lounge pianist who has been waiting all
his life for the right crowd to show up. Yeah, sure, they don't
have any taste, but he's gonna give them the best show they've ever
seen. Like King, he knows how to deliver a good time to the rubes.
Sadly, Singer doesn't _ not this time, anyway. It's as if, once he
got knee-deep in the material, he was stuck because he couldn't
play up the humor without making it look as if he condoned the
horrors that Nazism represents.

A NICE PLACE TO VISIT: LET'S TAKE A TRIP TO '50S TV. NOW LET'S ADD
COLOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' is ... not unpleasant. It starts with a
likable sendup of a Nick at Nite-style cable channel _ TV Time _
that traffics in the relentlessly cheerful irony that makes almost
everything in pop culture feel meaningless because the folks
selling it have to pretend they're smarter than their subject
matter. (And it's easy to make fun of 1950s television, which even
the TV Time actors _ if you want to call them that _ don't seem to
take very seriously.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie gets lost when its writer-director Gary Ross (''Big,''
``Dave'') steps outside of that purview and adds (or tries to add)
real-life weight. Still, he's working at making a liberal fantasy
with some feeling and a heart. That kind of ambition is hard to
find in a movie these days, and my hat goes off to him for the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Shy, croaky-voiced David (Tobey Maguire) is obsessed with the
syrupy banality of the TV Time '50s series ``Pleasantville,'' which
transports him to a fantasy world where he's far more comfortable.
It's a lot easier to deal with this than his miserable high school
life or coming home to hear his divorced mother (Jane Kaczmarek,
underused, as usual) arguing with his deadbeat dad.
</P>
<P>
   David's twin sister, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), is nothing
like him. She's a cool charmer who is obviously using sex as a
substitute for a closeness she's not getting at home. So when David
and Jennifer are sucked into their TV and into the black-and-white
world of Pleasantville via a remote control that a mysterious TV
repairman (Don Knotts) gives them, it's a dream come true for him
and a nightmare for her.
</P>
<P>
   There are elements of ``The Wizard of Oz'' and ``It's a
Wonderful Life'' in the town of Pleasantville, as well as a
make-me-the-center-of-the-universe facet that's reminiscent of
``The Truman Show.'' David is in love with its placid surfaces.
Jennifer digs desperately under the shiny, comfy surfaces only to
find ... more surfaces. They've replaced the happy-go-lucky Bud and
Mary Sue, the teen-agers of the Pleasantville series, and their new
mom (Joan Allen) and dad (William H. Macy) treat them with respect,
confident that their kids will never let them down. So when
Jennifer introduces sex to Pleasantville, pockets of colors _
representing real fulfillment _ begin to erupt all over town.
</P>
<P>
   And when David brings knowledge and curiosity to the town,
something more than color breaks out. Fear over a
no-longer-predictable universe spills into the streets, and the
mayor (the late J.T. Walsh) is unnerved by the disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   What writer-director Ross is out to do is to create a parable
about fascism. He has an abiding interest in innocence, as his
movies ``Dave'' and ``Big'' have shown, as well as a Capra-esque
sensibility in believing that what's right is right. The most
fascinating irony to be found is that Ross' worldview is not much
more complex than Pleasantville's. He's out to bring
three-dimensionality to a world and he barely seems to have two
dimensions himself; there's an intriguing pot-calling-the-kettle
black aspect to ``Pleasantville.'' Jennifer puts aside her
self-proclaimed slutty behavior and turns to books, and she becomes
a real _ in color _ human being; the obvious irony is that the town
Pleasantville, with its structure, is actually good for her.
</P>
<P>
   David learns to stand up for himself, although ``Pleasantville''
misses a point by giving him color a beat too early _ it should
happen when he confronts bullies over his mother's honor. The
patness of Ross' fairy tale is underscored by scenes such as these:
at one point, David enters the soda shop where the shy Mr. Johnson
(Jeff Daniels) works after experience has brought literal color to
the kids' black-and-white cheeks, and the Dave Brubeck Quartet's
``Take Five'' is playing, which is just the kind of generic jazz
you might have heard on some '50s show like ``Father Knows Best''
or ``The Donna Reed Show.'' (For slight redemption, Ross later uses
Miles Davis' ``So What).''
</P>
<P>
   The movie even tries to play on the racism of '50s shows by
creating prejudice over the ``coloreds'' _ that is, black-and-white
characters who gain color. But when Etta James' sexy ``At Last''
comes up on the soundtrack, we wonder how there can be music by ...
well, by someone of color if there's no such person in the city.
And Pleasantville is a little too clean; nobody even smokes there,
which I think even the dogs did on '50s TV. (You may also wonder
what happened to the original Bud and Mary Sue. Are they sitting at
David and Jennifer's, horrified by ``Seinfeld'' reruns?)
</P>
<P>
   There's an amazing level of technical accomplishment to
``Pleasantville,'' as we watch its black-and-white and color
characters co-exist in the same frame. But it's not as exciting as
seeing a director's imagination freed up. Joan Allen, with her
delicate, long neck, brings a resonance that all the technical
excellence of this movie cannot hope to match; she's like a swan
coming into her own. (Randy Newman's score, with its witty,
parodistic lushness, helps, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the problem is that movies can realize so much visually
nowadays that the storytelling pales by comparison. Under more
modest circumstances, ``Pleasantville'' would have been an almost
subversive idea for a big studio movie. But the overwhelming
capacity of the special effects makes its small idea seem even more
slight.

SAVED BY POETRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Marc Levin films the urban drama ``Slam'' with such a
casual cinema-verite voyeurism, it's as if he were using
surveillance cameras. He and his actors sometimes seem to have
wandered into the movie's Washington, D.C., locations and just
started filming while the residents went about their business. It's
representative of the movie, which tries to show the real world
while living in a dream one.
</P>
<P>
   At its center is Raymond Joshua (Saul Williams), a two-bit dope
dealer so resigned to his fate that he could be punching a time
clock as he peddles his wares. But Ray's laconic fatalism hides a
bitterness that comes out in his poetry, which spills from his lips
with such furor it's almost as if he were speaking in tongues.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's words can't keep him out of jail, but they do save his
life when he's inside _ this is probably the only cell-block movie
in which poetry rescues an inmate rather than turning him into
someone else's girlfriend. We know Ray is a benevolent criminal
because he deals in marijuana instead of something vicious like
crack (and if that isn't enough easing up for you, he's busted for
possessing only a quarter of a baggie). Lauren (Sonja Sohn), an
English teacher who falls under the spell of Ray's street-preacher
poetry, senses a goodness in him and offers him a ticket out of his
wayward life. But she lets him know that the ticket has a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slam'' is an audacious movie, but it's not entirely
successful. Written by and starring real-life slam poets _
including Williams, who, like Ray, has a low-key demeanor that
belies his onstage evangelical furor _ it's a movie about the power
of words that suffers when the words cease rhyming. It tries to
look the harshness of street life dead in the eye, but it blinks;
even though a couple of characters cite the odds against young
inner-city black males as if their dialogue were adapted from a
statistics report, the movie solves its characters' problems with
far too much ease.
</P>
<P>
   It almost seems like it's going to cop out on Ray, giving him an
easy way out, and it still gives us an ambiguous ending that we
could take as an easy out. Naturally, because of its writers, it
comes most alive when the poets are speaking their words _ there's
a mesmerizing scene in which Ray and a jail neighbor improvise a
song-poem that's a cry of pain.
</P>
<P>
   But audacious as it is, the movie is not as unique or original
as some will give it credit for; it merely sets the conventions of
musicals to a different beat.
</P>
<P>
   It benefits from its low budget, which Levin _ whose most recent
movie was 1993's ``The Last Party,'' which followed Robert Downey
Jr. to the 1992 political conventions _ handles with such aplomb,
you almost hope no one ever gives him the money to make something
more expensive. He loses his assurance a little in some of the
dialogue scenes, which he often lets go on too long, but he's
intriguing enough that you wish he'd work more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slam'' suffers from a poetic irony _ it's an audience picture
that will have trouble finding an audience, because of its
pocket-change look and its subject matter. It's no wonder that it
has played well at film festivals, where crowds are more likely to
break into applause _ after the poets here show their stuff, you
feel like you should react in some way that's more active than just
sitting in your seat.
</P>
<P>
   Many of its actors also appear in this year's excellent
documentary ``SlamNation,'' which would be a perfect companion
piece. These movies aren't easy to find, but they're worth seeking
out.

SENATOR REJECTS SOFT MONEY AND FINDS HIMSELF IN TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ Sen. Russell Feingold has been buffeted by
relentless attacks over space monkeys and cow flatulence, flag
burning and late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when you put yourself between a rock and a
soft place.
</P>
<P>
   As champion of an unsuccessful effort to overhaul
campaign-finance laws, the Wisconsin Democrat began his race for a
second term facing a dilemma: be branded a hypocrite by taking the
``soft money'' his legislation would have banned, or reject it and
help out his Republican opponent, Representative Mark Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold chose the latter, while Neumann's campaign has reaped
extensive soft-money support from the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, whose anti-Feingold ads on issues big and
small have recently saturated Wisconsin airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The senator says it was an easy choice, notwithstanding the
risk. Recent polls suggest this is now an extremely close race
between two very different men with very different visions. But
whoever prevails, the result will surely be viewed as a statement
on how strongly voters feel about the ills of the campaign-finance
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Feingold wins, it proves it's possible to stand up against
these outside issue ads and survive,'' said Don Kettl, director of
the LaFolette Institute of Public Affairs at the University of
Wisconsin. ``If he loses, it proves the playing field is inevitably
not level when outside groups have the ability to bomb away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The question everyone wants answered is, `Can you maintain
your principles in a real tough battleground, and win with one hand
tied behind your back?''' said Larry Mackinson, executive director
of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, in fact, has done more than forswear soft money; he
has also moved to erase other advantages incumbents normally cling
to. He and Neumann agreed to limit contributions by political
action committees and non-Wisconsin residents. They also capped
spending at $3.8 million _ about a dollar for each state voter _ or
about half of what a race like this might otherwise cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be darned if I'm going to call up some CEO or some labor
leader to save my neck in a campaign,'' Feingold said last week of
fund-raising calls. ``I'd rather lose my job than play those games,
but I intend to win.''
</P>
<P>
   On the rare occasions anyone looks at this race as something
more than a referendum on campaign finance, the election offers a
compelling matchup of late-1990s political opposites, though with a
twist.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, 45, is a Rhodes Scholar and Harvard Law School
graduate who nevertheless boasts that he is the Senate's poorest
member, with a net worth around $35,000. He votes with liberals on
most social, environmental and international issues, but has a
decidedly frugal bent on federal spending, particularly when it
comes to using Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   He is best known nationally for the campaign-finance legislation
he co-sponsored with Arizona Republican John McCain, and he
describes it as a window into his political philosophy. ``I have
devoted my career trying to prove the average citizen can still
participate in the political process at all levels, and that
includes the US Senate,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold was elected in 1992 over Republican incumbent Robert W.
Kasten Jr. with help from clever ads (Elvis sightings and tours of
his closets to show they were skeleton-free) and painting three
promises on his garage door (a yearly visit to each of the state's
72 counties; a campaign financed mainly through in-state
contributions; keeping his primary residence in Wisconsin).
</P>
<P>
   Neumann, 44, is a high school teacher-turned-millionaire home
builder who is a member of the restive GOP House class of 1994. He
came to Congress by narrowly beating Democratic incumbent Peter
Barca in a rematch of a 1992 race won by Barca. Since then, Neumann
has nourished a reputation as a hard-nosed advocate for shrinking
the national debt _ he even opposes pork barrel projects in his own
district. In 1995, he wrote a federal budget that would have been
balanced by 1999, in part by cutting corporate welfare; it won 89
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think government is too big, takes too much of your money
and has too much control over your life,'' Neumann said.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann is a favorite of the Christian right, which embraces his
no-exceptions antiabortion stand; he pushed an unsuccessful 1997
recall effort against Feingold for voting against a ban on
``partial-birth'' abortions. He's also a darling of conservatives
who want to shrink the government, and Neumann courts veterans with
support for an anti-flag-burning amendment that Feingold opposes as
an assault on the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Where both break from the classic mold of liberal Democrat and
conservative Republican is the shared willingness of the two 1975
University of Wisconsin graduates to play the maverick.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann has squared off more than once with House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, and was one of only 11 Republicans to oppose a GOP-backed
tax cut this year because he said it would damage the Social
Security Trust Fund. Feingold was one of just eight senators to
oppose a 1997 tax cut, also to protect Social Security, and he
called for an independent counsel on Clinton administration
fund-raising in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At their first debate last week in the state capital, the two
men confined their sharpest attacks to campaign finance, though
Neumann also played into his tough-guy stereotype by making a
college student cry by suggesting her question about an obscure PAC
was a Feingold plant. She denied it and tearfully demanded an
apology, which Neumann granted.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold played up his refusal to allow the national Democratic
Party to run ads on ads on his behalf. He then accused Neumann of
exploiting loopholes in their spending limit by coordinating
television ads with the national GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann countered by accusing Feingold of benefiting from
``issue ads'' by groups such as the AFL-CIO, the Sierra Club and
the League of Conservation Voters, all of which have in fact
entered the fray. In an interview, Neumann said Feingold ``should
just quit whining and get down to the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ads that have riled Feingold most is one in which
Neumann accuses him of profligate government spending, citing $11
million for a Russian space monkey research project. Feingold
actually co-sponsored a Senate measure to kill that funding.
Neumann said his real point was to criticize Feingold's 1993
support for a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Another unexpected sticking point: gaseous cows. Neumann says
Feingold supported a wasteful program to study bovine flatulence as
a source of methane; Feingold calls that a misrepresentation.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent battleground _ marking a decidedly tougher shift
in Neumann's advertising _ has been late-term abortions. Feingold
says he would vote for a ban only if it included exceptions to
protect the mother's life or health.
</P>
<P>
   Voters interviewed last week said they were focused more on the
issues _ particularly abortion _ than on campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm with Feingold. I don't want anything to take away a
woman's right to choose,'' said Linda Brunker, a retail manager
from Madison.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue cuts both ways here. Beverly Steiner, a real
estate agent from Mauston, said she voted for Feingold in 1992.
This year she supports Neumann. ``I like his stand on abortion. I'm
strongly pro-life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Andrews, spokeswoman for the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, said the race is among the GOP's top five in
terms of priority and financial commitment, though she declined to
elaborate. ``We see this as winnable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, President Clinton's impeachment troubles have
had little direct impact on the race, though Democrats fear low
turnout from downhearted party members.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Spring, chairwoman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, was
rueful when asked about how different things might have been had
Feingold used all the advantages of incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really respect him,'' she said. ``But I've got mixed
feelings right now. We'll see on Nov. 3 how it plays out.''

   SAN ANTONIO _ The buffalo no longer will roam where the deer and
antelope play after Nov. 29 at the Kerrville Camera Safari.
</P>
<P>
   The 230-acre ranch will close after more than six years of
operating in what has been called the heart of the exotic animal
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got an offer to buy the entire ranch that we couldn't
refuse,'' Ken Wilson, ranch manager and co-owner of the safari,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 people a year drove through the canyons and draws
of the ranch in the Hill Country northwest of San Antonio _ an area
that once concealed whiskey stills _ to observe the collection of
more than 300 animals ranging from giraffe to American bison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was more than just a tourist attraction. It was a
showcase for the exotic ranching industry in an area where hundreds
of ranches specialize in raising various species,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most game ranches are closed to the public, so this offered
people an opportunity to see something that was normally not
available,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the purchase were being withheld by agreement between
the two parties, Wilson said, adding that the deal was finalized
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a commercial master plan being developed for the
entire 230 acres,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Cunningham, president of the Kerrville Area Chamber of
Commerce, said the operation would be missed as an attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my grandchildren's favorite place,'' she said. ``It
has been such a special place for families who just want to go out
and picnic or drive around and see the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a real loss for Kerrville,'' Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the animals will sold to other exotic animal
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch is part of an original 4,400-acre property called
Whiskey Creek Ranch, named for the illegal whiskey stills once
operated there.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and his partner, Roger Haley, both from California, spent
more than $250,000 to improve the property before its opening on
Sept. 4, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Animals that have been displayed at one of the largest drive-
through parks of its kind include aoudad, axis deer, bison,
blackbuck antelope, eland, giraffe, Hawaiian black sheep, llama,
Texas dall sheep, timberwolf, water buffalo and zebra.

OH, THE ECSTASY OF IT ALL
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In spite of its much-ballyhooed NC-17 rating, ``South Park''
co-creator Trey Parker's ``Orgazmo'' succeeds on two levels: as a
clever spoof of pornography, action films and the '60s ``Batman''
TV series; and as a surprisingly hilarious piece of ``adult''
humor.
</P>
<P>
   I stress ``adult'' because in a hypersensitive world where
parents schlep their 3-year-olds to R-rated fare such as ``Saving
Private Ryan'' and then whine about the violence, it's nice to see
a movie made explicitly for adults. Don't even ``think'' of
bringing the youngsters to this one unless you want to spend the
next three weeks engaged in uncomfortable Q &AMP; A sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, in addition to his writing and directing duties, stars
as Mormon missionary Joe Young (no relation to the mighty big
monkey). Faced with the insurmountable task of converting jaded Los
Angelenos, Joe merrily troops door to door, undeterred by the rude
responses he incurs.
</P>
<P>
   When he's almost beaten to a pulp for disturbing an adult-film
shoot, Joe defends himself with such style that the director begs
him to star in his next picture _ as porno superhero Orgazmo.
</P>
<P>
   Joe refuses at first, until he realizes his substantial paycheck
will help bankroll his fiancee's dream wedding at the Mormon temple
in Salt Lake City. He decides to grin and bear it, and with the
help of his enthusiastic sidekick Choda Boy (Dian Bacher), he makes
the film a huge success _ which means ... you guessed it, sequel
time.
</P>
<P>
   But all bets are off when Joe's girlfriend finds out what he's
been up to and forbids him to make a follow-up. His enraged boss
has her kidnapped to persuade Joe to complete the picture, so it's
up to the ``real'' Orgazmo and Choda Boy to save the day.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the best bits in this picture are far too rude to
discuss in a family newspaper; suffice it to say, if it's been done
in a porn movie, it's discussed in graphic detail here. But unlike
the queasy voyeuristic feeling you got while watching ``Boogie
Nights'' with an audience, ``Orgazmo'' is so silly and over-the-top
that you can't possibly be offended by anything it has to say. And
its matter-of-fact, on-the-set banter is a much more accurate
depiction of adult film shoots then anything in ``Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that the film won't offend audiences _ as with
the foul-mouthed cartoon antics of ``South Park,'' ``Orgazmo'' has
more than its fair share of toilet humor. Flatulence jokes abound,
along with irreverent non-PC jabs at religion, gays, Asians and
African-Americans. But like ``South Park,'' it's an
equal-opportunity offender.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's ``South Park'' partner in crime, Matt Stone, co-stars
along with a host of real-life porn stars for audience members to
pretend not to recognize. As for the inevitable comparisons to
``There's Something About Mary,'' ``Orgazmo'' manages to be about
10 times as clever while outdoing ``Mary'' on the gross-humor meter
by far. Best of all, there's not a hair-gel joke in sight. Now
that's funny.
</P>

ALTHOUGH VIAGRA SALES SHRINK, IT REMAINS QUITE A MONEY MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some men simply didn't get the results they'd been promised.
Others balked at the cost, not to mention possible deadly side
effects. Then there were those who found that Viagra boosted their
confidence along with their sexual performance _ to the point where
they could leave the medication in the medicine cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   All of which helps explain why sales of Viagra have fallen
substantially from the sky-high levels they reached in April, when
the drug was released.
</P>
<P>
   But even with that decline, reflected in sales figures released
last week, Viagra remains the most successful new drug in history.
And Wall Street analysts, along with physicians who are prescribing
the drug and patients who are taking it, remain bullish about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the most successful drug ever. It's just not twice
as much as the next closest, the way it was,'' said Len Yaffe, a
pharmaceutical analyst at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco. ``We expected this rapid uptake, the lull in between,
and the flattening out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Stripling, an Atlanta urologist who has prescribed the
drug to more than 2,000 patients, said that while he has seen
interest wane somewhat, ``Viagra still is the best in initial
treatment and probably will be the gold standard for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way Paul sees it, too. The 46-year-old who lives on
the North Shore has been taking Viagra for four months to help him
function sexually after undergoing groin surgery stemming from a
bicycle accident. The drug ``definitely works,'' he said. ``It's
extraordinary, its effectiveness can not be overstated.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem, added Paul, is that his health insurer limits
reimbursement for the drug, which can cost up to $10 a tablet. ``If
it was any other organ,'' he argued, ``the insurance company
couldn't say it just won't pay for it. It's obscene.''
</P>
<P>
   The Viagra craze began even before the drug came out last
spring. The media was awash with stories about how merely popping a
pill not only would cure impotence, but could let already-potent
men reach new levels of performance. Within a week of its release,
Viagra captured nearly 80 percent of the market for drugs to treat
sexual dysfunction, and within a month doctors were writing about
300,000 prescriptions a week. Worldwide sales for its first quarter
hit $411 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sky seemed the limit, but the reality playing out on the
ground was more sobering, as became clear with last week's release
of the latest sales statistics: Prescriptions are down to about
170,000 a week. And worldwide sales in the most recent quarter
plummeted to $141 million, a third of what they were the previous
four months.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the decline was a natural sorting out of those
who didn't really need the drug, or for whom it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tidal wave of interest and desire is gone,'' said Dr.
Abraham Morgentaler, director of the male infertility and impotence
program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ``It doesn't work
quite as well as advertised in the media, but clearly it works in
about 50 percent of guys with some sort of physical problem with
their erection. ... It's not 90 percent, but it's an amazing
figure, and for those 50 percent it's fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the drug works is straightforward: The main problem for
men with impotence is that not enough blood gets into or stays in
the penis to keep it erect. Within an hour of taking Viagra,
however, smooth muscles in the penis are relaxed enough to let
blood flow into the spongy tissue that becomes engorged to cause an
erection.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra also has proven a boon to many men whose troubles in
sustaining an erection are psychological, although many of them
aren't getting new prescriptions. ``They may still have tablets in
the bathroom,'' said Stripling, the Atlanta urologist. ``Just
knowing it's there, they can go to bed with more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear of potentially deadly side effects is another reason
for the drop in sales. Such fears were fanned when the US Food and
Drug Administration reported last summer that at least 69 men
taking Viagra died during its first four months on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA and Pfizer Inc., the drug's manufacturer, say that death
toll is low given that more than 2 million men had taken the drug,
and many of those who died were old or sick enough that it probably
was from overexertion. They also point out that the drug carries a
warning against taking it if you are on nitro-glycerine or other
nitrates.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Washington-based Health
Research Group, said that those warnings aren't sufficient and that
many would-be Viagra users have come to realize that ``having an
erection is really important, but it's not worth dying for.''
</P>
<P>
   For those not at risk, and who liked the drug when they first
tried it, there's another reason not to sign up for refills: It's
simply too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Some HMOs have been paying for the pill, but they often make
doctors and patients fill out so many forms certifying that they
suffer from dysfunction that it has discouraged them from filing
for reimbursement. Other insurers will only cover it under special,
more expensive policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure that about 50 percent of insurers and managed-care
companies will reimburse for it, and we're hoping to see that
increase over time,'' said Mariann Caprino, spokeswoman for Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the dampening of interest and those disincentives for
use, Viagra still is almost sure to become the best-selling new
drug ever. The record-holder is Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering
drug released last year that earned just over $1 billion during its
first 12 months. Viagra is on track to earn more than $1.1 billion
by the end of its maiden year, said Yaffe, the investment analyst,
and that's based on reaching just one-fifth of its market of an
estimated 20 million American men who suffer from impotence.

ARIZONA STREET KIDS GET LIFELINE  
 (ART ADV: PHOTO HAS BEEN SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   PHOENIX - Three nights a week, Steven Serrano and Linda Silva go
out in a white van and drive slowly through the worst parts of
Phoenix and neighboring Tempe, looking for homeless kids.
</P>
<P>
   Concealed by day, the teenagers emerge from the dark shadows of
the street with their hands outstretched when they see the van.
</P>
<P>
   They know it is stocked with food, cold drinks and clothes _ in
particular the thick white socks that help ward off the foot fungus
that breeds from too much time in the same pair of shoes and socks.
</P>
<P>
   Every kid out here has a different story, but there are similar
plot lines.
</P>
<P>
   Some lived in expensive homes, others in crack houses. Most were
physically or sexually abused. And many of them have given up the
lives they once dreamed of, sleeping now on sidewalks and masking
their pain with alcohol and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd rather sell their body for sex than go home, so home
has to be pretty bad,'' Serrano said.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Action Alliance, a non-profit advocacy agency,
estimated in 1990 that there were 5,000 runaway and homeless youths
in Arizona. Now, estimates run as high as 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   And since 1983, the number of homeless girls has about doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really knows how many kids are out there,'' said Karny
Stefan, development director for HomeBase Youth Services, a
non-profit agency that helps homeless young people with food,
shelter, clothing, counseling and other services.
</P>
<P>
   They rarely stay in one place long enough to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   Within two days of landing on the streets, 72 percent of girls
will turn to prostitution to make money, Serrano says. Half of the
boys will do the same within three days.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless kids are scattered throughout the metro Phoenix area,
although there are higher concentrations of them in downtown
Phoenix and Tempe, where Serrano and Silva make regular runs.
</P>
<P>
   Besides HomeBase, only two other non-profit agencies _
Tumbleweed Center for Youth Development and Stand Up for Kids _
comb the streets in search of these kids. Serrano says they could
use double that force.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano has been making these runs into the night for HomeBase
for four years, Silva since March.
</P>
<P>
   They take the van but often canvass parks and nearly empty
streets on foot with packs on their backs, peering into public
restrooms and alleys and behind fences and trash cans.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano and Silva hand out bags of non-perishable food _
pull-top cans of tuna, canned fruit, granola bars. And they
distribute hygiene products _ toothbrushes, toothpaste, disposable
razors, soap, shampoo and combs.
</P>
<P>
   In the van, they keep blankets, bandages, remedies for lice
infestation and other medicine. &UR; Everything is donated. They can
empty the van in a single night.
</P>
<P>
   Silva asks the kids if they are thirsty, hungry or if they need
a place to stay. The goal is to find the young people a safe place
to stay, such as HomeBase's shelter near Seventh Street and Indian
School Road, which is for people ages 18 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   There, they get counseling, go to school or find jobs. They're
well fed, living in apartments around a small swimming pool. They
can live there for as long as two years.
</P>
<P>
   They are either homeless children, runaways or foster kids who
had no place to go once they turned 18. Of those who have lived
there, about 85 percent never go back to the streets, the best rate
in the nation among homeless programs for children, director Pat
Leach says.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, the kids are hesitant when they meet Serrano and
Silva, scared to trust someone they don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute they wake up out here, someone wants something from
them,'' Serrano said. ``They want them to do a drug run or they
want them for sex. It's hard for them to believe that we don't want
anything from them.''
</P>
<P>
   He drives first through an area in downtown Phoenix known on the
streets as ``Boys Town,'' a place where male prostitutes
congregate, and shiny Infinitis and BMWs _ one with a child
restraint seat in the back _ cruise by slowly.
</P>
<P>
   In the alleys, addicts shoot up. A police officer walks the
area.
</P>
<P>
   It is quiet tonight, and they see no kids. Yet the men working
the area _ some dressed as women _ wave. Serrano and Silva wave
back.
</P>
<P>
   They befriend drug dealers and pimps because they know where the
children are. A pimp once called Serrano to tell where to find a
missing teenage boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk to everyone,'' Serrano said. ``We make sure we know
what's going on that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Silva and Serrano move on. Their next stop is in a dark
industrial area in downtown Phoenix that is known as a haven for
drug users and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   There, a 19-year-old girl named Angie waves down the van.
Serrano parks under the single street light on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Silva asks Angie if she is hungry, and Serrano hands her a cold
drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any socks?'' Angie asked. ``I need a blanket, too.
Can I have the blue one?''
</P>
<P>
   Another boy walks over to the van, his lip burned and split from
smoking cocaine from a hot pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``How old are you?'' Serrano asked.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen, the boy tells him. His name is Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano gives him a sandwich for now and a bag of food for
later. He also gives Juan a card with the telephone number of the
HomeBase shelter. The boy puts it in his bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll call,'' he said. ``I'm tired of sleeping on the
sidewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, Serrano says, there are few shelters for people
younger than 18, so they often are full. Even HomeBase's shelter
has a waiting list, although two beds are kept open for emergencies
_ kids who are sick or have been beaten or raped.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, the kids are polite, saying ``please'' and
``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Serrano talks to Juan, 20 men and women gather around
the van _ homeless, prostitutes, drug users and dealers. Mostly,
they are haggard; some wear thick gold chains.
</P>
<P>
   They, too, ask for handouts, and Serrano explains that HomeBase
serves only people ages 14 to 21. Other services are available for
the adult homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 21!'' shouted a man with gray hair who clearly was at
least twice that.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano and Silva shut the van's doors, but the crowd presses
in, hands reaching for the box of doughnuts in Serrano's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back up. Back up,'' Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd moves closer, pushing Serrano and Silva against
the van. Someone shouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's gonna be a fight,'' a woman yells.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano hands the box of doughnuts to the man nearest him, and
he and Silva hurriedly get into the van.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whew!'' Serrano said. ``My heart is pounding.''
</P>
<P>
   This has happened before, Serrano says, sometimes twice a week.
Serrano and Silva carry cellular phones and whistles but no
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had anything happen to me out here,'' Serrano said.
``The day might come, but it's important that we saw people _
Angie, Juan, Justin.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin was a skinny kid about 18. Serrano gave him a bag of
food, though chances are good that one of those adults _ older and
stronger _ would take it from him.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano and Silva stop next at Central Arizona Shelter Services.
t Craig, 20, who has lived here for a few months, moved to Arizona
to live with his parents only to find that his parents had moved
away three weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He and other young men gather around the van.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, sir,'' Craig said, taking a bag of food and
toiletries from Serrano.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel, 20, went to high school with Serrano near the
exclusive enclave of Paradise Valley. In the last year and a half,
Serrano says, he has run into a dozen youths on the street with
whom he went to school. Some of them are in bad shape, mostly
because of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see kids who are really, really bad, we don't know if
we'll ever see them again,'' Serrano said.
</P>
<P>
   Their shift is over, but Serrano and Silva don't want to go back
until they find Luke, an 18-year-old who has been homeless for a
year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   He has been coming to HomeBase's drop-in center for food and
counseling, but they are worried because Luke's arms are lined with
slash marks. He cuts himself.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano pulls himself up on a concrete block fence behind a
Phoenix restaurant and calls, ``Luke! Hey, Luke!''
</P>
<P>
   Luke's blond head pops up.
</P>
<P>
   He's eating a can of tuna that Silva gave him earlier in the day
at the drop-in center and reading a book, borrowed from the
center's library.
</P>
<P>
   His parents kicked him out of his Phoenix home, although he
didn't say why. He has talked to them twice on the phone since.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask me how I'm doing, but they don't ask me to come
home,'' Luke said. ``You learn how to live with it. You try not to
get angry at anyone. I'm just angry at myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a good-looking kid and well spoken. He promises Silva he
will come to the drop-in center the next day to talk about moving
into the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need some help. It's been hard this year and a half, and I
obviously can't do it on my own,'' Luke said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many kids Serrano and Silva find each night, they
never forget a name _ Angie, Joshua, Craig, Nathaniel, Noel, Luke,
and the hundreds more like them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you forget?'' Serrano asked. &QL;

PEOPLE WILLINGLY MADE MICROSOFT RICH AND POWERFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time the Justice Department's lawsuit against Microsoft
Corp. comes to a close, the government will have spent millions of
dollars on its effort to punish the software company for its
``predatory'' behavior. To defend itself, Microsoft will have spent
millions of dollars as well. But consider how great a difference
there is between the government's money and Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   Every dollar that Microsoft pays its lawyers is a dollar it
earned by providing something a customer desired. The company's
revenues, around $11 billion annually, come from selling and
leasing products that people choose to pay for. Every one of its
moneymaking transactions is voluntary: Microsoft has never used
force to confiscate money from the public.
</P>
<P>
   The government, by contrast, acquires nearly all of its revenues
_ more than $1.5 trillion a year _ by force. Fail to pay your
taxes, and armed government agents are liable to confiscate your
property or lock you behind bars. Or both.
</P>
<P>
   There are many differences between government and business, but
none more basic than this: Governments depend on coercion,
businesses depend on freedom. Yet, perversely, it is the government
that accuses Microsoft of coercive practices.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the Justice Department's case against Microsoft is
that the company has made Internet Explorer, its Web browsing
software, an integral part of Windows, its overwhelmingly popular
operating system. Microsoft doesn't charge for Internet Explorer _
the price of Windows didn't go up when the Web browser was added _
and it doesn't supply it separately. Computer makers wanting to
load Windows into their desktop PCs have to take Internet Explorer
as part of the package. This is the ``coercion'' which the
government is spending millions of dollars to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forcing PC manufacturers to take one Microsoft product as a
condition of buying a monopoly product like Windows,'' says
Attorney General Janet Reno, ``is ... plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, then it is plain wrong for the publisher of this
newspaper to force you to take the sports section as a condition of
getting the news and the op-ed page. It is plain wrong for Chrysler
to force car dealers to take vehicles with Chrysler engines and
radios already installed as a condition of selling Jeeps and
Eagles. It is plain wrong for Visa to force its cardholders to take
rental-car insurance as a condition of receiving a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's lawsuit boils down to the illogical
presumption that consumers would be better off if they had to pay
separately for a Web browser. But why stop (or start) with
browsers? If Reno is right, we would all be better off if Windows
didn't include word-processing software either. Or calculators and
calendars. Or modem drivers and disk compression utilities.
Microsoft released its first operating system in 1981, and has
continually enhanced its product with new features. What is it
about this feature _ Internet Explorer _ that the government finds
so objectionable?
</P>
<P>
   True, Microsoft has a near-monopoly in desktop computer
operating systems; 90 percent of all PCs run Windows. But that
doesn't make Microsoft a monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, its share of the overall computer industry is
tiny. In 1996, Microsoft controlled less than 2 percent of global
computer market revenues. Even in the software-only universe, its
market share was only 4 percent. Among the Fortune 500, Microsoft
is ranked just 137th. It is outdistanced by IBM (which ranked 6th),
Hewlett-Packard (14th), Intel (38th), Compaq (42nd), Digital
Equipment (118th), and Dell (125th). ``It is difficult,'' the
Heritage Foundation's Adam Thierer writes, ``to understand the
claim that Microsoft's market power in the computer industry is
destroying competitive opportunities for these larger, more
profitable companies, or for any other company in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   It is even harder to understand the claim, implicit in the
Justice Department suit, that Microsoft is depriving consumers of
the benefits of competition. Computer prices are low and keep
falling. Product quality keeps rising. There is no shortage of
entrepreneurs or innovation. Microsoft plays hardball with
competitors, but it gives its customers exactly what they want: a
common operating system that comprises numerous products and
supports a myriad of applications. If it has a monopoly, it is a
monopoly honestly earned.
</P>
<P>
   The government has an ignoble history of firing its antitrust
guns at companies whose only real offense is being successful.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, in one of the worst blunders of his brilliant career,
Judge Learned Hand agreed with the government that the Aluminum
Company of America had an unlawful monopoly and should be broken
up. Alcoa was wrong, he wrote, to ``always anticipate increases in
the demand for (aluminum) ingot and be prepared to supply them.
Nothing compelled it to keep doubling and redoubling its capacity
before others entered the field. It insists that it never excluded
competitors; but we can think of no more effective exclusion than
progessively to embrace each new opportunity as it opened, and to
face every newcomer with new capacity already geared into a great
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa had to be punished, in short, for its efficiency and
adroitness, for steadily improving its operation, and for
safeguarding its market share. Fifty-three years later, it seems,
the Justice Department still regards those things as crimes.

MANY IN GOP ANGRY AT CONGRESS'S DEAL WITH CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's budget agreement left many Republicans and
conservative commentators in a foul mood. They were aghast at the
extraordinary spending levels agreed to by the congressional
Republican leadership. They were angered by their party's
capitulation on tax cuts. They were amazed that President Clinton
was so successful in rewarding Democratic members of the House
Judiciary Committee. Privately, they wondered whether their
leadership had become the hacks they once abhorred.
</P>
<P>
   Former vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp spoke for many when
he said: ``Today, the Republican Party is adrift, without an agenda
and without purpose beyond its seeming preoccupation with saving
the congressional seats of its incumbents.''
</P>
<P>
   George Will was even tougher, calling the Republican Congress
``disgraceful,'' ``corrupt'' and ``the Boston Red Sox of politics,
forever muttering, `Wait till next year.''' Will concluded by
saying, ``Republicans can no longer say it is important to elect
them because they represent something dramatically different.
Democrats can no longer say it is important to defeat Republicans
lest there be risky assaults on ... anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That last sentence was the reason Gingrich agreed to the deal;
he ``lost'' the budget battle to ``win'' the electoral war. This
may explain the speaker's irritation Tuesday with conservative
critics, whom he denounced as ``perfectionists'' and ``petty
dictators,'' out of touch with political reality.
</P>
<P>
   From Gingrich's point of view, the 1998 budget negotiations were
all about 1998 midterm and year 2000 election strategy. Gingrich
feared that if the Republicans did not give President Clinton some
measure of what he wanted, then Clinton would force the issue (by
veto) and shut down the government, blaming Republicans as he did
so. Gingrich wanted no part of a replay of the budget battle of
1995. He learned that lesson the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of Gingrich's strategy was to take the ``risky''
out of Republican and leave Clinton issueless going into the last
two weeks of the campaign. By caving in to key Clinton demands,
Gingrich ensured that the president would be unable to campaign
against a Republican Congress that had just given him more than a
fair shake. Taking away the GOP Congress as a campaign issue leaves
Clinton without a -``national'' issue to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's bet is that by ``denationalizing'' the midterm
elections, they will revert to form. The form works to Republican
advantage at almost every turn. Historically, the party out of
power in the White House makes significant gains in congressional
elections in the sixth year of the incumbent's reign.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the GOP's financial advantage is made much more
significant if the mid-term elections are denationalized. This is
especially true this year because the Democratic Party is pouring a
huge percentage of its funds into California to try to capture the
governorship and keep control of the state Legislature. Democrats
hope that by doing both they will be able to redraw the
congressional districts in 2001 to their advantage. But by devoting
such a high percentage of their resources to one state (and an
expensive state at that), they are substantially increasing the
GOP's money advantage in every other state.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Democratic turnout will likely be lethargic given
that key Democratic constituencies (such as teachers unions) did
well in the budget negotiations. Anger is the key to high turnout,
and Democrats can hardly be irritable about this year's budget
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologically, Gingrich understands that Clinton can't stand
taking himself off the playing field. Clinton will feel compelled
to campaign, even if few in his party would like him to come to
their states or districts. Once he is out on the trail, Clinton
will be perceived as the lying politician that he is (as opposed to
the chief executive working hard to keep the government
operational). His campaigning _ and the coverage of it on
television _ will remind every Republican constituency why it is
that they loathe him with such intensity. Which will likely drive
Republican turnout up.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Gingrich is preparing his party for the year 2000
election. Truth be told, he likes the fact that the more
conservative elements of the party have been publicly critical of
the budget deal. That moderates the party's image and makes it more
difficult for Clinton and Gore to portray the GOP as obstreperous
or dangerous. Which in turn might make it easier for Americans to
elect both a Republican president and a Republican Congress in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans make substantial gains in this year's midterm
elections, then the recent spate of conservative criticism will be
forgiven and forgotten in the victory celebration of enhanced
majority status. If Gingrich's strategy fails to produce
significant gains, then the party's right wing will become much
more assertive immediately, opening up the possibility of another
challenge to Gingrich's leadership. The stakes in these elections
are as high for Gingrich as they are for Clinton.

GRAND AM GT GRAND, SE BLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - And now, ``A Tale of Two Grand Ams'':
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best of cars, it was the worst of cars.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Truth be told, the two Grand Ams in question _ the
sportier GT model and the standard-issue SE _ were like Cain and
Abel, Yin and Yang.
</P>
<P>
   One that's hot, one that's not.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Am for '99 is Pontiac's completely redesigned sport
compact, a budget-priced coupe or sedan that vies to uphold the
marquee's ``excitement division'' reputation in the General Motors
paddock.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you do get a lot of car for the money. Stylish bodies,
well-furnished interiors, dynamite stereo systems and enough
panache to help attract members of the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at the hearts of under-30 drivers, male and female, the
Grand Am is affordable enough to be a reasonable longing. Even J.D.
Powers, the high-profile arbiter of automotive quality, favors the
Grand Am, bestowing upon it the APEAL award as the most appealing
entry-level midsize car.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, thought the SE sedan was just OK, and then
only if you don't mind a rubbery suspension, vague steering,
mediocre engine power and plastic interior parts that seem ready to
fall off.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, I found the SE to be boring to drive, not
exciting, as one might expect from the excitement division. After
my pleasant experiences last year with the new Grand Prix, I was
highly disappointed by the Grand Am's lack of spirit.
</P>
<P>
   So I complained to Pontiac, which was hurt and confused by my
lack of appreciation for a car the division had worked so hard to
update, and which is such an important part of its product line.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac told me the SE model was a softer approach to sports
coupes and sedans, one designed to appeal to women, as shown
through a number of focus groups. It provides the comfort and ease
of operation of a compact car coupled with sporty road manners for
driving fun.
</P>
<P>
   I must have missed the sporty-road-manners part.
</P>
<P>
   The brand-new GT version is the car for me, the Pontiac people
said, and sent out a GT coupe to test. It's as comparably priced as
the SE but with tighter steering, stiffer suspension and greater
responsiveness all around. The GT is the guy car, they said.
</P>
<P>
   And they were right. That Grand Am is a car I could deal with.
Even like. The suspension was firm, not mushy, and the steering
felt direct and connected, not vague and too light to the touch.
With just five more horsepower, the GT engine felt noticeably
stronger, though still fairly raucous under acceleration. Even the
transmission shifted more precisely.
</P>
<P>
   The GT handled nicely, with decent road feel. And it was fun to
drive, which is what I thought a Grand Am was supposed to be in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   So what am I to conclude from this? That the guy car is cooler
than the girl car? Now, that seems like a rather backward notion in
this age of equality. Besides, most of the women I know like cars
that drive as well as the GT, not as poorly as the SE. My wife, for
instance, who concluded independently that the GT was hot and the
SE was not.
</P>
<P>
   Either version is available in a two-door coupe or four-door
sedan, which are the exact same size but provide the advantage of
back doors. The interior in either version is comfortable and
roomy, with enough space in the back seat for regulation-size
humans.
</P>
<P>
   The interior styling is modernistic, with a dashboard form that
consciously calls up past sports-car forms, with gauges and
air-conditioning ducts each raised in a round hump. It works as
such and should appeal to its young audience, but it's a bit
over-the-top for me.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior styling is suitably aggressive and sporty,
Pontiac-style, with contoured lower-body cladding giving it a broad
and purposeful look. The Pontiac flaring-nostril grille is strongly
pronounced, and the whole body seems to be bulging with muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The rear-deck spoiler is a trip. Instead of the usual flat,
contoured shape, this one has a pair of raised, aerodynamic-looking
protrusions on either side that look suspiciously like tail fins.
In the rearview mirror, they look (begin ital) exactly (end ital)
like tail fins.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Am is sure to make quite a splash in the broad pool of
sporty compacts. No one can beat the price for these well-equipped,
personable cars. A less-expensive model can be had with a
150-horsepower, four-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
   For '99, all Grand Ams have automatic transmission; stick shift
is expected to be offered next year.
</P>
<P>
   The GT version is greatly improved over previous Grand Ams,
though the SE fails to move the ball forward in any fashion. Guys
will like the guy car, but I think girls will prefer the guy car,
too. &QL;

LADYBUGS MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When thousands of ladybugs swarmed Teri Christoferson's windows
Sunday trying to find a way in, her 12-year-old son, Robert,
defended the Westwoodm Mass., homestead by blowing the ladybugs off
the screens with a vacuum set on reverse. But as soon as the
machine was off, the ladybugs were back.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, however, the beetles had vanished just as suddenly
and mysteriously as they had appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``Halloween ladybugs'' for their colors and timing,
the black-spotted orange creatures are a newly arrived species that
has been infiltrating houses on warm October days ever since they
came to Boston about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In their native Asia, they hibernate in limestone crevices, so
when winter approaches, they look for someplace white to climb
into. Like the Christofersons' white windows.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Cocca, a natural history information coordinator for the
Massachusetts Audubon Society, was herself swarmed with calls about
the insects Monday, all from people who lived in white houses or
houses with white shutters. Most also lived near wooded areas. Some
of the calls were from offices that assigned an employee to
telephone after trading Monday-morning anecdotes about rampaging
ladybugs.
</P>
<P>
   So where did these ladybugs come from, where did they go, and
what should you do about it?
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that the Asian ladybugs (Harmonia axyridis)
hitched a ride here, as they were first recorded in large numbers
near a port in Louisiana 10 years ago. They spread from there and
now they're in all the New England states.
</P>
<P>
   Asian ladybugs spent the warm season outdoors eating insect
pests (they've been a boon to orchardists), but when a warm spell
hit last week, they started swarming. When the weather turned cold
again this week, most settled back down under leaf litter. Those
that got into houses soon disappeared into walls and attics to
hibernate. These ladybugs probably won't be seen again until next
spring, when they'll gather at windows waiting for you to let them
out, which is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   There are several things you can do to thwart Asian ladybugs.
Put screens on attic air vents and keep window screens secure till
November. Consider painting your white house or window trim another
color.
</P>
<P>
   What you should never do is crush ladybugs indoors, because
their fluids stain and have a noxious odor. Insect sprays indoors
are a bad idea, too, as the ladybugs themselves are harmless.
</P>
<P>
   If you're housing uninvited ladybugs, you can vacuum them up
live and dump them outside or stash the bag in a cool basement or
garage and release the beetles in early April. If they do spend the
winter indoors, they won't eat or reproduce, which makes them easy
house guests, so you could also adopt the attitude of the Japanese.
They consider it good luck to house hibernating ladybugs.

   UNDATED - It wasn't the first sneeze that scared me.
</P>
<P>
   When I heard my husband sneeze a third, fourth and fifth time
from the living room, I still had no fear. It's a common occurrence
in our house; if you touch anything, move anything, or sit on
anything, a sneeze is imminent.
</P>

spending too much time out in the sun when she was a puppy, refuses
to come back indoors unless she has completely coated herself with
a thick layer of dirt and dead grass. If you try to brush her or
pat the dirt off her, it will just make more. As a result, I have
enough dust on some bookshelves to plant seeds in.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't scared until my husband woke up the next morning and
shook me awake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, I don't feel so good,'' he squeaked out. ``My throat
feels scratchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, he came back into the bedroom and leaned over
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I coughed up my colon,'' he begged. ``What does it
look like to you?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he stared at me and muttered the most horrendous words a
husband could ever say to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, ``I think I'm going to stay home today.''
</P>
<P>
   I will say right now that my husband is the nicest guy on the
planet. I knew when I married him that I got the best deal on the
market, although I never thought a guy like him would ever settle
for a big bag of trouble like me. We had had a lot to drink the
night he first told me he loved me as we sat in a Denny's parking
lot, and then he bought me a Grand Slam breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The next day he mentioned that he remembered what he had said
and didn't even take it back. I was amazed. I had a Good Guy, an
endangered species. The only thing that would make my husband more
valuable is if he were an albino.
</P>
<P>
   But when he gets sick, King Cranky is born, and a wave of panic
washes over me when he mentions staying home. I know all about the
vows I took when we got married _ for richer, for poorer, in
sickness and in health _ but the man I married changes just as soon
as he's unable to breathe out of one nostril. He becomes a walking
testament to misery, shuffling around the house with two little
wads of tissue compacted in his nose, poking his congested head in
my office every couple minutes and asking me questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the phone ring. Is it for me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it time for my pill yet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much longer do you have to work?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the dictionary? I want to look up `tuberculosis.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, you type loud. Every time you press a key, it's like a
dagger going into my brain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the symptoms for the hantavirus again?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bored.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you make soup from scratch?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the instructions on the box of oatmeal say it should cook
for one minute, how long is that in the microwave?''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, and the fact that I had a deadline that day,
I jumped out of bed, rushed to the bathroom and dug like an animal
through our medicine chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's some stuff to make you feel better,'' I offered to his
droopy eyes, his pink nose, his chapped upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   He unscrewed the top of the bottle and popped a pill into his
mouth. ``What are . . . Derma Caps?'' he asked weakly, reading the
label as he turned the bottle around.
</P>
<P>
   I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spit it out!'' I snapped, holding my hand out. ``Spit it out!
That's medicine for the dog's dandruff!''
</P>
<P>
   I ran back to the bathroom and dug some more. In a box I still
haven't unpacked from our move two years ago, I hit gold. There, at
the bottom, I found a whole box of a cold remedy you mix with water
and then drink. I remember taking that stuff the last time I was
sick, and how I passed out and flew into potent hallucinations
before the last mouthful went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This medicine,'' I told my husband, plopping the two fizzling
tablets in a mug of water, ``is better than drinking a whole fifth
by yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   He downed it in one swallow. Within fifteen minutes, he was
asleep on the couch, twitching and batting at things. It was magic.
</P>
<P>
   I went back to work, but I checked on him every now and then,
and was even privy to some of his hallucinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merv Griffin won't give me back my pillow!'' he shouted from
the couch. ``Give it back! But I'm the Hooner!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey all of you sailors, get out of my house! Put your pants
back on! Where's my wife?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you, Mister, I'm Nick Barkley and I'm the head of this
ranch!''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I even suspected that he was beginning to regain
consciousness, I mixed up another batch of cold stuff and poured it
down his throat. I had drugged him so heavily he could have written
``The White Album'' all by himself. By nightfall, I had made my
deadline successfully, and I went into the living room to see how
many things I could put up my husband's nose before he woke up.
</P>
<P>
   I had a nickel in my hand when he shuddered awake, rubbed his
eyes and then said, ``Honey, you don't look so good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those sailors wear me out!'' I replied. (begin ital) ``Choo!''
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' my husband gasped. ``You're getting sick!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not!'' I protested. (begin ital) ``Choo! Choo! Choo!''
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't handle this,'' he replied, handing me a tissue. ``You
get so cranky when you're sick! You turn into Mrs. Mean!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not!'' I said angrily, patting my nose with the Kleenex.
``Will you quit looking at me? Move over, hog! I want to lie down
there!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I get you anything?'' he asked kindly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shut your pie hole!'' I screeched. (begin ital) ````Choo!''
(end ital) Your voice goes through me like daggers! Get me some
soup! But I want it from scratch!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got something a little better,'' he said, getting up from
the couch, and in no less than five seconds, I heard the familiar
sounds of Plop! Plop! Fizz! Fizz! coming from the kitchen. &QL;

WADING ONTO THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When my dad was in his 70s, I gave him a tape recorder.
He'd once said he wished he could save certain radio talk-show
conversations and I thought he'd like being able to record his
favorite parts. He turned the tape recorder over in his hand before
giving it back to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, Dad?'' I said. ``Look, it's easy. You just press the red
button and the one beside it. That's all there is to it.'' He shook
his head. It was clear he felt the machine was too complicated for
him to master.
</P>
<P>
   It was upsetting to see my dad intimidated by technology. I
vowed that would never happen to me. I didn't want growing older to
mean getting befuddled by every newfangled invention. So I figured
out how to hook up a fax, how to get on the Internet, and how to
send an e-mail. I should have known I wouldn't have time to rest on
my laurels.
</P>
<P>
   The next obstacle was my own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years I've personally answered letters from readers
without too much difficulty, but I was overwhelmed by how many of
my readers requested a spirituality inventory last May. The first
batch of letters covered the dining-room table, and every time I
caught a glimpse of oak, the mailman delivered hundreds more. I had
to open every letter and respond to questions, fold and fit three
sheets of paper into such a variety of envelopes that at times I
felt I was in the middle of an origami project. Some people forgot
to enclose an envelope. Others forgot the stamp. I added my return
address. It took all my leisure time for one solid month.
</P>
<P>
   This is not something I want to ever do again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet time and again, I think of things I'd like to share with my
readers. For example, after hearing Dr. Susan Love speak in Boston
about the importance of adding soy to a healthy diet, the steering
committee of the Marblehead Cancer Prevention Project decided to
have a soy potluck dinner. I collected all the recipes, plus our
evaluations, and wanted to share them with my readers, but I didn't
want to do the self-addressed stamped-envelope dance again. It
occurred to me that if I had a Web site on which to post them,
those recipes could be downloaded far more easily than I could ever
mail them.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, I thought of a million uses for a Web site. I
have photos of my family I thought folks might enjoy comparing to
the images they've carried in their heads for the past 17 years.
Since my schedule includes numerous speaking engagements that are
open to the public, a Web site would give me a chance to invite
readers to attend. I could include information about the subjects
of my talks in case anyone wanted to invite me to address their
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are reviews of my books, which most folks have never
seen. Although ``No Place Like Home'' is out of print, I have 600
copies in the garage for sale to those who'd like to read
selections from my earliest columns. I envisioned including a
reading group guide for my new book, ``Family Puzzles,'' which
would bring up provocative issues for discussion. It also occurred
to me that I could stay in touch with readers who've left Boston by
posting my ``Ever So Humble'' column on my Web site every week so
that they could visit me on the Internet from anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   I had no problem imagining the content. It was implementation
that stopped me cold.
</P>
<P>
   How do you get a Web site? How much does it cost? Does it matter
how many screens you fill? Does a Web site end up being another
monthly charge or does your e-mail account cover it? How do you
update it? How do you get your Web site listed on search engines?
All I knew was the depth of my ignorance. I toyed with the idea of
taking a Web-site workshop, but the task seemed overwhelming. For
months I did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I was actually eating a mushroom stuffed with tofu and bread
crumbs at our soy dinner when I gave vent to my confusion. What
happened next always happens in my life. The minute I'm clear
enough to express a need, the perfect person to help me appears as
if by magic.
</P>
<P>
   It just so happened that the woman I was speaking to was married
to a man who'd just decided to create Web sites for a living. I'd
known Jane for a year yet I hadn't had even a inkling of that. It
felt like fate to me. And so, with a folder full of papers and
photos, I met with her husband and placed my Web site in Nelson's
hands. The depth of my ignorance hasn't changed, but my Web site is
now on line.
</P>
<P>
   Come visit me at www.shore.net/weltner. I'm at home there 24
hours a day.

SOMETIMES A LEACHING FIELD CAN BE RELOCATED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am having trouble with the septic system in my 15-year-old
house. The leaching field is saturated. I had the tank cleaned out
and was told that the water table is high, and that not much can be
done about the saturated field. The house abuts conservation land
classified as wetlands. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   CALLER from Cohasset, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You can pray that the town will install sewers some day, but
don't hold your breath. The house abutting wetlands is a clue as to
why the leaching field becomes saturated; there is no place for the
effluence to drain to because the water is already there, very
close to the surface. Fifteen years ago builders built houses
anywhere, and put in septic systems in virtual swamps, not caring
about the consequences. There were no Title 5 regulations then.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the leaching field can be relocated to an area where
the soil is permeable, where water and other liquids will percolate
into the ground properly. This may be impossible because of the
proximity to wetlands. So another alternative (probably the only
option) is to raise the leaching field high enough so there will be
plenty of permeable earth for the liquids to percolate into safely,
without damaging the environment. This might mean a mountain of
earth in your yard, but if the yard is big enough, you could make
it sort of a yard landmark. Anything you do will be expensive, but
if you sell the house, it will be required anyway.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do I have to waterproof the bricks on my new outdoor steps? I
was told I should seal them.
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no need to apply sealer, which will temporarily
waterpoof them. But they are already waterproof, or as waterproof
as any masonry can get. Sit tight and do nothing, and be happy with
good-looking brick steps. If they get dirty, you can treat them
with bleach and water, or be philosophical about outdoor floors and
sidewalks, which will get dirty no matter what you do, but not too
dirty; besides, rain will help keep them as clean as they are going
to get. To seal bricks, you have to apply a masonry sealer every
year or two. Who needs that maintenance chore?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have never had any luck with caulking between the tub and
tile. And in my present house, between the fiberglass tub surround
and cast-iron tub. The caulking is quite dry now. I bought some
silicone caulking. Will that improve things? I have also heard that
filling the tub with water will depress it a little, allowing more
caulking to go into the joint. Does that really help? Also, can I
caulk the edges of a slider on the tub to stop a leak?
</P>
<P>
   STEVE FUSI, Bedford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Most caulking jobs like yours fail because there is very
little space for the caulking to go into. Caulking should go into a
groove or a slot or trench, if you will; the same goes for putting
mortar into a brick joint. Just slopping it on a plain corner is
not going to work.
</P>
<P>
   So, gouge out or remove the old caulking. And, filling the tub
with water will indeed help depress the tub so there will be a good
space for the caulking to go into. Fill the tub as high as it will
go, take off shoes and socks, and get in the tub to depress it even
further. When you get out and drain the tub, it will rise and tend
to squeeze the caulking into a watertight joint. No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   No, you cannot caulk against the slider; well, you can, but it
won't do any good. You have to get the caulk into something. So,
remove the frame, scrape off old caulk, and put a big bead of new
caulk along the tub edge, then put the frame back, pressing against
and squeezing the caulk. After the caulk sets, cut off any excess
that is squeezed out with a utility knife.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My cottage stays empty in winter, when mice move in and I see
droppings everywhere. Would a plug-in ultrasonic repellent work to
keep them away?
</P>
<P>
   H.S., Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Probably not. One of the leading pest-control books, ``Common
Sense Pest Control,'' reports generally negative results with such
ultrasonic devices.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet (and the book confirms this) is to seal the house.
That sounds like a big order, and it probably is, but it is the
most effective way to keep out mice. Be aware that a mouse can go
through a hole the size of a dime. Caulk all visible joints and
stuff larger openings with Stuffit, a nonrusting steel wool.
Regular steel wool will help, but will rust over time.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious place of entry is under sinks and in cabinets, where
pipes and wires enter, and where the sides of cabinets don't quite
make it to the tops of cabinets and sinks, leaving gaps that mice
can climb up and over. And they are good climbers.
</P>
<P>
   Putting D-Con or other poisonous baits in cabinets and in the
basement or crawl space may kill a lot of mice, which could help.
But such baits may attract more mice than usual, and there will be
others to take the place of the deceased brethren.
</P>

   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &LR;  (Moving in ``e'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   PERSIAN-ART-EXHIBIT (New York) _ In every culture, objects of
beauty bring delight. They also push ideologies, advertise
interests, secure alliance and pump up reputations. So it has
always been; so it is likely always to be. It was certainly true
two centuries ago in Iran. By Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   VAUTIER-ART-EXHIBIT (New York) _ Ben Vautier is appearing in
three shows in New York: ``Ben Vautier: Statements with Clocks,''
at the John Gibson Gallery in SoHo; with one large piece, ``Gallery
One,'' in ``Premises: Invested Spaces'' at the Guggenheim Museum
SoHo, and ``Ben Vautier: Photo Rejects,'' at the Zabriskie Gallery
on East 57th Street. Lots of Ben: joy to the world. By Vicki
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   FAIRIES-ART-EXHIBIT (New York) _ It's about sex. I am, of
course, referring to the peculiar and heretofore obscure Victorian
phenomenon known as fairy painting, the subject of a show at the
Frick that is a scaled-back version of a hugely popular exhibition
in London a year ago. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER-PROGRAM-EXHIBIT (New York) _ More than 100 theater
programs of the avant-garde theater in Paris are on view at the
National Academy Museum in Manhattan. By John Russell.
</P>
<P>
   APPLE'S-LOUISVILLE (Louisville, Ky.) _ The city began with the
river. As the broad and occasionally unruly Ohio flows southwest
from Pittsburgh toward its rendezvous with the Mississippi, it is
interrupted here by rapids. In 1778, that barrier prompted George
Rogers Clark, a young frontiersman from Virginia, to pause on his
trip west and establish a settlement that eventually grew into
this, the first metropolis west of the Alleghenies. By R.W. Apple
Jr. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY-THEATER (New York) _ In the rehearsal hall, the
dialogue was sliced tart and true from the life and times of Monica
Lewinsky, with no less than three actresses taking a crack at the
ultimate ingenue's role in the inescapable national melodrama that
has no copyright, perchance no ending. By Francis X. Clines
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-MUSIC-BENEFIT (New York) _ Review of a concert at Avery
Fisher Hall for the Jerusalem Foundation. By Allan Kozinn.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTLOOSE-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ Ben Brantley reviews
``Footloose'' the musical.
</P>
<P>
   HUBBARD-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ D.J.R. Bruckner reviews
``Mother Hubbard.''
</P>
<P>
   BROWN-DANCE-COMPANY (New York) _ For a small company like
Evidence, this season is major. And all Ronald Brown's meticulous
planning was disrupted when, soon after rehearsals began, six of

THE HARD READ CAFE COULD DO A LOT OF GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hard Read Cafe, another brilliant concept brought to you by
the same column that brought you the Soft Rock Cafe. And whatever
happened to that idea? Could it be that its time has finally come?
What with the Burt Bacharach revival and all? Or isn't he soft
rock? He's soft, definitely. But rock?
</P>
<P>
   Back to the Hard Read Cafe, where the great books are always
accessible, and the not-so-great books are too. Where there's a
trained staff, many with advanced degrees, to explain the difficult
bits, to describe how a particular work fits into the grand scheme
of literature.
</P>
<P>
   How many times have you put down a book, maybe even flung it
across the room, shouting, ``What the hell is this supposed to be
about?''
</P>
<P>
   The Hard Read Cafe would could provide the answer.
</P>
<P>
   People are turning back to books. Some are turning to them for
the very first time. Oprah's television book groups are a huge
success. National Public Radio has a monthly
reading-group-of-the-air. Don Imus is handing out big-money
literary prizes. On the Internet, amazon.com is thriving. People
actually debate the merits of the Modern Library list of the 100
best English-language novels of the 20th century. And while smaller
bookstores are being driven out of business by the big chains,
those big chains are getting bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Reading is back. But if reading is going to flourish in the
information-overload age it has to be glamorous, trendy, now, hot,
or cool, or whatever the current word may be.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Hard Read Cafe occurred to me last weekend in
Baltimore, where there's a new waterfront attraction, the Power
Plant, a huge building that used to be what its name implies. Now
the east wing houses a Hard Rock Cafe, the west wing the new ESPN
Zone, the prototype for a planned chain of sports bars on steroids.
In the middle there's a Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The lines were long outside the Hard Rock, and outside the ESPN
Zone too. Inside Barnes &AMP; Noble people browsed the shelves, but
outside there were no lines of people waiting to be granted
admittance. Why not? Now that reading is back, shouldn't there be
eager throngs clamoring to get into bookstores?
</P>
<P>
   Hence the Hard Read. It's really only a step or two beyond what
some bookstores are doing now. They sponsor book groups, readings,
and signings by authors. Staff members post lists of personal
recommendations. And many bookstores have cafes. In some instances
it almost seems that the cafe is the big draw, the books merely
incidental.
</P>
<P>
   Books will never take a back seat at the Hard Read Cafe. Reading
will always be the main event. Not that we'll stint on amenities.
At the Hard Read Cafe you'll be able to sit down with a scholar,
maybe even a PhD, who'll help you understand those difficult
passages in, say, ``Ulysses,'' or ``Darkness at Noon,'' over a cup
of coffee or a glass of wine and an authentic literary delicacy
from our cafe menu. Bread pudding James Joyce. Mansfield Park
gooseberry tart. Chlodnik a la Alice B. Toklas. Pinhead oatmeal
porridge in the style of George Bernard Shaw. And the inevitable
Remembrance of Things Past madeleines.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Hard Rock Cafes display collections of rock n' roll
artifacts, the Hard Read Cafe will be adorned with select literary
memorabilia. Pop music pilgrims travel great distances to Hard Rock
Cafes to eat cheeseburgers and stare at Mick Jagger's codpiece, or
whatever. Imagine the appeal to avid readers of items with literary
associations. Edith Wharton's corset stays. An empty bottle of
Wildroot Creme Oil thought to have been used by F. Scott
Fitzgerald. An Ernest Hemingway wineskin, signed by the author.
Really, the possibilities are endless.

NEWSPAPERS LAG ON HIRING MINORITY JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, the American Society of Newspaper Editors set
a goal of having newsrooms match the nation's racial makeup by the
year 2000. With the millennium around the corner, minorities
constitute just over a quarter of the American population, but
minority journalists still fill only 11.46 percent of the newsroom
desks. At its board meeting in Miami this week, ASNE emerged with a
mission statement declaring that ``the nation's newsrooms must
reflect the racial diversity of American society by 2025 or
sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we will be measured as much for our efforts as our
aspirations,'' declared ASNE president Edward Seaton. Included in
those efforts are a series of upcoming round-tables to encourage
minority journalists, journalism teachers, and media foundation
officials to brainstorm about the elusive goal of stronger minority
recruitment and retention. In addition, ASNE will establish
``measurable benchmarks'' to gauge its progress _ in areas from
increasing minority internships to reducing minority turnover _
every three years.
</P>
<P>
   But ASNE's new diversity declarations provoked a mixed reaction
in some quarters. ``We're encouraged that the society thinks
diversity is a goal worth striving for,'' says Vanessa Williams,
president of the National Association of Black Journalists. But
``we're troubled that they've put the goal (of diversity by 2025)
so far away.'' Asserting that ``lack of commitment'' has been the
single biggest obstacle to journalistic diversity, Williams worries
that the 2025 deadline creates ``no sense of urgency.'' By ASNE's
own count, 42 percent of American daily papers have no minority
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ASNE's mission statement is ``not sufficient,'' agrees Kara
Briggs, president of the Native American Journalists Association
and of UNITY: Journalists of Color Inc. ``Is it a step in the right
direction? Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she says ASNE has ``done some very serious talking and
engaged in some very respectful dialogue'' on the topic of
diversity, Briggs still worries that newsroom diversity is still a
``numbers game'' that does not recognize the inherent value of
minority journalists and often creates ``hostile environments'' for
those journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that this has to be a two-fold challenge,'' she adds.
``Certainly it is a newsrooom policy issue. But it is also an
in-your-heart issue. ... Are you willing to have a change of heart
about the value of these journalists?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
What's next for Newsweek? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Newsweek staffers gather in New York today for a memorial
service for editor Maynard Parker, thoughts turn to a successor.
Parker, whose legacy is his magazine's out-hustling of rival Time
on the cultural Zeitgeist beat, died last week of complications
from pneumonia after battling leukemia. He leaves an ostensible
heir apparent in managing editor Mark Whitaker. But his ascension
may not yet be a done deal. Other reported contenders include
international editions editor Michael Elliott and assistant
managing editors Evan Thomas and Ann McDaniel. The selection of
either Whitaker, an African-American, or McDaniel would strike a
blow for diversity atop the masthead. But word is that McDaniel,
based in Washington, is not eager to relocate to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Parker was known for a hard-driving style, what Time managing
editor Walter Isaacson called ``his legendary intensity'' in a
tribute he penned in Time. But his final resting place is far
removed from New York's grinding journalistic rat race. Parker's
ashes will be scattered near a favored Oregon vacation spot.

ALTHOUGH VIAGRA SALES SHRINK, IT REMAINS QUITE A MONEY MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some men simply didn't get the results they'd been promised.
Others balked at the cost, not to mention possible deadly side
effects. Then there were those who found that Viagra boosted their
confidence along with their sexual performance _ to the point where
they could leave the medication in the medicine cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   All of which helps explain why sales of Viagra have fallen
substantially from the sky-high levels they reached in April, when
the drug was released.
</P>
<P>
   But even with that decline, reflected in sales figures released
last week, Viagra remains the most successful new drug in history.
And Wall Street analysts, along with physicians who are prescribing
the drug and patients who are taking it, remain bullish about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the most successful drug ever. It's just not twice
as much as the next closest, the way it was,'' said Len Yaffe, a
pharmaceutical analyst at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco. ``We expected this rapid uptake, the lull in between,
and the flattening out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Stripling, an Atlanta urologist who has prescribed the
drug to more than 2,000 patients, said that while he has seen
interest wane somewhat, ``Viagra still is the best in initial
treatment and probably will be the gold standard for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way Paul sees it, too. The 46-year-old who lives on
the North Shore has been taking Viagra for four months to help him
function sexually after undergoing groin surgery stemming from a
bicycle accident. The drug ``definitely works,'' he said. ``It's
extraordinary, its effectiveness can not be overstated.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem, added Paul, is that his health insurer limits
reimbursement for the drug, which can cost up to $10 a tablet. ``If
it was any other organ,'' he argued, ``the insurance company
couldn't say it just won't pay for it. It's obscene.''
</P>
<P>
   The Viagra craze began even before the drug came out last
spring. The media was awash with stories about how merely popping a
pill not only would cure impotence, but could let already-potent
men reach new levels of performance. Within a week of its release,
Viagra captured nearly 80 percent of the market for drugs to treat
sexual dysfunction, and within a month doctors were writing about
300,000 prescriptions a week. Worldwide sales for its first quarter
hit $411 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sky seemed the limit, but the reality playing out on the
ground was more sobering, as became clear with last week's release
of the latest sales statistics: Prescriptions are down to about
170,000 a week. And worldwide sales in the most recent quarter
plummeted to $141 million, a third of what they were the previous
four months.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the decline was a natural sorting out of those
who didn't really need the drug, or for whom it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tidal wave of interest and desire is gone,'' said Dr.
Abraham Morgentaler, director of the male infertility and impotence
program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ``It doesn't work
quite as well as advertised in the media, but clearly it works in
about 50 percent of guys with some sort of physical problem with
their erection. ... It's not 90 percent, but it's an amazing
figure, and for those 50 percent it's fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the drug works is straightforward: The main problem for
men with impotence is that not enough blood gets into or stays in
the penis to keep it erect. Within an hour of taking Viagra,
however, smooth muscles in the penis are relaxed enough to let
blood flow into the spongy tissue that becomes engorged to cause an
erection.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra also has proven a boon to many men whose troubles in
sustaining an erection are psychological, although many of them
aren't getting new prescriptions. ``They may still have tablets in
the bathroom,'' said Stripling, the Atlanta urologist. ``Just
knowing it's there, they can go to bed with more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear of potentially deadly side effects is another reason
for the drop in sales. Such fears were fanned when the US Food and
Drug Administration reported last summer that at least 69 men
taking Viagra died during its first four months on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA and Pfizer Inc., the drug's manufacturer, say that death
toll is low given that more than 2 million men had taken the drug,
and many of those who died were old or sick enough that it probably
was from overexertion. They also point out that the drug carries a
warning against taking it if you are on nitro-glycerine or other
nitrates.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Washington-based Health
Research Group, said that those warnings aren't sufficient and that
many would-be Viagra users have come to realize that ``having an
erection is really important, but it's not worth dying for.''
</P>
<P>
   For those not at risk, and who liked the drug when they first
tried it, there's another reason not to sign up for refills: It's
simply too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Some HMOs have been paying for the pill, but they often make
doctors and patients fill out so many forms certifying that they
suffer from dysfunction that it has discouraged them from filing
for reimbursement. Other insurers will only cover it under special,
more expensive policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure that about 50 percent of insurers and managed-care
companies will reimburse for it, and we're hoping to see that
increase over time,'' said Mariann Caprino, spokeswoman for Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the dampening of interest and those disincentives for
use, Viagra still is almost sure to become the best-selling new
drug ever. The record-holder is Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering
drug released last year that earned just over $1 billion during its
first 12 months. Viagra is on track to earn more than $1.1 billion
by the end of its maiden year, said Yaffe, the investment analyst,
and that's based on reaching just one-fifth of its market of an
estimated 20 million American men who suffer from impotence.

FUNNYMAN LAUGHS OFF LACK OF RECOGNITION IN U.S.  
 (ADV: WITH CELINE-DION-MUSIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - More than 16,000 tickets to Celine Dion's concert in
Phoenix went on sale on a Sunday back in April. In only two days,
all were sold.
</P>
<P>
   You have to figure that at some point, about 15,999 of those
buyers were looking at their tickets and wondering, ``Who the hell
is Andre-Philippe Gagnon?''
</P>
<P>
   The man with the big moniker is the fortunate soul who landed
the opening spot on the Canadian chanteuse's ``Love in the Round''
tour. And while his name may be as common as Sleaman's Cream Ale
north of the border, the Quebec-born funnyman knows it's a
different story down here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Americans hear that Andre-Philippe Gagnon is on the show,
they get confused,'' says the comedian, calling from a Calgary,
Alberta, hotel. ``There's this element of surprise the first five
minutes: `Who is this French-Canadian with the thick accent?' But
the accent disappears when I sing, and the mood starts to build up.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, I have people on their feet, applauding, so I've
warmed them up. They're ready to welcome Celine and to party.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from his mammoth press kit, the whole Gagnon story seems
to be a veritable phenomenon. A shy kid in French-speaking Canada
watches Tweety Bird cartoons on a daily basis. He doesn't
understand the words, but he learns to do a pretty fine imitation
of the lippy canary.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, the kid is imitating teachers, friends,
celebrities. He grows up, hits the Canadian comedy circuit. A 1985
gig on ``The Tonight Show'' launches him into the front ranks north
of the border and in France, although U.S. fame has yet to
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done shows at the Comedy Store and in Vegas,'' says
Gagnon, a genuinely friendly type. ``The shows in America don't
give you the same exposure. In Canada, I sell out 4,000-seat
theaters. Then you play to 30 people at the Comedy Store, so it's
different.''
</P>
<P>
   He's hoping that the current tour will raise his American
profile. Plus, the U.S. tour works out well for him. When he was
focusing on the French-speaking world, he was a young guy with no
commitments. Now he's 37, a married man with two small kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've neglected the States for some time,'' he admits. ``Things
were going so well in France, and I was traveling a lot. But now,
the traveling is easier if we stay in North America because I can
see my family more.''
</P>
<P>
   His repertoire has grown to include more than 400 voices. It's
tempting to call him a Canadian Rich Little, until you remember
that Rich Little was born in Ottawa. Still, Gagnon probably is the
most famous impressionist of his generation working in his homeland
today.
</P>
<P>
   Gagnon doesn't offer up many impressions on the phone _ he's
resting his voice before a gig. But the concepts sound funny. His
big number is a re-creation of ``We Are the World,'' in which he
handles all the different celebrity voices. He does
``Unforgettable,'' a la Natalie and Nat King Cole. There's Roger
Whittaker singing heavy metal and Metallica performing nursery
rhymes.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there is the whole different-culture thing to deal
with. Gino Vannelli and Gordon Lightfoot impressions probably won't
inspire big belly laughs at the Purple Palace. And no matter how
good a Pierre Trudeau joke is, it's still a Pierre Trudeau joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in front of Canadians, it's a little different,'' he
says. ``When I'm in front of Americans, I do their Top 40. I tell
stories about the parallels in the culture. It all works out. If
something doesn't work, I've taken it out of the show by now.''
</P>
<P>
   And no, he won't do any Celine impersonations in the show. He
used to do her back in her child-star days, before she crossed over
to English-speaking audiences. But now he offers only kind words
for the titanic-voiced singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so talented and so generous,'' he says. ``She works so
hard. It's no wonder why she's such a success. We're all like a big
family to her _ she takes the time to say hi to everybody on the
tour. It's a two-way situation _ she loves them and we love her.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, he's talking about his boss. Still, the sentiment sounds
sincere. And for a guy who has been in the limelight for more than
a decade, he sounds remarkably grounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out that someone in Arizona wanted to talk to
me,'' Gagnon confesses, ``I thought it had to be some kind of
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Nope. After the concert Sunday, (Oct. 25) the joke will be on
those Celine Dion fans still wondering, ``Who the hell is
Andre-Philippe Gagnon?'' &QL;

MUSIC AS A METAPHOR MAKES FOR COMPELLING FICTION

   CANONE INVERSO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Paolo Maurensig &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Translated from Italian by Jenny McPhee &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holt, 202 pp. $21 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paolo Maurensig was past 50 when he wrote his first novel, ``The
Lueneberg Variation,'' which enthralled an international literary
audience a couple of years ago. His second, ``Canone Inverso,'' is
another fable or metafiction at least as compelling as its
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lueneberg Variation'' used chess as subject and metaphor
for history; for ``Canone Inverso'' Maurensig uses music for the
same purpose. This is a subject Maurensig can write about from
within, because he plays Baroque flute, viola da gamba, and cello,
and one of his earlier careers was as a restorer of old
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, ``Canone Inverso'' is a story about two young men
and a violin. Jeno Varga is a musician of promise, maybe of genius,
the illegitimate son of a Hungarian peasant woman; his only
connection to the father he never knew is a violin, an unusual
instrument with ``a tiny anthropomorphic head carved into the top
of the pegbox, where one usually finds the traditional scroll. ...
This (head) was a very precise reproduction of a man's face,
perhaps a Mameluke, with a drooping mustache, a ferocious
expression, and a wide-open mouth, as if he were screaming in pain
or anguish.''
</P>
<P>
   We follow Jeno through his early affinity for the violin, to the
beginning of serious studies, to his infatuation with the great
violinist Sophie Hirschbaum. Then he arrives at an isolated and
prestigious Austrian musical school, the Schola Cantorum, which is
a cross between a monastery and a labor camp. There Jeno meets
another young violinist, Kuno Blau, a young aristocrat who is
everything he is not. The two, for a time, find common ground in
music, and Jeno goes to visit Kuno in the Tyrolean family castle,
Hofstain. There the friendship of the two young men both reaches
its apex and begins to unravel _ Jeno is a better musician and
violinist than Kuno, and the differences in their backgrounds seem
obscurely hostile, not complementary. ``Without my being aware, our
friendship, which had risen to its supreme fulfillment in an
original burst of mutual genius, had already, and for some time,
begun its descent, its countdown, or, to use a musical term, its
canone inverso.'' (A canone inverso is one in which the second
voice is the first one played upside down; Maurensig's canon seems
to be both upside down and moving backward, in retrograde).
</P>
<P>
   There is much thoughtful discussion among the residents of
Hofstain, and the discussions are repeatedly interrupted by ugly
incidents of rivalry and betrayal that unfold in an atmosphere of
strange family secrets. Nothing is uglier, however, than a concert
Jeno later attends in Vienna, when Hirschbaum is booed for daring
to play the Violin Concerto by Mendelssohn. ``It was an anonymous
crowd, attracted, in its stupidity, to a sign of power, to
something that promised to satisfy its repressed base instincts, a
crowd that had come, in a sort of sleepwalker's stupor, to take
part in a lynching, a public execution. It was a crowd that
rumbled, and came together in order to see what was going on, a
bobbing crowd that was moving ... toward perdition, turning their
backs on salvation, blindly aiming toward the place of their own
annihilation. I extracted myself from those bodies and went to the
front of the theater. Scraps of paper were scattered over the steps
leading up to the entrance. Posters and notices had been ripped
from the walls and covered with offensive graffiti and swastikas.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurensig unfolds this tale with an elegant, beguiling, and
meaningful complexity: There are stories within stories, and
everything reverberates. The book opens in the 1980s, when the
first narrator has just been reunited with a strange and familiar
violin he has bought at auction at Christie's. A second narrator, a
writer, arrives too late for the auction, and tries to buy the
violin because he has heard something of its story from an old
itinerant fiddler named Jeno; for the writer, the existence of the
violin affirms the truth of the ``terrible story'' he has heard,
which he repeats to the violin's new owner, mostly in Jeno's words.
By the end, we have learned who the violin's new owner is, and in
the last couple of pages, in a document that has come into his
possession, we learn a fact about Jeno and Kuno that makes it
necessary to reexamine the whole book, and its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Until the end approaches, that single word ``swastikas'' is the
only direct reference to the history that surrounds Jeno and Kuno
and that is about to engulf them, but just about everything in the
story of the two men is a probe into that history, its causes, its
meaning, and its consequences. The writer says he wants to ``get to
the end'' of the story he is investigating; there is no way to get
to the end of history, but you can encompass it, illuminate it,
wrestle it into a kind of order, even if the order is as complex as
a canone inverso, and that's what Paolo Maurensig has accomplished.

SINGER REVEALS A QUIETER SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following a blockbuster album is an almost impossible task.
Whether you're Michael Jackson, U2, Madonna _ or Alanis Morissette
_ it can be a thankless job, though no one is going to shed any
tears for you. It's now Morissette's turn to give it a go, as she
prepares to follow up her 28-million-selling ``Jagged Little Pill''
album with the strangely titled ``Supposed Former Infatuation
Junkie,'' which hits record store shelves Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   She's previewing it with a club tour that drew a sold-out crowd
of 1,500 fanatics to Avalon Thursday night. They may have come to
hear Morissette pick up from the ``angry young woman'' image that
suffused her last album, but what they got was a more mature, more
inwardly calm, but still terrific, performer.
</P>
<P>
   Morissette crammed nine new songs into her 90-minute set _ many
of them still hard to fathom because the audience and this critic
had not yet digested them _ but the most significant moment was
actually on an older song, ``You Oughta Know,'' a once-angry anthem
that had been defused dramatically. It was obvious that Morissette
no longer had the heart to sing it venomously, which tells a lot
about where she is today.
</P>
<P>
   Having taken a long time off, during which she traveled to and
meditated in India, Morissette is clearly a different, more evolved
person. She said nothing to the crowd other than ``thank you''
after every number, but she didn't have to. It was apparent in her
manner and in many of her new songs, which have a slower, more
pensive air, and ride a rhythm of grooves, rather than the
guitar-steeped, rock 'n' roll intensity of the aptly named ``Jagged
Little Pill.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a black and silver T-shirt, a maroon, India-print
skirt, with her hair in a pigtail dangling to her waist, Morissette
performed in front of a curtain that contained the bold-printed
words: ``We ask you to abide by the following moral code upon the
premises: Please refrain from killing.'' The same saying was on her
T-shirts for sale at the gig, which had the further embellishment
of asking that you refrain from ``lying, stealing, sexual
misconduct, and taking intoxicants.''
</P>
<P>
   Morissette opened with new track ``Baba,'' which questions the
pursuit of gurus. ``How soon will I be holy? How much does this
cost, guru?'' she asked in the song, as she built to an
open-throated wail and let her band (now five pieces with the
addition of a groove-stoking keyboardist) take over.
</P>
<P>
   She switched to acoustic guitar for the new ``Can't Not'' (which
asked gently, ``Would I be whining if I asked for a hug?'') and the
new, more rocking ``Would Not Come,'' in which she wondered, ``If
I'm masculine, I will be taken more seriously.'' And in the new
``Sympathetic Character,'' she sang, ``I was afraid of your
testosterone.'' These underscored a new vulnernability, rather than
the armored attack of her last disc.
</P>
<P>
   Morissette, who was in great voice and was setting the table for
an arena tour to follow this winter, reached back for oldies ``Hand
in My Pocket'' and ``All I Really Want,'' but the focus was
definitely on the new. In yet another new tune, ``Joining You,''
she concluded, ``We need reflection.'' And that's as good a summary
of her new path as any.

THE DIVINE MISS DION?  
 (ADV: WITH GAGNON-COMIC) 
</HEADLINE>
 DION-MUSIC-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The gushing tone was undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celine Dion is just incredible,'' the woman on the phone said.
``She is such a (begin ital) diva. (end ital)''
</P>
<P>
   It made me pause. Celine Dion is a lot of things. Wildly
successful, sure. Canadian, of course. Multilingual, (begin ital)
oui. (end ital) But a diva? I think not.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because VH1 recently included her in its ``Divas
Live'' special. Maybe it's just that she's a woman who sings with
all the subtlety of a bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
   But a classic, true-blue diva? Pardon me, but the sparkly gown
of divadom simply does not fit on the 30-year-old singer's petite
frame. In a few years, who knows? Right now, though, she's simply a
nice woman with a great set of pipes and a cute accent.
</P>
<P>
   To attain true divaness, a few requirements must be met. It's
like passing a driving test. It separates the women from the girls.
It's the difference between a Madonna and a Sheena Easton.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick rundown on the holy triumvirate of divadom. A
woman can achieve diva status without all three, but a minimum of
two is absolutely essential.
</P>
<P>
   - Attitude: Divas have it down pat, baby. They take no bull.
They pull no punches. It's two snaps up and then they're out.
</P>
<P>
   Divas can be nice women, but there's that snappish edge that
comes out at the oddest times. A classic diva moment: Diana Ross
grabbing the microphone away from Mary Wilson during the ``Motown
25'' anniversary special. ``Reach Out and Touch Somebody's Hand''?
I'll reach out, honey.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples: Barbra Streisand, Courtney Love, Claudine
Longet, Kathleen Battle, Patti LaBelle.
</P>
<P>
   - Survival instinct: Nothing stops true divas. There is no
obstacle they cannot overcome. They will endure anything and come
out singing. That's one reason Judy Garland is the mother of all
divas: She went through almost every conceivable hell and still
performed ``Over the Rainbow'' with a touching believability. Plus,
it gives divas a good reason to shed actual tears on a concert
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples: Gloria Estefan, Connie Francis, Rosemary
Clooney, Billie Holiday, Edith Piaf, Liza Minnelli, Tina Turner.
</P>
<P>
   - Sheer fabulosity: You've heard the expression ``Miss Thang?''
Divas not only know it _ they live it. They think they (begin ital)
are (end ital) it. There is nothing more pleasing than hearing the
sound of their own voice, which is one reason they love to indulge
in vocal acrobatics even if it has nothing to do with the song they
are singing.
</P>
<P>
   That's why insecurity doesn't work with this aspect of divadom.
She must be big and brash. She's so over-the-top she should play
only in open-air arenas. A shy diva is an oxymoron. A diva is not a
fly on the wall; she's the life of the party. Bette Midler is a
one-woman amusement park, while Paula Cole could have a lampshade
on her head and you still wouldn't notice her.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples: Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Minnie Riperton,
Vikki Carr, Shirley Bassey, Cher.
</P>
<P>
   See? It's simply a little too early for Celine to come to the
party. It doesn't have to do with age _ Brandy has already made it
and she's not out of her teens yet. It has more to do with
experience, with style, with pure ``it''-ness.
</P>
<P>
   Celine may be on her way, but she's not there yet. Give her time
_ and some lessons from RuPaul _ and who knows? &QL;

THERE ARE WAYS TO GET BETTER MATCHES IN BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two new studies published in the recent New England Journal of
Medicine show that bone marrow transplantion can be refined to get
better matches between unrelated donors and recipients, and better
outcomes between partially mismatched, related donors.
</P>
<P>
   The studies, one by Japanese researchers and one by an
Israeli-Italian team, ``are milestones in our quest to find bone
marrow donors for all our patients,'' Dutch researchers noted in an
editorial. ``It is equally clear,'' they added, ``that many other
milestones will have to be passed before not only all patients have
donors, but also all are cured.''
</P>
<P>
   In bone marrow transplantation, marrow cells or so-called stem
cells from another person or stored cells from the patient himself
are used to reconstitute the patient's own bone marrow after it is
destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation. About 30,000 such
transplants are performed a year worldwide, and in many the patient
acts as his own donor.
</P>
<P>
   When it is necessary to use cells from another person, the best
matches are between identical twins, although matches involving
other family members, or even strangers whose blood is similar to
the patient's, are sometimes close enough.
</P>
<P>
   In the Japanese study, 440 patients, most of whom had leukemia,
received transplants from unrelated donors. The team showed that
even when standard antibody tests showed donors and recipients
carried identical markers called HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR, more
precise tests of DNA revealed small but important differences.
``Genomic typing'' of HLA ``adds substantially to the success of
transplantation,'' the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a deeper way of identifying'' matches and ``should
become state of the art,'' says Dr. Jerome Groopman, chief of
experimental medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   In the Italian-Israeli study, 43 leukemia patients received
transplants from related donors. In each case, half of the donor's
HLA markers were a good match with the recipient's and half were
not. Often, this degree of mismatch causes the donated cells to
attack the recipient (graft versus host disease, or GVHD) or leads
to failure of the graft to ``take.''
</P>
<P>
   In this study, the researchers boosted production of stem cells
in the donors with a drug called G-CSF, then removed ``T cells''
before transplantation to reduce the chance of GVHD. Despite the
mismatches, the transplants took and did not cause GVHD.
</P>
<P>
   The mortality rate was high _ 40 percent _ and the researchers
tracked survivors for only 18 months. That all the grafts took is a
``tremendous achievement,'' said Dr. Claudio Anasetti, director of
the unrelated donor transplant program at the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center in Seattle. But the fact that recipients end
up with no T-cells is a ``major drawback.'' T-cells are crucial for
immune defense, and the body's ability to make new ones is limited
after age 15.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Prostate patients fare well off drug &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Men with metastatic prostate cancer who have been surgically
castrated are sometimes given the drug flutamide to block a hormone
that can drive the cancer. But a new study published this week in
the Journal of the National Cancer Institute shows that they're
better off without it.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Southwest Oncology Group Statistical Center
in Seattle found that men given a placebo had a better quality of
life _ less diarrhea and better emotional functioning _ than those
who got flutamide. There were nearly 400 men in each group. Data
from the study also showed that combining the drug with surgical
castration had no significant survival benefit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Boxers or briefs, sperm don't know &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember those old wives' tales that tight underwear could raise
the temperature of the testes enough to lower sperm counts and
ultimately, fertility? Well, forget it, say two urologists writing
in the October issue of the Journal of Urology.
</P>
<P>
   With a colleague, Dr. Bruce Gilbert, a urologist at the State
University of New York at Stonybrook, examined 100 men and measured
core body temperature as well as the temperature of scrotum and
forearm skin. They compared these temperatures to the type of
underwear the men wore _ boxers or briefs.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion? While heat does affect sperm production, the
type of underwear does not influence scrotal temperature. ``So it
doesn't matter whether you wear boxers or briefs,'' he said.
</P>

A COUPLE OF TOOLS MAKE USING THE INTERNET FASTER, SOMETIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Like everyone else, I often wait in frustrated
anticipation for a Web page to appear on my computer screen. But I
don't waste empty minutes playing electronic solitaire. I prefer
the game called Figuring It Out. Why is my Internet connection so
slow? Why is this particular Web site so sluggish?
</P>
<P>
   These aren't simple questions. The Internet actually is
thousands of networks woven together; there are so many possible
points of failure, it's a wonder the thing works at all. But if you
can figure out why you're having trouble getting through to a Web
site or receiving e-mail, you may be able to sidestep the problem,
and get some work done.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I don't go surfing without those basic tools of the
network engineer: a couple of programs called Ping and Traceroute.
These are pieces of software that'll tell you how quickly your
machine is communicating with some other computer on the network.
</P>
<P>
   Ping and Traceroute were developed years ago for use with Unix,
an operating system designed from the ground up for use in
networks. Now that we're all hopping onto the Internet, every
serious PC or Mac user should also have Ping and Traceroute in his
toolkit.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of you already do, without knowing it. In a rare act of
modesty, Microsoft Corp. added Ping and Traceroute to Windows 95
and 98, without advertising the fact. I stumbled across them by
accident three years ago. Mac users aren't quite as lucky, but Ping
and Traceroute software for the Mac can be downloaded off the 'Net
at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   What do they do? Consider their names. Ping sounds like the
sonar in a submarine warfare movie, right? That's the idea. Ping
sends out a special data packet to any Internet server computer you
choose. All Internet servers are programmed to echo this type of
packet back to its source, like sonar bouncing off a ship. The
sending computer calculates the packet's travel time, measured in
milliseconds.
</P>
<P>
   Anything under 400 milliseconds is fine, but you can get one- or
two-second times when the network is really running slow, and if
the server is down, you'll get no response at all. Can't get
through to yourfavoritesite.com? ``Pinging'' the site is a quick
and dirty way to see whether it's up and running. On a Windows PC,
just open up a DOS window and type ``ping'' and the address of the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Say your site pings you back, but very slowly. What's causing
the slowdown? Traceroute can help you figure it out. Every Internet
packet passes through a number of router computers on its way to
its destination. Often a slow router will delay your message.
Traceroute can pinpoint the problem by pinging each router along
the path, and timing its response. Again, your wait should be less
than 400 milliseconds. To try this on a Windows PC, type
``tracert'' and the site address.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not satisfied with the Windows versions of these
tools, there are a bunch of programs on the Web that do the same
thing. The coolest of the PC offerings is NeoTrace, a $19.50
Traceroute program that actually draws you a map of your Internet
connections. For a free trial, go to http://www.neoworx.com.
Macintosh users can try WhatRoute, a free Ping and Traceroute
program available for download at
http://mac.org/internet/whatroute. And if you don't feel like
loading up new software, there are Web sites that provide on-line
Traceroute services at no charge. Just type in the server name, and
let somebody else's machine do the work. To find these sites, go to
http://www.yahoo.com and search under ``traceroute.''
</P>
<P>
   What good is all this information? Even if you find that you're
getting hung up on a router in San Francisco, there's not a lot you
can do about it _ unless you've got more than one Internet
provider. But at least you know.
</P>
<P>
   And if your work requires you to have Internet access, you ought
to have at least two ways of getting on-line. I maintain America
Online and CompuServe accounts, and a Web hosting account with
Concentric Network in California, because this gives me access to
several different Internet backbones. When one is crawling, another
is screaming. And with the help of Ping and Traceroute, anybody can
figure out which is which. It beats the heck out of playing
solitaire.

TO KNOW SINGER CONNIE FRANCIS IS TO FEEL HER PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Rock-and-roll stardom, drug addiction, mental illness,
violent crime _ it was just a matter of time before someone made a
documentary about Connie Francis.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the Arts and Entertainment channel took up the task of
telling the singer's story, so ``Connie Francis: America's
Sweetheart ofSong'' (airing Sunday) manages to be revealing without
being too sordid. Lord knows how the E! channel would have handled
it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the life of the biggest-selling female singer in
history unravels rather politely. An unflappable Shelley Fabares
serves as narrator, coating even the disturbing aspects of Francis'
life with a sensible ``niceness.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the frankness of the project is surprising, especially
considering that the hourlong show was made with the assistance of
the 59-year-old vocalist and members of her family. If this is the
``approved'' version, an unauthorized take could be positively
hellish.
</P>
<P>
   Francis' immigrant father is described as a controlling tyrant
who never wanted kids and torpedoed her romance with Bobby Darin.
The singer's four failed marriages are carefully documented, as is
her longtime battle with pill addiction.
</P>
<P>
   It grows even darker. The mob-related killing of her brother is
rehashed, with home movies showing the young man relaxing in his
pool. It gives a sad face to the tragic crime.
</P>
<P>
   The singer's aunt recalls Francis' headline-making 1974 rape in
harrowing detail. When she talks about the vocalist coming home
from the police station, tearfully crouching in the back seat of
her father's car, it's almost too intimate, a secret that should
have stayed in the family.
</P>
<P>
   With all the dark moments in Francis' life, the show winds up
giving short shrift to the music, the thing that made her so
appealing in the first place. She was the dominant female singer in
the late '50s and early '60s, racking up 16 Top 10 hits in a
spectacular reign.
</P>
<P>
   She had a big, confident voice that could sing anything. She
could belt out a rock-and-roll song (``Lipstick on Your Collar'')
or weepily handle a heartbreak ballad (``Among My Souvenirs''). She
had hits in 16 different languages, and her repertoire ranged from
1920s standards (``Who's Sorry Now'') to Neil Sedaka bubblegum
(``Stupid Cupid'').
</P>
<P>
   It was both a blessing and a curse for Francis to be a superstar
in her day. She was exactly what America needed: optimistic,
clean-cut and personable, someone both kids and their parents could
like.
</P>
<P>
   But she was huge during a time that most people forget when
looking back at pop music. She came after Elvis but before the
Beatles, an era usually dismissed with an indifferent shrug.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a friend says that Francis became known as ``the
woman who was raped rather than the No. 1 female vocalist in the
world.'' Unfortunately, this show doesn't shift the attention back
to where it rightly belongs. Maybe the producers needed another
hour to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most poignant aspect of the entire program is seeing
how Francis has been affected by the pitfalls in her life. Grainy
black-and-white footage reveals a striking woman with
girl-next-door good looks and a sunny, confident personality.
</P>
<P>
   The mature Francis seems distant and uneasy, speaking in a
scratchy monotone that sounds nothing like the starlet who
frolicked on the beach in ``Where the Boys Are.'' With her hair a
deep red and her appearance modified by plastic surgery, it's hard
to connect the two images.
</P>
<P>
   Even the singing voice is different. It's not only because of
age, but due to a botched nose job that permanently marred her
vocal range.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a moment in ``Connie Francis: America's
Sweetheart of Song'' that shows the contemporary Francis grabbing a
microphone and endearingly singing ``You Made Me Love You.'' It may
not be the voice we remember, but it is the voice of a survivor. &QL;

WHY ARE TELEPHONE COMPANIES WASTING OUR TIME AND MONEY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computers are supposed to save time and increase productivity,
and mostly they do, which is why we put up with so many of their
idiosyncrasies. But there is a disturbing trend among firms that
are building computerized telephony systems. Instead of time
saving, these systems are adopting the reprehensible practice of
``time shifting'' _ wasting my time to save somebody else's time or
money.
</P>
<P>
   I had my first unpleasant experience with time shifting two
summers ago, when Nynex (now Bell Atlantic) introduced a new
computerized directory assistance system. Now these systems are
everywhere. Just dial 411 and the recorded voice of James Earl
Jones pours out of your handset, booming, ``Welcome to Bell
Atlantic.'' Then another recorded voice asks, ``What city?''
</P>
<P>
   And then, ``What listing?''
</P>
<P>
   You speak your piece, and then the recorded voice says, ``One
moment please.''
</P>
<P>
   What many people using this service don't realize is that the
real, flesh-and-blood operator doesn't actually hear your
interrogative until after you finish speaking. Bell Atlantic's
computer then finds a free operator and plays back your recorded
message. At this point you're likely to hear the clicking of a
computer keyboard while the operator tries to find your number,
says thank you, and then transfers you to another computer, which
offers to connect you to the number for an additional fee _ all
before finally giving you the information that you asked for and
paid for in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   What I find most infuriating about the Bell Atlantic directory
service is that it actually takes longer _ sometimes twice as long
_ to get a phone number from directory assistance with the new
system than with the old system.
</P>
<P>
   Now this insidious time-shifting technology is going mainstream,
with two companies offering personal digital assistants: Portico,
by General Magic, and Wildfire, by Wildfire Communications. Both of
these systems combine advanced speech recognition with voice mail,
teleconferencing, and an address book. I've had all-too-personal
experiences with both systems lately. While they may be great for
the person paying the bills, they make things considerably more
difficult for the person making the call.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I placed a call to my friend Lee Sherman in
California. But instead of getting Lee, I heard a burst of music.
Then a voice: ``Good evening, welcome to Portico. You've reached
the number for Lee Sherman. Please tell me your full name so I can
say who is calling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Portico service employs a female's voice. It/she is smart,
practical, and just slightly sexy. She catches me a bit off-guard.
``Simson Garfinkel,'' I finally blurt out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi there,'' continues the voice of General Magic's Portico.
``Would you like me to try to find him for you, or should I take a
message?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Find him,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try the number he left for me. This may take a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   (More music plays.)
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Portico actually does what I wanted to do in the
first place: It calls Lee Sherman. At least it tries. But Portico
doesn't have any more luck than I had. A minute later, Portico
comes back on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, sorry to keep you waiting. He's not available at the
number he left. If you would like to leave a message, say yes or
press 1. Otherwise, say no and press 2.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Portico works like a rather typical voice-mail
system, taking my message and letting me correct it. The only
difference is I've keyed in my number so that Lee can call me back
automatically when he gets his messages.
</P>
<P>
   Although it works like a big voice-mail system, Portico is
priced by the minute, just like a cellular phone. When you use
Portico you pay each time somebody calls you through the system as
well as for the time you spend listening to your messages or
placing calls. Portico is also priced like a cell phone: The set-up
fee is $50, after which you pay $19.95 a month for 60 minutes,
$44.95 a month for 300 minutes, and $149.95 a month for 1,300
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Portico's one redeeming feature is that there are no
long-distance charges, neither for the calls you place with the
system nor for people calling you. Each Portico user gets their own
personalized toll-free number. (You can learn more about Portico at
www.generalmagic. &QC; 
com.)
</P>
<P>
   Portico also has some impressive Internet integration features.
You can retrieve your voice mail over the Internet without charge.
Portico will also keep track of your address book and calendar, or
synchronize its address book and calendar with the applications on
your desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that Portico is great for Lee, but it left me with a
bad taste in my mouth. Sure, I can now call him for free. But it
takes me longer to reach him using Portico than by simply picking
up the phone and dialing his home phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Portico is remarkably similar to Wildfire, another
telephone-based personal digital assistant that was developed by
Lexington-based Wildfire Communications. Actually, the systems are
extremely similar, down to the smart-and-slightly-sexy recording of
a woman's voice that is the system's personality. One thing that's
different about Wildfire, though, is the distribution model.
Instead of selling direct, Wildfire goes through local service
providers. In Boston, two companies selling the product are Milcom
Corp. and Linx Communications. You can find more information at the
Wildfire Website, www.wildfire.com.

WAS IT SUCH A GOOD IDEA TO FIGHT OFF HOSTILE TAKEOVER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We were all so happy back then because we knew the good guys had
won.
</P>
<P>
   Those nasty corporate raiders, empowered by their junk-bond
billions, were loose in the land in those frantic days of the late
'80s, and one company after another was getting swallowed up in one
hostile takeover after another.
</P>
<P>
   Two local institutions, Gillette Co. and Polaroid Corp., could
have easily disappeared. But they fought long, expensive battles
against the raiders _ and won.
</P>
<P>
   The spring day that Stanley Gold and his California-based
Shamrock Holdings finally capitulated in 1989, Polaroid's chief
executive and hundreds of his employees poured onto the lawn
outside the Cambridge headquarters for a victory rally. ``This is
our day,'' said I. MacAllister Booth, the CEO's voice cracking.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, it is obvious that Gillette was right to stand
up, first against Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman, and then against
Coniston Partners, an aggressive New York investment firm. Since
the last bid ended in August 1988, Gillette stock has been a Wall
Street superstar. Since the beginning of 1989, its total return to
shareholders, including dividends, is about 900 percent, or about 2
1/2 times what the broad market has done. That number is all the
more astonishing given Gillette's big recent swoon.
</P>
<P>
   If the judgment of time is clear for Gillette, it is just as
clear for Polaroid: The company should have sold itself to the
raiders when it had the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Gold, a financier who managed the family fortune of Roy E.
Disney, the nephew of Walt Disney, offered $3 billion for the
Cambridge instant photography company. Today Polaroid has a market
value of $1 billion. You don't have to be an investment banker to
do that math.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't done well at all. They know it, the shareholders
know,'' Gold says today. ``They say in their own releases.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Ulysesses Yannas, a Wall Street analyst and current fan of
Polaroid: ``If you had been given $3 billion 10 years ago, how much
would it be worth today?''
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid's long-suffering shareholders can only weep. But at the
time the company's management and directors _ who included big
names like Digital Equipment's Ken Olsen and Gillette's Al Zeien
(who is still there) _ didn't think $3 billion was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that was clear was that management was
entrenched and was unwilling to accept any new or unorthodox
ideas,'' says Gold, who was vilified on these pages and elsewhere
at the time as ``The Dreaded Stanley Gold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Given those parameters, we were bound to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Gold have done better? A better question is, how could he
have done worse?
</P>
<P>
   After Gold went away, Polaroid wandered in the woods for six
years under Booth. Massachusetts' original high-tech wunderkind,
built on the breakthrough concept of instant photography by Edwin
Land, plowed hundreds of millions of dollars into technologies that
never panned out and failed to market its core products to a
generation of customers. Both the stock and employment plummented
on Booth's watch.
</P>
<P>
   The record of Booth's successor, Gary DiCamillo, looks no better
at this point.
</P>
<P>
   The day the former Black &AMP; Decker executive was named as the
first outsider to head Polaroid, the stock fell 1 1/8, hardly the
kind of endorsement any new CEO wants. Since that autumn day in
1995, Polaroid's stock has gone from about 41 to about 23, a 44
percent decline. The stock market is up 250 percent in that time;
shares of Polaroid's archcompetitor, Eastman Kodak, has more than
doubled, even though it has had its own problems.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid has lost $142 million since the start of 1996; revenues
are down. The company has missed its earnings projections four
quarters in a row. About 3,000 employees have lost their jobs under
DiCamillo, and the layoffs may not be over.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the world has not gone DiCamillo's way.
</P>
<P>
   When DiCamillo took over, Russia was the company's second
largest market, representing 10 percent of its sales and 40 percent
of its operating profits. Now, says DiCamillo, ``It is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many companies that can take 10 percent of sales
and 40 percent of operating profits and see it go to zero,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Yannas, an analyst for Mercer, Bokert, Buckman,
estimates the strength of the dollar has cost Polaroid nearly $70
million in annual operating income during DiCamillo's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Dicamillo says the upheavals in world markets have pushed back
the turnaround by 1 1/2 years. Polaroid is counting on a patch of
new products that is now just hitting the market. DiCamillo says
the early market reaction has exceeded expectations, particularly
for a pocket camera being sold in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a work in progress,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But if the new wave of products fall short, shareholders are
likely to be looking for DiCamillo's head, not his Plan B.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Gold, for his part, has had the luxury of sitting on the
sidelines these last 10 years. Shamrock sold all its Polaroid stock
years ago; its agreement not to make another run at Polaroid
expired last Easter Sunday. ``I thought about it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Gold says it would be a mistake to suggest that he's
interested in another takeover bid. ``If they want some ideas and
they are really prepared to listen, maybe they should come and ask
me, rather than me imposing myself again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gold's number for all interested parties: (818) 845-4444.

CHINESE SPEAKERS CAN RECAST BALLOTS IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DIANA WALSH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thousands of Chinese-speaking voters who
received ballots for the November election that did not list the
Chinese names of seven San Francisco candidates will have a chance
to recast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Under a compromise ordered by a Superior Court judge, the city
agreed Wednesday to mail letters to 3,000 Chinese-speaking voters
telling them that they could vote over if they had difficulty
finding their preferred candidates on their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the mass mailing, acting Registrar of Voters
Naomi Nishioka will take out ads in four Chinese-language daily
newspapers alerting voters of the offer to recast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was made after three candidates for the Board of
Supervisors _ Mabel Teng, Carlota del Portillo and Victor Marquez _
filed suit against the city for not putting their
Chinese-translated names off the absentee ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Although Judge Ronald Evan Quidachay denied their original
request to have a correction letter sent to all 52,000 voters in
the city who requested an absentee ballot, the plaintiffs declared
the compromise an overwhelming victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a landmark decision ... that ensures a fair and
constitutional election,'' Teng said. ``This is about the right for
Chinese-speaking voters to be able to participate in an election
with full information. It is defending bilingual voting.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Teng and her attorneys called the omission an error,
Nishioka placed the blame with the candidates and their campaigns.
The registrar's office is required only to offer Chinese and
Spanish translations of occupations and other designations on the
ballot. The translation of names, which has been used during only
one other city election, in 1995, is an optional courtesy provided
by the registrar.
</P>
<P>
   Nishioka said her office had twice called Teng's campaign to see
whether the supervisor wanted her name printed in Chinese on the
ballot and been told no both times. Nonetheless, Nishioka, who
maintained that her office did not have the time or staffing to
complete the more extensive mailing to all absentee voters, said
she hoped that the compromise would have positive results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it was necessary, but since we have agreed to
it, we will abide by it,'' Nishioka said. ``If it helps bring
additional voters, we will be pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise, Chinese-speaking absentee voters can
recast a ballot if they take the registrar's letter to Nishioka's
office. Once there, they must sign a declaration stating that they
were unable to vote for the candidate of their choice because their
ballot lacked the proper transliteration.
</P>
<P>
   The election is Nov. 3.

   ABOUT-CARS-ODYSSEY-NYT (Detroit) _ Honda has arrived at the

more magical than Chrysler's offerings, and Chrysler faces its
toughest competition yet. By Michelle Krebs. With Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-PRICE-COMPETITION-BLOOM (Los Angeles) _ Car shoppers are
finding that U.S. prices for 1999-model cars and trucks are holding

   AUTO-REVIEW-BOS (Hershey, Pa.) _ To the regulars in the old-car
hobby who flock here every October, the event is simply known as
``Hershey.'' It is difficult to comprehend the immensity of this
rite of autumn where Hershey Park, a vast complex of stadium,
amusement park, factory store, and even vaster grassy fields
separated by roads is turned into a tent city of 28,000 souls
overnight. Suddenly this pretty little company town is home to a
sprawling refugee camp cum junkyard wherein you may find parts for
obscure autos, whole vehicles, automobilia, and such diverse

IN PURSUIT OF `HAPPINESS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There probably isn't another director working who has made a
style of ambivalence in the way Todd Solondz has. With ``Welcome to
the Dollhouse,'' which followed an outcast Jersey preteen girl at a
difficult time in her life, his deadpan direction kept people
off-guard. His newest film, ``Happiness,'' is sure to provoke even
more conversation. He clearly wants to subvert, and cheat, the
expectation that a movie should make audiences feel one thing at a
time _ laughter, sadness, outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' follows a group of people whose connection to each
other is revealed as the film plays out. We see a gentle, smiling
young woman (Jane Adams) trying to let down a suitor (Jon Lovitz),
and the moment, with all of its good intentions, goes horribly
wrong. He goes from blubbering to acid hostility in a heartbeat,
and she doesn't know which way to look. It's a scene that sums up
the contradictory ideas of ``Happiness'' instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' _ an ironic title if ever there was one _ then
examines this group connected by sticky threads of suburban
gossamer. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a sweaty pervert seeing a bored
psychiatrist (Dylan Baker). The object of Hoffman's deviant
fantasies is his next-door neighbor (Lara Flynn Boyle), a glam poet
who brings new men into her life so often you'd swear they had
expiration dates stamped on some part of their anatomy. Boyle also
happens to be Baker's sister-in-law. Boyle's married sister
(Cynthia Stevenson) is a chirpy suburban mom who goes on about
having it all _ a comfy home, three kids and a loving husband. She
doesn't quite have her husband; when Baker's not confessing
homicidal fantasies to his own shrink, he's confecting drugged
treats to give to neighborhood boys so that he can molest them.
</P>
<P>
   Adams is sister to Boyle and Stevenson, and the three of them
are trying to comfort their mother (Louise Lasser), because her
husband (Ben Gazzara) is walking out on her after a 40-year,
loveless marriage. Like Adams in that very first scene, you may not
know where to look or how to react. Solondz is out to create a
world filled with people whose existences are so fogged by
self-absorption they can't recognize happiness.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if the characters are right-minded people or
not; they end up walking into a wall. All except Boyle, whose
movie-star slinkiness seems to guarantee her the least amount of
hurt. Although Solondz does fill his films with regular-looking
people, and he pokes at the tyranny of a looks-obsessed culture, he
seems as much a slave to it as anyone else. There are scenes with
Hoffman and Camryn Manheim, as his other neighbor, who's needy and
overeager, that play just like scenes from ``Marty,'' except the
audience chortles at these two pathetic people who are lonely even
when they dance together _ the joke is underscored by Air Supply's
middlebrow lilt, ``All Out of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Solondz isn't out to extort a reaction. Instead, he practices a
remote touch that can add a grayness to the proceedings, even
though he's not being judgmental. So the scenes with Adams bouncing
from one kind of suffering to another are treated with the same
lack of affect that he gives to Baker's weird, patient explanations
of sexual function with his 12-year-old son. Or later, to Baker's
final confessions of his behavior to his son, which leave the boy
crushed and confused. Because Solondz doesn't lead you to a
conclusion, you may find yourself angered by the implicit
compassion he shows Baker, who emerges as a sympathetic figure
because of his performance. Or you may find Solondz's lack of
insistence refreshing. Then again, you may find yourself just as
ambivalent about these characters as Solondz seems to be, which may
strike you as a cheat, because lack of perspective can often betray
a lack of interest in developing insight. It felt like a cop-out to
me.

HIGH-TECH HISTORIES MAY OFFER INSPIRATION FOR BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To grow the economy, the government has to continue to think
big.
</P>
<P>
   That's the history lesson to be drawn from Thomas Hughes'
``Rescuing Prometheus'' (Pantheon Books, $28.50, 372 pages). The
book chronicles the development, execution and long-term impact of
four massive post-World War II projects with the size and scale to
spark creative thinking that could affect the way the commercial
sector does business for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his book, ``American
Genesis: A Century of Invention and Technological Enthusiasm,''
extends his efforts at chronicling the history of technology
development with his new title.
</P>
<P>
   The book provides an in-depth look at the creation of the
pioneering Semiautomatic Ground Environment, or SAGE, defense
system; the first intercontiental ballistic missile, called Atlas;
a major highway construction project that is burrowing a tunnel
under the city of Boston; and the computer network that laid the
foundation for today's Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The common thread tying those projects together is their
complexity. By solving problems on a grand scale, managers and
engineers have had to come up with new approaches that created
solutions that could be applied in the business world.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the whole notion of systems engineering _ the
practice of designing different pieces of a complex machine at the
same time _ made significant strides because of the SAGE project.
Likewise, the Atlas project _ carried out in the 1950s at the
height of the Cold War _ provided a glimpse at how project leaders
can cut through red tape to speed the development of a crucial
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The billions of dollars expended on SAGE and Atlas provided
the engineers, scientists, and managers physical and personnel
resources of quantity and quality unprecedented in the long history
of technology,'' Hughes writes. ``Such support emboldened them to
tackle enormously complicated problems. The creative problem
solving they did for SAGE and Atlas proved an exhilarating
experience for many of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the reader, much of that exhilaration does not
transfer to the pages of ``Rescuing Prometheus.'' The sheer size of
the projects described practically dictates that decisions are made
by committees, a setting that hardly sets the stage for gripping
narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hughes describes a series of committee decisions and
how they came to be made. As it turns out, reading about a
committee is probably about just as interesting as sitting on one.
Hughes' authoritative work provides telling detail about the
individual projects he describes, but they are stories more likely
to be useful to students writing a historical summary of the
efforts rather than a casual reader seeking smooth-reading insight.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes does as well as he can in describing the context that
propels the projects to their historical significance, but the
description of the process behind the projects is probably reading
that only a historian, engineer or bureaucrat would love.
</P>
<P>
   For a more lively look at the internal workings of a big
government project of the modern era, try ``Managing Martians,'' by
Donna Shirley with Danelle Morton (Broadway Books, $25, 276 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Shirley headed the team that designed and built the 25-pound
robot Sojourner rover that sent those incredible pictures of Mars
back to Earth in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The book describes that historic space mission, Pathfinder, with
a riveting first-person account from the landing of the spacecraft
on Independence Day back to when the ideas were first being
bantered about.
</P>
<P>
   The book is also quite autobiographical, following Shirley's
life from a small town in Oklahoma to her experience as one of the
first female aeronautical engineers at the University of Oklahoma
and then in the work world beyond.

   ``The Cost of Caring: Money Skills for Caregivers''
</P>
<P>
   By Anne M. Johnson and Ruth Rejnis
</P>
<P>
   John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $14.95
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that there are 50 million caregivers in the
United States, people working full or part time to take care of
someone else, generally a family member. Of that group, around 38
million are also in the work force. Caregivers need a lot of help,
and this book shows you there is a lot of help out there. Caregiver
associations have been formed on the local, regional and a national
levels, and more than 3,000 sites on the Internet are devoted to
caregivers. The book focuses on topics from tax deductions to wills
for those caring for others.

</P>
<P>
   John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $14.95
</P>
<P>
   Now in its third edition, this is one of the bibles for
entrepreneurs. The book analyzes the upsides and downsides of
running your own business, then asks a number of pointed questions
to determine whether readers have what it takes. Then the authors,
who are business consultants in Orange County, Calif., take readers
through a thorough checklist of business basics to get readers up
and running.

WIRED WORKERS LET COMMUNICATION GO TO THEIR HEADS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all started with that dorky icon of customer service, the
Time Life operator. In 1990 it surfaced on stage, clamped to
Madonna's noggin like some high-tech orthodontic headgear. Now, it
has infiltrated the very core of cool-dom: the Hollywood prop
house.
</P>
<P>
   It's ... the headset.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that liberating gizmo that allows the wearer to knit a
scarf, carve a turkey or juggle several small dogs while talking on
the phone has wheedled its way into everyday life. Look, Ma! No
hands!
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a major headset devotee,'' admits David Hale Smith, a
Dallas literary agent. Smith's headset comes with a very long cord
so he can pace the perimeter of his office while he converses.
``I'm like a dog on a leash. I sometimes forget that it's on and
walk down the hall to the men's room.''
</P>
<P>
   You can thank headset microphones for freeing all four of Janet
Jackson's nubile appendages during sweaty concert performances.
Sports agent Jerry Maguire (a k a Tom Cruise) nails the deal
wearing a sleek Plantronics number. And the wired sales staff at
Old Navy clothing stores can locate a size 12 in no time, thanks to
the futuristic walkie-talkies fastened to their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun for the staff,'' says Old Navy spokeswoman Kirsten
Maynard. ``They look cool. They feel cool.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer confined to drive-through McStaffers and office
receptionists, the headset is destined to become the next
communication must-have. It's ergonomically correct, improves
productivity and looks soooo stylin', especially if you're a tough
cop (Kevin Spacey in ``The Negotiator''), free-lance assassin (John
Cusack in ``Grosse Point Blank'') or really hip soccer mom (no
sightings yet reported).
</P>
<P>
   Witness employees at cutting-edge restaurants sending and
receiving data from the kitchens. At health clubs, aerobics
instructors no longer have to worry about banging their teeth
against hand-held mics. Ouch. Headsets that attach to cell phones
that attach to belts provide the ultimate in mobility. No more of
that one-hand-on-the-steering-wheel thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are finding they want to do more with the time they
have,'' says Tom Benoit, marketing communications manager for
industry heavyweight Plantronics. ``I get home from work, I put my
headset on, and talk while I make dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   The newest headsets slip around or in the ear, so as not to muss
up hairdos, which is key in Hollywood. Between 1995 and 1997,
Plantronics headsets took a supporting role in more than three
dozen television shows and movies, including ``Baywatch,'' ``Murphy
Brown,'' ``Fresh Prince,'' ``Friends,'' ``Con Air,'' ``Alien 2,''
``Godzilla,'' ``Men in Black'' and ``The Peacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Headsets have portended the future ever since John Glenn voiced
his most famous words through a Plantronics doohickey in 1969. Even
so, they can still look dorky to the uninitiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone walks in my office and they're not a headset
person,'' Smith says, ``you look like you're trying to be mission
control or something.''

SOLONDZ FOLLOWS TWISTED ROAD TO `HAPPINESS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' seemed to upset almost
everyone, except Todd Solondz, the writer-director of a new movie,
``Happiness,'' that has a high outrage quotient of its own. So it's
interesting that ``Happiness'' seemed to disturb the Farrelly
brothers, writers-directors of ``Mary.'' A recent New York Times
Sunday Magazine article was supposed to feature a dialogue between
these creators. But instead, it became a profile of only Solondz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, initially the writer had pitched a story which she
described as high art/low art,'' says the slender, reflective
Solondz, whose first film, ``Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' was a
twisted, hilariously dark look at junior high. ``I don't think I
would consider myself high art exactly. ... I'd seen `Mary' and had
quite enjoyed it. I thought it was very funny and very liberating
in a way, and also a very personal film at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he continues, ``when they saw my movie, I'm not sure
there was a mutual appreciation going on.'' According to the Times
article, in fact, the Farrellys thought ``Happiness'' was ``sick.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not just be the Farrellys. ``Happiness'' has received
laudatory reviews and last spring won the critics' prize at Cannes.
But it has also drawn controversy for its plot and characters,
including a sexually predatory poet, a phone-call pervert and a
child molester. October Films, an art-house film-releasing arm of
Universal, dropped ``Happiness''; Solondz got a new distributor and
chose to release the movie unrated rather than accept an NC-17.
</P>
<P>
   No one could look less threatening than Solondz. With his
glasses, high forehead and shock of hair perched atop it, he looks
like the smartest kid in the class. But his easygoing manner hides
a will of iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' about a pushy, unsympathetic
12-year-old girl may not have made it abundantly clear that Solondz
gets what he wants, but Happiness does. And there's no
sentimentality in his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true. One moderator, when introducing me, said I don't
invite easy sympathy for my characters,'' Solondz says. ``It's easy
to make a character sympathetic. You just give them cancer, and, of
course, your heart will go out. You'll feel sorry for that person.
It's a knee-jerk response. ... But for me _ to be able to accept
and acknowledge, if not, embrace people with their flaws, that, for
me is a much greater challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But Solondz's characters are victims, although not just that. He
often introduces them in a humorous context, and then works
backward to show the person underneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer not to use the word jokes when describing my movies,
because as much as many people may find them funny, to me it is
never a joke,'' he says. ``There is a certain kind of humor at
play, but I think if the audience is laughing out of a sense of
superiority ... well, it's not cruel, but rather exposing a kind of
cruelty. An unwitting cruelty which some find funny, and others
find incredibly sad. And a cruelty that doesn't just disappear
after the seventh grade. It's only the best of us who are able to
suppress, rechannel, sublimate, these baser instincts _ but they
are present.''
</P>
<P>
   His characters certainly suffer. In ``Happiness,'' the wife
(Cynthia Stevenson) is denied sex by her child-molester
psychiatrist husband (Dylan Baker); in ``Dollhouse,'' Dawn the
ridiculed kid is ignored by her parents while her adorable younger
sister is prized. So Solondz seems cruel.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do call me misanthropic as well,'' he says. ``But
that's not the case. It's funny, because people will say, `Why do
you make movies about such ugly people?' I don't think they're
ugly. I think it's more telling about the viewer than the film,
because these characters are not glamorized. They are not softened.
They are not beautiful, and audiences want to identify with the
beautiful and the alluring. I feel very emotionally connected to
all of these characters, although I must retain some degree of
detachment from them. Without that, it would be unbearable to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there has to be a need to provoke in Solondz, as surely
evidenced by not making his child-molester character a monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'know, it's a funny thing,'' he says. ``It's not the (child
molestation) subject that makes people run away, or else the Oprah
book and the Roseanne book wouldn't be bestsellers.''
</P>
<P>
   Those projects, however, focus on people who've been victimized,
not aggressors who prey on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``To actually try to humanize, put a face, a heart and a mind,
attach that to someone who perpetrates such a crime ... when people
say the movie is shocking, that I think is what is most shocking to
them,'' he says. ``What makes this man tragic is not merely that he
has this horrible affliction but rather that he is, in fact, a
great father who loves his wife and (son).''
</P>
<P>
   That element of the film has been rendered in the most
sensationalistic terms, as if it's the only story that
``Happiness'' deals with. Was such a one-dimensional depiction a
concern of Solondz's?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that would happen and it has happened. People, in
describing the movie, do reduce it to its basest elements
sometimes. You can't stop that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But ultimately,'' he muses, ``you hope the movie will get seen
for what it is, that it will speak for itself.''

   MISSION-AZR (Mesa, Ariz.) _ Bradley Borden, a Mormon missionary
from Mesa, is recovering from the knife wounds to his upper
intestines, liver and pancreas, inflicted by a drunk in Russia who
murdered his friend, officials say. But when the 20-year-old
recovers from the stabbing, his mother said, ``I know he'll want to
go back to Russia.'' ``Being a missionary is the best thing a young
man can do,'' Myrna Borden said. ``It's what the prophet of our
church has asked our young men to do.'' By William Hermann.
</P>
<P>
   SACRILEGE-REVIEW-NYT (Undated) _ The play ``Corpus Christi'' has
refueled debate over a purported double standard: is offending
Christians not as bad as offending other religious or ethnic
groups? But the deeper and more complicated issue is what is fair
and what goes over the line in dealing with religious themes. By
Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   CORPUS-CHRISTI-HNS (New York) _ Hate the sin, love the sinner.
It's the official Roman Catholic position on homosexuality, and it
would also seem to be the lesson of Terrence McNally's new play
about Jesus, ``Corpus Christi.'' By Joan Smith.
</P>
<P>
   GAYS-CONTROVERSY-TEX (Undated) _ The killing of a Wyoming
homosexual brings new attention to an ongoing controversy: Gay
advocates say you are what you are, and Christian activists say you

</P>
<P>
   BLACKCHURCHES-COX _ An alarming number of Black churches are
experiencing financial difficulties, younger church members are
more critical of church management, and African Americans belonging
to the Church of God in Christ, Pentecostal and Baptist
denominations tend to give more money than those of other
denominations. These are a few of the findings released Wednesday,
part of a two-year study by the Interdenominational Theological
Center. By John Blake.
</P>
<P>
   BAPTISTS-SEMINARY-TEX (Fort Worth, Texas) _ Board members of
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary have changed a bylaw to

that women must ``submit graciously'' to their husbands. By Tara
Dooley.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-JONES-COLUMN-TEX (Undated) _ Sister Helen Prejean, the
author of ``Dead Man Walking,'' is full of life. The spirited Roman
Catholic nun's smiles and hugs won her audience long before she
began speaking. ``I'm taking my case to the American people,'' said
Prejean, who munched a sandwich as she greeted old and new
acquaintances and signed autographs before speaking out against the
death penalty last week in Fort Worth. Since actress Susan Sarandon
won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Prejean in the acclaimed
movie version of ``Dead Man Walking,'' the nun has been much in
demand and her audiences are larger. By Jim Jones.

 &HT;    CHURCH ARSONS DECLINE AS PROSECUTIONS RISE
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Church arsons have sharply declined in the face of
increased prosecutions, community intervention and media coverage,
a federal task force said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   About 114 church arsons, bombings or attempted bombings have
been investigated this year through September, compared with 297
incidents in 1996, according a report the National Church Arson
Task Force submitted to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton created the task force in 1996 after a rash of church
fires, concentrated in the South. Since then, the group has
investigated 670 cases, resulting in the arrest of 308 suspects.

BY COMPARISON, 1927 TEAM STILL LOOKS MURDEROUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN DIEGO _ Who's the best? The 1927 Yankees featuring Babe
Ruth and Lou Gehrig? Or the 1998 Yankees, a collection of lesser
talent molded into an unstoppable unit by manager Joe Torre? The
arguments have already started.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the debate has been raging since the regular season.
The 1998 Yankees set an American League record with 114 wins in 162
games. But the 1927 club, which won 110 games in a 154-game season,
had a better winning percentage (.714-.704).
</P>
<P>
   Wins weren't the only credentials of the club that featured the
so-called Murderers' Row _ Ruth, Gehrig, Tony Lazzeri, Bob Meusel,
and Earle Combs. Six members of that club _ Ruth, Gehrig, Lazzeri,
Combs, and pitchers Waite Hoyt and Herb Pennock _ were elected to
the Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   How many potential Hall of Famers does the 1998 team have? Maybe
Derek Jeter, but it's far too early in his career to project him
for Cooperstown. The same goes for batting champion Bernie
Williams. Maybe Chuck Knoblauch, but if he gets inducted, it will
be in a Twins cap. Among the pitchers, Andy Pettitte has 67
victories in four seasons but would need to maintain that level for
another decade at least. Mariano Rivera would have to remain a
dominant closer for years to merit consideration. David Cone is
winding down a fine career, but it won't get him to Cooperstown.
Right fielder Paul O'Neill is a consistent, productive hitter and
excellent defensively, but he's no Hall of Famer. Ditto first
baseman Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are expectations when you wear a Yankee uniform,'' said
manager Joe Torre. ``You work for George Steinbrenner. He is a
perfectionist and he's always trying to improve on perfection. I
don't remember the 1927 Yankees. But you hear a lot about them.
Coming to New York, you understand that getting to the World Series
is what it's all about. They had a winning club in 1994, 1995. We
won finally in 1996 and made the playoffs again last year. It's
just something that has happened here over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   But the benchmark remains manager Miller Huggins's world
champions of 61 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The offense batted .307 and pitchers had a combined 3.20 earned
run average; six of them won in double figures. Gehrig batted a
team-high .373 with 47 homers and 175 RBIs. Ruth batted .356 and
hit 60 homers, a record that stood for 34 years. Lazzeri (102) and
Meusel (103) knocked in more than 100 runs. Combs had a league-high
231 hits, including 23 triples, and batted .356.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyt (22-7), Wilcy Moore (19-7, league-leading 2.28 ERA),
Pennock (19-8), and Urban Shocker (18-6) formed a redoubtable
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Can the 1998 club match up? Not statistically. But for pure
athleticism, the choice isn't so obvious. Defensively, the infield
of Jeter, Knoblauch, Scott Brosius, and Martinez would be hard to
match. But the 1927 quartet of Gehrig, Lazzeri, Mark Koenig, and
Joe Dugan was considered the best of its day. Whom would you want
in your outfield? Chili Davis, Bernie Williams, and O'Neill? Or
Ruth, Combs, and Meusel? Get your encyclopedias out and prepare for
a long debate.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs of 1927 and 1998 have one thing in common: Both knew
how to win. Both capped their seasons with World Series
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go back to the old Boston Celtics to find a team
that compares to the one we have now,'' said Torre. ``Those guys
averaged 16, 18, 19 points a game, but they were always able to win
games as a team. With this ball club, they're going to take MVP
votes away from each other. It's a great feeling for a manager to
know that when these guys come to the field, the only thing they
are interested in is winning the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're driven. This is a club that even surprised me. They
don't care who gets the game-winning hit. They all want to get the
game-winning hit, but they don't want to talk about it. It's the
most unusual club that I've seen in all my years in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the 1927 club had going for it was longevity. The
nucleus stayed together to win World Series titles in 1928 under
Huggins and again in 1932 for Joe McCarthy. That would be unheard
of in today's baseball climate.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Yankees had two major defections after winning the
World Series _ pitchers John Wetteland and Jimmy Key _ because of
free agency. The '98 club faces a similar loss _ namely, Williams.
As close as the Yankees have become, they fully understand that the
marketplace and budget considerations could do more to break them
up than the San Diego Padres ever could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when we won in 1996 we weren't going to be able to keep
all those guys together,'' said Torre. ``With free agency the way
it is today, it's tough. It was difficult saying goodbye to the
Jimmy Keys and John Wettelands after 1996. But we understand it.
That's why players want to come here and take advantage of
something special like we have going on now. We were fortunate to
just be able to keep this club together all year. The last couple
of years, we added people here and there and subtracted people
during the course of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do that this year. The players who did come in
seized the opportunity. It's nice that we had a nucleus. It was a
lot easier for those guys to blend in and get caught up in the same
things we do.''
</P>
<P>
   How well they did that compared to their '27 forefathers is a
matter for the historians to settle.

<P>
   BEIT EL, West Bank _ Founded in biblical zeal, this hilltop
hamlet is where suburban pleasantries meet the uncompromising
frontline of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Kids in kindergarten amble down the sidewalks past tidy
landscaping and red-roofed stone villas. The grocery store is
friendly, and a community club board announces a music and lecture
program for seniors week.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women cover their heads with skullcaps or hats in
accordance with Orthodox Jewish tradition. On the edge of town,
mobile homes house the newcomers eager to join in the community
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   But people in this West Bank settlement are worried and angry
about the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, in their eighth day
Thursday, at the Wye Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike much of the world, they do not want any deal to come out
of the Wye talks and are concerned that their choice of prime
minister, right-winger Benjamin Netanyahu, is caving in to
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   They say God gave this mountain to them -- not to the Arabs.
They are fearful that the Wye talks could make them an island among
Palestinians, neighbors who hurl large stones at them through their
windshields and, they say, cannot be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that giving up any part of the land of Israel is
something we cannot accept,'' said Judith Missel, a 39-year-old
Beit El municipal worker and mother of five. ``There is no place
else in the world a Jew can live and not be expelled or persecuted.
Why should that happen in the land of Israel?''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year Beit El resident Becky Pinsky, originally from
Brooklyn, N.Y., knows a compromise may be necessary, but not
without trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody says peace has to come now. Maybe it will take another
20 years,'' said the 47-year-old kindergarten supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   This is the West Bank, land captured by Israel in the 1967 war.
Palestinians say it is theirs, and even American officials have
asked in vain for a halt to Israeli settlement construction because
of the bitterness it inspires.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 144 West Bank settlements with about 170,000
residents in the West Bank. They are easy to spot on hilltops,
usually surrounded by fences.
</P>
<P>
   Most have biblical names -- Beit El residents say the story of
Jacob's ladder took place here and God promised the Jews this land.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the settlements there are more than 1.5 million
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Oslo peace process is built around the hand-over of
Israeli-occupied lands to the Palestinians. Most settlements will
remain, but they could be encircled by Palestinian lands. No maps
have come from Wye yet, but Beit El residents could see the circle
close around them soon.
</P>
<P>
   That is hard to face in Beit El, a 21-year-old community of 750
families about a half-hour from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago a mother and son were shot to death in their
car, and a 17-year-old boy was shot to death outside the town's
gate.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, settlers have blocked roads in the West Bank
and threaten to do likewise in the heart of Israel in protest
against any agreement that would come out of the Wye talks turning
over land.
</P>
<P>
   It was the start of a peace talks backlash similar to others
Netanyahu has faced and survived.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing members of the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, have
already filed a no-confidence motion to greet Netanyahu upon his
return.
</P>
<P>
   Most settlers supported Netanyahu's election. Now, though, their
leaders are considering candidates to oppose him in case early
elections are called in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations are planned and, girding for the worst, police
intend to increase Netanyahu's personal security when he returns
home.
</P>
<P>
   Settler leaders are not without influence in Washington, where
they traveled last week to meet friends and visit with American
supporters. In fact, in Beit El and other settlements here, the
larger buildings bear the names of American benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Settlers claim their presence buffers Israel from its hostile
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But, many left-wing Israelis argue that, in the age of missile
warfare, settlements do little for the country's security and may
do more harm by the anger they inspire.
</P>
<P>
   Mosi Raz, secretary general of Israel's Peace Now group,
disputes the idea that turning over land endangers settlements. He
said settlements in the Gaza Strip are more peaceful now,
surrounded by Palestinian lands, than they were during the
turbulent Israeli occupation there.
</P>
<P>
   David Newman, Israeli political scientist, said the settlers'
organized tactics have been effective at toughening Israel's
position in the Oslo process. But, most Israelis do not identify
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasing numbers of people see them just as (American)
Indian reserves in the West Bank,'' he said, noting that two-thirds
of Israelis have never been to the West Bank.

   UNDATED - If average Americans spend a quarter of their lives

suburban high schoolers stumbling awkwardly through a world that
has little to offer but sex, humiliation and despair.
</P>
<P>
   David escapes through nostalgia TV. He's a devoted rerun fan of
a show from the '50s called ``Pleasantville,'' one of those sitcoms
that encompasses ``Father Knows Best,'' ``The Donna Reed Show'' and
``Ozzie and Harriet'' rolled into one happy, black-and-white world.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, David and Jen are transported into that world, where
everyone thinks the kids are the stars of the show, Bud and Mary
Sue.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're living in a black-and-white world where everything
is pleasant and meaningless, where the weather report is the same
every day: ``a high of 72 and a low of 72.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jen threatens the perfection of that Pleasantville world
when she introduces desire into their sealed-off existence.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons between ``The Truman Show'' and ``Pleasantville''
are obvious. Happily, ``Pleasantville'' is more original, funnier
and more thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, writer/director Gary Ross pushes his metaphor too
far, and the film loses its sense of fun and becomes preachy.
</P>
<P>
   Ross starts with a clever notion: a TV world where desire brings
color out of black and white, where sex leads to rock and roll, and
art liberates.
</P>
<P>
   But when Ross starts hammering home the idea that ``family
values'' is a thin cover for fascism and that you can be put on
trial for illegal use of magenta, he stretches his vision and his
metaphor until it pops like an overinflated balloon.
</P>
<P>
   He also loses grip on what makes the movie work: the amusing
contrasts between real life and TV life.
</P>
<P>
   Why the irksome problems with a visionary film like
``Pleasantville?'' Probably one man doing too much.
</P>
<P>
   Ross is a talented, successful screenwriter (``Big,'' ``Dave'')
moving up to direct his first film, which he also wrote and
produced. That means the top three voices for guiding the vision
all came from the same man.
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished filmmaker might succeed flying solo. But
first-time directors often need someone else telling them when
they've gone off-base.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its shortfall, ``Pleasantville'' is such an original
that you have to see it. Like ``Back to the Future'' or ``Who
Framed Roger Rabbit'' ``Pleasantville'' gives us a new way to look
at pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, the film makes such clever use of black and white that
it puts color in a new light. Stylistically, the movie zips, full
of surprises, especially in the first half when the kids arrive in
Pleasantville.
</P>
<P>
   As a nation whose culture is dominated by television, we are
watching a generation of filmmakers who have learned more about
life from the tube than from the more confusing world off the
living-room couch.
</P>
<P>
   Now ``Pleasantville'' and ``The Truman Show'' are telling
stories to people trapped by TV about people trapped inside TV.
Wonder what's coming next?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' is misrated at PG-13. It has enough profanity,
sex and nudity for an R. 3 stars. &QL;

   BEIT EL, West Bank _ Founded in biblical zeal, this hilltop
hamlet is where suburban pleasantries meet the uncompromising
frontline of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Kids in kindergarten amble down the sidewalks past tidy
landscaping and red-roofed stone villas. The grocery store is
friendly, and a community club board announces a music and lecture
program for seniors week.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women cover their heads with skullcaps or hats in
accordance with Orthodox Jewish tradition. On the edge of town,
mobile homes house the newcomers eager to join in the community
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   But people in this West Bank settlement are worried and angry
about the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, in their eighth day
Thursday, at the Wye Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike much of the world, they do not want any deal to come out
of the Wye talks and are concerned that their choice of prime
minister, right-winger Benjamin Netanyahu, is caving in to
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   They say God gave this mountain to them -- not to the Arabs.
They are fearful that the Wye talks could make them an island among
Palestinians, neighbors who hurl large stones at them through their
windshields and, they say, cannot be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that giving up any part of the land of Israel is
something we cannot accept,'' said Judith Missel, a 39-year-old
Beit El municipal worker and mother of five. ``There is no place
else in the world a Jew can live and not be expelled or persecuted.
Why should that happen in the land of Israel?''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year Beit El resident Becky Pinsky, originally from
Brooklyn, N.Y., knows a compromise may be necessary, but not
without trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody says peace has to come now. Maybe it will take another
20 years,'' said the 47-year-old kindergarten supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   This is the West Bank, land captured by Israel in the 1967 war.
Palestinians say it is theirs, and even American officials have
asked in vain for a halt to Israeli settlement construction because
of the bitterness it inspires.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 144 West Bank settlements with about 170,000
residents in the West Bank. They are easy to spot on hilltops,
usually surrounded by fences.
</P>
<P>
   Most have biblical names -- Beit El residents say the story of
Jacob's ladder took place here and God promised the Jews this land.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the settlements there are more than 1.5 million
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Oslo peace process is built around the hand-over of
Israeli-occupied lands to the Palestinians. Most settlements will
remain, but they could be encircled by Palestinian lands. No maps
have come from Wye yet, but Beit El residents could see the circle
close around them soon.
</P>
<P>
   That is hard to face in Beit El, a 21-year-old community of 750
families about a half-hour from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago a mother and son were shot to death in their
car, and a 17-year-old boy was shot to death outside the town's
gate.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, settlers have blocked roads in the West Bank
and threaten to do likewise in the heart of Israel in protest
against any agreement that would come out of the Wye talks turning
over land.
</P>
<P>
   It was the start of a peace talks backlash similar to others
Netanyahu has faced and survived.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing members of the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, have
already filed a no-confidence motion to greet Netanyahu upon his
return.
</P>
<P>
   Most settlers supported Netanyahu's election. Now, though, their
leaders are considering candidates to oppose him in case early
elections are called in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations are planned and, girding for the worst, police
intend to increase Netanyahu's personal security when he returns
home.
</P>
<P>
   Settler leaders are not without influence in Washington, where
they traveled last week to meet friends and visit with American
supporters. In fact, in Beit El and other settlements here, the
larger buildings bear the names of American benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Settlers claim their presence buffers Israel from its hostile
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But, many left-wing Israelis argue that, in the age of missile
warfare, settlements do little for the country's security and may
do more harm by the anger they inspire.
</P>
<P>
   Mosi Raz, secretary general of Israel's Peace Now group,
disputes the idea that turning over land endangers settlements. He
said settlements in the Gaza Strip are more peaceful now,
surrounded by Palestinian lands, than they were during the
turbulent Israeli occupation there.
</P>
<P>
   David Newman, Israeli political scientist, said the settlers'
organized tactics have been effective at toughening Israel's
position in the Oslo process. But, most Israelis do not identify
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasing numbers of people see them just as (American)
Indian reserves in the West Bank,'' he said, noting that two-thirds
of Israelis have never been to the West Bank.

`APT PUPIL' MAKES SUBTLE STUDY OF FAS CISM'S EVILS 
</HEADLINE>
 PUPIL-MOVIE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - In a pleasant suburban town, could your good neighbor
actually be a Nazi war criminal? He definitely can in a movie based
on a Stephen King story.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Apt Pupil'' is not the kind of slasher/horror thriller
that will please fans of ``Scream'' or ``Blade.'' Instead, director
Bryan Singer turns King's tale into a tense psychological study of
evil.
</P>
<P>
   Curious about the nature of extreme evil, a bright high school
student, Todd (Brad Renfro), becomes absorbed in a study of Nazi
Germany and the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Todd's research unearths the fact that an old man in the town,
Kurt (Ian McKellen), is actually a former Nazi officer, responsible
for exterminating thousands of people in the gas chambers during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening Kurt with exposure, Todd blackmails the old man into
telling him the truth about what it was like to slaughter innocent
people.
</P>
<P>
   But as the months pass, the old man and the boy subtly begin to
shift positions of power until Kurt threatens to control Todd's
life.
</P>
<P>
   Singer turns King's novella about a boy who learns his lessons
too well into a suspense movie that is more psychologically
disturbing than frightening in traditional Hollywood terms.
</P>
<P>
   Singer had a surprise hit with the unusual crime tale ``The
Usual Suspects.'' His work in ``Apt Pupil'' is more subtle and
sophisticated, as he must build suspense out of thin plot elements
and practically no action.
</P>
<P>
   The director succeeds in convincing us that the monster inside
all men doesn't lie far beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   However, the film's dynamics slump badly in the middle once we
know what Todd's up to and before we find out how Kurt will deal
with him. That leaves us with too much time waiting to see if the
story will pick up steam again. It does, but perhaps not enough to
satisfy thriller fans.
</P>
<P>
   Singer is greatly aided by two taut, constrained performances by
the stars. Renfro (``The Client,'' ``The Cure'') remains one of the
most talented serious young actors in Hollywood. He keeps us on the
edge, wondering about Todd's motives and exactly what he is capable
of doing.
</P>
<P>
   McKellen, the English actor, is becoming particularly creepy
with his fascist portrayals. Last year, he reinterpreted
Shakespeare's Richard III as a modern dictator. In ``Apt Pupil,''
he gives us a broken old man who hasn't entirely lost the goose
step in his soul.
</P>
<P>
   The previews are somewhat misleading about the level of
excitement in the movie, but ``Apt Pupil'' has a lingering,
depressing psychological effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apt Pupil'' is rated R for profanity, violence and nudity. 3
stars. &QL;

`APT PUPIL': IN A SUBURB, ECHOES OF THE THIRD REICH 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(af) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a scene in ``Apt Pupil'' in which an old man, a former
Nazi war criminal, literally takes his marching orders from a
clean-cut high school boy. The old man moves his feet reluctantly
at first, then displays a mocking, puppetlike compliance.
</P>
<P>
   But as he moves faster and faster, something terrible happens:
long-dormant evil is rekindled and the old man begins to stomp as
fiercely as he did for the Third Reich. ``Boy, be careful,'' he
hisses to his teen-age taskmaster. ``You play with fire!''
</P>
<P>
   That's the hook for Bryan Singer's first film since ``The Usual
Suspects,'' adapted from the Stephen King novella collection that
seems to have been written under a lucky star. (``The Shawshank
Redemption'' and ``Stand by Me'' come from the same volume,
``Different Seasons.'')
</P>
<P>
   Singer brings his same dazzling craftsmanship and clinical
precision to another story in which shrewd wickedness knows no
bounds. And Ian McKellen, Hollywood's improbable It Guy of the
moment, is irresistible enough to minimize another similarity to
``The Usual Suspects'': there's much cruel fascination here, but
there's nobody to like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apt Pupil'' certainly begins on a hateful note, with the
discovery by the schoolboy Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) that a
notorious Nazi is hiding in his town. The boy's next move is to
confront Kurt Dussander (McKellen), a recluse living under a
pseudonym, with a blackmail threat.
</P>
<P>
   If Dussander doesn't follow orders, Todd plans to blow his
cover. And what does Todd want in exchange for his silence? ``I
want to hear about it,'' he says. ``The stories. Everything.
Everything they're afraid to tell us in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd is full of questions. (``And once they were in the chamber,
how long did it take? Like a minute? Five minutes?'') Dussander,
for his part, lets down his guard and becomes the enthusiastic
raconteur. (``And it still wasn't enough for Himmler,'' he muses
about some awful deed.)
</P>
<P>
   But rather than dwelling on the past, ``Apt Pupil'' soon evolves
into a war of nerves as Todd begins realizing he's in for more than
he'd bargained for. The old Nazi begins to manipulate and haunt
him. And as the title indicates, Todd is a quick study when it
comes to misanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy proved to be a very good student,'' Dussander remarks
mischievously one day, ``but perhaps not in the way his mother and
dad envisioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on much of the impressive technical talent behind ``The
Usual Suspects,'' Singer makes this a handsomely shot (by Newton
Thomas Sigel), stunningly edited (by John Ottman) feat of
gamesmanship. McKellen works all of his considerable wiles as a man
who keeps his monstrousness under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   And if Renfro (``The Client,'' ``Sleepers'') can't match his
complexity, he can put a diabolically wholesome face on Todd's
budding viciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Both actors play their roles so trickily that tensions escalate
until the horror grows unimaginatively gothic. By the time somebody
is wielding a shovel as a murder weapon in the basement and there's
an exclamation of ``Now we'll see what you're made of!,'' the
story's cleverness is noticeably on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a claustrophobic two-character piece, ``Apt
Pupil'' (adapted by Brandon Boyce) is full of secondary characters
and artful visual contrasts. Thus Dussander's lair is a place that
time has forgotten, while Todd lives the epitome of a privileged,
squeaky-clean suburban life.
</P>
<P>
   Among the film's other characters are Elias Koteas as a
mysterious derelict who glimpses Dussander at his most outrageous;
David Schwimmer as the school guidance counselor whose brown shirt
and thick mustache suit a tale of Nazi evil; Bruce Davison as
Todd's clean-cut, oblivious father, and Joe Morton as proof that
the past will not be denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apt Pupil'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It includes profanity, violence and brief
nudity in the locker-room shower scene that drew fire from the
parents of teen-age extras while the film was in production. It's a
discreet sequence that is indeed important to the overall plot.

IMPOTENT `ORGAZMO' SINKS TO NEW LOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - When a movie is rated NC-17, it usually means that
anyone younger than 17 can't get into the theater. In the case of
``Orgazmo,''it should mean that anyone with an IQ over 17 doesn't
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   A sex farce released to capitalize on the success of Trey
Parker, one of the creators of TV's ``South Park,'' ``Orgazmo''
attempts to establish a new bottom for the barrel of pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Parker is the writer, director and star of a movie aimed
strictly at the people who found ``Beavis and Butt-head'' too
intellectually challenging.
</P>
<P>
   He stars as Joe Young, a Mormon on a mission, who agrees to star
in a porno film so he can make enough money to marry his
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The film details Joe's days on the set, where he gets morally
upset by the sex but has a stand-in, or lie-in, for the close-ups.
He also joins forces with another porno star (Dian Bachar) to have
silly fights with various thugs and battle the evil producer
(Michael Dean Jacobs).
</P>
<P>
   The comedy is abysmal, the acting too dumb to call camp, and
even the sex is stupid and boring.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Orgazmo'' has the makings of a cult hit. Will
it end up as ``The Rocky Horror Picture Show ''of the next
millennium? If there is no level to which stupidity cannot sink, it
will.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Parker made ``Orgazmo'' to find out exactly how much he
can insult the intelligence of his fans and still take their money.
</P>
<P>
   The film is also grossly offending to Mormons, although that
implies some Mormons would actually see the movie to be offended,
and that seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing interesting about ``Orgazmo'' is how it got that
prohibitive NC-17 rating. Sure, it contains a little sex, some ugly
nudity and a heap of profanity. But so did ``Boogie Nights,'' which
was also about the porno-film industry but which was rated R.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orgazmo'' probably has less sex and nudity than ``Boogie
Nights,'' although it's far more offensive to anyone with even a
dreg of taste.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the movie ratings board tried to stigmatize
``Orgazmo'' with the NC-17 simply because it's such a lousy movie,
while ``Boogie Nights'' is a serious, legitimate film. In other
words, the board is now judging filmmaking quality, not content
issues alone. 1 star. &QL;

A VICTIM OF PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE FIGHTS BACK

   Brawn without brains can't accomplish much beyond wreaking
glorious, mindless destruction. That's the message that leaks
through ``Soldier,'' a high-testosterone science-fiction fantasy
starring Kurt Russell as a professional fighter trained from birth
to be nothing other than an efficient killing machine.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie's grim opening scenes, we watch the education of
Russell's character, Todd, who is nurtured in an incubator at a
special hospital devoted to producing lethal warriors. As a boy,
Todd learns to watch with unblinking calm while attack dogs tear
apart a man.
</P>
<P>
   He is indifferent when a classmate, lagging behind in a
long-distance race, is deemed useless and casually executed by an
instructor. By age 21, Todd's face has frozen into an
expressionless glare. His name and number are tattooed on one cheek
and a bicep is inscribed with his war record.
</P>
<P>
   Like most science-fiction movies, ``Soldier,'' directed by Paul
Anderson from a script by David Webb Peoples, is much better at the
windup than at the pitch. The drama begins when Todd, in his 40s
and battle-scarred but still one of the toughest men alive,
suddenly finds his generation of soldier about to be replaced by a
new genetically enhanced model.
</P>
<P>
   In a chilling demonstration of technological progress, Todd and
two fellow soldiers are ordered to fight Caine 607 (Jason Scott
Lee), the sleek younger leader of the new breed, while all four are
clinging to rope chains. Caine quickly dispatches Todd's cohorts,
then Todd collapses, but not before putting out one of Caine's
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Severely wounded and assumed to be dead, the middle-aged warrior
is whisked by space-age garbage scow to a remote planet that serves
as a junkyard and dumped onto a giant scrap heap.
</P>
<P>
   But the planet, assumed to be uninhabited, turns out to have a
secret life. The dying soldier is discovered and nursed back to
health by a colony of hardy, peace-loving space pioneers whose ship
crashed and left them stranded. In only a few weeks, Todd is
strenuously working out with a metal punching bag and having
flashbacks while he bloodies his fists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldier'' quickly becomes as sticky and predictable as a
mediocre episode of ``Star Trek.'' Befriended by a gentle pioneer
settler and his beautiful blond wife, Sandra (Connie Nielsen), who
discreetly ogles the hunky warrior, Todd has his first experiences
of human warmth.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's little boy, who hasn't spoken since he was bitten
by one of the nasty green snakes that infest the planet, also takes
a shine to Todd.
</P>
<P>
   But soon the new generation's troops, deployed by the arrogant,
power-mad bureaucrat who is promoting them, show up for a training
exercise in which they have orders to destroy anyone who happens to
be on the planet. The new generation is physically stronger and
faster than the old, but not as smart.
</P>
<P>
   The last third of ``Soldier'' is a dull, phony-looking series of
fiery scenes culminating in an inevitable showdown between Todd and
Caine. The action is strictly routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldier'' is rated R. It has violent scenes, including an
eye-gouging.

GIVING A HUMAN (AND HUMOROUS) FACE TO REARING A BOY UNDER FASCISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(af) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   His look is impish. His limbs are rubber. His hair is vanishing
and his face is a caricaturist's dream. So Roberto Benigni gets
some of the biggest laughs in his brazen ``Life Is Beautiful''
when, impersonating a school inspector in Fascist Italy, he is
asked to hold forth on why Italians are a superior race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where can you find someone more handsome than me?'' he asks
the children, leaping onto a desktop. ``Look at the perfection of
this ear!'' When he waves his hands, he declares, ``They dream
about these!''
</P>
<P>
   Benigni clowns so nimbly that he gets as far as celebrating his
navel before having to beat a hasty retreat from the room.
</P>
<P>
   Now the notion of racial perfection is no laughing matter. And
Benigni can count among his attributes a colossal amount of gall.
For in ``Life Is Beautiful,'' he dares to find humor and tenderness
in the midst of the Holocaust, playing a Jewish waiter named Guido
who jokes his way through this nightmare for the sake of his loved
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni's film, a Cannes prize winner that's as likely to offend
those who haven't seen it as to beguile those who have, is as
stubbornly entertaining as he is, and as passionate, too. It dares
to laugh in the face of the unthinkable. And because Benigni can be
heart-rending without a trace of the maudlin, it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' even overcomes a bigger problem than the
gravity of its subject matter: the fact that midway through its
story, it effectively turns on a dime. The first part of the film
is blithe and playful, a fine showcase for the star and director's
unstoppable verve. (Not for nothing is he one of Italy's most
popular film stars.)
</P>
<P>
   In an opening sequence, he finds himself in a runaway car and
sticks out an arm to protect himself _ only to confuse himself with
the saluting Fascists who are also in town. The film's views on the
imminence of World War II are expressed with unanticipated wit, as
when Benigni's Guido asks a man about his political views. Before
he answers, the man turns to his squabbling sons and exclaims:
``Benito! Adolfo! Be good!''
</P>
<P>
   Benigni also brings an enchantment to Guido's courtship of Dora
(Nicoletta Braschi), the aristocratic beauty whom he nicknames
Principessa. Some of his more inspired comic inventions here come
from finding ways to charm Dora away from the man she's supposed to
marry.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five minutes into this sweet, glossy romance, Guido and
Dora glide into a greenhouse, and when they emerge it is years
later. By then Dora has forsaken her wealthy family to marry Guido
and they have a son.
</P>
<P>
   In the presence of this boy, called Giosue and played by Giorgio
Cantarini, both Benigni and the film's method come into their own.
The father's gentle buffoonery and quick-witted fibs are perfectly
suited to the child and also to the film's way of reducing the
Holocaust to its essential absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni never trivializes his material, but he lies
euphemistically to the boy with unspoken outrage. Why a ``No Jews
or Dogs Allowed'' sign on a bakery window, the boy wonders? These
are just matters of personal taste, his father tells him,
explaining that a ``No Spiders or Visigoths'' sign would make just
as much sense.
</P>
<P>
   The lavish settings of the film's first half, where Guido serves
dinner to elegant patrons (and finds a way to carry a poodle on a
tray), eventually give way to much bleaker ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? Seats on a train?'' Guido exclaims when he and Joshua
are forced to board a cattle car. ``It's obvious you've never been
on one!'' And when they arrive at a prison camp and are made to
join a long line, the father explains that this is because people
are so eager to get inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see the guy who hands out bread and jam already come
by?'' he asks another prisoner, when the boy is hungry. When called
upon to translate a Nazi officer's commands into Italian, he comes
up with: ``We play the part of the real mean guys who yell.'' And:
``Don't ask for lollipops. You won't get any. We eat them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Benigni effectively creates a situation in which comedy is
courage. And he draws from this an unpretentious, enormously
likable film that plays with history both seriously and
mischievously. Piety has no place here, nor do tears until the
final reel. ``Life is Beautiful'' plays by its own rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is Beautiful'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It deals with the violence of the Holocaust only
indirectly and in ways that older children will understand.

SINGER `HOOKED ON LIFE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BARBARA KARKABI 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Ashley Millet has been singing country music tunes
since she was 3, performing at baby beauty pageants.
</P>
<P>
   She's long since left the pageant scene, but Ashley, 15, still
loves to sing and is now trying to teach other young people through
music about the dangers of drug abuse, underage drinking and drunk
driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston teen just returned from a country western tour of
Georgia and recently performed ``Hooked on Life,'' a song she
co-wrote, at Miller Outdoor Theater in Houston as part of the Red
Ribbon Campaign, sponsored by the Texas Federation of Parents for a
Drug Free Youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a really good response to the song. There were about 200
kids,'' said Ashley, who is the group's teen advocate. ``I co-wrote
the drug-free song because so many kids do listen to the words as
well as the music. We were hoping to get the idea through with
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley wrote ``Hooked on Life'' with Clifton Smith, who produced
the song. It encourages teens to stay drug-free, to resist peer
pressure and to stay focused on life.
</P>
<P>
   The song goes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hooked on life and live for tomorrow and don't give up the
fight ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do is reach younger kids so that when
they get to high school they won`t do drugs,'' Ashley said. ``Kids
today are often portrayed as being on drugs, but they're not. It's
just a few who do, and they give the rest a bad name.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ashley has always been anti-drugs, it was only recently
that she got involved musically. About 1 1/2 years ago, she was
approached to sing a song called ``Little White Crosses'', about
drunk driving.
</P>
<P>
   Through that song she was connected with an organization in
Florida called Alcohol Free Kids, which decided to use ``Little
White Crosses'' as its theme song and Ashley as the group's
national student spokeswoman. Ashley is also involved with Houston
Crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her appearance at Miller Outdoor Theater, Ashley sang
``Hooked on Life'' over the weekend in Del Rio and on Tuesday in
Austin _ all for the Red Ribbon Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley used to attend Faith West Academy, but these days she is
so busy with her career that she is home-schooled. She's also given
up guitar and horseback-riding lessons, so she has more time for
performing and voice lessons.
</P>
<P>
   These days her songs are being played on a Bay City country
station, KMKS 102.5, which is also the sponsor of her Web site.
Ashley sometimes thinks about studying law and being an
entertainment lawyer. But right now her No. 1 goal is to be a
successful entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a famous country western singer, and by being
famous I want to reach kids by being drug-free,'' Ashley said. ``I
will always be drug-free.''

<P>
   We've all had them. We got them falling off bicycles and swings
as children and we still get them as adults.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about bruises _ nature's little tatoos _ those
painful injuries involving rupture of small blood vessels with
resulting black and blue marks that never seem to go away.
</P>
<P>
   But while it will always take some time for the skin
discoloration to disappear, we can take steps to ease the
discomfort much more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   There are two natural herbs which can be very effective for
bruises: arnica and calendula, the latter having the common name of
marigold. Let's take a look at each of them and the ways in which
they can be used.
</P>
<P>
   Arnica is a native plant of Europe but was imported to America
where it now grows wild, particularly in moist soil conditions in
mountains and valleys from 3,500 to 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   It is also grown as a cultivated plant in some flower gardens.
It resembles many other members of the composite family with
yellow-orange sunflowerlike flower heads which bloom from April
through September. Preparations of arnica were listed in the U.S.
Pharmacopeia (the official listing of approved drugs in the United
States) from the early 1800s to 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Two common names for arnica are mountain tobacco and leopard's
bane, the latter referring to its toxicity if swallowed by some
beasts, including humans.
</P>
<P>
   All the safe preparations of arnica are for external use only.
These preparations are a fluid extract, an ointment and a tea bath.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare a fluid extract, put 6 ounces of powdered arnica
flowers (which can be obtained from herbal suppliers or at some
health food stores) in a glass jar containing 8 ounces of grain
alcohol, 90 percent strength (180 proof). Stir constantly for about
10 minutes, screw a cap on the jar and let the mixture to set
overnight so that the flowers dissolve completely.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, filter the mixture through cheesecloth, bottle it
and apply a clear label. While not a pharmaceutical-grade tincture
of arnica, it is very effective in alleviating soreness from
bruises.
</P>
<P>
   An arnica tea may be made simply by placing a tablespoon of the
arnica flower-powder in a cup of boiling water and allowing it to
steep for 10 minutes. Filter the undissolved powder through
cheesecloth; the remaining warm solution may be applied to the
bruised area.
</P>
<P>
   An arnica ointment is also available at herbal outlets and
natural food stores.
</P>
<P>
   Calendula, or marigold, is a common annual found in many
household flower gardens. Its preparations, too, are for external
use only.
</P>
<P>
   For a homemade fluid extract and a tea, follow the same
directions above, using dried marigold flower petals (available at
herbal suppliers). An ointment and an oil extract can be purchased
at herbal stores.
</P>
<P>
   The ointment has the advantage of being easy to apply, and in
addition to reducing soreness it penetrates deep into the skin to
start the healing process. Calendula oil is just as soothing
properties as the ointment but lacks its staying power. However,
because it is a liquid, you can pour the oil onto cuts and bruises
you wouldn't dare to rub with an ointment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (Oct. 13) _ The day the letter arrived, early last year,
Marion Finlay at first thought it was junk mail. It carried a
company's logo and offered something for free, as do many
commercial leaflets flooding her mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   A company called Microsoft, the letter explained, had picked
Finlay's upper-middle-class street in the Northern London borough
of Islington for a networking experiment and was looking for
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The company wanted to create a living case study to explore how
the Internet would affect a real, local community _ as opposed to a
``virtual community'' existing only in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Participating households, the letter added, would be given a
computer, a modem, a free Internet account through the Microsoft
Network (MSN), a dedicated phone line, a selection of software, a
contribution toward their phone bills, and on-site installation and
tutoring by specialists. They would also have access to a dedicated
telephone line for troubleshooting, and to a private Web site and
bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   It was an Internet beginner's dream.
</P>
<P>
   In return for this all-expenses-paid connection to the Internet,
participants in Microsoft's MSNstreet project only had to commit to
keeping a log book of their online activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too good to be true: I had just completed a computer
course and was eager to become more involved in Internet
communication,'' said Finlay, an expatriate Canadian journalist.
</P>
<P>
   She read the letter over again, thinking that there must be a
catch. Others on her street, like Peter McCartney, a medical
researcher, thought it was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't, and both Finlay and McCartney volunteered to
participate, as did 23 other households on the street, for a total
of 60 people.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later a van arrived. Technicians from Microsoft
brought in computers and connected wires, and a company was hired
to handle MSNstreet's public relations (which include preventing
journalists from publishing the street's real name).
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months into the experiment _ which was originally
planned to run for just six months _ all the participants contacted
for this article were fairly enthusiastic about the Internet and
are using it to look up stock quotes and other information, plan a
ski vacation, or keep in touch with friends and customers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond encouraging general Internet literacy however, what has
the ``first cyberstreet community project in Europe'' revealed
about how the Internet may affect the lives of ordinary families
and neighborhoods?
</P>
<P>
   McCartney believes the street's residents are closer socially.
``There has been a significant improvement in communication in the
street which would not have happened otherwise,'' he explained in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Many things can prevent neighbors from getting to know one
another, especially in a residential street full of lawyers,
journalists and other professionals who head downtown early in the
morning and aren't back until dusk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have a reason to approach people,'' said Jane
Judd, a literary agent who had been living on the street for years
but knew only her immediate neighbors and a couple of neighbors of
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the MSNstreet project has been the perfect substitute
for the classic cup of sugar. The shared experience of being
Internet beginners and talking about local issues on the bulletin
board ``has meant that when we meet face to face we can carry on
discussions instead of blandly talking about the weather,'' Judd
added.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson Phillips, a retired journalist, has rapidly become the
informal leader of the local online community. ``I have more time
than others to spend online,'' he said, while sitting in his
basement among piles of books and charts detailing the organization
of a street party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to know maybe 5 or 6 people in the street, now I know
at least 40 of them quite well, and some very closely,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Scrolling through dozens of messages posted on the bulletin
board, Phillips explained how the participants have been able to
exchange information like gardening tips, recommend a decent
plumber or electrician, find a trustworthy babysitter, or swap
notes on local shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have been asking for help with homework, others have
posted messages looking for somebody to receive a parcel or to feed
the at,'' he said. ``This creates a stronger feeling of
participating in a community that cares about its members.''
</P>
<P>
   Common-interest discussions have also taken place on online.
Participants are debating a proposed municipal plan that would
introduce controlled parking on nearby streets, which has created
concerns that their street would be flooded by cars.
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin board has also been used to gain support for a
campaign against disruptive vibrations caused by the local railway.
And when a burglar struck on the street, the news was circulated
immediately, prompting a discussion about whether the street needed
better lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these debates find their way into the ``Barnsbury
Bugle,'' the neighborhood newspaper that Phillips edits and e-mails
to other residents.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic mail appears to be the crucial application. ``I'm
addicted to e-mail,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did we ever do without it?'' wondered Jane Judd.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that e-mail will be used by everybody, and
that for all the talk of wiping out time zones and geographical
distances, it will become a normal way to exchange information
locally as well,'' said Andrew Graham, a professor of economics at
Balliol College in Oxford, who has been monitoring the project as
part of his research into the effects of new technologies on
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Yet before becoming commonplace, technology needs to ``get much
easier to use,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the favorable bias of having state-of-the-art equipment
installed by specialists and the availability of constant technical
support, ``nobody has made any positive comment on the hardware and
software, or said that it was easier, faster or more powerful than
he or she expected,'' Graham commented in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own PC and Microsoft's were both badly messed up by
incompetent engineers,'' said Tom Linch, a journalist with The
Financial Times and a street resident. ``I was without any computer
at all for weeks and had to switch all my e-mail use to the
office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's so hard to get a computer fixed properly with the
might of Microsoft standing behind the whole operation, what
chances has everyone else?'' Linch wrote in an article.

   If you say you have no time to workout, I'll get right to the
point:
</P>
<P>
   You're sniveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being short on time is nothing new,'' says San Diego running
coach Kevin McCarey. ``Roger Bannister was studying to be a doctor
and he only had an hour a day for running. He broke the four-minute
mile. Same constraints as you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannister's example is telling. Certainly few people are as
time-crunched as doctors, too hurried to write a legible signature.
Note too that Bannister wasn't just trying to drop a few pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hooked on the idea of how long, but the important
point really is the quality of the exercise,'' says Ross Gerry,
assistant women's swimming coach at Stanford University. ``Can you
get a good workout in thirty minutes? Definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   t's simple. Each time you exercise there are two things you can
tinker with: how long you exercise and how hard you exercise. It's
a pie with two pieces. Make one bigger, and you can pare back the
other. Want to burn 200 calories? You can walk easily for 40
minutes. Or you can cut that time in half and run. Up the
intensity, and get just as much or more from a shorter workout.
</P>
<P>
   Several years back I interviewed a runner who had not missed a
day of running in 26 years. Once on train trip he slipped in his
run when the train pulled into a station, going for a 10-minute jog
with a sprint to catch the departing train. ``Finding the time to
exercise is really no different than finding the time to shave or
eat,'' he said. ``If you want to do it, you'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are an assortment of time-efficient workouts, each about 30
minutes long. You can do the workouts at an easy pace or you can
raise the ante, the choice is up to you.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RUN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Matt Giusto, who ran the 5,000 meters at the Atlanta Olympics,
also coaches recreational runners in his hometown of Albuquerque,
N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The workout below works for beginners and experts. The
difference, experts run hard during the hard portions and beginners
don't. If you're new to this kind of effort, just pick up the pace
a little during the hard portions. (This workout works great for
biking and walking too; you can also do it on a treadmill or an
exercise bike too.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're doing is raising your heart rate for a period of
time, then recovering, then raising it again,'' says Giusto. ``That
gives you and your heart a better, more interesting workout.''
</P>
<P>
   Warm up with 10 minutes of easy running.
</P>
<P>
   Run hard for three minutes (beginners, make the pace just a
little faster than your easy pace).
</P>
<P>
   Jog two minutes easy (really relax; if you don't, you defeat the
purpose of the workout).
</P>
<P>
   Run two minutes hard.
</P>
<P>
   Jog one minute easy.
</P>
<P>
   Run one minute hard.
</P>
<P>
   Jog three minutes easy.
</P>
<P>
   Cool down with five minutes of very easy running or walking.
Light stretching, five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SWIM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To get a good swim workout in 30 minutes, you need to keep a few
things in mind says Stanford coach Ross Gerry. Good idea to vary
the strokes if you can; swimming backstroke, breastroke, butterfly
and freestyle brings more muscles into play, and it helps you avoid
injury by spreading wear and tear. And keep the rest short; not
allowing for full recovery will keep your heart rate up, giving you
a better workout.
</P>
<P>
   Take 10 seconds rest between each swim.
</P>
<P>
   Swim 200 yards freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Swim 100 yards backstroke.
</P>
<P>
   Swim 200 yards freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Swim 100 yards breastroke.
</P>
<P>
   Swim 200 free.
</P>
<P>
   Swim 100 yards individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   Swim 200 free.
</P>
<P>
   Kick 100 yards freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Have a few more minutes? Do six 25-yard sprints (rest 20-30
seconds between each one), then cool down with an easy 200 yard
swim.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WEIGHT ROOM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a workout that builds strength and gives your heart and
lungs a buff too, courtesy of Gina Lombardi, a National Strength
and Conditioning Association certified personal trainer whose
Hollywood clients often don't have more than 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced lifters should do 8-15 repetitions of each lift, run
through each group of exercises twice and take no rest until the
workout is done (that's what gets your heart involved). If you're
fairly new to lifting, or this feels like too much, do 8-15 reps,
go through each set only once, and rest 2-3 minutes between each
set.
</P>
<P>
   Expert or not, and this is critical, lift light weights. Since
you're doing a fairly large number of reps and not taking much, or
any rest, lifting heavy weights won't work. And it could injure
you.
</P>
<P>
   Warm up 5-10 minutes (light calisthcnics, jog on the treadmill,
spin easily on an exercise bike).
</P>
<P>
   Group one: One set of squats. One seat of shoulder lateral
raises. One set of abdominal crunches. One set of biceps curls.
(Experienced lifters repeat).
</P>
<P>
   Group two: One set of lunges. One set of lat pulldowns. One set
of leg curls. One set of dumbbell bench presses. (Experienced
lifters repeat).
</P>
<P>
   Group three: One set on the outer thigh machine. One set triceps
pushdowns. One set on the inner thigh machine. One set of back
extensions. (Experienced lifters repeat) Cool down 5 minutes.

`CITY OF PEACE': YOUNG LIVES AND CONFLICTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(af) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1994, 60 teen-agers in and around Washington
volunteered for a theater project based on their lives and
conflicts. Black, white and of mixed blood, from drifters and
prostitutes to prosperous preppies, they came together for a year
to write and rehearse a musical production that was performed in
the ornate Warner Theater, not far from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Their story forms the basis of ``City at Peace,'' a commendable
and intermittently captivating documentary directed by Susan Koch
and produced by Christopher Koch, a team whose extensive television
credits include ``Blacklist: Hollywood on Trial'' and ``Normandy:
The Great Crusade.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of productions ranging from ``A Chorus Line'' to
``Small Wonders,'' the splendid 1996 documentary about a dedicated
violin teacher and her East Harlem pupils, ``City at Peace'' makes
a strong case for creating harmony and tranquility by bringing
together people of differing backgrounds in a common enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   As they tell their confessional stories of broken homes,
emotional deprivation, murder, rape, hustling, struggle and
teen-age pregnancy, these youngsters begin to overcome the barriers
between them by achieving understanding of what their lives have in
common.
</P>
<P>
   The film's thesis is buttressed by the violent reality of life
on the city's streets. Two young men involved in the production _
D'Angelo, a drifter who is the film's most intriguing focus, and
Rickey Payton Jr., the son of Rickey Payton Sr., the composer of
the musical _ are shot during the making of the film.
</P>
<P>
   And while the results of the overarching enterprise appear
worthwhile, the documentary also makes clear that an ideal society
is not easily achieved.
</P>
<P>
   But ``City at Peace,'' whose executive producers are Barbra
Streisand and Cis Corman of Ms. Streisand's Barwood Films Ltd.,
breaks no new ground in expressing its argument.
</P>
<P>
   Sensible as it may be and sharp-eyed in its choice of focal
figures in the musical's cast, the film surges only intermittently
with emotional power. Coverage of the actual performance of the
musical seems hurried and muted, although an epilogue devoted to
the maintenance of bonds among the teen-agers and an explanation of
what has happened to some of them since the performance proves
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``City of Peace'' remains film in a noble cause.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   `CITY AT PEACE'

edited by Jeff Werner; music by Rickey Payton Sr.; produced by

`THE CRUISE': STRONG OPINIONS OF A DIZZY TOUR GUIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Timothy (Speed) Levitch, the loquacious New York City tour-bus
guide, sidewalk philosopher and one-man almanac of urban lore
profiled in Bennett Miller's compelling documentary film ``The
Cruise,'' is a man who enjoys making himself dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite activities, he confides, is to spin around
under the twin towers of the World Trade Center and, when
thoroughly disoriented, to look up and reel under the illusion that
the buildings are toppling down on him.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in high-contrast black and white that makes the city look
harshly magnificent, at once irresistible and forbidding, ``The
Cruise'' could be described as a whirlwind tour both of New York
and of Levitch's feverish mind.
</P>
<P>
   In his extreme quirkiness and in his love-hate (but mostly love)
relationship with the city, he is a representative New Yorker;
there is probably no one in the world remotely like him.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments when Levitch, who speaks in an emphatic nasal
honk, suggests a 90s update of a classic New York cabby. He has a
strong opinion on almost everything and is ready to share it in
winding soliloquies that display an impressive, eclectic erudition.
</P>
<P>
   His monologues, he confesses, aren't just aimed at entertaining
tourists, they're a technique for picking up women.
</P>
<P>
   As his double-decker tour bus meanders through Manhattan,
Levitch disgorges an encyclopedia's worth of facts, all filtered
through a highly personal appreciation of New York. During a
fascinating mini-history of Central Park, he mentions that the park
was designed to evoke a Transcendentalist ideal of peaceful
contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, which was just being invented at the time, would have
been outlawed there, he maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Levitch appears to be able to pinpoint the residence of every
famous writer who ever lived in New York. Once he's finished
ticking off the names of authors (along with salty anecdotes about
their drinking habits and suicide attempts) who lived in Greenwich
Village at various times, you are left with a palpable sense of
that neighborhood as a permanent artists' colony.
</P>
<P>
   Levitch's gift for metaphor often approaches the poetic. He
muses that he sometimes thinks that if the city ``is a living
organism, perhaps it's more on the level of a scintillating
streamlined mermaid who sings to me at night.''
</P>
<P>
   As the movie goes along, the anger and insecurity underlying his
intellectual bravado increasingly surface. Stung by his
grandparents' disappointment in him for not being a material
success, he reflects on the degrading aspects of conformism
(symbolized in the city's planning by its right-angled grid
pattern) and bridles at the prospect of having to shed the street
clothes he's been accustomed to wearing on the job to don a
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy that emerges, which Levitch calls ``the cruise,''
is synonymous with his continually imperiled sense of personal
freedom, which in his own flowery vocabulary is ``an effervescent
homage to the present tense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am cruising because I have dedicated myself to all that is
creative and destructive in my life right now, and I am equally in
love with every aspect of my life, and I am in love with the
frantic chaos of this limitless universe,'' he babbles.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Levitch's voice grates, you can't help but admire the
zest for life of this heroically independent but impossibly
self-centered crank.
</P>

DAZZLING IMAGES DELINEATE A WORLD THAT NEVER WAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In every culture, objects of beauty bring delight.
They also push ideologies, advertise interests, secure alliance and
pump up reputations. So it has always been; so it is likely always
to be.
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly true two centuries ago in Iran. There, a passel
of ambitious new rulers came out of the blue and created an
assertive, self-promotional dynastic art of almost hallucinatory
strangeness and brilliance, briefly revivifying an ancient culture
in its twilight years.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing quite like this late Persian art had ever appeared in
Asia. And it has never been seen in bulk in the West before the
opening Friday of an extraordinary exhibition, ``Royal Persian
Paintings: The Qajar Epoch, 1785-1925,'' at the Brooklyn Museum of
Art.
</P>
<P>
   Many shows flatter audiences by telling them what they already
know; this one does the opposite. In a gathering of 100 objects
from starry international collections, including the Hermitage and
the Louvre, it fleshes out an almost unheard of chapter of art
history as it upsets the popular image of classic art tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Persian painting,'' and what comes to mind? Small
illuminated miniatures with diminutive landscapes and teensy
figures. But the Qajar emperors thought big, sometimes very big.
They liked their portraits life size, their battle scenes
Cinemascopic. Even their collectibles _ lacquered boxes, gilded
enamels _ have a trumpeting, clear-the-way flair, like props in a
Handel opera, glinting under the stage lights.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time the Qajars, who were Turkish-speaking tribal
warlords, came to power in Persia at the end of the 18th century,
the empire was badly in need of star wattage. The last Safavid
ruler had been defeated in 1722. Two stopgap dynasties had come and
gone. The Ottoman Turks posed a serious threat, and European
superpowers _ England, France, Russia _ had designs on Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn show, organized by Layla Diba, the museum's curator
of Islamic art, and Maryam Ekhtiar, senior research associate,
begins with a selection of late Safavid art, the most familiar of
Persian styles. Here one finds an illuminated Koran, all lapis
lazuli and gold, a scrap of official calligraphy and a miniature
portrait depicting the court artist Riza Abbasi.
</P>
<P>
   He is shown as an elderly man, stooped, gentle, bespectacled,
though the image is somewhat deceptive: he was notorious for his
lifelong love of wrestling and louche company. What's most
interesting about the portrait, though, is that it shows him at
work on a painting, and that painting is the figure of a man in
European attire.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, one quickly discovers, is everywhere in the art on view.
Louis XIV, or someone who looks a lot like him, shows up in a
miniature painting from Isfahan. A neo-classical Flora decorously
hikes up her skirt in front of a stylized Safavid landscape in an
album painting. A lacquered book cover is decorated with a
pasted-on French engraving.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most striking is a European-inspired expansion in scale,
dramatically demonstrated in four full-length portraits hung near
each other in the show. Two of them are spectacular images of
Charles I of England and his Queen, Henrietta, by Anthony van Dyck,
on loan from Russia. The other two, of a boy carrying a bow and
arrow and a young girl in a snood-like cap, are products of the
Safavid court.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, the Western and Asian works couldn't be more
different. Charles looks suave and relaxed, like a dancer at rest,
in licorice-black armor set off by a cascade of royal red silk. The
Persian youth stands as stiff as a doll in a spatial setting of
Escher-like illogic, in which one-point perspective and the
depthless flatness of Persian manuscript tradition clash. But side
by side, the paintings tell a story of how a new Persian art
developed, inspired by Western models but still Persian to the
core.
</P>
<P>
   This hybrid art flourished during the short-lived Zand dynasty
(1750-79). And although little from the period survives, the items
in Brooklyn are wonderful. They range from vivid narratives, to
naturalistic portraits, to full-length oil-on-canvas figures meant
to occupy niches in palace walls.
</P>
<P>
   The standout is a large picture, once owned by Andy Warhol, of a
couple locked in a steamy (for Persian art at least) embrace. Their
clothing has been loosened, their limbs are intertwined. The woman
salutes her importunate lover with a wine glass as he fondles her
breast. But her attention is elsewhere. She stares confidingly out
at the viewer as if extending an invitation to join the fun.
</P>
<P>
   After the Zand period, the Qajar dynasty (1785-1925) took charge
and settled in for the long haul. Its founder, Aqa Muhammad Khan,
was an odd character. As a young man, he had suffered castration at
the hands of tribal enemies; and while his contemporaries extolled
his martial prowess, they alluded to his unphotogenic looks with a
shudder.
</P>
<P>
   His nephew and appointed heir, Fath Ali Shah, was his opposite
in every way. He had a populous harem and fathered more than a
hundred children, basically producing an entire ruling class of
siblings. He was an indifferent administrator and was inclined to
let his sons do the dirty work on the battlefield. But his gift for
self-advertising was second to none, and in art he created one of
the great, head-turning personal styles of the dawning modern era.
</P>
<P>
   Six of his life-size portraits are at the center of the Brooklyn
show, and they are riveting. In one, from around 1809, he is shown
standing, one hand at his waist, the other holding a staff topped
by a little gold bird. His face, with its pale skin, looks
youthful, but is is nearly lost between his beetling handlebar
eyebrows and his long black beard.
</P>
<P>
   He wears a creamy ankle-length robe with a snug top, a nipped-in
waist and a flared skirt bordered with pearls. His
color-coordinated accessories _ wristlets, armlets, epaulets _
culminate in a peaked and feathered crown that is almost the size
of his torso. His feet are shod in flowered hose and dainty
high-heeled slippers.
</P>
<P>
   To the modern eye, he looks effete, faintly absurd, like a
bantamweight dandy with attitude. But the portrait was meant to
represent an ideal, an icon. The rigid stance and the kohl-lined
eyes were modeled on those of the fabled Sasanian rulers of
Persia's pre-Islamic Golden Age. The hand gripping the staff has
suggestive connections with Napoleonic portraiture being created in
France.
</P>
<P>
   The conspicuous beard may be read, at least in part, as a
self-conscious emblem of virility, understandable in a dynasty
whose patriarch was a gelding. The clothes and trappings, however,
seem designed entirely for dramatic effect. They exude a
distinctive but familiar chic defined by costliness, impracticality
and an immunity to embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   That immunity served Fath Ali Shah well when he packed paintings
like this one off as a kind of diplomatic calling card to the
courts of Europe. And he was no doubt gratified to learn than when
his Persian ambassador in London bowed to one of the portraits as
if it were a religious image, the English followed suit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Did he even suspect that they were just being shrewdly, amusedly
polite? Probably not, given the atmosphere of willed fantasy that
seemed to pervade the Qajar court. It was such fantasy that
prompted Fath Ali Shah to have himself depicted receiving obeisance
from English, French and Turkish envoys at a time when exactly the
opposite balance of power was in effect, and Iran was on its way to
becoming a pawn in a colonial game.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Qajar art is a work of fiction. In some cases it
rewrites history; in others it creates an image of the court as an
extravagant, sensual, no-expense-spared Eden. This is evident in a
22-foot-long painted ceiling covered with angels and floral
arabesques, and in niche-shaped still life paintings of tempting
meals. And it is nowhere clearer than in the pictures, of
unflappably charming women, meant to decorate palace rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Several are included in the show. One is a dancer with castanets
and a wealth of sausage curls. Another is a bare-breasted mother
with her all-but-nude young daughter, an erotic Madonna and Child.
Most remarkable are the upside-down female acrobats. Their faces
peer impassively out from the bottom of the paintings while their
bodies topple above, fragmented cubistic puzzles from which sets of
toes emerge.
</P>
<P>
   These contortionist paintings are formally exhilarating, and
they leave an indelible after-image, always a good sign. But
there's also something disturbing about them, slightly cracked.
They give the human figure no place to go except toward further
disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   With the death of Fath Ali Shah, however, Qajar art pulled back,
and took a more conventional route. An 1830s portrait of his
successor, Muhammad Shah, shows the change. The picture's somber
palette and realistic modeling adheres to European standards. Only
a twist of patterned fabric tied around the sitter's waist is a
reminder of lost dazzlement.
</P>
<P>
   There was, to be sure, fine Qajar work still to come. A battle
scene painted on the lid of a lacquered box, dated 1865, is a
miracle of close-worked detail. And the official portraits of the
next ruler, Nasir al-Din Shah, constitute an exquisite return to
near-miniature scale. In a sparkling painting on loan from the
Louvre, he assumes the time-honored power pose, but he looks small
and shy in his chunky Victorian chair, and his soft, wide-set eyes
seem distracted and a little sad .
</P>
<P>
   Late Qajar painting is Victorian art, with the mix of
photographic realism and escapist fantasy that this implies. A
portrait of the dynasty's last, aged leader, Muzaffar al-Din Shah,
records his enfeeblement with merciless accuracy. Yet a genre scene
from the same time, depicting an exorcism in progress, includes a
clutch of scampering imps that might have come straight from
English fairy painting.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Diba, who worked for five years on this show, brings it to a
provocative conclusion with a single 1907 political cartoon from an
Iranian newspaper. In it, Asian rulers are caricatured as dogs _ an
animal despised in the Muslim world _ vying for scraps dispensed by
two giant hands, one labeled Russia, the other Britain.
</P>
<P>
   This little marriage of art and politics is a quiet shocker. Far
from being a self-advertisement for glory, it is an irate,
self-critical call to action by underdogs, a militant demand for a
new, modern national self-identity and for revenge. In the light of
this image, the bright pageant of Persian art through which one has
just passed feels like the mirage it was: vain, preposterous,
evanescent. But there's no question that it was an illusion of
inimitable glamour, which this once-in-a-lifetime show captures
unforgettably.
</P>
<P>
   ``Royal Persian Paintings: The Qajar Epoch, 1785-1925'' remains
at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, through Jan.
24. The exhibition travels to the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and
Cultural Center, University of California at Los Angeles (Feb. 24
to May 9), and the Brunei Gallery of the School of Oriental and
African Studies, University of London (July 5 to Sept. 26).

`PLEASANTVILLE': CONDEMNED TO REPEAT THE JOY OF THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sick of hearing about iffy job prospects and ozone depletion in
the 1990s, a high school student named David (Tobey Maguire) is in
love with the sugar-coated past. On his favorite old television
show, Dad booms ``Honey, I'm home,'' and Mom wears a crinoline and
pearls. The kids say ``Gee whiz!'' and the fire department rescues
cats in trees. The teacher's desk is lined with apples, for this is
a ``Father Knows Best'' clone with a vengeance. Who knew, while
plotting to stay home from school and watch it in reruns, that this
show's idea of family paradise would make it the great cultural
madeleine of its time?
</P>
<P>
   One thing we did know eventually: those apples had worms. And
Gary Ross' ingenious fantasy ``Pleasantville'' is about finding
them. Ross' screenplay takes David and his sister, Jennifer (Reese
Witherspoon), on a ``Back to the Future'' trip and into the midst
of their favorite show, where he gets a headful of Brylcreem and
she finds herself in saddle shoes. To their astonishment, they
replace two actors on the program to become Bud and Mary Sue (aka
Muffin) and act out stories that David, as a fan, already knows
about. And they, like everyone around them, are in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Entertaining as it is, ``Pleasantville'' has its own
black-and-white side that extends beyond the visual. The teens from
the '90s, especially Jennifer/Mary Sue, bring a missionary zeal to
awakening the benighted '50s types from their slumber. They wind up
introducing truth, art and passion into Pleasantville in ways that
make color bloom selectively on townspeople who have turned
three-dimensional. By the time these newly enlightened characters
have been labeled ``coloreds'' and have stirred up a conservative
backlash, the movie has seriously belabored its once-gentle
metaphor and light comic spirit. Like ``The Truman Show,'' with
which it overlaps a bit, ``Pleasantville'' has more inspired
trickery than depth.
</P>
<P>
   But there's great fun in that trickery as the film begins,
especially in the choice of Don Knotts as a mysterious wizard of
the sitcom realm. Knotts plays the television repairman who is
apparently drawn to David because the teen-ager knows so much about
``Pleasantville'' episodes. ``Hey, who did Muffin take to the
masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?'' he
quizzes David. (The answer: her father, of course. And he dressed
as Prince Charming.) Pleased with David's answers, he offers him a
brand new television remote control with extraspecial ``oomph.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the device that strands David and Jennifer in the past,
where the repairman still keeps an eye on them. ``I'm a little
concerned by what I'm seeing in these reruns,'' he complains as the
town begins to bloom. By then, townsfolk are shocked to see a
double bed in the furniture store and new-found sexuality has
started a real fire. In Pleasantville, where the temperature varies
from 72 to 72, nothing so real has been seen before. Trying to
rouse the firemen, David/Bud tries the only cry of alarm they know:
``Cat?''
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Pleasantville'' concentrates affectionately on the
television-perfect family into which the teen-agers have been
dropped. William H. Macy brings a funny, touchingly naive bombast
to the father's role, while Joan Allen truly does bloom as the
mother. Ms. Allen gives a lovely performance as a housewife who
cares most about lavishing vein-clogging food on her family (``And
of course, a ham steak!'' she declares at breakfast time) until
that rogue color begins creeping in. When it arrives at that
fateful night when Dad gets home to find no dinner,
``Pleasantville'' recapitulates the changing family atmosphere of
baby boomers' after the ``Father Knows Best'' years.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, whose writing credits include the equally fanciful ``Big''
and ``Dave,'' makes his directing debut with a film that exerts
extraordinary technical demands. Indeed, much of the interest here
is in watching how the black-and-white scenes (filmed on color
stock) begin to flower, often to the characters' embarrassment;
once Ms. Allen's character changes, she fearfully hides her rosy
face behind green-gray makeup. Jeff Daniels plays the soda shop
proprietor who makes her blush and who himself blossoms at the
discovery of art. Randy Newman's score is splendid, but it needn't
have boomed so ecstatically at the sight of a van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Witherspoon turns in a deliciously naughty performance as
the '90s renegade who loves shaking up Pleasantville, even if her
own generation is also satirized here. (The film's '90s teen-agers
treat ``Hey!'' as an interesting sentence.) J.T. Walsh, in one of
his last roles, played the town's most repressive bully. And the
film's unsung heroine is Jeannine Oppewall (``L.A. Confidential''),
the production designer who wittily turns the fantasy of
Pleasantville into an actual place. Watch the sidewalks crack and
the skirts grow less poufy as reality sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Pleasantville'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It includes mild profanity and sexual situations.

`T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS': MONSTERS ON THE MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Passions for the prehistoric that remain unsated after the two
``Jurassic Park'' films are likely to be requited by the latest
IMAX 3-D film, ``T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous.''
</P>
<P>
   Drooling and menacing, the monsters of the Mesozoic are on the
march again in this brief, enjoyable dip into paleontology,
teen-age adventure and parent-child relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoing ``Jurassic Park'' and its sequel, ``The Lost World:
Jurassic Park,'' ``T-Rex'' puts its dinosaurs visually in your face
_ close up and personal, as the television networks like to say.
Set against the lush ferns, moss and ancient trees of the Olympic
rain forest in the state of Washington, these creatures seem
marvelously lifelike.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, ``T-Rex,'' directed by Brett Leonard and written by
Andrew Gellis and Jeanne Rosenberg, doesn't rest on its
technological splendors. Its plot takes the viewer to a
paleontological dig, raises unanswered scientific questions and
introduces some of the major figures in the history of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, seeing ``T-Rex'' won't qualify anyone for a
doctorate in paleontology, and an intriguing subplot that hints at
a troubled family background for its teen-age heroine is left
unresolved; but the film is the sort likely to whet active young
minds to know more about the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``T-Rex'' is built around Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber), the
daughter of an eminent paleontologist, Dr. Donald Hayden (Peter
Horton). While he is busy uncovering new specimens at a dig in
Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada, she is spending her
summer wishing he would allow her to join him. Sharing his passion
for the subject, she is leading tours at the natural-history museum
where he works and completing a paper embodying her theories about
parental instinct among dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   When Donald returns with his latest find, Ally speculates that
it might be a dinosaur egg, although her busy father reminds her
that no one has ever found one.
</P>
<P>
   Toward nightfall, after Donald is summoned to a meeting
elsewhere in the cavernous museum, the find is knocked to the
floor, and moments later, Ally begins a journey in and out of the
past. Dinosaurs in the museum appear to come to life; she meets
Charles Knight, the prescient artist of dinosaurs, and in the early
part of the century encounters Barnum Brown on one of the digs that
earned him renown. And from time to time, she finds herself in that
forest primeval, among the creatures that fascinate her and seem
equally likely to fascinate and stimulate young audiences.

FOX'S `BRIMSTONE' GOES THROUGH HELL AND BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You might have guessed that ``Touched by an Angel'' would mother
some strange puppies, but this beats all.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's ``Brimstone,'' premiering Friday, is a kind of ``Touched
by the Devil,'' in which our hero does Satan's work on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Not that that's a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   (Some television guides might tell you that ``Brimstone'' isn't
on Friday night. But in a late move, Fox pulled two struggling
comedies and subbed ``Brimstone.'' Its regular time slot is 9 p.m.
Tuesdays.)
</P>
<P>
   Ezekiel Stone (series star Peter Horton, who used to be more up
to earth in ``thirtysomething'') is good-looking, courageous and,
darn the luck, dead.
</P>
<P>
   He was a New York City cop who avenged his wife's rape by
murdering the assailant, died himself 15 years ago, and was
condemned to hell.
</P>
<P>
   Satan (John Glover, in the role he's surely been searching for
all these years) can always use a good man. He sends Stone back up
top to hunt down 113 escapees from hell.
</P>
<P>
   And a truly bad lot they are. Stone's hunt begins Friday night
with a pedophilic priest.
</P>
<P>
   Do we have this straight? The priest is the bad guy. The devil,
in his incorrigible way, is doing the right thing. This is not a
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, brother, is it ever (set ital)not(end ital) a comedy.
``Brimstone'' is dark, and earnest, and a bit too smitten with its
own ornate premise.
</P>
<P>
   As the last scheduled fall series to debut, ``Brimstone'' is
also right in line with so many of the year's new shows _ hard to
hate, hard to adore. It fills space with neither dishonor nor
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give it this, though: ``Brimstone'' manages one of the best
lines of the season in a scene where a young woman hits on Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very flattered,'' he tells her, ``but I'm married. Not to
mention dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Take it. The line is yours, a gift from Fox. Halloween's coming;
the situation might arise.
</P>
<P>

<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   _ If you've seen Oprah Winfrey's ``Beloved,'' watched ``Africans
in America'' this week on PBS and can handle more, it's here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masterpiece Theatre'' has a two-part, four-hour British drama
called ``A Respectable Trade,'' airing Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It's a different take on a dirty business, though the
fictionalized treatment _ Philippa Gregory wrote the script, based
on her own novel _ ultimately buttresses the ``Africans in
America'' documentary series.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the story is in England. In 1788, Frances Scott (Emma
Fielding), a parson's daughter and lord's penniless niece, marries
Bristol businessman Josiah Cole (Warren Clarke).
</P>
<P>
   His business, the ``respectable trade'' of the title, is
shipping and selling African slaves to Jamaica plantation owners.
He also imports several to Bristol, with the idea of polishing them
and selling them at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Horrified and then reluctantly agreeing to tutor the slaves,
Frances eventually falls in love with one of them, Mehuru (Ariyon
Bakare). Though he's forced to wear a silver slave's collar, he has
the intelligence and sensitivity that Frances' husband, Josiah,
lacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Respectable Trade'' slumps badly in Monday's installment,
when the production turns so sudsy that, but for English restraint,
it might become a British ``Mandingo.'' It's a close call.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about ``A Respectable Trade'' is Clarke as Josiah
the slave trader. He's an oafish man with hopes that his ill-gotten
fortune and refined wife will pave his way into polite society.
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no. If Josiah had any wits, he'd be smart enough to
recognize who is and isn't a ``savage'' in 18th century Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   _ And finally, no confirmation from Fox, but I hear that Rob
Schneider (``Saturday Night Live,'' ``Men Behaving Badly'') has
signed to guest star as Ally's boyfriend on ``Ally McBeal.''

`LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL' BALANCES DAD'S SWEETNESS, NAZI TERROR
</HEADLINE>
 - BEAUTIFUL-REVIEW-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 4 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Life Is Beautiful'' has been labeled in some
publications as a ``concentration camp comedy.'' It's a shorthand
description that's accurate up to a point, but one that ultimately
trivializes this movie's tremendous power and beauty. Italian
filmmaker Roberto Benigni has crafted a masterpiece that delicately
mixes comedy and tragedy in a way that you'd never think possible.
This is a movie unlike any other this reviewer has ever seen, a
transcendent work that indelibly shows how the human spirit, using
humor and imagination, can overcome anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' is composed of two distinct halves. The
film begins in 1939, when Guido (Benigni), a childlike dreamer,
comes to a Tuscany town looking to open a bookstore. There he falls
in love with the beautiful Dora (Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's
real-life wife), whom he charms by constantly popping up in
unexpected places. Dora is engaged to a fascist official, the same
bureaucrat Guido has been hounding for a permit to open his store,
but you know it's only a matter of time before she drops this loser
and goes off with her elegant clown suitor.
</P>
<P>
   Skip ahead and it's 1944 and the Nazis have occupied Italy.
Guido and Dora, now married, have a son, Giosue (Giorgio
Cantarini), who can't understand why the local pastry shop
prohibits Jews and dogs. Using humor to shield his son from the
encroaching nightmare, Guido tells him that stores can make
whatever rules they want. He then asks him, ``What do you hate?''
For Giosue, it's spiders. ``OK, then,'' Guido replies. ``Tomorrow
we put a sign on our store that says, `No spiders and Visigoths.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, though, never comes. Guido and Giosue are shipped off
to a Nazi death camp and Dora voluntarily follows them. Again,
Guido's first concern is to protect his son's heart. He tells
Giosue that their new surroundings are part of an elaborate game,
and if they play it well enough, Giosue will win a tank.
</P>
<P>
   Guido carries this ruse off through his comical (and astounding)
ability to think fast. For instance, when a German guard asks for
an interpreter so he can lay down the camp rules, Guido volunteers.
He can't speak a word of German, of course, but he can
``translate'' the guard's words for his son. As the soldier barks
out the regulations, Guido lays out the contest's details: Points
are earned by hiding, keeping quiet and not asking for a snack or
crying for Mommy. Giosue understands, and, in turn, has a chance to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of ``Life Is Beautiful'' is reminiscent of
Benigni's earlier movies with its honorable, accident-prone hero
and emphasis on light, physical comedy. The courtship scenes are
genuine and romantic, and Benigni (who also co-wrote the film) even
gets in a few digs at the rigidity of fascism in a scene where he
masquerades as a state official giving a talk on the superiority of
the Italian race.
</P>
<P>
   The film's supreme accomplishment comes when it shifts to the
death camp and still manages to maintain its delicate balance
between sweetness and sorrow. In fact, ``Life Is Beautiful''
achieves its heartbreaking poignancy because Benigni was able to
achieve a lighthearted air at the outset. It only makes what
happens later all the more devastatingly sad.
</P>
<P>
   The movie doesn't pretend to be a historical document of the
Holocaust. Benigni knows full well that he can't paint a realistic
or accurate picture of the camp and achieve his film's goals, so he
establishes it as a stylized monster's lair. The nightmare is
always there in the background, but Guido bravely acts as if it is
all a joke. In the face of death, he has the audacity to believe
that life really is beautiful. After seeing this magnificent film,
you will agree.

A RAY GUN THAT MAKES CUPID QUIVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(Also: In the third graf the name Baseketball is correct.) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Batman'' meets ``Boogie Nights'' via Hong Kong-style kung fu
in ``Orgazmo,'' Trey Parker's flat-as-a-pancake spoof of
superheroes, the pornography industry and religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In writing and directing ``Orgazmo,'' Parker, a creator of
``South Park,'' faced an insoluble problem: how do you make a
boundary-shattering gross-out farce about the porn business that
isn't itself pornographic? Having the actors wear silly costumes
embellished with sex toys just won't do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who was one of the great minds behind the slightly more
amusing ``Baseketball,'' stars as Joe Young, a squeaky-clean Mormon
missionary doing door-to-door religious salesmanship on the streets
of Los Angeles. Barging onto the set of an X-rated film-in-progress
one afternoon, Joe fends off some menacing guards with an
impressive martial arts display that prompts the movie's producer,
Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs), to make Joe an offer he can't
refuse: $20,000 for two days' work if Joe will step into the role
of the movie's comic superhero, Captain Orgazmo.
</P>
<P>
   Because the character wears a mask, Joe assumes he won't be
recognized. And the use of a stunt double for the close-up sex
scenes will ensure he won't have to perform any dirty deeds that
conflict with his puritan values.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical scene from the movie, which becomes a crossover
megahit of Spielbergian proportions, the superhero and his
sidekick, Choda-boy (Dian Bachar), crash through a wall in the nick
of time to rescue scantily clad women on the verge of being raped.
They are immediately rewarded with a voracious orgy.
</P>
<P>
   Life eventually imitates art. When Joe and Ben (the chirpy young
actor playing Choda-boy) discover their producer is in cahoots with
thugs who have been terrorizing the proprietor of their favorite
sushi bar, they step into their movie roles to wreak justice.
</P>
<P>
   Their chief weapon, invented by Ben, is a workable real-life
version of the superhero's magic toy, an orgazmorator, a ray gun
that disarms an opponent by producing an instant and intense
orgasm.
</P>
<P>
   Well, as they say, when you've seen one orgasm you've seen them
all. Once the pair have tested their device on a little old lady in
a walker and on a vicious guard dog that becomes tenaciously
amorous, the movie's main running gag is exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Late in ``Orgazmo,'' nice, sweet blushing Joe gets to splutter,
``I'm not a superhero, I'm a Latter-day Saint!'' It's the film's
one genuinely witty line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orgazmo'' is rated NC-17. There are no hard-core sex scenes,
but the dialogue leaves nothing to the imagination.
</P>

A `LION KING' WITH GIRLS AS STARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(af) 
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the low end, there's the dinky Simba key chain, and on the
high end the extravagant Broadway musical. With all those ``Lion
King'' products floating around, it comes as a shock to realize
there hasn't been a sequel to the movie until now.
</P>
<P>
   The straight-to-video ``Lion King II: Simba's Pride,'' scheduled
for release in stores on Tuesday, is based on an obvious but
sensible and cheering idea: it's the girls' turn to be hero and
villain. Simba has grown into a protective father; his daughter,
Kiara, is a rambunctious teen and the movie's star.
</P>
<P>
   And since Simba's evil Uncle Scar was last seen about to be
shredded by hyenas, the new villain is a wicked mother lion named
Zira.
</P>
<P>
   It's disappointing that this girls-are-strong theme doesn't play
out as smartly as it should, but that's the one weakness in this
sleek, joyful, entertaining film. Its hour and 20 minutes zoom
along as it energetically spins out the durable Disney formula.
</P>
<P>
   There is an innocent romance, a big action scene, lots of music
and brand new possibilities for products.
</P>
<P>
   Though it seems as if ``The Lion King'' has always been with us,
it was only four years ago that the film became a record-breaking
hit and Op-Ed writers fretted about children's reactions to the
death scene of Simba's father, Mufasa. The sequel is much easier
for small children to take.
</P>
<P>
   The major voices from ``The Lion King'' are the same, and early
on there is a visual echo as Simba (Matthew Broderick) and Nala
(Moira Kelly) stand on top of Pride Rock and raise their cub to the
sky while Mufasa's image beams down. All that ``Circle of Life''
business has been taken to heart, and its warmth is felt strongly
here.
</P>
<P>
   In adolescence, Kiara has Neve Campbell's voice and her father's
questioning, adventurous spirit. Simba wants his daughter to stay
close to the family cave. When she insists on exploring away from
home, he sends his old pals Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the
warthog (Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella) to keep an eye on her and
provide comic relief (though they don't have quite the manic energy
and wit they used to).
</P>
<P>
   ``Lion King II'' looks better than most straight-to-video
sequels. The thoughtfulness behind the animation is evident in the
contrast between the brightly colored, lush landscapes of Simba's
Pridelands, filled with herds of zebras, giraffes and other
peaceful creatures, and the dark, dry Outlands, where Scar's
followers have been exiled.
</P>
<P>
   The young Kovu (Jason Marsden) has been chosen as Scar's heir,
but it is Kovu's mother, Zira, who runs this evil-minded show.
Suzanne Pleshette brings to Zira a steely ambition and a
throatiness that suggests the depths of her ruthlessness.
</P>
<P>
   It's not her fault that there is no way to replace Jeremy Irons'
deliciously scathing portrayal of Scar, yet these villains reveal
the distance between the inspired creativity of the original ``Lion
King'' and the competence of its sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Zira trains Kovu to kill Simba, but in classic Romeo and Juliet
fashion, Kovu and Kiara fall in love and eventually unite their
warring families. In happy-ending Disney fashion, they don't have
to die to manage that.
</P>
<P>
   Among the five catchy new songs (and one recycled from the
Broadway musical) the best feature buoyant African rhythms and the
voices of the Zulu group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. ``Upendi'' is the
exuberant song behind the requisite production number. The lively
``We Are One'' is more subtle and graceful, attuned to the film's
hopeful theme of regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   But the generic-sounding ballad ``Love Will Find a Way''
presents an even bigger problem than its mawkishness. Determined to
be with Kovu, Kiara sings, ``I may not be brave or strong or
smart/But somewhere in my secret heart I know/Love will find a
way.'' Wait a minute. Kiara is supposed to be brave and strong and
smart, like her dad.
</P>
<P>
   This slur on her character may be unintentional. After all, this
song sounds detachable, the one intended to be played when the
bride and groom dance at weddings. But it's sadly true that for all
her teen-age spunkiness, Kiara is a colorless, indistinct
character. She's not as bright as Belle in ``Beauty and the Beast''
or even as vehemently willful as Ariel in ``The Little Mermaid.''
</P>
<P>
   And she's certainly no Simba. She fills the cookie-cutter role
pleasantly enough, when she could have done much more.
</P>
<P>
   It's the rare sequel that matches the creative flair of an
original, of course. ``Lion King II'' may be derivative, but it is
also winning on its own, more than an excuse for Kiara lunch boxes
and ponytail holders.

`FOOTLOOSE': A LITTLE TOWN GOES A LITTLE FOOTLOOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(JT) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ That poor, tormented Reverend Moore. All that worry
for so little reason, all that anguish over something so tame.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Footloose,'' the flavorless marshmallow of a musical that
opened Thursday night at the Richard Rodgers Theater, this
righteous minister of a small-town church spends most of the show
fretting over the dangerous consequences of rock-and-roll,
something he describes as ``an endless chant of pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if only, early on, he could have shared the audience's
perspective on the way his town's teen-agers dance to such music.
Why, it's less erotic, and considerably less involving, than an
introductory aerobics class. Of course, if the reverend had
realized this in the production's first scene instead of its last,
then there wouldn't be a show. That is not necessarily a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   There have certainly been worse musicals on Broadway than
``Footloose,'' the $6.5 million adaptation of the hit 1984 movie
that starred Kevin Bacon. Yet it's hard to think of one so totally
unaffecting.
</P>
<P>
   The music in the show is loud, for sure, with a propulsive beat
designed to set toes tapping and fingers snapping. The score is
peppered with flashy dance tunes from the movie that have boomed
over disco floors for years. And there's a young, eager,
hard-working cast of dancers, somersaulting, back-flipping,
wriggling to beat the band.
</P>
<P>
   But as directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by A.C.
Ciulla, this production has a blurry, removed feeling, like a Xerox
of a Polaroid. The show's creators seem to be aiming at teen-agers
whose parents won't let them see the raunchier ``Rent,'' with a
generation-crossing family entertainment that absolutely no one
could object to.
</P>
<P>
   Any grit and spunk that belonged to ``Footloose,'' the movie,
which was silly but kind of satisfying, has been bleached and
sanitized out of existence. When a character sings about letting
``my mind take a small walk,'' when small-town life becomes too
oppressive to bear, it's the only moment in the show when you fully
identify with someone onstage.
</P>
<P>
   You have to question the wisdom of adapting a film whose charm
was largely realized in the editing room. Directed by Herbert Ross,
the original ``Footloose'' arrived in the wake of the hugely
successful ``Flashdance'' and made similar use of the kinetic
crosscutting and camera work popularized by MTV. What most people
still remember about the movie is its opening sequence, a series of
close-ups of restless dancing feet that matched the percolating
rhythms of Kenny Loggins' title song and was guaranteed to give
anyone watching it a case of the St. Vitus twitches.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, live dancers should be just as (if not more) able to
convey an infectious exuberance. But that never, ever happens here,
despite the gymnastic agility of the cast. Ciulla's choreography
is, while buzzing with busyness, peculiarly uncentered; it doesn't
tell you what to focus on.
</P>
<P>
   It says everything about the show that in a number that is
ostensibly about an awkward youth learning to dance (the rousing
``Let's Hear It for the Boy,'' a high point in the movie), we
aren't allowed to see his evolution from klutziness to high-kicking
assurance. The metamorphosis of this cartoon rube (played by Tom
Plotkin) occurs mostly behind a curtain of other performers.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was also lively looking enough to keep you from
thinking about its treacly formula plot. It's the story of young
Ren McCormack (Jeremy Kushnier in the role played on screen by
Bacon), who arrives in a heartland high school from Chicago and
teaches a strait-laced town that young folks have just gotta dance.
</P>
<P>
   Ren's strongest opposition comes from the Rev. Shaw Moore
(Stephen Lee Anderson), whose son was killed in a car accident
after a party and who has since convinced the town council to make
dancing illegal. Unfortunately, the Reverend also has a wild,
dance-prone daughter, Ariel (Jennifer Laura Thompson), with eyes
for Ren, and a wife, Vi (the ever-professional Dee Hoty), who has
had about enough of her husband's sanctimoniousness.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Pitchford, who wrote the screenplay for ``Footloose'' as
well as most of its songs' lyrics, is also the book author, with
Bobbie, and lyricist for the stage version. (Tom Snow wrote most of
the music, though there are numbers from the film by Loggins, Eric
Carmen, Sammy Hagar and Jim Steinman.) The new script scales up the
movie's most feeble aspect: its tale of reconciliation and domestic
healing among people who have known loss and whose spoken and sung
confrontations here take on the aspect of a particularly teary
segment of ``Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   The characters have been built up but in the wrong ways, with
the emphasis on insights out of pop psychology books and very
little of the detail that defines personality. As played by Bacon
and Lori Singer in the movie, Ren and Ariel projected a sullen,
smoldering quality; you could imagine their exploding in dangerous
ways. The film in which they appeared might have been on the square
side, but its young stars were undeniably cool.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   This is not an adjective that fits their successors. The lean,
rubber-jointed Kushnier is a likable presence and a limber dancer,
but a brooding James Dean type he is not. His Ren registers as a
genial, smart-aleck chorus boy who is a little too jittery (his
character-defining solo is called ``I Can't Stand Still'') and
could probably benefit from the occasional Valium. Ms. Thompson is
a pretty, matronly young woman with nothing of the hellcat about
her. It is worth noting that Ariel's most brazen bad-girl
activities in the movie, like sleeping around and playing dangerous
daredevil games with cars, have been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The many new songs Snow has composed range from the vaguely
pleasant (a Sondheimesque duet about ``learning to be silent'' sung
by Ms. Hoty and Catherine Cox as Ren's mother) to the unbearable (a
long soul-searching soliloquy performed by the mild-mannered
Anderson).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoty and Ms. Cox come the closest to seeming like real
people, and Stacy Francis, as Ariel's best friend, has a powerhouse
voice, though it is hardly used to best advantage. For a musical
that aspires to be a series of crowd-stirring show stoppers,
``Footloose'' has a perverse tendency to muffle the endings of its
songs, as though it weren't really expecting much applause.
</P>
<P>
   John Lee Beatty's sets feature assorted generic moving scenery
against sunny backdrops with crayonline streaks of yellows and
blues, as though the world being summoned came out of a coloring
book. This isn't inappropriate. The most impressive scenic effect
involves a giant bridge over a river (prettily set off by the
lighting designer Ken Billington's evocation of flowing water and
starlight) that has little reason to be. Mostly, you keep wondering
where that seven-figure budget was sunk.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the second act of ``Footloose,'' Ren takes
Ariel and some pals to a honky-tonk in a neighboring town. ``Isn't
this worth fighting for?'' he asks, pointing to the dance floor.
Yet what he is indicating is a group of couples in cowboy outfits
doing a simple ballroom step with bovine serenity. If this is all
the wide world has to offer, Reverend Moore should have no
difficulty keeping his congregation down on the farm.

conference title in eight years with a victory at home Saturday

`GOOD MORNING AMERICA' IS JUST TOO SMART FOR ITS OWN GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eulogies for ``Good Morning America'' have been piling up for
months now, and they only seem to become more grave in tone. Once
considered unbeatable, ``GMA'' has fallen badly and can't get up.
Why? Because it's breaking the cardinal rule of morning television:
It's failing to give its audience what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   Now it must pay the price of catch-up in a genre in which
ratings turnarounds are often painfully slow in coming.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from what I've read so far of this mess, fingers are
pointing within the ABC family about who broke this once-proud
program and how it should be fixed. Some say the fall began when
``GMA'' was placed under the network news division and those stiff
shirts tried to ``make it matter.''
</P>
<P>
   I am struck, however, that this is a production that has flown
against the established standards of morning TV by selecting
co-hosts (Fort Worth's Lisa McRee and Kevin Newman), for their
brains and not beauty; by pushing substance over sizzle; and by
assuming that journalism experience is the first and foremost
qualification.
</P>
<P>
   Is this where ``GMA'' stumbled and ``Today'' thrived? Morning
television watchers often flick on the TV without much thought as
to what awaits them, following a morning routine that is exact,
comfortable, gloriously familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Most ordinary viewers who tune in to weekday infotainment
programs like ``GMA,'' ``Today,'' ``CBS Morning News,'' or even
``Good Morning Texas'' on the Dallas-Fort Worth ABC affiliate,
catch these shows in the chunks in which they're shrewdly designed.
</P>
<P>
   They consume news nuggets, lightweight interviews, entertainment
and lots of chatter while doing something else, like eating,
getting the kids dressed, cleaning. In most instances, it's
background noise. A companion with whom you never feel guilty for
being less than attentive.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts of these programs must be attractive and warm, but not
forceful or opinionated, and shouldn't probe or drill someone even
when they leap into well-rehearsed legalese doublespeak.
</P>
<P>
   And that's fine. Let's face it: We don't look to these people
for journalistic scoops or investigative reportage.
</P>
<P>
   ``GMA'' wanted to tweak the format, and hired the people to do
it. Unfortunately, it succeeded, and ``GMA'' now trails ``Today''
by nearly 3 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched McRee's career, from her days at the local ABC
affiliate to overnight news anchor, cable magazine host and anchor
in Los Angeles, I often watch her on ``GMA'' and wonder why she's
bothering to interview some movie star on publicity autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   Much was made of her news background and how she's more prepared
to handle a breaking news story, better equipped to improvise and
summarize, and able to make a seamless transition between the news
and cooking segments.
</P>
<P>
   But is that what we want? I remember the flak recently over
former U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari co-anchoring the Saturday version
of ``CBS Morning News,'' that she wasn't a ``journalist.'' How soon
we'd forgotten that David Hartman, the original ``GMA'' host, was
an actor, or that former ``GMA'' co-host Joan Lunden couldn't
breathe without a TelePrompTer telling her how.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, for instance, is able to balance serious reporting with
breezy banter, but I can't count the number of female friends and
colleagues who have questioned his hunk quotient and noted how it
doesn't compare with that talking model over on ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, you can't have it both ways, at least not in the
sizzle-over-substance climate in which we've created.
</P>
<P>
   I say ``GMA'' will succumb to the tastes of the waking-up TV
watchers, returning to a world of triteness and banality. In fact,
plans are already under way to mimic ``Today's'' viewer-friendly
``window to the world'' of flag-waving tourists who gather weekday
mornings outside 49th Street and Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we can say that ``GMA'' went down the tubes shortly
after it changed hands to the ABC News division. I say it's that
darn window at NBC. What a shrewd ``journalistic'' move.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget about England and the groomed green hedges that line the
maze at Hampton Court Palace, with its quiet bench in the center.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about Crete and the maze where Daedalus confined the
Minotaur. Drop any vestige of hope for the religious and meditative
features of labyrinths.
</P>
<P>
   And then, with a couple of kids in tow, you can have a really
good time at the raggedy corn maze in back of a farmstand on the
North Fork of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing fancy, just a set of paths cut through an acre of
unusually tall corn (a red strain called Butcher Block) with tacky
Halloween-theme props to mark your way. But the maze and, a few
miles down the road, a farmstand and petting zoo called Punkinville
USA, have become our family's ritual markers of fall.
</P>
<P>
   This year, after a beautiful ride past the North Fork vineyards
and pumpkin fields, my husband and I, our enthusiastic 9-year-old
daughter, our slightly blase 13-year-old son and his politely
interested 13-year-old friend arrived at the Greenland Family Farm
maze in Cutchogue in midafternoon on the day it opened in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Corn mazes, by their nature, are not built to last; the ones on
Long Island open in September or October and close soon after
Halloween. By this time the cornstalks have become dried out and
ratty, and there is a heavy infusion of yellow tape to block off
paths that have been stomped into confusion by weeks of heavy
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the season goes by,'' said Adam Samolewski, a member of the
family that runs the farm, ``there get to be more and more trails,
and we have to try to mark off the path and stop people from making
their own.''
</P>
<P>
   But when we visited, the corn was ripening, the paths were clear
and the maze was very inviting. After fortifying ourselves with
raspberries, peaches and honey sticks from the farmstand, paying
the $2-a-person entrance fee and getting a copy of the map, to be
opened only in case of panic, we plunged in, boys first, dad
second, mom and daughter last.
</P>
<P>
   The boys were off on their own in an instant. The dad, too.
There was the initial thrill of adventure, traipsing around
corners, finding dead ends, pushing through a set of black plastic
streamers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooh, this is really fun,'' said the daughter, four minutes in,
as we encountered the cutout of the witch feeding a cat out of a
kettle.
</P>
<P>
   Ooh, this is really frustrating, thought the mom, nine minutes
in, coming on the kitty peeking out of the pumpkin for the fourth
time in as many minutes, and having absolutely no idea how to do it
any differently.
</P>
<P>
   There was no panic to my disorientation, since cornstalks,
unlike hedges, are not impenetrable barriers, and I knew I could
push my way out the side at any time. But after 12 minutes, the fun
was wearing off. And when my husband reappeared _ having made it to
the end, congratulated the triumphal boys and then come back in _
my daughter was ready to abandon my aimless meandering and go with
him.
</P>
<P>
   I stayed behind. But as soon as they were out of sight, I
sneaked a peek at the map, only to discover that it showed a blank
maze with no markings _ completely useless unless you'd tracked
every turn you made since entering and could figure out where you
were. So when my husband came back to get me, I was perfectly
content to be guided out.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, meanwhile, had gone back in, memorized the way and
could now, according to my daughter's stopwatch, navigate the whole
route in one minute and 22 seconds. Not to be outdone, she went
back with the map and followed the most direct path, straight to
the exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother designed it, on graph paper,'' Samolewski said.
``We just plant the rows and then take out the plants where the
paths are going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Corn mazes have become ubiquitous in the Northeast in the last
five years, the most visible feature of a push into agri-tourism by
family farms looking to expand their income with attractions like
hayrides and harvest festivals. This is the third maze the
Samolewskis have planted; they also have pick-your-own pumpkins, a
nursery and a series of tiny backyard ``ponds'' guaranteed to
please the under-6 group.
</P>
<P>
   We looked at the fish in the ponds and then, carefully avoiding
the vineyard tastings that are the upscale North Fork attraction,
drove east on Route 48 to Peconic, site of our other landmark of
hokey fall fun _ Punkinville USA, a farmstand and petting zoo
decorated with an almost unbelievable number of garishly painted
pumpkins, ghosts and witches.
</P>
<P>
   Here the $3 entrance fee buys a look at, and a chance to feed, a
huge collection of birds _ macaws, ostriches, rheas, pheasants of
all kinds _ as well as Vietnamese potbellied pigs, Jacob sheep with
six horns, Nibbles the pygmy goat, iguanas, a menagerie of bunnies
and more.
</P>
<P>
   When the children were younger, we would spend many, many
dollars buying corn kernels from gum-ball dispensers to feed the
animals. In those days, the high points were the pony ride, the
bales of hay to romp in, the enclosure for mingling with a herd of
goats and, one year, the prairie dog that would grab corn from
between fingers.
</P>
<P>
   This year though, the stars were the wild boar; the coati, a
raccoonlike South American creature, and Frankie, the imposing
white llama who stood nine feet tall or more as he put his front
legs up on the fence and stared at us.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't fancy, but it's fun.

 &HT;    '100,000 TEACHERS' BILL MAY HAVE LITTLE IMPACT
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton claimed victory this week as the
Republican-led Congress approved $1.2 billion as the first step
toward hiring 100,000 new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation's fine print _ and doubts among some
education experts about the benefits of smaller classes _ could
throw cold water on public expectations that the influx of teachers
will quickly improve the nation's lagging academic skills.
</P>
<P>
   Among the facts that have been clarified since the plan was
rushed into law as part of an end-of-session budget agreement:
</P>
<P>
   _ While Clinton promised 100,000 new teachers to reduce class
size to 18 in grades 1-3, the Education Department says that it
will take up to seven years to fulfill that pledge _ and then only
if Congress decides to go along each year with additional funding,
totaling $12 billion over the period.
</P>
<P>
   _ The first teachers under the program won't be hired until next
July, and the total number will be no more than 30,000 for the
first year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finding qualified teachers for the new slots could be
difficult, since many areas of the country have a critical shortage
of teachers now.
</P>
<P>
   _ And if good teachers can be recruited, where will the schools
find the new classrooms to put them in? Congress rejected a Clinton
proposal to subsidize school repairs and new construction to
relieve overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, education experts are sharply divided on whether
shrinking class size will translate into significant academic
gains. Some researchers suggest it could be a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most studies give no reason to expect a change in student
performance as a result of smaller class sizes,'' said University
of Rochester professor Eric A. Hanushek, considered one of the
foremost researchers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest study yet, the state of Tennessee commissioned an
experiment to compare varying class sizes in kindergarten through
grade 3. The U.S. Education Department uses the study as evidence
of gains in math and reading for the smallest classes, which
averaged 13-17 pupils. However, Hanushek studied the same data and
concluded that ``small classes at best make a discernible
difference in kindergarten, but not at later primary grades.''
</P>
<P>
   Such contradictory conclusions have hardly dissuaded of
advocates of Clinton's plan to hire new teachers. ``It's a giant
step in the right direction,'' said Mary Elizabeth Teasley,
director of government relations for the National Education
Association, the nation's largest teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   But Teasley conceded that the growing teacher shortage in many
regions will complicate the effort to find 100,000 qualified new
teachers in the coming years. In fact, a major concern is retaining
new teachers already in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned about support for new teachers for the
first three years,'' she said, adding that up to 50 percent of the
newcomers now leave the profession within the first few years.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Chokraii Rees, education policy analyst at the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington, seconded
that observation. Especially in the inner cities where conditions
are the toughest, she said, schools have difficulty keeping their
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new ones won't stay long enough to make a difference,''
Rees said, adding that the government should have begun with the
shortage of quality teachers first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem with teachers is that the teacher training
schools are not attracting the best and the brightest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new teacher funds will be divvied up to the states according
to a formula that takes into consideration poverty and population
numbers. The Education Department released estimates Thursday
indicating that California will receive the greatest amount , $129
million, to hire an estimated 3,322 teachers, followed by New York
($140 million and 2,688 teachers) and Texas ($97 million and 2,500
teachers).

DARK AND MOODY `BRIMSTONE' DEBUTS FRIDAY ON FOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hell hath no fury like a network ignored.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that Fox's gloomy back-from-the-dead adventure
thriller, ``Brimstone,'' makes its debut Friday night at 8 instead
of next Tuesday at 9. The thinking is that ``Brimstone,'' a dark
and moody drama, is a better fit with the dark and moody
``Millennium'' than two underwatched comedies _ ``Living in
Captivity'' and ``Getting Personal'' _ ever were. The programming
executive who scheduled those comedies in front of ``Millennium''
this season has probably been relegated to the network equivalent
of hell, which at Fox would be devising new and creative strategies
for ``World's Wildest Police Videos.''
</P>
<P>
   To make room for ``Brimstone,'' Fox placed ``Living in
Captivity'' on the shelf and canceled ``Getting Personal.'' It also
decided to keep ``Guinness World Records: Primetime,'' an
extravaganza of stupid human tricks originally intended as summer
filler, in the Tuesday slot that was supposed to have gone to
``Brimstone.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot of maneuvering to accommodate one new show. But Fox
could use some good news right about now. Three of its new fall
comedies, ``Costello,'' ``Holding the Baby'' and ``Living in
Captivity,'' are already off the schedule, the moving of ``King of
the Hill'' from Sunday to Tuesday has cut its audience almost by
half, and ratings for the just-concluded World Series were weak.
</P>
<P>
   So, who you gonna call?
</P>
<P>
   How about somebody who can take a few bullets to the chest
without wincing? Or can fall off a building and walk away, albeit
stiffly, without having to visit the emergency room?
</P>
<P>
   Ezekiel Stone is your man, especially if you need to round up
escapees from hell.
</P>
<P>
   Stone is a New York police detective who went to hell when he
died because of the vigilante-style justice he administered to the
man who raped his wife. Conventional law enforcement was unable to
bring the criminal to justice, so Stone killed him in cold blood,
then died shortly afterward in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the end of the story, except Fox needs a hit show
and hell seems to have a serious security problem. One hundred
thirteen vile souls have managed to return to Earth, and Satan
wants them back. Stone is picked to handle this last roundup
because he was New York's best detective once upon a time, and he
would very much like to see his wife again. The devil, in fact, has
promised him redemption if he successfully corrals each escapee.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Horton plays Stone as the antithesis of Gary Shepherd, the
fun-loving guy he created on ``thirtysomething.'' Then again, 15
years in hell might dull anyone's sense of fun. So what we get is a
tormented soul, still suffering despite his work-release reprieve,
still wondering about his qualifications for sending people back to
hell.
</P>
<P>
   In the show's third episode, for instance, Stone's
escapee-of-the-week is a rape victim from medieval times who got
revenge by killing her attackers and their families. Stone must
send her back, but, having been deeply affected by the same crime,
he's not sure the woman deserves any more time in hell.
</P>
<P>
   Horton shows a tad more emotion in that episode than he displays
in Friday's premiere, but he's no grim weeper. It seems he and
Michael Madsen of ABC's ``Vengeance Unlimited'' prepared for their
roles with the same minimalist acting coach. They have achieved the
same soto voce murmur, the same sarcastic asides, the same
mysterious, brooding presence.
</P>
<P>
   Though detective Stone occasionally has amusing run-ins with the
devil, played impishly by John Glover, the overall effect of
``Brimstone,'' as any preacher will tell you, is not salubrious.
Reasonably well written, it is nevertheless sullen and moderately
violent _ a real downer that's hard to embrace at the end of a long
week.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing liberally from ``X-Files''-style themes of fighting
evil supernatural forces, ``Brimstone'' ends up doing it with style
but not a lot of grace: Stone must subdue his targets by destroying
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   That may change as Ezekiel Stone gets used to tracking down
hell's fugitives. But if one of them shows up on ``Guinness World
Records: Primetime'' trying to cram the Anaheim Angels onto the
head of a pin, you'll know the show's in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Brimstone. Hourlong drama series about a deceased police
detective who is dispatched from hell to round up 113 escapees.

THREE WOMEN JOURNALISTS WHO ARE HANGING TOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three foreign female journalists stood behind a
podium in the Waldolf Astoria on Wednesday and, one after another
calmly recited the horrors they have endured _ death and rape
threats, kidnapping, acid thrown in a face, years of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   All for merely doing their job, which is to honestly report what
goes on in their countries.
</P>
<P>
   The women were brought to this country by the International
Women's Media Foundation, which encourages the work of female
journalists abroad and each year highlights the bravery of a few
who literally put their lives on the line every day. There was
scarcely a dry eye in the place as the courageous trio told a
banquet crowd their tales of survival and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   American journalists take freedom of the press for granted. As
CBS correspondent Rita Braver observed, ``In our country, if
somebody comes after us, it's usually with a lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   But many reporters and editors in corrupt and authoritarian
countries operate under outrageously repressive conditions imposed
by governments that fear public exposure of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   We Americans feel courageous if we defend our reporting against
the criticism of a powerful politician or editor. But the worst
that can happen is that we might be fired. Our foreign colleagues
must sometimes risk their health, their sanity, their very freedom.
Now that calls for true grit.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Zarkova, a veteran reporter at Trud Daily in the Bulgarian
capital of Sofia, writes investigative articles about police
violence, drug trafficking, corruption and the burgeoning criminal
clans in her country. In May, an attacker threw sulfuric acid on
her, severely burning the left side of her face, neck and arm and
potentially blinding her in one eye.
</P>
<P>
   After a long hospitalization, she went back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us there is no other way,'' she says. ``If they do not
splash acid in your face as a journalist, they will kill you in the
street as a civilian.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanca Rosales Valencia is the editor of La Republica, a
newspaper in Lima, Peru. She says she constantly receives death
threats. Last year she was kidnapped, held at gunpoint and
threatened with rape and death by her captors before finally being
freed in a distant field.
</P>
<P>
   She admits she was terrified, but she continues to go to work
every day. ``Our everyday reality'' she says, is ``the lack of
press freedom.'' She cites the example of a covertly recorded
conversation at a local television station between the producer of
a top-rated program and a government official. The official not
only dictated which information was to be reported that day and
which facts ignored, but the order in which the information should
appear.
</P>
<P>
   The third honoree, Chris Anyanwu, former editor of Zest News
Limited's Sunday Magazine in Lagos, Nigeria, won the International
Women's Media Foundation's Courage in Journalism award three years
ago. She was unable to accept in person because she was behind bars
in a primitive prison, convicted in a secret military court as a
traitor for publishing a story unflattering to Gen. Sani Abacha,
who ruled Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   After Abacha died in June, his successor released her and she
was allowed to come here to tell her story. She says imprisonment
was ``a nightmare.'' But she told herself, ``Don't give in, don't
be an insult to women. Women have not come into this world to fool
around.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep her sanity, she knitted 120 berets in her solitary cell.
She isn't going to give up her chosen profession, either.
</P>
<P>
   Why do these women remain in journalism? Is it really worth the
pain and fear?
</P>
<P>
   They all say that they feel an obligation to help their
countries move toward democracy. ``It is my deliberate choice not
to join the conspiracy of silence,'' Anyanwu says. ``We are in a
frontal fight against corruption,'' Valencia says.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 45 years of being ruled by communist dictators,
Bulgarians are making the first steps as citizens ... if we lose
the battle against the criminals, we might lose everything we have
gained,'' Zarkova says.
</P>
<P>
   It makes covering Washington politics seem very tame.

VICTORIAN ESCAPISM AND DENIAL WITH THE FASCINATING FAIRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's about sex.
</P>
<P>
   I am, of course, referring to the peculiar and heretofore
obscure Victorian phenomenon known as fairy painting, the subject
of a show at the Frick that is a scaled-back version of a hugely
popular exhibition in London a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only about sex, because it's also about drugs, some of
the pictures having possibly been painted under the influence of
cocaine, morphine, absinthe or chloroform, all of which were
readily available in Victorian Britain. Narcotics seem to be ``the
stuff,'' for example, in ``The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of,'' a
picture by John Anster Fitzgerald, who is said to have sustained
his imagination with a steady diet of laudanum, a preparation of
opium, and who, so as to leave no doubt in this case, included
tell-tale medicine bottles in a watercolor version of the painting,
which shows a peaches-and-cream Victorian heroine in a flimsy white
dress conjuring up goblins, satyrs and other Boschian creatures at
her bedside.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Carroll once counted 165 fairies in ``The Quarrel of
Oberon and Titania'' by a Scottish artist named Joseph Noel Paton,
much admired by Queen Victoria. That's 165 naked women in a single
painting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, we are told, the British never acknowledged the erotic
content of their fairy paintings, thereby demonstrating a form of
collective sexual denial that is a root of the phrase there'll
always be an England. For the Victorians, it seems, the
un-Disneylike images were sufficiently couched in mythological
terms to allow critics and the public to see the pictures as
respectable, even ennobling variants of history paintings, the
highest endeavors for painters at the time.
</P>
<P>
   For contemporary sensibilities, the pictures are more simply
about sex and drugs, and death, too. (Fitzgerald painted a fairy
funeral, for example.) No wonder the exhibition has been so
popular.
</P>
<P>
   The show's cachet in London had partly to do, I think, with the
current vogue for surrealism. The exhibition was on view there at
the same time as ``Sensation,'' the much-talked-about survey of the
new British shock art, and it made a useful point of comparison:
the gap is very wide between young artists like Matthew Barney, an
American, or the British Chapman brothers, and a fairy painter
like, say, Daniel Maclise, whose ``The Faun and the Fairies'' shows
a particularly malevolent faun among dozens of frisky, frolicking
nymphs. But the divide isn't infinite, and some of the fairy
paintings therefore look oddly up-to-date.
</P>
<P>
   Up-to-date though not precisely a revelation. There are some
very good pictures in the exhibition but only one great one, ``The
Fairy Feller's Master Stroke'' by Richard Dadd. The paintings,
roughly spanning the 1840s through the early 20th century, are
mostly amusing, and above all they are instructive as byproducts,
or symptoms, of a mix of 19th-century cultural phenomena, each of
which is ultimately more significant than the art.
</P>
<P>
   I am talking, for example, about what Charlotte Gere describes
in the exhibition catalog: ``As modern industrial progress engulfed
the English countryside,'' she writes, ``the Victorians embraced
belief in fairies as a reaction to the disenchantment of the
world.'' Fairies provided an escape from a new Darwinian existence
into an occult and magical kingdom that existed apart from urban
society. Fairy paintings show a half-seen, pixie realm in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Akin to that feeling of unease and the desire for escape in the
mid-19th century was a taste for the paranormal, sparked by various
spirit sightings, which made table-turning and seances popular
British pastimes. The new spiritualism, as it was called, cut
across society to include the educated classes, the most famous
example being Arthur Conan Doyle, who, besides writing the Sherlock
Holmes stories, was the son of a fairy painter named Charles Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   From his father, he inherited a belief in the paranormal and
became so convinced of the authenticity of several fairy or spirit
photographs concocted by a pair of English girls in Cottingley,
West Yorkshire, in 1917 that he even wrote a book defending them,
``The Coming of the Fairies.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the photographs now look patently fake. Fairy
painting, overlapping with photography and eventually the early
stages of cinema, provided visual evidence of an unseen universe to
a British public (of which Doyle was a late representative) that
longed to believe what it saw. Their faith in make-believe was
probably less a matter of gullibility or collective delusion than
simple nostalgic wishfulness or desire, which the undeniable
brutality of World War I finally brought to an end.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   There was also a good deal of discussion in the middle of the
19th century about the empire's importation of (read: dilution by)
foreign cultures. Fairies, although they came partly from the
German Grimm Brothers, derived from native folklore. The term
folklore is itself Victorian.
</P>
<P>
   What we see at the Frick exemplifies a kind of oblique jingoism,
which can be described as another manifestation of social
insecurity and longing. Fairies derived from Scottish, Celtic,
Irish and Welsh stories and legends and from Shakespeare, whose
fairy plays, ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and ``The Tempest,'' had
revivals in 19th-century English theaters where the public also saw
Gilbert and Sullivan's ``Iolanthe'' and ``La Sylphide.''
</P>
<P>
   In an essay in the show's catalog, Jeremy Maas, an expert in
fairy paintings who died recently, stresses the special impact of
ballet and theater: Marie Taglioni in ``La Sylphide,'' he points
out, provided fairy painters with an image of a figure dancing on
the tips of her toes, and a general revolution in stagecraft and
set design increased the public appetite for spectacle and
illusion, blurring the line between what was real and what wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   A few of Thomas Grieve's fantastical watercolors for extravagant
set designs are at the Frick, along with paintings like Robert
Huskisson's ``Come Unto These Yellow Sands,'' based on Ariel's song
in ``The Tempest,'' the image set within a proscenium arch and the
figures spotlighted. Fairy painting became an extension and
reflection of the new forms of theater and thrived as they did.
</P>
<P>
   It was a French painter at the time, Gustave Moreau, who said,
``I believe only in what I do not see,'' which is what the British
fairy painters contended. Besides Moreau, there were artists like
Puvis de Chavannes and Anselm Feuerbach in France and Germany
painting classical images of a strange, dreamy sort that is not
altogether unrelated to fairy painting. My point is that fairy
paintings were just one British manifestation of an escapist ethos
throughout Europe, you might call it the flip side of 19th-century
Realism, which in the singular case of Dadd rose to an exceptional
level because his imagination was stronger and his technique more
exact than any other British fairy painter's.
</P>
<P>
   Dadd's story is familiar by now. Born in 1817, a follower of
Maclise, he was regarded as one of the most promising artists of
his generation, universally liked for his cheerful good nature.
Then he went mad, believing he was persecuted by devils and under
the power of the Egyptian god Osiris. He murdered his father, fled
to France was caught and then was committed in 1844 to the British
lunatic asylum known as Bedlam. He spent 20 years there until
transferring to the new asylum at Broadmoor, where he died of
consumption in 1886.
</P>
<P>
   During his 42 years of confinement he painted, according to an
observer, ``amidst the most revolting conversation and the most
brutal behavior,'' and although once he had a few works exhibited
publicly, basically he was cut off from the world.
</P>
<P>
   His madness inevitably colors how people see the work, but what
makes it remarkable is in part its connection, despite his
isolation, to what was going on in British art. Dadd offers the
prime example of a hyper-precise, narrative style that reached its
apogee in ``The Fairy Feller,'' his insect's-eye view of
Lilliputian figures seen through a scrim of timothy grass.
</P>
<P>
   The image is dense, like woven tapestry, its surface as smooth
and hard as enamel. Dadd spent years on it. Dozens of figures, the
fairy populace of his mind, surround a woodchopper, the fairy
feller, about to split a hazelnut.
</P>
<P>
   Dadd always declined to explain the scene, which has about it a
particular hallucinatory and vaguely menacing quality. I noticed
the other day that the blade of the woodchopper's ax is
conspicuously left unpainted.
</P>
<P>
   Dadd killed his father by stabbing him to death.

   PRACTICAL MAGIC &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, Dianne Wiest, Stockard Channing,
Aidan Quinn, Goran Visnjic &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Griffin Dunne &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 05 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Being from a family of witches, the gorgeous Owens sisters,
Sally (Ms. Bullock) and Gillian (Ms. Kidman), have a problem with
men. By pronouncing a curse on the entire male gender, an Owens
woman of long ago sentenced mates of future generations to a
premature end.
</P>
<P>
   Sally marries a cheery fish merchant, only to have him hit by a
truck. Gillian, though, puts the destructive force to good use and
brings about the demise of her vile boyfriend, a bad idea named
Jimmy (Visnjic).
</P>
<P>
   But Jimmy, now dead and with eyes looking as if they've been
borrowed from a striped bass, won't stay put in the hole the
sisters have dug for him in the back yard of the strikingly
photogenic Owens seaside homestead.
</P>
<P>
   With Gillian possessed by Jimmy's body and soul, the plucky
Sally rallies the neighbors, who swallow their distaste for witches
and pitch in to wield broomsticks and prepare the potions required
to exorcise the evil among them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Jimmy cuffs Gillian around and tries to brand her with
his heated-up signet ring. Later there is much seething and
thrashing about as the women battle the dead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX No action but Gillian vamps about. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Now and then the obscenities fly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 Yes, there are witches, but they look like major movie
stars and come with relationship troubles and other baggage.
Besides, the film is too scary and too confusing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-9 They'll like the idea of witches, but this just isn't a
movie for small children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12 Ms. Bullock and Ms. Kidman aren't teen-agers, but
they seem to be at times as they bounce about a glossy-magazine
setting. The glamour will appeal, but parents have profanity and
domestic violence to consider. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP By this age, the film could be too tame and a
trifle silly. Teen-agers generally crave stronger stuff. Jimmy is a
creep, but he'd never make it in ``Scream'' or ``Scream 2,'' huge
hits with older adolescents, whose bad boys take no prisoners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOLY MAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy, Jeff Goldblum, Kelly Preston, Robert Loggia &QL; 
Directed by Stephen Herek &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG 113 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Ricky (Goldblum) and Kate (Ms. Preston) work at a television
shopping channel where they attract and repel each other while
honing pitches for glue guns and love scents.
</P>
<P>
   One day as they are changing a tire on an expressway, they
encounter a smiling, beatific fellow called G (Murphy), who
materializes amid the whizzing traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Kate and Ricky (though he has misgivings) sponsor G and soon the
mysterious visitor _ some kind of holy man? _ proves himself
overpoweringly wise and calming. Put on the shopping channel, he
eschews materialism and becomes a kind of guru to the masses, who
to everybody's delight buy more junk than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the world's leading religions take a crack at
explaining G's views, but only he knows for sure. Now, can he help
Kate and Ricky overcome their differences? &QL;

DIMINISHING EFFECTS: VISUAL GEMS LIKE `PLEASANTVILLE' HARDLY RAISE
AN EYEBROW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1988, when Bob Hoskins throttled the animated title
character of ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' audiences were stunned.
When we saw this movie, our eyes bugged out as if we were cartoon
characters ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   We'd seen live action and animation mixed before, but it never
looked like this _ you actually believed that Hoskins' hands were
around the neck of a character you knew wasn't real. You couldn't
read about the movie without reading about its effects; you
couldn't see it without being amazed.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to Friday, when Gary Ross' fantasy
``Pleasantville'' opens in theaters. The movie centers on a couple
of '90s teens who somehow get sucked into a black-and-white 1950s
sitcom _ and start coloring the world of its characters. The
effects should startle viewers _ in one scene, Jeff Daniels wipes
the black and white off Joan Allen's tear-stained face to reveal
flesh-toned skin _ and yet, the film has received very little
pre-release buzz.
</P>
<P>
   So are we becoming too jaded about what movies can do? If one of
the reasons we see movies is to escape, to visit worlds that we
could never otherwise visit, our increasing sophistication about
how movies are made creates a problem. It's like knowing how a
magic trick is done; once you've been educated, the spell is
broken.
</P>
<P>
   We know, for instance, that ``Pleasantville'' involves a lot of
computer enhancement and digital trickery. And we've grown used to
the movies doing these things. We see such effects not only in
movies, but also in commercials, in music videos, in TV shows such
as ``The X-Files.'' We've come perilously close to taking them for
granted, egged on by the number of effects used just for effects'
sake.
</P>
<P>
   Computer trickery has given filmmakers a lot more visual
freedom, but something has been lost in trade. It's like the
complaint that record collectors make when debating CDs vs. vinyl;
sure, the newer technology is cleaner, but that cleanliness lacks
the warmth of the old style.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that moviemakers should turn Amish on us. Tom
Rainone, the Arlington, Texas-bred effects wiz whose work has been
seen on such recent movies as ``Wishmaster'' and ``Star Kid,'' says
that the digital enhancement isn't evil if that's what you use it
for _ enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use it as a control device, to clean up some of the
stop-motion effects, it's fine,'' Rainone says. He credits the
influence of such effects pioneers as Willis O'Brien, who set the
standard for stop-motion effects with 1933's still-amazing ``King
Kong,'' and O'Brien's protege Ray Harryhausen, who dazzled with a
series of myth-inspired fantasies such as ``Jason and the
Argonauts'' in the '50s, '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   These older movies look primitive by today's standards, and
that's exactly what's so charming about them. In stop-motion work,
someone had to painstakingly move an 18-inch Kong by hand for frame
after frame to provide the illusion that he's a real, moving, giant
ape.
</P>
<P>
   We marveled at tricks like this for decades. During the
pre-''Star Wars'' '70s, film buffs still gaped at the effects in
1956's ``Ten Commandments'' when it first appeared on TV. The
parting of the Red Sea, achieved through reverse photography, looks
almost hokey now, but it's fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Movies such as 1972's ``The Poseidon Adventure'' and 1973's
``The Exorcist'' also had people babbling about their effects.
``Poseidon's'' upside-down luxury liner now looks like it was
filmed in a bathtub, but the knowledge of what it achieved at the
time gives the movie a much-needed boost. Even as recently as 1994,
we were astonished to see Tom Hanks interacting with dead
presidents in ``Forrest Gump'' _ directed, not coincidentally, by
``Rabbit's'' Robert Zemeckis.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, we're becoming spoiled. The past month has brought
us three visually amazing movies: the aforementioned
``Pleasantville,'' DreamWorks' computer-animated ``Antz'' and the
Robin Williams new-age reverie ``What Dreams May Come.'' Yet we've
heard more about ``Antz's'' subversive humor and ``Dreams'''
Kodak-commercial sentimentality than we have about how great the
movies look.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to play `Antz' to an audience of 8-year-olds and
then play (Harryhausen's) the `Seventh Voyage of Sinbad,' I think
they'd enjoy `Sinbad' more,'' Rainone says. ``For a lot of reasons,
but mostly because it's neater.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, every now and then, people still do things the
old-fashioned way _ and that's when we're most astounded. The best
recent example is ``Titanic.'' Although James Cameron used
computers, his movie was so expensive and took so long to make
partly because he insisted on using a realistic ship, built 70
percent to scale. When the boat starts going down, it looks so real
that it's staggering, and the movie transcends its hoary love story
and clunky dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But although the old-fashioned way looks better, we're going to
see more and more of the computerized stuff and digital trickery
because of the freedom it allows filmmakers and the time it saves _
and it's just not that impressive anymore.
</P>
<P>
   It'll take a true visionary to stun us again, the type of person
who comes along every 20 years or so. In 1977, it was George Lucas,
whose first ``Star Wars'' still looked incredible in its 1997
reissue. Place your bets on him again: He's under so much pressure
to deliver on his next ``Star Wars'' movie in 1999, he's likely to
pull every trick out of his bag to make our eyes pop out again. But
after he takes us to that next level, where will we go from there?

`LASSO THE WIND': HOW THE WEST WAS WON, THEN LOST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lb) 
Ed Sylvester is a professor of journalism at Arizona State
University and author of ``The Healing Blade: A Tale of
Neurosurgery.'' 
 By ED SYLVESTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood provided the American education about the ``Wild
West'' through most of this century, and two story lines
predominated. Good settlers would be rescued from hostile Indians
by heroic cavalry, and good settlers would be rescued from bullying
big ranchers or outlaw gangs by rambunctious but hard-working and
honorable cowboy heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The cowboy, in particular, had to be all that and more to match
land that was and is rock-hard, prickly and mostly bone dry. Gold
was a fever that drove men crazy, but water drove them to wars
throughout the West.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly news. The ongoing struggles in courtrooms and at
ballot boxes over water and land use have been well documented in
books, television specials and newspaper articles.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Timothy Egan, a third-generation Westerner who is a
national correspondent of The New York Times, with ``Lasso the
Wind,'' a book that is terse in length and sprawling in scope. In
chapters ranging from Arizona and New Mexico to the Northwest and
California, he covers every hot topic of the New West: Water.
Cattle. Mining. Logging. Sprawl. The clash of cultures. The good
feel of wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Such sweeping reportage, part travelogue but more essay, is a
time-tested way to cover a huge topic, and the form has been used
successfully since de Toqueville. Here it is only partly
successful, and most of its failings owe something to Egan's
method.
</P>
<P>
   He sets off from a conference on the future of the West at Grand
Teton National Park in Wyoming, with this mission: ``It may be
easier to lasso the wind than to find a sustaining story for the
American West. Still, as storytellers it is our obligation to keep
trying.''
</P>
<P>
   In the best chapters, Egan uses the past powerfully, to explain
and give dimension to the present. We visit the Oregon frontier,
where whites destroyed the Nez Perce led by Chief Joseph. We move
to the present, where that cruelty haunts the town named for
Joseph. The Nez Perce got treaty rights to their land in 1863.
Fourteen years later they were given a week to leave it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, impoverished white settlers whose land is played out by
logging and grazing are enraged that the government is trying to
curtail those activities. They reach back into that past for a most
sovereign right to defend their property from seizure.
</P>
<P>
   We view the ruin of Butte, Mont., a huge chunk of which is now
an open-pit mine; and we stop in agricultural Washington, reluctant
to accept Hispanic mestizo culture where it was born, while relying
on the cheap labor that only Mexicans will provide.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout ``Lasso the Wind,'' Egan develops two themes. First,
by embracing cattle-grazing, logging and mining as the true West,
ordinary working people wind up destroying the beauty and majesty
that drew them there. Second, in claiming their historical rights
to the land and its customs, the descendants of settlers are taking
exactly the same stand as the original Hispanic and Indian
residents did against the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The book's most powerful scene concludes the chapter on Butte.
Egan depicts a miner who, as his father had, worked for the company
that chewed up city, mountain and countryside. He is telling his
children not to become miners. But he will move on to a new mine
job paying $15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ```What good is the money when this place will kill you?'' his
wife asks. ```But look how damn beautiful it is,' the miner says,
dragging on a cigarette and motioning to the mountains all
around.''
</P>
<P>
   The family is sitting at a memorial to 168 miners killed in the
worst mining disaster in U.S. history. In the cemetery, those not
killed in mine accidents usually died of lung diseases. On many
miners' graves are etchings of their beloved mountains. The setting
of such observations side by side is Egan's strong point.
</P>
<P>
   But in between there is too much lassoing of wind, and in
between are most of the words. Using a journey to underlie a book
makes the writer a prisoner of the itinerary. There is a lot of
territory to fill, and a lot of old stories are retold for no new
purpose.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The book's most serious shortcoming is its portrayal of Mormon
history. The problem is not one of historical accuracy, but of tone
and attitude. The chapter on Utah details the infamous Mountain
Meadows massacre of 1857. At least 120 adults and children in a
wagon train were murdered by a band of Mormons fearful that
settlement was a prelude to invasion by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   An account of that awful day belongs in a book about the
past-haunted West, and overall it is well told, though derivative
of the work of Juanita Leavitt Brooks, a courageous Mormon who
first dug the story from families' records and oral histories. But
Egan tells too much of this important chapter with a sneer and
sarcastic asides that are especially inappropriate in a book
exhorting the many cultures of the West to share their common
ground.
</P>
<P>
   He opens the Mountain Meadows episode at the site, quoting the
granite memorial in full. He questions the lack of completeness in
what's there, hinting that some conspiracy of church fathers
prevented including details of who killed whom. He says, ``No stone
commemoration was more fought over.''
</P>
<P>
   But a news-database search on the term ``Mountain Meadows
massacre'' turns up a story on the laying of the memorial in 1990
by descendants of the survivors and descendants of the killers.
</P>
<P>
   The man who organized the reunion, a descendant on the victim
side, said both groups had chosen the words to honor the dead
without punishing the living. The man said, ``Do we want to pass on
to the next generation the animosity and hate that's been passed on
for the last 133 years, or do we want to stop it now?''
</P>
<P>
   Those are good words for the West, and words Egan himself echoes
a dozen times through this adventurous, often powerful, but flawed
look at the American West grappling with its past on the frontier
of the 21st century.

Backed by U.S., Saudis Seek Afghan Ouster of Bin Laden 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JUDITH MILLER and JAMES RISEN  &QL; 
 &QL; 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Urged on by the Clinton Administration, Saudi Arabia's top
intelligence official met privately with the leader of the Taliban
in late September to try to persuade Afghanistan to deport Osama
bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected of masterminding the August
bombings of two American embassies in East Africa, according to
United States and Arab officials.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks after the United States launched a cruise-missile
strike against Mr. bin Laden's terrorist training camps in
Afghanistan, Prince Turki bin Faisal, chief of Saudi intelligence,
sat down with Mullah Mohammed Omar, leader of the Taliban's Supreme
Council, and asked him to end his protection for Mr. bin Laden and
hand him over, Arab officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, the Islamic movement that controls most of
Afghanistan, refused. Their recalcitrance in the face of Prince
Turki's personal request finally prompted Saudi Arabia, one of the
Taliban's most important financial sponsors and allies, to
downgrade its diplomatic ties with the group.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they are supporting diplomatic efforts to
persuade the Taliban to deport Mr. bin Laden. ''Achieving the
expulsion of bin Laden and bringing him to justice is something we
are actively pursuing,'' said a State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   In their effort to persuade Afghanistan to deport Mr. bin Laden,
State Department officials also have spoken to Taliban
representatives themselves and have sought the intercession of
Pakistan, the only other major ally of Afghanistan in the region.
</P>
<P>
   They have also, said an Arab official, talked to members of Mr.
bin Laden's family in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   If Afghanistan does turn over Mr. bin Laden to Saudi Arabia, it
is possible that Mr. bin Laden might be tried there, rather than in
the United States. If he were to be handed over to the Saudis and
brought back to Saudi Arabia, one Arab official said, he could face
swift execution.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they want him to face trial in the
United States. They say they asked the Saudis to urge the Taliban
only to deport Mr. bin Laden. Senior United States officials said
they were not negotiating with the Taliban, but simply repeating
the message that they should get rid of Mr. bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've certainly urged, in public and private, all those who
have influence with the Taliban, that it is our strong view Mr. bin
Laden should be expelled and brought to justice,'' a White House
spokesman said. ''We will certainly continue our multi-pronged
strategy of combating Mr. bin Laden's network.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Administration officials said that the new diplomatic
effort did not preclude further military action against Mr. bin
Laden and his terrorist network. Officials said the Aug. 20
cruise-missile attack was intended to break up the network and
perhaps kill Mr. bin Laden. Since then, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and other law-enforcement and intelligence agencies
say they are continuing to work with other nations to arrest as
many of Mr. bin Laden's operatives as possible. Mr. bin Laden
already faces criminal charges in the United States under a sealed
indictment handed up by a Federal grand jury in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing the Taliban is part of a broad effort to damage the bin
Laden network, officials say. ''Our tactics may have changed, but
our strategy of putting him out of action remains the same,'' said
a senior American official. ''This is another way of trying to deal
with the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics outside of Government say it also suggests
ambivalence among Administration officials over how best to deal
with the radical Islamic group that now controls most of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a gap between our interests in Afghanistan and
the level of our attention to the need for a strategy,' said Zalmay
Khalilzad, an Afghan expert at the Rand Corporation. ''A rogue
state could emerge there, so we either need to pay attention now,
or later.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi role in trying to extricate Mr. bin Laden from
Afghanistan has been a murky one, complicated by Islamic politics
and the longstanding alliance between the Saudis and the Taliban.
But the Saudi request to the Taliban for Mr. bin Laden represents a
significant shift.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the Saudis had made it clear that they did not want
Mr. bin Laden brought back to Saudi Arabia, for fear that he could
be a martyr figure to Saudi dissidents. More broadly, United States
officials say they have been frustrated by the Saudis' refusal to
cooperate fully on terrorism investigations in the past, especially
in the case of the 1996 bombing of the American military barracks
at Khobar Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   But now, what Administration officials say is the clear evidence
of his involvement in the East African bombings, as well as a
growing belief among Saudi officials that Mr. bin Laden poses a
threat to their Government, seems to have prompted a change in
their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And, while he is not currently under indictment for any crimes
in Saudi Arabia, Arab and United States officials now say they have
evidence linking him to the 1995 car bombing of a military
installation in Riyadh in which American servicemen were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. bin Laden, who was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in
1994, would face ''swift'' action if he were brought back to Saudi
Arabia, said one Arab official.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even Mr. bin Laden's wealthy Saudi family is cooperating
with the United States and Saudi Arabia on how to bring him to
heel, the Arab official said. The bin Laden family made a fortune
in the construction industry. ''U.S. officials, after Saudi Arabia
blessed it, have talked to members of the bin Laden family,'' the
Arab official said.
</P>
<P>
   After Taliban officials repeatedly said they would consider
turning over Mr. bin Laden if they were presented with evidence
against him, Arab officials familiar with the matter say that
Prince Turki presented evidence to the Taliban of Mr. bin Laden's
involvement in terrorism, but it made no difference. Evidence was
also presented by Bill Richardson, former chief delegate to the
United Nations, when he visited Afghanistan earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton Administration officials, fearing that his return to
Saudi Arabia could lead to trouble for the Saudi Government, stress
that they do not want the Saudis to have Mr. bin Laden brought back
to their country. And they note that the United States does not
have an extradition treaty with Saudi Arabia. The Clinton
Administration is still determined to have Mr. bin Laden put on
trial in the United States, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a policy on whether we would accept bin Laden
being brought to justice in a third country, we haven't crossed
that bridge yet,'' one Administration official said. ''But Saudi
Arabia would not be the place where we would want him to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the Taliban's ambassador designate to the
United Nations, confirmed in an interview that his Government's
discussions with Prince Turki over Mr. bin Laden had been
''disappointing.'' but argued that Afghanistan's unwillingness to
oust its ''guest'' would not damage long-term relations between
Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. He added that his Government would be
willing to try Mr. bin Laden in Islamic court in Afghanistan if
there were ''solid'' evidence against him.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The city began with the river.
</P>
<P>
   As the broad and occasionally unruly Ohio flows southwest from
Pittsburgh toward its rendezvous with the Mississippi, it is
interrupted here by rapids. In 1778, that barrier prompted George
Rogers Clark, a young frontiersman from Virginia, to pause on his
trip west and establish a settlement that eventually grew into
this, the first metropolis west of the Alleghenies.
</P>
<P>
   Clark himself, a brother of Meriwether Lewis' partner, William
Clark, pushed on into the wilderness with a meager little force of
175 men. Marching through primeval forest and across flooded
prairies in a campaign of audacious brilliance, he fought and
defeated the better equipped, more numerous British at isolated
villages in the Northwest Territory _ Vincennes, Cahokia and
Kaskaskia _ securing that vast domain for the fledgling United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1809, long retired, Clark returned to Louisville to live out
his final years at his sister's house, Locust Grove. Built in 1790,
meticulously restored in 1962, it stands today as a monument to
Clark's exploits, which are detailed in a nearby visitors center.
But with its Flemish bond brickwork, shellacked ash floors and
original walnut paneling, its gardens and dependencies, Locust
Grove also bears witness to the highly refined tastes of some of
Kentucky's pioneer settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville has preserved other handsome mementos of its early
years. Farmington, an exceptional little federal-style plantation
house with delicate fan lights and a pair of octagonal rooms, was
built to plans by Thomas Jefferson in 1820. Depressed because he
feared that his courtship of Mary Todd had failed, Kentucky-born
Abraham Lincoln took refuge there for six weeks with his friend
Joshua Speed, scion of the family that owned the plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, the Jefferson County Courthouse, whose pediment is
supported by monumental fluted Doric columns, was built just a
little later, from 1835 to 1860. With a grand cast-iron stairway
and balustrade inside a 68-foot rotunda, it is by Gideon Shryock, a
student of the Philadelphia architect William Strickland, who
designed the Second Bank of the United States. Shryock introduced
the Greek Revival style to the states beyond the Alleghenies.
</P>
<P>
   The county was named, of course, for Thomas Jefferson, whose
statue stands in front of the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The city, whose inhabitants call it LOO-uh-vul, all but
swallowing the final two syllables, was named for Louis XVI, the
French king who aided the colonies in their war for independence.
(The Almanac of American Politics, Michael Barone's invaluable
compendium, points out that only one other American city, St. Paul,
Minn., was named for a man who was executed.) Other place names in
Kentucky, including Bourbon County and the towns of Paris and
Versailles, also reflect the new nation's gratitude to France in
the postwar years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Whisky, Women and Horses &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But ask a native about Louisville and you are likely to hear
about things other than history and architecture. The Kentucky
writers who put together the city's entry in the Depression-era WPA
Guide said it was ``noted for fine whisky, beautiful women and the
Kentucky Derby,'' and it still is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louisville is too busy making and selling things to have the
languor of a town in the Deep South, but it does have its special
graces,'' the guide adds. ``Its people are friendly and hospitable.
Bourbon and water or a cocktail after work is popular; amusement
and relaxation are as important as work.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 60 years, three wars and several economic upheavals
later, that description rings as true as ever, down to the last
semicolon.
</P>
<P>
   The city proper has a population of only about 275,000, but its
suburbs spread into three Kentucky counties and four across the
river in Indiana. The metropolitan area has more than a million
people and a big-city feel, with Interstates and freeways circling
and bisecting it. Yet drivers gallantly yield to people in
crosswalks and cars waiting to turn left.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, this is a border city in a border state. Kentucky
stayed in the Union during the Civil War, with Kentuckians fighting
on both sides. But Louisville long ago lost its heart to the South.
Before the war, explained James Holmberg, a curator at the Filson
Club, a Louisville historical society, ``we were a Western city,
but Confederate veterans took over the city and state after the
war. Kentucky was the only state to secede after Appomattox.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Maye, a Georgian who came to Louisville by way of
Chicago, says it ``combines Southern rural charm with Northern
urban tolerance.'' It produced not only Louis Brandeis, the first
Jewish Supreme Court justice, but also Muhammad Ali, in whose honor
the city plans a 50,000-square-foot museum, and it was one of the
first cities anywhere to comply with the 1954 desegregation ruling.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Those Exciting Two Minutes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Come here during Derby Week, the seven days leading up to the
annual Run for the Roses on the first Saturday in May, or the week
before that, and the traffic might make you think you're in
Manhattan or Los Angeles, even if the nonstop Southern belles and
the lawn parties, with lethal mint juleps served in silver stirrup
cups, might remind you rather more of Biloxi or New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The city plays host to the world with costume balls, the Pegasus
Parade down Broadway, the Great Balloon Race out at the Fairgrounds
and the Great Steamboat Race on the Ohio, punctuated by calliope
toots, between the local stern-wheeler, the Belle of Louisville,
and the larger Delta Queen from New Orleans. Race day itself might
come as an anticlimax if it were not so stirring: the sentimental
strains of Stephen Foster's ``My Old Kentucky Home,'' the clang of
the starting bell and the hell-for-leather charge down the stretch,
jockeys' silks flashing, crowd cheering, steeds straining.
</P>
<P>
   It is indeed ``the most exciting two minutes in sports'' (except
in 1973, when the great Secretariat won in one minute 59 and
two-fifths seconds). It is a parimutuel money-spinner, with $8.3
million bet at the track on the 1998 Derby. It is the only horse
race most Americans pay the slightest attention to.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a hell of a party. A Kentucky judge once said of the
julep that ``he who has not tasted one has lived in vain.'' Not
many of the 130,000 or so people at the Derby in a typical year are
in danger of that.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill Downs, where the race has been run since 1875, is open
almost every day of the year. Tucked beneath the twin octagonal
Edwardian cupolas, the track's trademark, is a museum celebrating
the race, the owners, the trainers, the jockeys and the horses
themselves, from Man O' War, Whirlaway and Citation to the present.
An exciting audiovisual presentation of the most recent race is
projected onto an oval overhead screen. Or maybe you'd like to gawk
at doll houses depicting C.V. Whitney's estate near Lexington,
Maple Hill, or collect trivia like this tidbit: women used to bet
candy or gloves on the race.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville has another sporting claim to fame: it is the home of
the Hillerich &AMP; Bradsby Co., the maker of Louisville Slugger
baseball bats. Lately the company has opened a museum, identified
by a bat 120 feet tall leaning against the building. Here, too,
there is a film, featuring Johnny Bench and Tony Gwynn talking
about hitting in such a lively, understandable way that my wife,
Betsey, a non-fan, was entranced. You can watch bats being made
from ash blanks taken from 50-year-old trees in Pennsylvania and
New York, and view Sluggers used by Babe Ruth and Roger Maris (but
not Mark McGwire, who swings a Rawlings bat).

   Stockmarket investors are fond of fairy tales. Until this
summer, their favorite was Goldilocks: the American economy, they
claimed, was neither too hot, nor too cold, but just right. Their
belief in perpetual growth seemed to justify ever-rising share
prices. Pity they forgot that, in the story, Goldilocks was
eventually chased away by the bears.
</P>
<P>
   After the markets fell back in July, the favorite tales changed:
the recent talk has been of something nasty in the woodshed. But as
in all good stories, a fairy godmother has arrived in the nick of
time.
</P>
<P>
   With a flick of his magic wand, and two swift cuts in interest
rates, Alan Greenspan has saved the day. Stockmarkets have rallied;
America's economy will, after all, continue to boom.
</P>
<P>
   Or so ever-optimistic investors hope.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 13
percent from its low at the end of August, leaving it only 9
percent below its July peak. Share prices have also bounced back in
Asia and Europe. Hong Kong and Bangkok have risen by half since
August.
</P>
<P>
   As well as lower American interest rates, there have been other
bits of (apparently) good news to cheer. The Japanese parliament
has, at long last, approved a plan to make 60 trillion yen ($500
billion) available to help the ailing banking system. America's
Congress has agreed to top up the IMF's coffers by $18 billion,
which should bring in over $70 billion more from other countries
and make it easier to arrange a rescue package for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   There are glimmers of hope in East Asia, where interest rates
have fallen sharply. And a weaker dollar has eased fears about a
devaluation of the Chinese yuan. All in all, investors might
conclude, the world is no longer coming to an end -- so goodbye,
bears.
</P>
<P>
   But take off the rose-tinted spectacles and the monsters still
loom large. One bank has now said it will apply for Japan's bank
bailout, but it is unclear whether others will follow. Financial
panic may be over in East Asia, but the region's economic troubles
remain daunting. And now a credit crunch threatens in the United
States, and perhaps in Europe, as firms have found raising new
money far harder in securities markets that have all but dried up.
Even a few more quarter-point cuts would not solve these problems.
</P>
<P>
   More pertinently, American share prices remain substantially
overvalued by historic measures. Some bullish analysts have argued
that recent falls in bond yields and the expectation of further
falls in interest rates justify higher share valuations. They have
even been advising investors to put more money into shares.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the main reason that bond yields and interest rates have
come down is concern about financial turmoil and a growing risk of
recession. That points to shrinking profits -- which can hardly be
good for share prices.
</P>
<P>
   It is striking that, even as equity strategists talk up share
prices, economists, often employed in the same firms, are becoming
gloomier about world growth. Many forecasters now expect the world
economy to expand by less than 1.5 percent next year, which by past
standards counts as a recession.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that financial bubbles, unlike fairy tales, never
have happy endings. Greenspan cannot prevent a bear market with a
mere wave of his wand. From the 17th-century Dutch tulip mania
through to emerging-market madness and today's Wall Street, bubbles
always burst eventually -- and the result is always painful.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's tumble since the summer has been widely blamed on
financial troubles in emerging markets. If so, goes the argument,
brighter prospects in Asia and an IMF package to rescue Brazil
should push share prices back up where they were.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in truth, America's bubble was inflated at home. For over
two years the Fed all but ignored the explosion in share prices and
lax credit conditions. And to the extent that America's rapid
economic growth in recent years has been fuelled by a splurge of
credit and by large capital gains, both its economic and its
financial boom remain unsustainable. A sharp slowdown is
inevitable; a recession is distinctly possible.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators now seem to view Wall Street as a gauge of
whether the Fed has got things right. A rise in share prices is
taken to mean that Greenspan has understood what needs to be done
to avoid troubles ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a bad test. Central banks cannot and should not try
to prevent an overdue correction in share prices. They should only
cushion the economy from the worst consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The zeal with which Wall Street has cheered Greenspan's latest
rate cut shows that investors still miss the point: even in fairy
tales, what goes up does eventually come down.

 LOUISVILLE: Rawlings bat.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A Museum's Holdings &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Down Third Street at the far end of the neighborhood known as
Old Louisville stands the J.B. Speed Art Museum, one of the premier
cultural institutions in a city that has a lot of them for its
size.
</P>
<P>
   Recently remodeled, the Speed has a tureen by Paul Storr, a
beautiful second century A.D. Roman altar supported by two lions, a
fine early Rembrandt portrait of a woman (the mate of a male
portrait in the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif.), a set of
folding screens painted in 1911 by Everett Shinn for the interior
designer Elsie de Wolfe, and the wooden paneling of an entire
reception room, complete with spectacular carving, from a manor
house in Broadhembury, Devon, England. Dating from 1619, it was
removed when the house was pulled down, sold to William Randolph
Hearst at the peak of his collecting mania, then resold to a
Louisville patron who gave it to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Odd, the way places catch up to you: the manor house, called the
Grange, belonged to a family named Drewe. For years, Betsey and I
have been stopping for lunch at a pub in that same speck of a
village, on our way from London to visit friends in Devon. The pub
is called the Drewe Arms. Snap.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the city's best sculpture, including pieces by Calder,
Dubuffet, Tony Smith, Louise Nevelson and John Chamberlain, is
gathered in and around the Kentucky Center for the Arts, a big,
glistening glass box. Its three stages provide homes for
Louisville's resident opera, ballet and symphony orchestra, plus
touring Broadway musicals and concerts from bop to bluegrass.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisville Orchestra, which celebrated its 60th anniversary
last year, has a reputation extending well beyond the region.
Beginning in 1953, under its founding conductor, Robert Whitney, it
has recorded several hundred previously unavailable works by more
than 250 composers, including Ginastera, Ives, Villa-Lobos, Piston
and Britten. Battered like many similar groups by drastic
reductions in funds in the 1980s, the orchestra finally returned to
the black in 1996 and named a new principal conductor, the Israeli
Uriel Siegel, for this season. It opened in mid-September with
Pinchas Zuckerman as violin soloist.
</P>
<P>
   A Tony Award-winning regional theater company, the Actors
Theater, occupies a Greek Revival bank building on Main Street,
built in 1837 (and erroneously thought for a long time to have been
designed by Gideon Shryock). Each winter the Actors Theater stages
a highly regarded Festival of New American Plays.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Innovative Leaders &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The city's civic and artistic life has been blessed by a
succession of innovative and capable mayors, including Wilson
Wyatt, a founder of Americans for Democratic Action; Harvey Sloane,
and the present incumbent, Jerry Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Louisville's cultural life was underwritten for years by
the Bingham family, as was the Falls Fountain, built in 1988. Best
seen from the Riverfront Belvedere or the Riverwalk, it spews water
to a height of 375 feet from the midst of the Ohio River. In
theory, it forms a fleur-de-lis, the city's official symbol, but to
be honest, you'd have to have a Rorshachian imagination to see much
of anything except a lot of splashing water.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Worth Bingham bought The Louisville Courier-Journal in
1917 from Henry Watterson, one of the greatest of 19th-century
American editors. In 1933, he went to London to serve as U.S.
ambassador, and his son, Barry, took over the paper. Barry Bingham
and his wife, Mary, rapidly became a dominant force in Louisville
political, cultural and philanthropic circles; he and Wilson Wyatt,
boyhood chums, worked in close partnership.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bingham children squabbled over their inheritance, and
the paper was sold in 1986. It has lost much of its zest under its
less open-handed new owner, the Gannett chain, and many Louisville
charities have felt the loss of the Binghams' leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Happily for the city, however, others have stepped in, notably
the family of David Jones, founder of Humana Inc., the health-care
company. Humana's headquarters, a salmon-pink skyscraper, is one of
Louisville's most distinctive buildings; its entrance is flanked by
Busby Berkeley waterfalls refashioned in Michael Graves'
post-modern idiom. Almost next door stands the American office of
the Aegon Insurance Group, a good-looking 1992 tower by John Burgee
and Philip Johnson whose openwork cap has led irreverent locals to
christen it ``the Ban roll-on building.'' The two contrast sharply
with other contemporary structures downtown, a thoroughly mediocre
group. Worst are the Waterfront Plaza Towers, with gaudy
scarlet-and-white ``lighthouses'' on their roofs.
</P>
<P>
   The waterfront itself has been redeveloped to great effect,
making it possible to walk for miles along the Ohio. You can also
follow the river upstream along River Road to some of Louisville's
prettiest suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fried Chicken and Bourbon  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Humana and other companies in its field are among Louisville's
biggest employers; there are no fewer than 15 hospitals in the
city. The city is also the global hub for United Parcel Service,
which provides 14,500 local jobs, more than any other single
company. General Electric makes appliances here, Philip Morris and
Brown &AMP; Williamson make tobacco products and Brown Forman and
United Distillers make bourbon. Tricon Global, the new corporate
tent for Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut, has its
headquarters here, too.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to experience the definitive Kentucky fried
chicken , and explore the bourbon belt, the best thing is to head
south to Bardstown, one of the state's oldest communities. It was
founded in 1775, the year of Paul Revere's ride in far-off
Massachusetts, and its streets are lined with 18th- and early
19th-century houses. More to the point, it has Kurtz's, where
Marilyn (Toogie) Dick serves her glorious fried chicken to hordes
of hungry people each weekend, some of whom come all the way from
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Suitably fortified, you can use Bardstown as a base to learn
more about bourbon, the corn-based whisky that made Kentucky famous
(along with Daniel Boone and racehorses). This is the state, it has
been said, ``where the corn is full of kernels and the colonels are
full of corn.'' So visit the Oscar Getz Museum of Whiskey History
in Bardstown to soak up distilling lore.
</P>
<P>
   Then move on to Maker's Mark in Loretto, a charming old
distillery. Its whisky is much loved by Kentuckians, for its red
wax seal and its distinctively mellow flavor. That results in part
from using winter wheat, instead of rye, along with corn and malted
barley. Near Versailles is Labrot &AMP; Graham, perhaps the most
picturesque of the distilleries; Woodford Reserve, the company's
small-batch bourbon, has the savor of a French Armagnac, with a
typical ``hot'' finish.
</P>
<P>
   If you have more time, spend a morning in the more abstemious
atmosphere of the restored Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill, near
Harrodsburg. The triumph of the place is not the 33 brick, frame
and stone buildings, or the clever, handsome furniture or even the
wonderful twin spiral staircases at the Trustees' House. The
triumph is the sense of serenity _ or is it spirituality? _ that
visitors feel, far from the roar of the interstate and the clamor
of the city, surrounded by ponds and meadows where sheep may safely
graze.

   &UR; From a Shaker Village To Whisky and Racetracks &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Here is information about visiting Louisville, Ky.: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   THE CAMBERLEY BROWN, 335 West Broadway, (502) 583-1234. Echoes
of Derby frolics past resound through the magnificent marble halls
of the 75-year-old Brown, Louisville's old-money hotel. Ornate
chandeliers, collections of equine paintings and sculptures and a
registration desk concealed behind gilded screens enrich the lobby.
Guest rooms, some a trifle small, are nicely appointed. Double
room: $189; special rates may be available.
</P>
<P>
   SEELBACH HILTON, 500 Fourth St., (502) 585-3200. Opened in 1905,
the Seelbach served as a model for a scene in ``The Great Gatsby.''
It was restored in the early 1980's, but some rooms and bathrooms
have grown shabby since; another facelift is needed and planned
soon, to the tune of $3.2 million. The lobby, with murals
illustrating Kentucky history, begs for better lighting. Double
rooms: $159 to $209; based on availability, special rates of $99 on
weekends and $129 on weekdays, including Continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   HYATT REGENCY, 320 West Jefferson St., (502) 587-3434, offers
the usual amenities of the chain hotels, but it, too, is starting
to look a little tired. Nonetheless, the Hyatt's downtown location
is convenient, and the tennis court, indoor pool and 18-story
atrium are strong selling points. A revolving rooftop restaurant
overlooks the river, if you like that sort of thing. Double rooms:
$99 to $120 on weekends; $169 to $210 on weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   OLD LOUISVILLE INN, 1359 South Third St., (502) 635-1574. Third
Street is lined with Gilded Age houses of every description from
Richardsonian Romanesque to Eastlake Victorian, many of them
carefully restored. One such is the Old Louisville Inn, a well-run,
10-room bed-and-breakfast with 12-foot ceilings, which was built in
1901 as the baronial residence of a telephone tycoon. Double rooms:
$95 to $135.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   CLUB GROTTO, 2116 Bardstown Rd., (502) 459-5275. Big Jim
McKinney says he knows 90 percent of the customers who visit his
animated, red-walled, low-ceilinged bistro. The menu reflects an
aversion to shortcuts: mozzarella is made in the house, barbecued
shrimp are served in a sauce based on lobster stock. Try
cornmeal-breaded fried walleye or the 11-vegetable ``orgy.''
</P>
<P>
   J. GRAHAM'S CAFE, in the Camberley Brown (see above), is a
glorified coffee shop that serves an authentic Hot Brown sandwich,
an old Louisville favorite invented at the hotel. Toast triangles
in an ovenproof dish are covered with shaved turkey breast, Mornay
sauce, smoky Kentucky bacon, Parmesan and tomato wedges and
finished under the broiler. Result: a cheese dream with a Ph.D.
Open for breakfast and lunch only: Mondays through Saturdays, 6:30
a.m. to 3 p.m.; Sundays, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   KURTZ'S, 418 East Stephen Foster Avenue, Bardstown, (502)
348-8964. Don't look for furbelows in this old stone house. Kurtz's
has been there since 1937, serving chewy, salty Kentucky ham;
crisp, greaseless chicken fried in deep cast-iron skillets;
blini-shaped fried cornbread, soufflelike corn pudding,
home-pickled beets and mashed potatoes better than your
grandmother's. Oh, my.
</P>
<P>
   LILLY'S, 1147 Bardstown Rd., (502) 451-0447. Lilly's served us
the best meal of a recent visit to Louisville. ``God bless our
local farmers!'' the menu said; I understood why after eating a
stack of phyllo rounds and ripe tomato slices topped with warm goat
cheese. Even better: juicy roast pork tenderloin with a spicy
red-brown sauce, gossamer cornbread and wasabi slaw.
</P>
<P>
   LYNN'S PARADISE CAFE, 984 Barret Avenue, (502) 583-3447. Who
needs a barrel of monkeys? Nothing could be more fun than Lynn
Winter's place, with an eight-foot-tall coffee pot out front,
corncob murals and a zany array of hideous lamps. Four thousand
people a week come for gotta-try-'em grits or French toast at
breakfast, meatloaf at lunch and Lynn's warming smile all day long.
</P>
<P>
   THE OAKROOM, in the Seelbach Hilton (see above), features
Kentucky products, from smoked spoonfish and Newsom's hams to
mangolike papaws, gathered by foragers in Appalachia. The gifted
chef, Jim Gerhardt, also marinates pork, the local meat of choice,
in bourbon and molasses and pairs it with a fruit compote. Fine
wines and cheeses are chosen by Adam Seger, the maitre d'hotel.
Open daily 5:30 to 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   VINCE STATEN'S, 9219 U.S. Highway 42, Prospect, (502) 228-7427.
A co-author of the standard guide to the nation's barbecue
restaurants, Vince Staten runs a joint of his own in the suburbs.
The decor is plastic, but not the food. Ribs and pulled pork
sandwiches are succulent, as are the beans and coleslaw; Staten's
offers six sauces, culminating in Legal Limit hot. Attractions
</P>
<P>
   LOCUST GROVE, 561 Blankenbaker Lane, (502) 897-9845. A 1790
Georgian mansion on 55 acres six miles up river from downtown,
restored and furnished to its original appearance. Hours: Mondays

elderly; $2 for children 6 to 12; children 5 and under free.
</P>

after a plan designed by Thomas Jefferson and furnished with
19th-century pieces. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to

Central Avenue, (800) 273-3729. The three-floor museum has
exhibitions, racing artifacts and memorabilia about thoroughbred
racing and the Kentucky Derby. Off-season, a walking tour of the
racetrack takes visitors to the paddock, under the grandstand via
the same tunnel the horses use, and to trackside to see the finish
line, the winners circle and the famous twin spires. Weather
permitting, 30-minute tours are given hourly, with the first at
9:45 a.m. and the last at 3:45 p.m. Admission: $6; $5 for ages 55

</P>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE SLUGGER MUSEUM, 800 West Main St., (502) 588-7228.
Look for what may be the world's tallest bat perched outside the
door. After a short film, visitors walk through the full-size
dugout and onto the museum's playing field. There are exhibitions,
interactive displays (the sensation of a 90 m.p.h. pitch coming at
you), baseball equipment and memorabilia. ``Baseball's

AT THE MOVIES: COLD WAR MOOSE ON THE LOOSE; NEFARIOUSNESS WITH A
TWIST; A LEAP FOR TOMLIN  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The Cold War produced plenty of victims, but the
ending of the Cold War has had its victims, too. The
military-industrial complex is a shadow of its former size, the
backyard bomb-shelter business has died, and Rocky and Bullwinkle
have become forgotten heroes without a Boris Badenov or Natasha
Fatale to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Or so we thought. Evil has a way of adapting itself to every
generation, and Boris and Natasha and their fearless leader,
Fearless Leader, have emerged from the '60s and reinvented
themselves as villains for the millennium; now they have a scheme
to take over the world by taking over television. Only a flying
squirrel and a 7-foot-tall moose can stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Studios and TriBeCa Pictures, Robert De Niro's film
company, are preparing to make a big-budget movie based on the old
Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon show, with filming set to begin in
January. The director will be Des McAnuff, who won a Tony in 1993
for directing on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The movie intends to be more than just another retread for
nostalgic baby boomers. Like the original show, noteworthy for its
mocking, satirical edge and wordplay, the picture will be
self-mocking with an edge of tart political satire as it takes on
the media in the latter years of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole premise is, `Gee, the world has changed,''' said
Jane Rosenthal, the movie's producer. ``They sort of drop in and
the Cold War is over and they wonder what evil spies do now. Well,
they seek world domination through TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie will be shot in live action, with only Rocky and
Bullwinkle done in an old-fashioned cartoon style. None of the
casting has been formalized, but De Niro is expected to play the
Fearless Leader.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Snider, president of production at Universal Pictures,
said that as part of the plot the two cartoon characters,
subsisting on tiny syndication checks from the show's diminishing
reruns, contemplate making a Rocky and Bullwinkle movie. They go to
a studio executive, Mini Mogul, to pitch their idea. Her boss
rejects the notion, insisting he does not do moose movies. And Jim
Carrey rejects the lead role because he does not want to walk
around in a heavy, hot moose suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We admit throughout that we're in a movie,'' McAnuff said.
``And we'll have that narrator's voice coming in explaining things.
It's like breaking through the fourth wall of the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The duo find redemption by frustrating the plot of Boris and
Natasha, but only after a string of misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of parachute these Cold War icons into our own day and
age, and what it does is remind us how cynical we've become,''
McAnuff said. ``They bring a kind of clarity to the age of
information through their bumbling. This great big stupid moose
comes up with these gems of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It gets farcical and there's lots of satire, but the
art is to not overdo it. It's like extracting the essence of
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad Guys Who Are Hip
</P>
<P>
   You know that cool guy, the insouciant character who rejects the
establishment, as demonstrated by his yellow-tinted glasses and
unkempt short hair dyed dark red or defiantly spiky hair pushed
straight up. Now imagine that that guy is working for the
government and out to destroy you, using every bit of computer
technology that exists.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the post-Cold War nightmare of Tony Scott. The new
thriller he has directed, ``Enemy of the State,'' due out on Nov.
20, is a relatively standard film of paranoia about a battle of the
little man against overwhelming forces. But there is a twist. In
this bleak view, the hipsters we learned to trust because they
fought the accepted order and pushed creativity ahead of conformity
are now the ones tracking the individualists down, ruthlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's view is not too bleak because the good guys _ one,
played by Will Smith, in a Brooks Brothers suit, and the other,
Gene Hackman, a nondescript everyman in a flannel shirt and
horn-rimmed glasses _ win. But, the movie asks, what kind of
victory is it?
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Smith is a Washington labor lawyer fighting with
some mobsters when a chance encounter with an old classmate turns
his life upside down and he suddenly finds himself struggling
against the awesome resources of the National Security Agency. The
mastermind of the plot against him is a rogue spymaster, played by
Jon Voight, made up as a carbon copy of former Defense Secretary
Robert McNamara. The malevolent force behind all this intrigue is
the telecommunications industry. The old communists look like
pushovers by contrast.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said the point of the movie, which cost roughly $85
million, was to reverse expectations by making the characters
usually presented as nefarious government geeks into hipsters
rather than warped super-patriots. The conservative characters with
the brush cuts are now the good guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was more spooky that way,'' Scott said. ``The
world's changed. The tables have turned. That's what I was aiming
to show here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scott said the movie is not off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make a commitment to a film until I check it out, and
I was able to toy around at the CIA and NSA,'' he said. ``I was
amazed. It was like the campus of UCLA. They were all kids and they
looked like these guys in the movies, sitting with their laptop
computers. I took a leaf out of the reality book when I made it
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   The young agents are meant to be particularly intimidating to
aging baby boomers, Scott said. But he said that at age 54, he does
not regard members of Generation X as rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm around kids like that all the time, but I'm a leech,''
said Scott, who has legions of young people working for him at his
commercial film company. ``I steal from them all the time. I steal
their ideas. I steal their energy. I respect those guys. But a
little fear is probably not a bad thing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Much of the outside world's preoccupation with China in recent
years has been with that country's strengths: would a rich China be
a threatening one, could such a China be absorbed comfortably in
regional and global institutions, how much money might be made from
selling goods to a billion richer Chinese, how many jobs lost to
imports from that same productive billion?
</P>
<P>
   It is time, however, for the focus to shift. The most important
question today is not how strong China might become but rather how
weak it now is. The danger of an economic collapse is growing. Such
a collapse would hurt Asia directly, and would damage the rest of
the world too.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest potential danger, however, is of economic trouble
leading to political chaos. If that transpires, all bets would be
off.
</P>
<P>
   Will it? Officially, China is destined to enjoy economic growth
of 8 percent both this year and next, and the government tells
anyone and everyone that it will hit that target, come what may.
Against signs of slowdown, it has launched a big program of public
spending on infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   China's economic leaders are determined and impressive people,
popular on the international circuit for their frank talk, their
willingness to hand their e-mail addresses to anyone with a
complaint, and, most particularly, for their promises not to
devalue the Chinese yuan or the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the stalwart Chinese worker: having at last
achieved a higher standard of living in the 1980s and 1990s after
30 disastrous and painful years, surely he is not going to take to
the streets at the first sign of economic trouble?
</P>
<P>
   To try to assess the situation in China, and to understand its
wider importance, it is as well to begin there: with the stalwart
Chinese worker. The past two decades certainly have brought new
opportunities, new freedoms and new wealth to many urban Chinese,
at least in the coastal region. It is also true that in other
countries, most notably Russia, predictions of popular unrest have
frequently proved wide of the mark, as ordinary people showed
themselves reluctant to take to the streets despite severe
hardships.
</P>
<P>
   The same could well prove true in China. But one group that is
far from confident about this is the Chinese leadership itself. On
the face of it, what China most needed in 1997-99 was an economic
pause. After the helter-skelter growth of the previous five years,
when property booms and speculation were rife and structural
reforms of state-owned enterprises and dodgy banks were rare, the
emphasis needed to shift to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, President Jiang Zemin made such reform his slogan;
so, last March, did his new premier, Zhu Rongji. Such reform must
by its nature be painful, since it involves closures, mergers,
privatization, unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, President Jiang and Premier Zhu lost their nerve, and
reform has been postponed. Slow growth and large-scale unemployment
was a risk they felt unable to take. They, at least, do not believe
the Chinese worker is as stalwart as all that. Their belief, it
seems, is that slow growth would be disastrous, both for China and
for their own jobs.
</P>
<P>
   No one can be sure in advance, but their worries could well be
justified. The legacy of 50 years of communism is that the party
has no intellectual or moral hold on its people, just a material
and a nationalistic one. Prosperity is its chief source of
legitimacy; once that is endangered, there is only nationalism to
fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, after three years of more open political discourse,
the party's rhetoric reverted to its old form, with calls to rally
against national threats from floods and from the Asian financial
crisis. The 8 percent target is the rallying point.
</P>
<P>
   So will it be achieved? It looks highly unlikely. Official
statistics are becoming more and more dubious, but even on the
basis of official growth of 7.2 percent in the first nine months of
the year, an annualized rate of 10.4 percent needs to be achieved
in the next three months if the target is to be met.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, exports are sagging, deflation is taking hold and
unsold inventories are ballooning. Despite the counterblast from
public works spending, an annualized rate of 5 percent or so looks
more plausible.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects next year look just as tough: the debate about the
outside world is whether it will get a bit bleaker or a lot
bleaker, so either way exports will again be under pressure.
Foreign firms have been cutting their new investment plans, while
foreign banks, worried about the recent closure of the Guangdong
International Trust &AMP; Investment Corporation, with debts of $2.4
billion, are cutting their lending.
</P>
<P>
   Although China has more of a domestic debt problem than an
international one, its foreign debts are larger than they appear
and official worry about this foreign exposure is now a powerful
argument against devaluing the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   Against this, it can be argued that China has a bright future
ahead of it. With entrepreneurial vigor of the Chinese sort, every
problem in the Chinese economy can plausibly be redefined as an
opportunity. Every bust, inefficient, polluting state enterprise is
a potential efficiency gain if it could only be managed by
different hands. Every sign of the wasteful allocation of capital
in the state-run financial system is evidence of how well things
would proceed if only capital was allocated more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   If it has grown this fast while being run badly, think how well
China could do if it were run better.
</P>
<P>
   The question, though, is how to get from here to there. That is
what is dogging the Chinese leadership, and it should worry
outsiders, too. Long-term growth will require privatization of the
state enterprises and banks; a freer flow of labor through the
abolition of the household registration system; the legalization of
private property; and more.
</P>
<P>
   Such moves will involve economic and social pain. There will
anyway soon be 18 million to 20 million unemployed. Meanwhile,
falling fertility and the one-child policy mean that China is
greying rapidly, with a babyless baby-boom generation fearing for
its future.
</P>
<P>
   The well of actual and potential resentment is deep. Hence the
leadership's reluctance to risk (or admit to) slow growth, or to
take the political decisions necessary to move to a brighter
future.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, worries about China have focused on the will-they,
won't-they question of devaluation, accompanied by fears that this
would trigger a new financial panic in East Asia. Yet this is to
miss the point. The real issues are whether China's growth is
slowing or even grinding to a halt; whether the resulting
unemployment will prompt political unrest, or a power struggle
among the leadership; and then whether that will send China in a

 HOLLYWOOD: bad thing.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Nurturing Tomlin
</P>
<P>
   Lily Tomlin has proved her versatility many times over, with
everything from a well-received one-woman show on Broadway to movie
roles like the recent part of an aging producer of LSD in
``Flirting With Disaster,'' and characters like her famed telephone
operator from her television days. But making the leap to play an
American lesbian archeologist in Italy during World War II was
something new.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Tea With Mussolini,'' which will open in late November, Ms.
Tomlin takes on an unusual dramatic role that not only gave her a
chance to try something different, but also took her to Italy for
three months and put her in company that, she said, left her awed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini,'' directed by Franco Zeffirelli, is based
on a chapter in his autobiography that tells the story of his
boyhood. Zeffirelli was illegitimate, and his father took little
responsibility for his upbringing. After his mother died, he was
taken under the wing of a group of odd English women in Florence,
who cared for him during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The women are played by some of the grande dames of the British
theater _ Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench. But
Zeffirelli added two characters for the film.
</P>
<P>
   Cher plays Elsa, an amorous American art dealer who is part of
their circle, and Ms. Tomlin is Georgie, the archeologist, who is
aggressive and protective of this unlikely band of eccentrics who
are struggling to get by as the clouds of war gather. Georgie
teaches the Zeffirelli boy, Luca in the film, to play soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The British women embrace the idea that Mussolini is not such a
bad dictator until Elsa, who is exposed as a Jew, is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about the part, it was actually pretty
negligible, but I just didn't want to pass this up,'' Ms. Tomlin
said from Los Angeles, where she was filming an episode of one of
her favorite television shows, ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, she added: ``Franco rewrote it. Making this was
hilarious, scary, exhilarating, insecure-making. It was everything.
Frustrating. I felt like a bobby-soxer around these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tomlin said that half the fun was swapping stories and
hanging out with the distinguished cast in between takes, but that
the work could get intense because of Zeffirelli's famous
perfectionism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Franco is completely, um, unique,'' she said, fighting for the
diplomatic phrase. ``He's inspiring. He's spoiled. He's
infuriating. He's endearing, all in one day. You would see him do
the most impassioned things.''
</P>
<P>
   Some modifications had to be made for Ms. Tomlin's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one scene she has to swing up these big suitcases,'' Ms.
Tomlin recalled, ``and I just said, `I can't do that physically.'
We had to change it a bit, but she still came through, even with
all those great ladies around. What a trip.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Much of the outside world's preoccupation with China in recent
years has been with that country's strengths: would a rich China be
a threatening one, could such a China be absorbed comfortably in
regional and global institutions, how much money might be made from
selling goods to a billion richer Chinese, how many jobs lost to
imports from that same productive billion?
</P>
<P>
   It is time, however, for the focus to shift. The most important
question today is not how strong China might become but rather how
weak it now is. The danger of an economic collapse is growing. Such
a collapse would hurt Asia directly, and would damage the rest of
the world too.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest potential danger, however, is of economic trouble
leading to political chaos. If that transpires, all bets would be
off.
</P>
<P>
   Will it? Officially, China is destined to enjoy economic growth
of 8 percent both this year and next, and the government tells
anyone and everyone that it will hit that target, come what may.
Against signs of slowdown, it has launched a big program of public
spending on infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   China's economic leaders are determined and impressive people,
popular on the international circuit for their frank talk, their
willingness to hand their e-mail addresses to anyone with a
complaint, and, most particularly, for their promises not to
devalue the Chinese yuan or the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the stalwart Chinese worker: having at last
achieved a higher standard of living in the 1980s and 1990s after
30 disastrous and painful years, surely he is not going to take to
the streets at the first sign of economic trouble?
</P>
<P>
   To try to assess the situation in China, and to understand its
wider importance, it is as well to begin there: with the stalwart
Chinese worker. The past two decades certainly have brought new
opportunities, new freedoms and new wealth to many urban Chinese,
at least in the coastal region. It is also true that in other
countries, most notably Russia, predictions of popular unrest have
frequently proved wide of the mark, as ordinary people showed
themselves reluctant to take to the streets despite severe
hardships.
</P>
<P>
   The same could well prove true in China. But one group that is
far from confident about this is the Chinese leadership itself. On
the face of it, what China most needed in 1997-99 was an economic
pause. After the helter-skelter growth of the previous five years,
when property booms and speculation were rife and structural
reforms of state-owned enterprises and dodgy banks were rare, the
emphasis needed to shift to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, President Jiang Zemin made such reform his slogan;
so, last March, did his new premier, Zhu Rongji. Such reform must
by its nature be painful, since it involves closures, mergers,
privatization, unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, President Jiang and Premier Zhu lost their nerve, and
reform has been postponed. Slow growth and large-scale unemployment
was a risk they felt unable to take. They, at least, do not believe
the Chinese worker is as stalwart as all that. Their belief, it
seems, is that slow growth would be disastrous, both for China and
for their own jobs.
</P>
<P>
   No one can be sure in advance, but their worries could well be
justified. The legacy of 50 years of communism is that the party
has no intellectual or moral hold on its people, just a material
and a nationalistic one. Prosperity is its chief source of
legitimacy; once that is endangered, there is only nationalism to
fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, after three years of more open political discourse,
the party's rhetoric reverted to its old form, with calls to rally
against national threats from floods and from the Asian financial
crisis. The 8 percent target is the rallying point.
</P>
<P>
   So will it be achieved? It looks highly unlikely. Official
statistics are becoming more and more dubious, but even on the
basis of official growth of 7.2 percent in the first nine months of
the year, an annualized rate of 10.4 percent needs to be achieved
in the next three months if the target is to be met.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, exports are sagging, deflation is taking hold and
unsold inventories are ballooning. Despite the counterblast from
public works spending, an annualized rate of 5 percent or so looks
more plausible.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects next year look just as tough: the debate about the
outside world is whether it will get a bit bleaker or a lot
bleaker, so either way exports will again be under pressure.
Foreign firms have been cutting their new investment plans, while
foreign banks, worried about the recent closure of the Guangdong
International Trust &AMP; Investment Corporation, with debts of $2.4
billion, are cutting their lending.
</P>
<P>
   Although China has more of a domestic debt problem than an
international one, its foreign debts are larger than they appear
and official worry about this foreign exposure is now a powerful
argument against devaluing the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   Against this, it can be argued that China has a bright future
ahead of it. With entrepreneurial vigor of the Chinese sort, every
problem in the Chinese economy can plausibly be redefined as an
opportunity. Every bust, inefficient, polluting state enterprise is
a potential efficiency gain if it could only be managed by
different hands. Every sign of the wasteful allocation of capital
in the state-run financial system is evidence of how well things
would proceed if only capital was allocated more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   If it has grown this fast while being run badly, think how well
China could do if it were run better.
</P>
<P>
   The question, though, is how to get from here to there. That is
what is dogging the Chinese leadership, and it should worry
outsiders, too. Long-term growth will require privatization of the
state enterprises and banks; a freer flow of labor through the
abolition of the household registration system; the legalization of
private property; and more.
</P>
<P>
   Such moves will involve economic and social pain. There will
anyway soon be 18 million to 20 million unemployed. Meanwhile,
falling fertility and the one-child policy mean that China is
greying rapidly, with a babyless baby-boom generation fearing for
its future.
</P>
<P>
   The well of actual and potential resentment is deep. Hence the
leadership's reluctance to risk (or admit to) slow growth, or to
take the political decisions necessary to move to a brighter
future.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, worries about China have focused on the will-they,
won't-they question of devaluation, accompanied by fears that this
would trigger a new financial panic in East Asia. Yet this is to
miss the point. The real issues are whether China's growth is
slowing or even grinding to a halt; whether the resulting
unemployment will prompt political unrest, or a power struggle
among the leadership; and then whether that will send China in a
disturbingly nationalistic direction.
</P>
<P>
   The right bets, on current evidence? Yes, yes and probably.

   WYE MILLS, Md. _ U.S. officials have used dogs to sniff out
drugs, hunt down bombs and hold would-be attackers at bay.
</P>
<P>
   But can man's best friend help make peace?
</P>
<P>
   The answer's a bit fuzzy, but here's a tail that's on point.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton journeyed to the sprawling Wye River
Conference Center earlier this week to try to press forward the
Israeli-Palestinian peace summit, he took a break with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Strolling around a nearby
farm, they came upon a litter of young golden retrievers for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the president and his top diplomat, it turns out, could
resist puppies. And so, before returning to the tough business of
bargaining for peace with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, they toyed with the
retrievers for some time.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Clinton an idea.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Wye on Thursday to try to hammer eight days
of talks to a conclusion, Clinton brought along Buddy, his year-old
Chocolate Labrador.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Clinton and the First Dog disembarked from the
presidential helicopter, Marine One, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart told reporters that Buddy had ''met'' one of the Middle
East leaders. In the spirit of fairness, he declined to reveal
which one -- clearly not wanting to risk tipping the balance of
access at a critical moment in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Buddy brought to the talks, all Lockhart could say
was a ''canine perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight inconclusive days here, that might have been about
the only point of view not yet fully aired.

FOR THIS CLOWN PRINCE, ART HERE, ART THERE, ART EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes, these days, it can be awfully hard to
distinguish a work of art from the objects that stray into the rest
of life. Artists like it that way. They have been trying to widen
the boundaries of art land since the second decade of this century
and began really strenuously hacking at the borders in the 1960s.
The ultimate grand, inclusive, generous gesture made by the French
artist Ben Vautier was the declaration that ``Everything is art,''
which rather mitigated the importance of distinctions. (On the
other hand, maybe this was the ultimate cop-out.)
</P>
<P>
   Ben, as he usually styles himself, is appearing in three shows
in New York: ``Ben Vautier: Statements with Clocks,'' at the John
Gibson Gallery in SoHo; with one large piece, ``Gallery One,'' in
``Premises: Invested Spaces'' at the Guggenheim Museum SoHo; and
``Ben Vautier: Photo Rejects,'' at the Zabriskie Gallery on East
57th Street. Lots of Ben: joy to the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Ben's manifesto of total inclusion perfectly
suited the Fluxus group, who believed that art and life should
cohabit whether legally married or not. The utopian idea that art
was everywhere, for everyone, that indeed everyone was an artist
and everything art, certainly changed the course of art making. It
also stirred a certain sense of puzzlement in the hinterlands and
prompted the creation of an entire literature in an arcane language
called artspeak. As for photography, it made answering that
persistent question ``But is it art?'' a whole lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nicest aspects of the notion that anything could be
art was that some of its adherents (more so in the early days)
considered it a license to have a good time and chaff just about
anything they could think of, especially the holy writs of art.
George Maciunas, who thought up the name Fluxus, once pronounced
the movement ``the fusion of Spike Jones, vaudeville, gag,
children's games and Duchamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Vautier is one of the devoted, amusing, thoughtful and silly
members of the old Fluxus group. His show at the John Gibson
Gallery is a glancing discourse on time, consisting of various
clocks and brief apercus that he wrote beneath them on a recent
trip when he whizzed into the gallery. The show has moments of
sweet appeal and off-balance wisdom like ``Time is too short to
spend it on your knees,'' or, in Ben's typically unpunctuated,
run-on, ardently ambiguous prose, ``to stop time suicide.'' But
he's not La Rochefoucauld, and the charm here is a little slight at
times.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim's ``Gallery One'' is a re-creation in the spirit
of ``Ben's Window,'' a store window that he lived in publicly for
15 days in London in 1962. Ben and his life were the display. Ben
and his life were art. On a table in the window at the Guggenheim,
a small frame that might be expected to hold his wife's or
daughter's photograph or perhaps a mirror says, ``Don't look at
me,'' highlighting the private-public nature of this art and the
observer's precarious position between an invitation to voyeurism
and Mum's preachments about not staring. Ben wrote on the window
and furniture, too, things like ``beauty is awful'' and the
portentous ``everything is art.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, he took his personal theater into the street as
part of the effort to bring art to everyone. In France, he sat on a
chair on a busy street with a sign that, in translation, said
``Look at me that suffices I am art,'' sat at a table outside a
gallery with a sign that announced ``I sign other people's
paintings'' and was actively engaged in signing things that had not
previously been considered art, like dirty water, plants, the pope,
God, death, the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these little happenings can be seen on tapes at the
Zabriskie Gallery, where the Fluxus spirit reigns again. For
example, Ben takes a razor to a self-portrait that he has slathered
with shaving cream, et voila! The portrait comes out cleanshaven.
Ben has plastered the walls up to the ceiling with photographs and
deadpan philosophical questions (making some things a bit hard to
see) and has thrown himself a gleeful party with, and at the
expense of, photography. Any visitor whose mouth hasn't been sewn
shut will be summarily forced to smile.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ben's photographs are often pretty dumb, poorly exposed, even
tattered; your photographs are probably more presentable. He was in
the gallery a few hours before the opening, cobbling together a new
piece with artistic items he had brought from France: a plastic leg
and a reproduction of a painting of Martin Luther that he arranged
as if the great reformer were staring at a female nude. ``I am not
a good photographer,'' he confidently announced. That's fair. No
one will ever confuse Ben with Ansel Adams.
</P>
<P>
   But whether in English or French, he poses more philosophical
questions about the medium than Adams had time for, in a dry and
even ridiculously naive manner, as if he were explaining Roland
Barthes on ``Sesame Street.'' Under a pair of so-so pictures of
Nice covered with snow, he wrote, ``Snow is exceptional in Nice so
this is an exceptional photo,'' raising the issue of the importance
of subject matter in photography. Under two Polaroids that are
nothing but blank color, he writes ``2 polaroids failed or
successful?,'' in effect asking what makes a photograph a work of
art.
</P>
<P>
   In a group of photographs of himself, his face is hidden by
signs saying things like ``No copyright for this photo'' (clearly
not a unique work of art); ``blind photo'' (Ben and the photograph
itself are incapable of ``seeing''); and ``Forget that this is a
photo'' (because you might think differently about it if you cast
off preconceptions _ or whatever; you are after all free to
interpret these pronouncements any way you choose).
</P>
<P>
   Long before the computer got into the art act, some artists
wanted the audience to interact with works of art. One of the walls
full of photographs at Zabriskie is a partial re-creation of a
piece Ben did in France. There it included a bathtub and a bed that
visitors could pose in or on for Polaroids they took and then
tacked onto the wall along with Ben's.
</P>
<P>
   The piece also had ``a lot of decor,'' as the artist put it, and
a transvestite who was there ``animating the place.'' Another piece
at the Zabriskie show, called ``Taking the Family Out to See a
Photo Show,'' consists of an old picture of a wedding lying atop a
flat wheeled cart that is meant to be taken for a walk on a leash.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. It's alternately zany, canny, dumb, wise. There
are lots of lessons to be learned here, but not to worry: if this
were a textbook, it would have been written by Groucho Marx. As it
is, photography will probably never be the same. But then, it never
is. Already.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben Vautier: Statements with Clocks'' is at the John Gibson
Gallery, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, through Nov. 14.
``Gallery One'' is at the Guggenheim Museum SoHo, 575 Broadway, at
Prince Street, through Jan. 10. ``Ben Vautier: Photo Rejects'' is
at the Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, Manhattan, through
Dec. 5.

INSIDE ART: SAATCHI SELLS, AND STUDENTS BENEFIT; SHIRTS SPEAK; PINK

<P>
   It has been a few years since Charles Saatchi surfaced as a
seller at an auction. But this week, Christie's in London announced
that Saatchi, the advertising magnate who is also one of Britain's
biggest contemporary-art collectors, would be selling 130 works by
97 artists, together valued at $1.6 million, on Dec. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeds will be used, in part, to set up a scholarship
program to help pay for students' projects and commissions at four
London art schools: Chelsea, Goldsmiths', the Royal College and the
Slade. The money will also help finance the projects of young
British artists who have left college. Members of this older group
will show their work at Saatchi's London gallery on Boundary Road
in the East End.

   Works being sold are by leading exponents of what contemporary
art lovers call the YBAs, or Young British Artists. They include
Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread and Jenny Saville. Also for sale
will be art by contemporary Americans like Cindy Sherman, Charles
Long, Sean Landers and Kiki Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's estimates that the works will sell for $1,600 to
$160,000 each. They will be on view from Dec. 1 through 7 at the
Clerkenwell Warehouse, in the London financial district.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Saatchi has bought and sold the work of young
artists in bulk, causing the prices of other works by these artists
to rise quickly when he was buying, and to fall as quickly when he
was selling. As a master of advertising, he has also helped
heighten the public's awareness of many of the artists.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he lent 120 works by young British artists for
``Sensation,'' a show last year at the Royal Academy in London. (On
Sept. 30, ``Sensation'' opened at the Hamburger Bahnof in Berlin,
where it will be until Jan. 17. The Brooklyn Museum of Art, in New
York, has been having discussions with Saatchi's representatives
about getting the show across the Atlantic, though museum officials
declined to comment on this.)
</P>
<P>
   Experts at Christie's were quick to say that Saatchi was not
dumping art on the market because he was tired of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult for Saatchi to decide what to sell, because
these artists are still heavily represented in his collection,''
said Graham Southern, who heads Christie's contemporary-art
department in London. ``They are all artists whose work he is still
buying.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Saatchi was one of Sotheby's biggest
sellers, sending scores of major works by artists like Malcolm
Morley, Robert Rauschenberg and Jackson Pollock to New York for
sale. But Christie's has been aggressively trying to get the
business. In fact, Christie's was the major sponsor of
``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, we didn't know there would be a direct
connection,'' Southern said. ``But anybody involved in the
contemporary art world is interested in Saatchi.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern did not seem concerned by the poor results of a
Christie's sale earlier this month that featured some of the same
artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a financial thing,'' he said. ``We hit the worst six
hours in the market. But it's gotten a lot better since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirts Speak
</P>
<P>
   His paintings may be abstract, but Sean Scully's political
opinions are clear. This week, every U.S. senator and
representative received a white T-shirt that reads ``Starr
McCarthy'' in a black box, and underneath in red, ``Two Great
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make an image with words that would help Kenneth
Starr have the right place in history,'' said Scully, a New
York-based artist.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he also planned to put the same message on the
sides of buses in Washington, and that he had been looking for a
billboard to rent in New York or Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empty billboards are hard to find,'' he said. ``So far, I
haven't had any luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Pink Slips
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has laid off 20 people in its London office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be the absolute maximum,'' said Luke Rittner, senior
director and head of communications for Sotheby's in Europe.
``We're in the process of a reorganization of some departments
which have resulted in redundancies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rittner said the cuts had nothing to do with the shrinking
London art market resulting from a rising 2-year-old European Union
import tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business in Europe has changed, and our structure has not
changed with it,'' he said, adding that Sotheby's was in the middle
of expansion in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and Zurich,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Happy Dealers
</P>
<P>
   The rising stock market helped make this year's International
Fine Art and Antique Dealers Show in New York, which closed
Thursday, far more successful than anyone expected.
</P>
<P>
   While not all dealers did as well as they had hoped, many did.
Among the hottest categories: furniture, as well as decorative and
fine art.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, I sold five pictures, among them a Vuillard, a Bonnard
and a Calder, and I'm still waiting for answers on several
others,'' said Waring Hopkins, the French dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Art deco and French furniture fared well, too. Patrick Perrin,
the French furniture dealer, said he had sold 35 pieces, including
three commodes, five tables, and several consoles, sconces and
candlesticks. The buyers were mostly American collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know American taste,'' he said. ``Nothing too large,
because of the proportions of New York City apartments.''
</P>
<P>
   Museums were also buyers. The Peabody Essex Museum in Salem,
Mass., bought an important pair of French Empire porcelain vases
with maritime scenes for $246,500. A similar pair is in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done better than we have at any fair, which we didn't
expect,'' said John Hill, one of the directors of Jeremy Ltd., the
London furniture and decorative-arts dealers. ``These days, it's
the highest-quality goods that have the largest market.''

   If the Pentagon's masters were doing all the right things to
adapt their forces for the 21st century, military spending would
probably have to rise in the short term. Does that mean, then, that
supporters of a strong America should be rejoicing over this week's
news of an upward blip in funding for the Pentagon?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. As well as well-founded concern over new
challenges -- terrorism, cyber-warfare, rogue ballistic missiles --
the ballooning defense budget reflects a reluctance to set
priorities and grasp nettles.
</P>
<P>
   In political terms, the unexpected $9 billion boost to next
year's spending on defense and related areas (such as embassy
security and intelligence) was made possible by a mixture of
changing global circumstances and tactical expediency. The fact
that Iran and North Korea are developing longer-range missiles, at
a faster pace, than anyone expected has boosted the case for
antimissile defenses. The stand-off in Kosovo makes it imperative
that America's forces in nearby Bosnia are adequately funded. And
armed-services chiefs have sounded a loud alarm bell over the
bundle of issues which they lump under ``readiness'' -- ranging
from their ability to retain skilled pilots to the supply of spare
parts for military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   To these logistical arguments can be added President Bill
Clinton's unwillingness, at this precarious moment, to pick fights
with the armed service chiefs. With public coffers relatively full,
and the prospect of mid-term elections in which defense could be a
pressing local issue, the line of least resistance lies in giving
the military establishment (and all its constituent parts) what it
wants.
</P>
<P>
   No responsible politician could ignore the recent warnings from
America's top officers that, unless annual defense spending is
raised by at least $20 billion, their mighty arsenal could turn
into a ``hollow force,'' bristling with expensive equipment which
cannot be used because of poor maintenance and staffing.
</P>
<P>
   But America's political leaders lack the confidence to ask
harder questions of the service chiefs -- such as why the
``readiness'' problem has arisen so suddenly in the past few
months, and whether it could have been averted by more efficient
use of the existing defense budget.
</P>
<P>
   Political courage, and a readiness to question conventional
military wisdom, will be needed if America's armed forces are to
make the switch from fighting yesterday's wars -- in which one
country's heavy armor did battle with another's -- to the
information-age conflicts of tomorrow. Institutional and economic
interests are bound to be hurt when a behemoth like the Pentagon
re-orients itself to deal with a world that is much less
predictable, but no less dangerous, than that of the cold war.
</P>
<P>
   And among defense experts who are not beholden to any
special-interest group, there is a growing consensus that the
Pentagon has been too slow to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Who is to blame for this state of affairs? There are some
obvious culprits: legislators who doggedly insist on maintaining
military bases, and industrial assembly lines, in their home
districts, and service chiefs who are keener on scoring points over
rivals than on shaping America's overall defense posture.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of hard decisions about how to counter fanatics with
biological weapons, or save lives in former Yugoslavia, it is
exasperating that base closures have proceeded much more slowly
than the broader drawdown of the cold-war armed services. And
efforts to develop anti-missile defenses -- which have little to
show for $40 billion of taxpayers' money -- have been frustrated by
rivalry between the army, navy and air force.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, political favoritism still distorts the defense
budget. With unusual bluntness, military commanders recently told
Congress that they were ordering too many C-130 transport aircraft
-- which happen to be made in Georgia, home of the House speaker,
Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   But criticism of service chiefs, or legislators with local
loyalties, is in danger of missing the point. Every player in
America's defense debate has a corner to defend; there is nothing
wrong with that, so long as countervailing pressure is applied by
policymakers who have the nation's broadest interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   The onus is on the Clinton administration to say precisely which
fighter aircraft, helicopters or ships will have to be sacrificed
in order to free money for electronics or information systems that
are really needed. Such hard choices are bound to threaten a
political cost.
</P>
<P>
   But if the urgency of America's defense dilemma is explained to
them, there is no reason why America's voters should not
understand.

&HT;    A FORMER COSMONAUT IS NO LONGER STARRY-EYED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Retransmission for New England clients) (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Few men alive today can relate to John Glenn, America's
once and future space pioneer, the way Konstantin Feoktistov can.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone say, ``Space pioneer?'' Not only did Feoktistov
(pronounced ``fee-awk-TEE-stuff'') fly on one of the Soviet Union's
first missions in orbit, he played a leading role in designing the
spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking celebrity status? There was a time Feoktistov and
his fellow cosmonauts had to wear dark glasses and avoid public
places to keep from being mobbed by well-wishers,
autograph-seekers, and ordinary Ivans who wanted to know what it
was like up there.
</P>
<P>
   And if the topic is septuagenarian former astronauts who would
drop everything to experience space travel one more time, as Glenn
will at the Oct. 29 liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery, then
Feoktistov, 72, knows a bit about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``To fly into the cosmos is fascinating,'' Feoktistov said. ``I
understand Glenn for wanting to be there again. If I had a chance,
I'd go again without a moment's doubt. If I had the money, I'd pay
what it costs to put me on the space shuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to talk about the hope, nostalgia, and heroism
inspired by Glenn, count Feoktistov out.
</P>
<P>
   Feoktistov believes that the Russian and US manned-flight
programs have both been a big waste of time and money, a battle of
egos between two superpower adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being first became the only goal,'' Feoktistov said in an
interview in his roomy, three-story condominium in a secluded
compound the Soviet government built in northern Moscow for veteran
cosmonauts. ``I don't think we have done enough productive work in
space to justify what either country has spent on it. For nearly 40
years, astronauts young and old have been going into space, but
what do ordinary people on Earth have to show for it? Very
little.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable stance for the man who headed the group of
engineers who designed the Vostok spacecraft that launched Soviet
cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into orbit in 1961, setting off the race
that led to Glenn's maiden voyage 10 months later.
</P>
<P>
   But in Feoktistov's view, his country's efforts to compete in
space were an expensive luxury that the former Soviet Union could
afford, but that are disastrous for Russia today.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Russia's economy is in freefall and many regions
are threatened by hunger, Moscow has committed itself to be a major
partner in the ambitious $60 billion International Space Station
project.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmonauts who once panicked Americans are now mocked openly in
films such as ``Armageddon,'' which depicts a Russian cosmonaut as
frenzied, unshaven, wearing a fur hat and fixing glitches by
pounding on machinery with a wrench.
</P>
<P>
   These are different times from the heady days when Feoktistov
lobbied Sergei Korolyov, the father of the Russian space program,
to let him be the first engineer to fly in space. It took two
years; the Soviet military thought only fighter pilots like Gagarin
and Glenn had the right stuff. But after Feoktistov agreed to
convert Vostok into a three-man module, Korolyov grudgingly agreed
to let him fly.
</P>
<P>
   Like Glenn's voyage on Freedom-7, Feoktistov's flight in October
1964 was a rough-hewn affair. Cramped quarters aboard Voskhod-1
forced him and his two crewmates to wear simple woolen suits
instead of the pressurized space suits usually worn by astronauts
as a precaution against depressurization. They carried knives in
case they had to fend off wolves in the Siberian taiga after
touchdown. Unlike Glenn, Feoktistov was not sure until liftoff that
his country wanted to send him into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had many enemies who did not want me to make that flight,''
Feoktistov said. ``Once we took off, I remember thinking, `That's
it; no one can get me off this spaceship now!'''
</P>
<P>
   That first thought soon subsided as he felt the 10 million
horsepower thrust of Voskhod's booster rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we all have a bit of our ancestors' nomad instincts in
us,'' Feoktistov said. ``For me, it was a thrill to ride that
beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 34 years later, he vividly remembers the sights of that
single day in orbit: the northern lights; the way the sun rises
over the atmosphere; the way lakes on Earth have their own, unique
color; the way mountains look like sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Feoktistov never flew again, but he dedicated his next years to
the space race with the Americans, especially since the Russians
recognized the technological disadvantage they faced. Getting over
that hurdle was a special source of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Russians, we wanted to prove we had the know-how to be the
first,'' he said. ``And we did it, time and again. We were the
first to send a satellite and the first to send man into space. We
had the first in-space hookup of two crafts, and the first space
station.''
</P>
<P>
   But the competition caused both Russia and the United States to
make costly mistakes. The Soviet Union tried to beat the United
States to the moon and lost. It tried to develop a shuttle, Buran,
the prototype of which is now a $35-a-ride attraction among the
amusements in Gorky Park.
</P>
<P>
   Feoktistov, who left the Russian space program in 1989, now
teaches at a Moscow technical institute. He is no longer recognized
on the street, but he has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even 20 years ago, people were telling me, `What are you
doing? People go up; they eat; they produce garbage; and nothing
changes. It's a waste of time,''' Feoktistov recalled. ``I don't
see anything heroic in this.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Glenn, Feoktistov wishes him the best but is preparing
for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vikings used to believe that a warrior should die with his
sword in hand,'' he said. ``Glenn is a warrior, and if he dies in
space, it will be like the Vikings, and maybe that's what he is
thinking. That's great for him, but not so much for the people who
are sending him up.''

McCarthy at the Daily News, (818) 713-3665.

APT-PUPIL _ Stephen King's ``Apt Pupil'' may not be his scariest
story, but it's likely his most disturbing. No ghosts. No
werewolves. No uplifting themes like those other stories from
King's ``Different Seasons'' collection that were turned into the
beloved movies ``Stand by Me'' and ``The Shawshank Redemption.''
Just two thoroughly evil guys talking, mostly, then finally acting
on their dreadful impulses. How do you make a Hollywood movie out
of that? For Bryan Singer, the 32-year-old director who made a big
splash last time around with the intricate crime puzzler ``The
Usual Suspects,'' it's been a warped dream ever since he first read
the story. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
CONTROVERSY-FILMS _ An avalanche of films with disturbing themes,
unsavory characters and creepy situations are making their way into
theaters, and audiences, if they're brave enough, are going to have
an unprecedented amount of opportunities to squirm in their seats.
By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
PUPIL-REVIEW _ ``Apt Pupil'' is creepy in ways you almost can't
imagine. That's the source of its mesmerizing power; we know the
unimaginable did happen, and this film shows us how easily it might
again. By Bob Strauss. 4 stars 
. 
LIFE-REVIEW _ ``Life Is Beautiful'' has been labeled in some
publications as a ``concentration camp comedy.'' It's a shorthand
description that's accurate up to a point, but one that ultimately
trivializes this movie's tremendous power and beauty. Italian
filmmaker Roberto Benigni has created a masterpiece that delicately
mixes laughter and tragedy in a way that you'd never think
possible. By Glenn Whipp. 4 stars
<TEXT>
<P>
   . &QL; 
PLEASANTVILLE-REVIEW _ Gary Ross' wonderful new film,
``Pleasantville,'' taps into our collective nostalgia for the
simplicity of the good old days and then forces us to examine
whether that bygone era was really as swell as we remember. In
fact, the movie prompts us to ask ourselves whether Father really
did know best or if everything we now remember about the Eisenhower
era comes courtesy of Nick at Nite. By Glenn Whipp. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ORGASMO-REVIEW _ This satire of the porno film industry is so
inept, in fact, it makes your basic amateur X-rated production look
like ``Gone With the Wind.'' By Bob Strauss. 1 star

DISC-REVIEWS _ Record reviews. &QL;

VIDEO-COLUMN _ After a promising beginning, ``Hope Floats'' becomes
one of those heartwarming and life-affirming films that never sinks
to the level of total schmaltz but never has enough edge to make it
compelling. What elevates it, though, is the irrepressible Gena
Rowlands. By Rob Lowman.  &QL;

CELINE-DION-CONCERT (Los Angeles) _ Adult-contemporary goddess
Celine Dion did Wednesday what so many before her were never able
to manage _ make the yawning cavern of the Forum seem intimate. By

   MIDEAST-TALKS _ QUEENSTOWN, Md. _ President Clinton returns to
Wye Plantation on Thursday to make a final push on an interim
Israeli-Palestinian agreement. Developing. (Deans, Cox News

</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-SETTLERS _ BET EL, West Bank _ This hardly looks like a
hotbed of activism. Kindergarten children with backpacks make their
way down the sidewalks past tidy landscaping and red-roofed stone
villas. The grocery store is busy and a community club is having a
music and lecture program for Seniors Week. But, this is the place
where they do not want a deal in the Wye Plantation talks and where
many are so to the right of right wing Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu that they want to oust him. They are religious
Jews fearful of being surrounded by Palestinian land and who
believe that God gave this mountain to them, not the Arabs,
forever. It's settlers like these who are spearheading the
opposition to Netanyahu and this phase of the Oslo peace process.
(Kaplow, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-PEACE _ JERUSALEM _ No matter what happens at the Middle
East peace summit at Maryland's Wye Plantation, the bulk of what
needs to be done to settle the issues between Israelis and
Palestinians is still ahead. We take a look at the heavy-lifting
that's left to be done, because once the summit is over, now the
real work begins. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

</P>
<P>
   TEACHERS _ WASHINGTON _ A bill to begin funding 100,000 new
public school teachers has been billed by both Democrats and
Republicans as one of the great accomplishments of the closing days
of the last Congress. But the program's promise is open to
question. The bill pays for only 30,000 teachers _ the rest will
have to be funded later _ and even the first batch won't be hired
until next July. Some educators, already warning that school boards
are hiring unqualified teachers to fill shortages, wonder where the
new contingent will come from. And once they are hired, school
officials say, where are the 30,000 classrooms to put them in?

   MONKEYS _ WASHINGTON _ One banana, two banana, three banana,
four: Monkeys can count. That discovery, announced Thursday in
Science Magazine by researchers at Columbia University in New York,
rattles one of the fundamental assumptions about what distinguishes
human beings from all of Earth's other creatures. (Nesmith, Cox

Thursday that unless he runs for president, this will be his last
campaign. He has no interest in running for a third term and no
interest in any other elective office. Herman, Austin
American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   PHIL-GRAMM _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Congress appeared poised this year
to dismantle a Depression-era law that has prohibited consumers
from one-stop shopping for banking, insurance, stocks and bonds.
But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, with his objection to a tiny piece of
the overhaul, stalled a reform that had been 20 years in the
making. We explain Gramm's problem with the CRA and the future of
banking reform. (Harlan, Austin American-Statesman)

radioactive waste site in Sierra Blanca. (Haurwitz/Harmon, Austin
American-Statesman).

   GOPSTRATEGY _ It's the last two weeks of an unpredictable
election season. You would expect to find Newt Gingrich campaigning
for vulnerable Republican incumbents and promising GOP challengers.
He is doing some of that, but the speaker also is spending a lot of
time in places like Michigan, where a controversial Democratic
nominee for governor may offer Republicans the chance to upset
Democrats up and down the ballot. Gingrich speaks Thursday in two
Democratic-held districts where the odds favor the incumbents. The
Republican hope is that Democrats will stay home in droves on Nov.
3 out of disgust with Geoffrey Feiger, Dr. Kevorkian's lawyer and
the Democratic nominee for governor, and that appearances like
those of Gingrich will help rally the faithful. (Sherman, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

Hilton &AMP; Towers. Attending board meeting of Atlanta Convention and

Gainesville in evening (Croft) and talking about Saturday funeral
of Gerrold Shropshire (Bixler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

against all nine proposed revisions to Florida's Constitution,
including one proposing waiting period on buying guns at gun shows.

   IVORY-TUSK _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Judy Bailey named it ``Nathan'' and
hoped to keep the antique ivory tusk in the family, but a private
buyer paid $11,300 Wednesday at auction for the rare, 11-pound
Narwhal whale tooth. (Mong, Dayton Daily News). MOVED

<P>
   BREAST-FEEDING-CAMPAIGN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ In brilliant color on
network television, the dead baby is rushed into a hospital
emergency room _ starved to death because the infant's
breast-feeding mother didn't understand nutrition. The horrifying
story _ which aired Wednesday night on the CBS drama ``Chicago
Hope'' _ may make gripping television drama, but national and local
breast-feeding advocates are incensed. The episode has sparked a
national counter-information campaign designed to assure mothers
that breast-feeding is not dangerous for their children.

</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ It all started with that dorky icon of customer
service, the Time Life operator. In 1990 it surfaced on stage,
clamped to Madonna's noggin like some high-tech orthodontic
headgear. Now, it's infiltrated the very core of cool-dom: the
Hollywood prop house. It's ... the headset. Why does everyone now

   FILM-SOLONDZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Todd Solondz's black comedy ``Happiness'' has received
much critical acclaim _ and a great deal of outrage about its
subplots, including one focusing on a pedophile. But the filmmaker
thinks it's more interesting to portray characters with all their
flaws than just try to wring sympathy from an audience. By ELVIS
MITCHELL. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-HAPPINESS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ There probably isn't another director working who has
made a style of ambivalence in the way Todd Solondz has. With
``Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' which followed an outcast Jersey
preteen girl at a difficult time in her life, his deadpan direction
kept people off-guard. His newest film, ``Happiness,'' is sure to
provoke even more conversation. He clearly wants to subvert, and
cheat, the expectation that a movie should make audiences feel one
thing at a time _ laughter, sadness, outrage. By ELVIS MITCHELL.
Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   FILM-SLAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Director Marc Levin films the urban drama ``Slam''
with such a casual cinema-verite voyeurism, it's as if he were
using surveillance cameras. He and his actors sometimes seem to
have wandered into the movie's Washington, D.C., locations and just
started filming while the residents went about their business. It's
representative of the movie, which tries to show the real world
while living in a dream one. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in
``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-APT PUPIL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ The first time I encountered an excited young dude
shouting ``I'm the King of the World'' wasn't in ``Titanic,'' but
in Stephen King's novella, ``Apt Pupil,'' now a film under the
direction of Bryan Singer. By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story has moved in
``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-PLEASANTVILLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ``Pleasantville'' is ... not unpleasant. It starts
with a likable sendup of a Nick at Nite-style cable channel _ TV
Time _ that traffics in the relentlessly cheerful irony that makes
almost everything in pop culture feel meaningless because the folks
selling it have to pretend they're smarter than their subject
matter. (And it's easy to make fun of 1950s television, which even
the TV Time actors _ if you want to call them that _ don't seem to
take very seriously.) By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story has moved in ``e''
entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-ORGAZMO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ In spite of its much-ballyhooed NC-17 rating, ``South
Park'' co-creator Trey Parker's ``Orgazmo'' succeeds on two levels:
as a clever spoof of pornography, action films and the '60s
``Batman'' TV series; and as a surprisingly hilarious piece of
``adult'' humor. By TODD CAMP. Story has moved in ``e''
entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-SPECIAL EFFECTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Are special effects becoming so ubiquitous in movies
that we're becoming jaded about them? The new movie
``Pleasantville'' deftly mixes black-and-white with color images _
often in the same frame _ but nobody's acting like this is a big
deal. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV-PERKINS-COLUMN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ``Good Morning America'' is dying because it broke the
cardinal rule of morning television: It tried to give the audience
something that flew against the established standards of fluffy,
style-over-substance morning programs. By KEN PARISH PERKINS. Story
has moved in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   BIZ-BOOKS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ To grow the economy, the government has to continue to
think big. That's the history lesson to be drawn from Thomas
Hughes' Rescuing Prometheus'' (Pantheon Books, $28.50, 372 pages).
The book chronicles the development, execution and long-term impact
of four massive post-World War II projects with the size and scale
to spark creative thinking that could affect the way the commercial
sector does business for decades to come. By TERESA McUSIC. Story

 &HT;    THE ROAD TO WYE, THE LONG ROAD AHEAD
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-PEACE-1023.

 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The summit talks at the Wye River Plantation are one step in
restarting a peace process that was born in hope in 1993 but has
been mired in violence and intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 13, 1993: Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin come to the
White House to sign the Oslo accords (negotiated in Norway).
</P>
<P>
   The accords lay out a largely unspecified schedule for Israel to
turn over occupied areas to the Palestinians in return for the
Palestinians dropping their resistance to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   May 4, 1994: Israeli and Palestinian leaders, in Cairo, sign the
Gaza-Jericho agreement, clearing the way for those areas to be the
first areas where Israeli troops withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 26, 1994: Culminating years of secret relations and months
of formal talks, in part a result of the Oslo process, Israel and
Jordan sign a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 28, 1995: Arafat and Rabin come to Washington to sign the
detailed agreement filling in many of the gaps in the first
accords.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 4, 1995: An extreme right-wing Israeli kills Rabin at a
peace rally in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 20, 1996: As laid out in the previous accords, elections
are held in the Palestinian areas, electing a legislature and
Arafat as president of the new Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
   February and March, 1996: Four Palestinian terrorist attacks
kill 54 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   May 29, 1996: Shocked by terrorism, Israelis narrowly elect
right-wing Benjamin Netanyahu prime minister over incumbent Shimon
Peres. He had opposed Oslo, but says he will fulfill its
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   September, 1996: Scores of Palestinians and several Israelis die
when Palestinian police and Israeli troops engage in firefights.
Palestinians were protesting Netanyahu's expansion of a tunnel near
a Muslim holy site.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 17, 1997: Israel and the Palestinians sign the Hebron
Accords, pulling Israeli troops out of 80 percent of the holy city
and laying out a rough schedule for further withdrawals. Israel has
now pulled out of most of Gaza and pockets in the West Bank
containing most of the Palestinian population.
</P>
<P>
   March, 1997: Deadline for the first of the three next troop
withdrawals is missed when Israel's offer is rejected as too small.
</P>
<P>
   July-September, 1997: Efforts to restart the peace talks are
derailed when Palestinian suicide bombers kill 24 Israelis in two
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 10, 1997: U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
visits the region and leaves with little progress, stressing that
the local leaders are not ready to make hard choices needed for
peace and that she will not come back again to ``tread water.''
</P>
<P>
   September, 1998: Deadline for second in series of Israeli troop
withdrawals missed.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 15, 1998: President Bill Clinton hosts summit at Wye River
Plantation, aiming to get Israel to carry out the delayed troop
withdrawals and get the Palestinians to improve their fight on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In the future:
</P>
<P>
   Early 1999: Negotiations could begin on the toughest issues
under Oslo:
</P>
<P>
   Whether Israel will share Jerusalem;
</P>
<P>
   whether Palestinian refugees can return to their homeland or be
</P>
<P>
   compensated;
</P>
<P>
   whether the Palestinians can have a state;
</P>
<P>
   and what the two final borders will be.
</P>
<P>
   May 4, 1998: Oslo accords expire. Arafat says he might declare
statehood whether or not he has Israeli approval. Israel hints that
could prompt it to retake land.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As hard as it was to get Israelis and Palestinians
to agree in this week's American-hosted summit meeting, the future
of the Middle East peace process looks even tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: The Oslo peace accords signed five years ago were not
a finished product. They simply set a schedule for settling the
disputes between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are now more than a year behind that schedule.
</P>
<P>
   This week's agreement at the secluded Wye River Plantation in
Maryland certainly moved the process forward. Even so, Ron Pundik,
one of the Israeli authors of the Oslo Accords, warned, ``The
post-Wye Plantation era could be tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Oslo, the Palestinians are supposed to recognize Israel's
right to exist. Israel is supposed to make phased troop withdrawals
from some of the Palestinian lands it captured in wars. The idea is
to build trust, allowing the adversaries to resolve the most
important and contentious issues in the so-called ``permanent
status talks'' at the end of the process.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent status issues include whether the 3.4 million
Palestinian refugees, and descendants of refugees, can return to
land that is now part of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the holy city of Jerusalem, including whether Israel
will let Palestinians rule part of it, must be decided. And
negotiators must decide whether to dismantle or protect the 144
Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the final boundaries of Israel to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has already withdrawn from most of the Gaza Strip and
from lots of little pockets in the West Bank. The Palestinians have
made partial progress in dropping their resistance to Israel's
existence.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli leader
Benjamin Netanyahu journeyed to the woods of Maryland's Eastern
Shore to work out this week's deal, they were already 19 months
behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The main topic of the summit: a land transfer that was supposed
to start in March, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, the whole process is set to expire May 4, 1999 -- and
the two sides have not even started negotiating the final issues.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has vowed to declare Palestinian statehood in May. That
would put nations around the world on the spot as they decide
whether to recognize the new nation. And Israeli leaders hint they
could respond by retaking the land they gave back under Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   That could lead to war.
</P>
<P>
   Another danger is that the Wye agreement could unravel before
negotiators can even get to the final issues. Terrorist blasts
could derail it all. So could threats from Netanyahu's right wing
supporters to topple his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take into account the extremes on both sides,''
said Palestinian political analyst Mahdi Abdul Hadi. ``It is a test
all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Wye agreement holds, the two sides are approaching
negotiations over the permanent issues with totally incompatible
positions. Netanyahu says he will never share even an inch of
Jerusalem. About a third of the city's population is Palestinian,
but it is ruled by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis say they will not allow the return of the more than
three million Arab refugees, something that would change the very
nature of the Jewish state. And settlers threaten political
upheaval in Israel -- and even civil war -- if many of Israel's 144
West Bank Jewish neighborhoods are dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arafat says there can be no real peace without a
Palestinian capital in a shared Jerusalem. The refugees insist on
returning to the land they say was stolen from them. The
settlements are indeed situated in occupied territory, and are
often surrounded by bitter Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hadi, the Palestinian political analyst, said
negotiators might be able achieve a permanent status agreement that
will be based on support from both sides and security commitments
from around the region. That, Hadi said, is one of the reasons
Jordan's King Hussein, an influential figure in the region, was
brought into the Wye talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is pending,'' Hadi said. ``Once there is a regional
package for cooperation, I can see the Israelis and the
Palestinians meeting halfway.''

 &HT;    WHERE WYE MEETS OSLO: THE PEACE PROCESS IN THE MID-STREAM
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-PEACE-1023.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question: How do the talks at Wye River Plantation Conference
Center fit into the Oslo peace process?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The Oslo Accords, agreed to in 1993, set out a series of
negotiations aimed at settling the dispute between the Israelis and
Palestinians. The understanding was based in part on Israel making
phased troop withdrawals from captured Palestinian lands in
exchange for the Palestinians dropping their resistance to the
existence of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The process was supposed to include a series of troop
withdrawals while leaving the toughest issues to be dealt with at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye talks are meant to end a 19-month stall in the process
and continue the troop withdrawals and security work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How far along is the process?
</P>
<P>
   A: Israel has withdrawn from most of the Gaza Strip and the
parts of the West Bank areas that are populated by Palestinians.
But, in the West Bank, the Palestinians are left in more than 150
little pockets that are surrounded, and can be cut off, by Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Palestinians, having dropped their Intifada
uprising, made commitments to recognize Israel. Their security
forces often work with Israeli forces, but their fight against
terrorist extremists within their own ranks has been inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the process on schedule?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The troop withdrawal negotiators are discussing at Wye
was supposed to have started in March 1997. And Israelis contend
the Palestinians have not kept their promises to fight terrorism.
The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) started, but never
completed, the process of amending its charter to drop resistance
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why are the negotiations so tough?
</P>
<P>
   A. Right now, leaders on both sides have incentives to resist
compromise. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is backed by
a right-wing coalition that largely opposed the Oslo process when
it was signed by then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat has threatened to declare Palestinian
statehood on May 4, 1999, when Oslo expires, and he may feel that
deadline will scare Israelis into making concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If they get an agreement at Wye, what comes next?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, it will have to be implemented. If Israeli troops are
to be pulled out, the withdrawal could be phased over time along
with Palestinian anti-terrorism steps. Then, another phased
withdrawal might be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and most important, come the permanent status talks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the issues in the permanent status talks?
</P>
<P>
   A: Will part of Jerusalem, a city run by Israel with about
450,000 Jews and almost 200,000 Arabs, be ceded by Israel for use
as a Palestinian capital? Will the 3.4 million Palestinian
refugees, and the descendants of refugees, be allowed to return to
Israel? Will Jewish settlements in occupied territories be
preserved? What are Israel's, and the Palestinians', final borders?
</P>
<P>
   And the parties will have to negotiate what kind of powers the
Palestinian government will have, such as whether it will be
empowered to form an army, or negotiate with other countries. And
they will have to resolve whether Palestine will, in fact, be a new
nation.

PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH GETS A BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 25)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a week of chaotic horse-trading on Capitol
Hill, advocates for more spending on prostate cancer research
emerged with $184 million to study the No. 2 cancer-killer of men,
more than the previous year but significantly less money than they
had sought.
</P>
<P>
   The budget package that President Clinton signed into law
Wednesday boosts prostate cancer research funded through the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) _ which includes the National
Cancer Institute _ and the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The military's commitment rose from $40 million to about $62
million. The effort was a victory for research advocates given that
this summer House and Senate negotiators considered funding as
little as $10 million through the Pentagon budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is a major contributor to cancer research in part
because the military operates numerous hospitals across the country
and treats active-duty and retired service members for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH will spend about $122 million for research on prostate
cancer this year, an increase of $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH funding was a setback for advocates. In closed-door
sessions before a sweeping $520 billion spending package was
approved last week, House and Senate budget negotiators dropped a
controversial measure by Sen. Ted Stevens, the chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, that would have earmarked $175
million for NIH-funded prostate cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, R-Alaska, is a survivor of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was eliminated because it directed NIH scientists
to spend funds for a specific purpose. Congress typically grants
scientists the leeway to spend cancer funds as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., has been a staunch critic of
designating spending on specific ailments, preferring to leave that
to the discretion of scientists and researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am opposed to getting into political health research, where
every group shows up with their banner, and their slogan, and their
calculations,'' Gingrich told research advocates this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very politics that led AIDS to become a politically
desirable thing to do research in is wrong. It distorts the
research process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Prostate Cancer Coalition, a Washington-based
patient advocacy group, had pressed for a total commitment of $418
million from lawmakers in the new fiscal year, asserting that
prostate cancer research is underfunded compared with other killers
such as breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The group sought a major spike in funds from the NIH and the
Pentagon. The latter was met with stiff resistance from lawmakers
who felt the armed forces needed every available dollar for
military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Hedlund, the coalition's president, said that while the
group didn't achieve its target, ``we've made a lot of progress.''
He said the organization would lobby NIH throughout the year to
spend as much as possible on prostate cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Some 184,500 men will be diagnosed with carcinoma of the
prostate this year, making it the most diagnosed cancer in the
United States next to highly curable forms of skin cancer. Nearly
40,000 American men will die from the cancer; only lung cancer will
kill more American men, according to the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer research receives comparatively little from the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite nearly 20 percent of all cancers diagnosed each year
being prostate cancer, until now less than four percent of total
federal funds for cancer research have been devoted to prostate
cancer,'' Hedlund said. ``Prostate cancer research money has been
left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, breast cancer and prostate cancer killed about the
same number of Americans in 1997 _ 43,900 women and 41,800 men,
respectively _ while about 14,000 people died from AIDs-related
illnesses last year.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH spent about $107,214 in AIDS research for every
AIDS-related death that year; $9,362 in breast cancer research for
every breast cancer death; and $2,512 in prostate cancer research
for every death from that disease.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 through 1997, the National Cancer Institute spent $371
million on prostate cancer research. By comparison, institute spent
nearly $1.67 billion for breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely must do more to fight this dreadful disease,''
said John Kelly, vice chairman of the American Cancer Society's
board of directors. ``We need a nationwide commitment to expand
prostate cancer research efforts in order to better understand and
prevent this disease.''

THE `100,000 NEW TEACHERS' AREN'T FOR EVERYONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 25)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and his Democratic allies in
Congress hope they've created an election year vote-getter with a
new federal program to pay for 100,000 new teachers to help cut the
size of elementary school classes.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton program is designed to hire 100,000 new teachers
over seven years to help cut class size in overcrowded schools to
an average of 18 students per teacher in first, second and third
grade.
</P>
<P>
   If funding is approved by Congress each year, the program could
eventually provide $12.4 billion over the next seven years to many
of the nation's 48,000 public elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the details behind the alluring headline of ``100,000 new
teachers'' show a more fragmented picture.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ Although Clinton has showcased the program as a benefit to all
Americans, with visits to suburban schools with overcrowded
classrooms, the actual formula for selecting schools for the money
targets schools serving low-income families rather than more
affluent suburban schools where overcrowding is just as common.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Clinton initiative could expose state and local
governments to billions of dollars in unplanned spending for
benefits and pensions for the new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   _ U.S. Education Department studies forecast that the
teacher-student ratios in elementary schools will decline from 18.9
in 1996 to 17.3 by 2008 even without Clinton's initiative.
</P>
<P>
   _ Money from Clinton's teacher initiative won't reach schools
for months; the initial $1.2 billion for the first 30,703 teachers
will not enable schools to hire teachers until next July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Public public opinion polls show that voters rank education
second only to the global economic crisis as their top concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more important to America's future prosperity
than giving our children a world &QC; class education,'' Vice President
Al Gore declared during a campaign swing to California last week.
``We must ensure that every child can master the basics and meet
high standards to succeed in today's knowledge-based economy _ and
this initiative will help reach that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scott A. Hodge, a senior fellow in tax and budget policy at
the Citizens for a Sound Economy, in Washington, D.C., says the
White House is exaggerating the federal role in public education
for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   Federal spending accounts for only 7 percent of the nearly $300
billion a year that the nation spends on public and private
elementary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear that education spending plays well with the
Democratic base _ whether its women or teachers' unions or
residents of inner cities,'' Hodge says. He claimed that Democrats
were using education as a ``wedge issue'' against Republicans to
gain political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard W. Riley downplays political
motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``All across America, we will begin to lower class size by
hiring teachers to give more personalized attention to students,''
Riley says.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of politically active teachers' unions hail the
venture. Bob Chase, president of the 2.4 million member National
Education Association, applauded Clinton's ``aggressive leadership
in keeping the class size proposal as a priority.'' Sandra Feldman,
president of the 1 million member American Federation of Teachers,
says Congress ``did the right thing'' underwriting new teachers
because ``students do better in smaller classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Green, Riley's spokeswoman at the Department of Education,
said the Clinton administration remains committed to winning
congressional funding for the program each year in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to go through the annual appropriations
process,'' Green says. ``But it will still be our commitment to
provide these resources to the school districts to pay for these
teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Zeeve, national field director of the deficit-fighting
Concord Coalition, predicted that the White House and the
Republican Congress will have trouble finding the money in the
future.

</P>
<P>
   The White House modeled its election-year initiative after an
effort launched in 1994 to use federal funds to hire 100,000 new
police officers. So far, the White House and Congress have agreed
to fund 88,473 police officers but only 46,544 police officers are
actually on the beat. The remainder are either being recruited or
trained.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton's teachers' initiative, the 100,000 new police
program requires local communities to take over the salaries and
benefits of the new officers after three years.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials say that 98 percent of the police
departments that have received federal funds to hire police
officers for the first three years have advised the Clinton
administration that they will keep the officers on the payroll with
local funds after the federal grant expires.

HMO CONCERNS FAIL TO ELECTRIFY VOTERS IN THIS ELECTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Addressing a group of local officials this
week, John Edwards, the Democrat challenging incumbent GOP Sen.
Lauch Faircloth, ticked off the critical issues he believed faced
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   When the candidate finished, he was peppered with questions
about his proposals to pump more money into the public schools,
protect Social Security, and revamp campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   No one asked him about his plan to reduce the power of health
insurance bureaucrats and give people more choice of doctors in
their managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns over health maintenance organizations do not appear to
be electrifying voters this election season contrary to the
predictions of many Democrats who had hoped that growing voter
disgust with their health plans would be a key campaign issue
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, reports of audiences cheering when a character
played by Helen Hunt in the movie ``As Good as it Gets'' lashes out
at the lousy service she received from an HMO, had stoked
Democrats' hopes that the issue was golden.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of the White House, they crafted a Patients
Bill of Rights that gave consumers more choice of doctors, the
ability to appeal managed care decisions and the right to sue their
plans for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant Republicans, prodded by their own polls showing rising
concern about HMOs, countered with their own watered-down versions
of managed care reform.
</P>
<P>
   But observers say that by late August the intense media focus on
the White House scandal made it harder for congressional Democrats
to showcase their health care agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative efforts fizzled as lawmakers became increasingly
distracted by the prospect of impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a cyclone hit and people stopped thinking about
any issue except the president,'' said Bob Blendon, a professor of
the Harvard School of Public Health, who has overseen a number of
polls about health care.
</P>
<P>
   Blendon said surveys continue to show that voters favor some
restrictions on managed care policies. But he said, they place
higher priorities on other issues such as education and the decline
of moral values.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards disagreed that the scandal has drowned out health care,
Social Security and education, the marquee issues Democratic
candidates are highlighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think exactly the opposite is true. I think that as a result
of what people perceive to be highly politicized process in
Washington regarding the president they are more hungry than ever
to hear people talk about issues that really matter in their
lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had looked to North Carolina as a test case on the
managed-care issue, because Edwards had stressed it successfully in
his primary campaign last spring. In the race against Faircloth he
has continued to mention the issue in stump speeches and aired one
health-care television spot earlier this fall. He is also running
an ad accusing Faircloth of voting to cut Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But political experts say that health care is only one of
several factors that has helped Edwards bring the race to a dead
heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not debating health care everyday. You would have to
stretch it some to say this is a referendum on health care or
HMOs,'' said Ferrel Gailoory, director of Southern Politics, Media
and Public Life at the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Edwards seems to place a higher priority on education
and visits a public school every week.
</P>
<P>
   Although his campaign spokesman denies health care is an issue,
Faircloth has felt the need to respond to Edwards' attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, he was one of a handful of Republicans who
joined Democrats in their unsuccessful effort to keep managed care
legislation alive when it was hastily brought up on the Senate
floor.
</P>
<P>
   And to shore up support among women, for whom health care issues
particularly resonate, Faircloth tells voters he supports breast
cancer research. This week the senator was scheduled to appear at a
breast cancer event on the courthouse steps in his hometown of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is inoculated if the issue comes up,'' said Charles
Black, a Washington-based Republican consultant who is advising the
Faircloth campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the health-care issue is no longer on the
front-burner politically, the business interests involved in the
matter have not forgotten it.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care industry, fearful of losing allies in Congress,
blitzed North Carolina and other states in September with ads
claiming that Democratic health care legislation was intended to
enrich trial lawyers, such as Edwards, because it would have
allowed consumers to sue their HMOs for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Merritt, a spokesman for the American Association of Health
Plans -the major HMO lobbying association _ said the group was
confident that ``80 percent'' of candidates plugging anti-managed
care messages will lose this year.
</P>
<P>
   But knowing the issue could be revived, the HMO group plans to
continue advertising next year in New Hampshire and Iowa, the first
presidential primary states.
</P>
<P>
   And interests on both sides of the issue are still opening their
wallets to candidates this season.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new report by the Center for Responsive Politics,
health care interests have contributed $35 million in the 1997-98
election cycle, with 58 percent of those contributions going to
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Democratic candidates around the country have taken
the health-care fight to the airwaves. Their ads often feature the
candidates against the backdrop of a hospital or emergency room
pledging to give people more choices of doctors. Others feature
victims of managed-care abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, Pat Casey, a Democrat in a tight race for an open
Pennsylvania House seat stands in front of a scene of a doctor
examining children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're sick, they should check out your pulse, not your
wallet,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, Democratic House candidate Shelley Berkley has taken
a more humorous approach to underscore the impersonal nature of
managed care plans, Her televisions ads depicts doctors, in Groucho
Marx poses, shoving thermometers, assembly line fashion, into long
lines of patients.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans consultants said that Democrats are not likely
to gain much traction, because most GOP lawmakers have backed some
variation of managed care reform and voters are not that excited
about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Garry
Mauro helps prove their point. He tried to use the managed care
issue last spring against incumbent Republican Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro ran ads attacking Bush for vetoing a bill that would have
given consumers more doctor and hospital choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``To choose your own doctor, you need to choose a new
governor,'' was the tag line of the ad.
</P>
<P>
   But even after the ads ran, Mauro continued to trail badly in
the polls. He rarely mentions it on the campaign trail anymore. &QL;

FASHION DESIGNER READIES STARS FOR VH1 FASHION AWARDS SHOW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA MITCHELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inge Fonteyne knows clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Celebs like Mariah Carey and Jennifer Aniston often consult her
before stepping out. For the second year in a row, VH1 has hired
her to dress the host of its annual Fashion Awards Show. When Ellen
DeGeneres arrives at Madison Square Garden Friday night to emcee,
she'll have Fonteyne to thank for her look.
</P>
<P>
   And, what exactly will that look be? The New York-based stylist
won't share her glamour plans but she did recently take a break
from her hectic, pre-show schedule to dish about last year's
celebrity presenters and their various fashion emergencies. The
most memorable _ presenter Jim Carrey's now-famous fig leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Carrey came up with this idea, to wear a fig leaf. He
faxed over a sketch, drawn to scale, and I had to search high and
low for just the right G-string. It had to be nude but I couldn't
find one that was perfectly nude so I ended up dying one with
coffee and tea. It was so last minute, I sent it off to him still
wet,'' Fonteyne remembered. ``The next day, the G-string came back
to me. It was too small. He had undermeasured himself by about 10
inches.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Fonteyne got Carey in a fig leaf that fit before the
big night. But more dressing dilemmas soon followed. Fonteyne put
Ashley Judd, who co-hosted with Harry Connick Jr., in a collection
of vintage evening gowns. One of the dresses came back from the
cleaners damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They absolutely ruined a strap that was covered in little
diamonds. So, hours before the show, I'm running to the fashion
district to find new diamond studs.''
</P>
<P>
   She fixed the dress, and the fashion world buzzed about Judd and
Carrey's show-stealing styles.
</P>
<P>
   Fonteyne doesn't expect this year's show to be any calmer. In
addition to DeGeneres and Heche, she'll be responsible for Janet
Jackson and her dancers, plus any other celebrity presenters who
need her talent and taste. Like Andy Dick, who called on her to
dress the actors in a short film he created for the awards show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy was fun to work with. We can push his boundaries,'' said
Fonteyne, who won't reveal the film's plot but did offer the
following hint: ``It has to do with live clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Before rushing off to meet another celebrity, Fonteyne weighed
in on whom she thought should take home statues Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   For most fashionable artist, she picks Madonna over Marilyn
Manson, Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl Crow and Steve Nicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madonna always pushes the limit, pushes the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   For best female personal style, Fonteyne likes Cameron Diaz more
than Jenna Elfman, Jennifer Lopez, Liv Tyler and Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love Cameron. I've worked with her.''
</P>
<P>
   For best male Personal Style, Ben Stiller beats out Chris Rock,
Dylan McDermott, Nicolas Cage and Vince Vaughn in Fonteyne's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben Stiller is awesome. He loves Prada.''
</P>
<P>
   The VH1 Fashion Awards happen Friday but don't air until 8 p.m.
Tuesday on the cable channel. Tyra Banks, Minnie Driver, Jennifer
Lopez and Michael Stipe are just a few of the celebrities scheduled
to present. Look for performances by the Smashing Pumpkins, Lenny
Kravitz and Iggy Pop.

`FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT': HISTORY AND FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having revived the American Symphony Orchestra with
programs in which works and composers are linked by overarching
themes, Leon Botstein showed on Monday evening that his programming
approach can enliven fund-raising concerts as well.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was a concert at Avery Fisher Hall for the
Jerusalem Foundation, a philanthropic organization that was founded
by Teddy Kollek, at the time the mayor of Jerusalem, with the goal
of improving the city for all its residents, Jewish, Muslim and
Christian, and making it more attractive to visitors as well. The
foundation has underwritten some 1,600 projects, including gardens,
museums, hospitals, cultural and sports centers and archeological
restorations.
</P>
<P>
   The 50th anniversary of the establishment of Israel was the
ostensible focus of the program, but its title, ``From Darkness to
Light,'' as well as the opening comments by Liv Ullmann, the
actress, and the intermission remarks by Martin Peretz, editor of
The New Republic, suggested a broader historical panorama.
Botstein's repertory selections widened the scope further, touching
on the complex balance between the forces of history and the power
of sustained faith.
</P>
<P>
   Lamentation, in the form of the mourner's prayer, ``Kaddish,''
as set by Ravel, and Jeremiah's reflections on Jerusalem's
destruction, as set by Bernstein, were offset by Jacob Weinberg's
beautifully modal setting of ``Kol Dodi,'' a section of ``The Song
of Songs,'' and ``Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel,'' Elijah's
proclamation of his readiness to serve God, from the Mendelssohn
oratorio about him.
</P>
<P>
   Allusions to Israel's liberation from Egypt were laced through
the program by way of a quartet from Rossini's ``Mose in Egitto,''
the final trio and chorus from Handel's ``Israel in Egypt,'' and a
spiritual, ``Go Down Moses.'' And Verdi's ``Va pensiero,'' from
``Nabucco,'' offered near the end of the program, revisited the
same sense of hope and longing embodied in the Israeli national
anthem, ``Hatikva,'' heard in Kurt Weill's peculiarly expansive
arrangement at the start of the evening. (``The Star-Spangled
Banner'' was given a Jewish connection too: Botstein conducted the
arrangement by Morton Gould.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobles seigneurs, salut,'' from Meyerbeer's ``Huguenots,'' may
have seemed off the topic at a glance, but the opera's look at the
dangers of religious intolerance is universal. The aria, sung with
exquisite suppleness by the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina, was far
and away the most delightful performance of the evening. Less clear
was why the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto was included, but it
offered an opportunity to hear an energetic, sweet-toned
performance by Sarah Chang.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Nassief's lovely, dark-timbred soprano suited the Ravel
``Kaddish'' nicely, and John Cheek used his rich bass effectively
in the selections from ``Elijah'' and ``Nabucco.'' Also among the
highlights were Harolyn Blackwell's graceful, light-textured
reading of Weinberg's ``Kol Dodi,'' Kristine Jepson's assured
singing in the finale of Bernstein's ``Jeremiah'' Symphony, and
Kathleen Battle's virtuosic renderings of three spirituals, ``I
Hear Music,'' ``Li'l David Play Your Harp'' and ``Go Down Moses.''
</P>
<P>
   A work commissioned from Philip Glass for the occasion, ``Psalm
126,'' seemed halfhearted: Not quite a setting of the psalm, the
piece was five minutes of choral and orchestral noodling in Glass'
trademark style, against which an English translation of the psalm
was read by Paul Sorvino.
</P>
<P>
   The American Symphony Orchestra and the New York Choral Artists
contributed polished, supportive performances.

NORTHEAST AND WEST BEST FOR WOMEN, WHILE SOUTH LAGS, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Areas in the Northeast and West rank among the top
places for women to live based on factors such as wages,
reproductive rights and opportunities to gain political posts,
according to a study released Thursday by a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, the Institute for Women's Policy Research,
said the lowest-ranking states are mostly in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 best are the District of Columbia, Connecticut, Maryland,
New Hampshire, Vermont, Washington state, California, Oregon,
Hawaii and Alaska, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 worst, from the bottom up, as Mississippi, Tennessee,
Kentucky, Arkansas, West Virginia, South Carolina, Alabama,
Oklahoma, Louisiana and South Dakota, according to the institute's
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``All too often, women's well-being is determined about what
states they live in,'' said Linda Tarr-Whelan, U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, at a news
conference here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of your residence sets up the odds of whether you
will be at the table where political decisions are made, economic
decisions are made,'' she added. ``It determines whether there is
going to be capital or education for you as a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonpartisan group analyzed indicators of women's well-being
and ranked the states according to how well women fared on all of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Besides wages and the ability to win political offices, the
indicators included the percentage of women registered to vote and
of those who actually voted and the proportions of females in the
work force, of those who are managers and professionals and of
those below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   The indicators also included the share of women with health
insurance, college degrees and their own businesses. Additionally,
they included reproductive rights such as access to abortion,
public funding for infertility services, insurance coverage for
contraceptives and whether gay or lesbian couples can adopt
children.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Hartmann, the institute's president, said the status of
females has improved in many states, ``but women will pay a penalty
in their paychecks even in the best states. In the worst states,
(they get) really socked ... every pay day.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma and Alabama, considered the bottom of the heap for
women's wages, females earn slightly more than 63 cents for every
dollar men are paid.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the District of Columbia, which has the highest
percentage of women in professional and managerial jobs and the
biggest percentage of female-owned businesses, women earn 87 cents
for every dollar men are paid, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartmann said the poverty rate for females is 50 percent higher
than it is for men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poverty is a woman's epidemic in states like New Mexico,
Mississippi and Louisiana, where one out of five women are
scrambling to survive below the poverty line,'' Hartmann said.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, Alaska, Utah and New Jersey have the fewest women
living in poverty, with rates ranging between 7.6 percent and 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   While 64 percent of females are registered to vote compared with
61 percent of men, relatively few women hold elective office.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-four percent of state governors are men and 91 percent of
U.S. senators are male. Only 15 women have been state governors. In
terms of electing women to public office, Washington, California
and Maine have the best records while Mississippi, Kentucky and
Alabama have the worst, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Friedan, a founder of modern feminism who helped launch
the National Organization for Women, said at the news conference
that research shows adding just two women to a state legislature
begins to change the agenda, ``not just in the direction of women's
rights, but in issues having to do with life, health, welfare,
older people, children, the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedan said if women can win about half of elective offices,
``you might see all sorts of wonderful changes in national public
priorities, such as child care.''
</P>
<P>
   On the score card for women's reproductive rights, Hawaii ranks
highest, trailed by New York, Connecticut, Vermont, Oregon, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, Washington, Maryland and the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Reproductive rights are most curtailed in North Dakota, followed
by Nebraska, Mississippi, Kansas, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Ohio, South
Dakota, Utah and Michigan, the report said.

WHEN WALLS TALKED TO YOU 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Are you sorry you tossed that Bob Dylan poster? You
know, the one with his face in silhouette and his hair a tangle of
psychedelic spaghetti; the one that came folded up in the ``Best
of'' album, which you tacked to your wall and then threw out after
senior year?
</P>
<P>
   It was designed by Milton Glaser. It is quite scarce. In good
condition, it would be worth $500.
</P>
<P>
   Now, are you sorry?
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary posters are nowhere close to rivaling the classics
in price or popularity. But they are, nonetheless, being admitted
for the first time in large numbers to the International Vintage
Poster Fair, which begins at 5 p.m. Friday at the Metropolitan
Pavilion at 110 West 19th St.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my goal is to broaden people's perception of what's
desirable,'' said Louis Bixenman, the organizer of the fair and
proprietor of the Poster America gallery at 138 West 18th St. ``The
reason there are Toulouse-Lautrecs and Cassandres today is that
people saved them when they were contemporary posters.''
</P>
<P>
   Already a collector's item is Paul Bruehwiler's 1983 poster for
a Fritz Lang retrospective at the Filmpodium-Kino in Zurich,
Switzerland. The director stares grimly from the center, encircled
by radiant black and white spokes that slash through the bold type
and through the small movie stills that are peppered across the
background.
</P>
<P>
   Bixenman estimated that 300 of these posters were printed, half
of which were posted and thus effectively destroyed. But quality as
well as scarcity dictates the $1,200 price, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine this hanging on the street?'' Bixenman asked,
as he slid the poster into view on a broad tabletop piled high with
bright images. ``You'd almost have to stop to look at it. That's
what a good poster does.''
</P>
<P>
   One of four dealers who will be showing contemporary posters at
the fair is Jack Rennert, president of Posters Please and Poster
Auctions International, both run from a corner loft in the
Starrett-Lehigh Building at 601 West 26th St., with panoramas of
the Hudson River so sweeping that one can almost overlook the
posters.
</P>
<P>
   And that is just what many collectors do _ overlook contemporary
posters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk by a poster gallery and see that it's charging $500
for a poster that you had in your dorm room,'' Rennert said.
``People are not prepared to make the jump from $5 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things take time,'' he said. ``Toulouse-Lautrec did all
his posters in the 1890s. Up until the 1950s, you could go to any
Madison Avenue gallery and get one for $50.''
</P>
<P>
   Not today. Toulouse-Lautrec's 1893 poster of Aristide Bruant,
his gaze averted from the viewer, red scarf draped rakishly over
his black cape, is expected to command $40,000 to $50,000 at a Nov.
8 auction organized by Poster Auctions International in Manhattan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the auction, in the auditorium of the Armenian Diocese,
Second Avenue and 34th Street, A.M. Cassandre's dynamically
mechanistic hymns to modern transportation _ the Nord Express
railroad poster of 1927 and the Normandie ocean-liner poster of
1935 _ are each expected to sell for $7,000 to $9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Shargel, Rennert's associate, does not expect much
disruption at the high end from the turmoil on Wall Street. ``We
always sell the best items,'' she said. ``People who have $50,000
or $100,000 to spend still have it.''
</P>
<P>
   For those with a little less, $200 will buy one of Tomoko Miho's
elegant 1968 posters saluting New York City, sponsored by Container
Corp. of America. These images recall the suavity and confidence _
however illusory _ of the era of Mayor John Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which was then quite new,
dominates one poster as a high-contrast black image against a
ruby-red sky, compressed by a telephoto lens into abstract
intersecting arcs and angles. Aligned vertically with the bridge
tower is the caption ``65 bridges to new york,'' all in lower-case
Helvetica type.
</P>
<P>
   Less legible but even more evocative of the period are the
posters produced in San Francisco for rock concerts at the Fillmore
West and Avalon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   A three-box set of 300 small posters, from 1966 to 1971, will be
offered at the Nov. 8 auction. Rennert estimated the price at
$10,000 to $12,000 and expects that a museum will buy the set.
</P>
<P>
   While it is said that anyone who can remember the '60s probably
wasn't there, it is difficult not to feel transported by the sheer
infuriating exuberance and urgency of these posters.
</P>
<P>
   They almost defy the viewer to decipher them, and certainly
suggest that the task would be best done in an altered state of
consciousness. Letter forms are fattened into thick slabs or loopy
balloons, looking less like Roman type than Sanskrit characters
that have been inflated with a tire pump.
</P>
<P>
   For a February 1967 concert by Moby Grape, the artist Victor
Moscoso created a Neptune figure in neon-bright raspberry,
shimmering in high contrast against an electric blue sea. Wrapped
around him is a great fish, as orange as Tang, whose scales spell
out ``Neptune's Nation'' and whose mouth encircles a nymph.
</P>
<P>
   One month later, for a dance concert called the Eye Ball,
Moscoso devised a multilayered diamond framing an eyeball. After a
few moments' study, the layers of the diamond reveal themselves as
letters: ``Big Brother and the Holding Company / The Charlatans /
Blue Cheer.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also in 1967 that Glaser's poster of Bob Dylan could be
bought for the price of an LP album. ``When I was in college, we
all had this pinned up,'' Bixenman said. ``At the end of the term,
we all threw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   A year or two ago, seeing the poster for sale at Poster America,
Glaser stopped, introduced himself and asked the price. He was
amazed to hear the figure. ``You would think that this would not be
one of the world's scarcest posters,'' he said. ``I mean, they
printed 6 or 7 million of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the poster was scarce enough that even its designer
was bereft of a copy in good condition. ``I really didn't have any
left except for one very beat-up, torn version,'' Glaser said.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, he received a Dylan poster from Poster
America _ at no charge. ``I gave it to him,'' Bixenman said. ``I
thought if anyone should have it, he should have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bixenman expects 35 American and European dealers at the fair,
which runs through Sunday. Admission is $30 for three days, $15 for
two days or $10 for one day. More information on the fair is
available at www.posterfair.com or (212) 206-0499, and on the
auction at www.posterauction.com or (212) 787-4000.

BUDGET HOLDS PERKS FOR MISSOURI, KANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   WASHINGTON _ Smaller than a set of
encyclopedias, but larger than the New York City telephone
directory, the budget passed by Congress this week is also a
textbook of parochial concerns.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas got $6 million, for instance, to help build a new public
policy center at the University of Kansas and name it after former
Sen. Bob Dole. Missouri, meanwhile, got $7 million to pay for a
new, state-of-the-art juvenile records system.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas also received $4 million to renovate the Topeka
elementary school that figured in the landmark Brown vs. Board of
Education Supreme Court case. And Missouri also got $2.5 million
that will help restore Kansas City's Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes.
</P>
<P>
   Littered among the big-ticket, national spending priorities,
such as money for Bosnian peacekeeping and aid to farmers, is a
host of earmarks for local projects. The roughly $500 billion
measure was crafted in a headlong rush to avoid a government
shutdown and allow Congress to leave town to campaign. Many
members, even as they voted for the bill, were disgusted with the
process.
</P>
<P>
   While he was happy to get money for farmers, Sen. Sam Brownback,
a Kansas Republican, said, ``A half trillion dollars in spending
was put together at the last minute with five people in the room,
and then we get less than 24 hours to look at the bill. This is
just not the way to run a democracy...and I really had to think
long and hard on whether or not to support the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats united behind President Clinton and presented a
unified front on the budget. They trumpeted priorities such as
education spending, and blasted the Republicans, who control
Congress, for causing the last-minute, breakneck pace of
negotiations needed to keep the government open .
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to the Republican leadership, we've worked the fewest
days and passed the fewest bills in decades,'' said Democratic Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader. ``We
didn't even pass a budget resolution in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest howls came from within the Republican
Party's own ranks. Many members were critical of their own
leadership for giving away too much to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican and one of several
senators from both parties to vote against the spending bill, said
in a statement that the bill was ``a win for liberal
tax-and-spend.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a press release from the National Republican
Congressional Committee, Rep. John Linder of Georgia, who is
chairman of the group, said, ``The Republican Congress once again
won a victory for the American taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, the projects that got money in the measure
included:
</P>
<P>
   $4.5 million _ Statewide purchase of buses, vans and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   $2.5 million _ Buses, vans and equipment for the Older Adults
Transportation Service, which serves seniors and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   $2 million _ Guadalupe Center, Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   $1.9 million _ Air-traffic control tower improvements at Lambert
Field in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   $1 million _ Intelligent Transportation System, which monitors
highways and gets information to drivers about problems. Half goes
to the Kansas City area, half goes to the state.
</P>
<P>
   $1 million _ Commuter rail study, half for a planning along
Interstate 35 in the Kansas City area, half for planning in St.
Louis, Jefferson City and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   $750,000 _ Improvements to Thornberry Center for Youth and
Families in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   $500,000 _ Missouri Department of Conservation's Discovery
Center planned for Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, the projects that got money include:
</P>
<P>
   $2 million _ Construction of Johnson County bus garage and
maintenance facility.
</P>
<P>

FATTENING OF AMERICA: 55% NOW OVERWEIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   _ The United States is now the fattest
nation on earth.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And if we keep on eating the way we do now, by 2030 everyone in
America will be obese.
</P>
<P>
   The national epidemic of obesity is at such a crisis that it
demands urgent attention by medical professionals, the government
and the public.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message repeated again and again this week by
experts at the American Dietetic Association's annual meeting in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   They came armed with statistics and a missionary zeal to enlist
dietitians as front-line fighters in the war against obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the fattest we've ever been,'' said Sachiko Tokunaga de
St. Jeor, director of the nutrition research and education program
at the University of Nevada. ``Obesity is the No. 1 malnutrition
problem in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of American adults who are overweight or obese
has risen from about 43 percent in the early 1960s to about 55
percent today. The average man now weighs 25 pounds more than men
of his great-grandfather's generation.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the obesity epidemic can be found in our culture
of abundance and inactivity, said the experts on causes and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a society in which people drive instead of walk, fast
food is available 24 hours a day, children are bombarded with
advertisements for junk food, and one-quarter of all the vegetables
we eat are french fries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American, particularly children, recognizes
`supersize' as a verb,'' said Yale University psychologist Kelly
Brownell, referring to the term for ordering larger portions of
french fries at McDonald's restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The health effects of obesity have been staggering. The
condition causes 75 percent of all diabetes cases in the United
States and is responsible for half the high blood pressure cases
and half the cases of abnormal cholesterol levels, according to
figures cited at the meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of treating obesity-related diseases adds up to $52
billion per year, according to estimates cited by the National
Institutes of Health. When indirect costs of obesity, such as lost
productivity, are added in, the sum approaches $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the past many doctors did not consider obesity a medical
problem and left its treatment to fad diet promoters, said Louis
Aronne, clinical professor of medicine at Cornell University
Medical College. He was one of the speakers at the Dietetic
Association meeting.
</P>
<P>
   New research on the biological basis of obesity and the urgency
of the epidemic have changed their perspective, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in June the American Heart Association put obesity
alongside smoking, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and
sedentary lifestyle on its list of major modifiable risk factors
for heart attack and coronary heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity treatment ``has been on the fringe on the infomercials;
now it's moving into prime time,'' Aronne said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of diet drugs are being developed so that one day doctors
will be ``capable of controlling body weight completely,'' he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Until that time, however, doctors and their patients will have
to give up the idea of turning overweight people into sleek hard
bodies and settle for more modest and attainable weight loss,
experts said.  &LR; brk:No quick cure  &LR; tx:Obesity is a chronic disease
that requires regular medical treatment and a lifelong commitment
by patients to control their weight. People who quickly lose large
amounts of weight typically gain it all back in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all tried to get (obese patients) down to skinny little
people, and that's impossible,'' said John Foreyt, a psychologist
at Baylor College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep patient expectations realistic....None of us is in the
business of cosmetics. We're in the business of helping patients
improve their health.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing 10 percent of one's weight is a realistic initial goal,
said F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, director of the obesity research center
at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But even dropping five or 10 pounds can be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small and achievable weight loss can have a major impact on
health risks,'' said Pi-Sunyer.
</P>
<P>
   Pi-Sunyer was chairman of a federal panel of experts that issued
guidelines in June on the diagnosis and treatment of obesity.
</P>
<P>
   According to the panel, people are considered overweight if
their body mass indexes, a comparison of weight to height, are 25
or over. Anyone with an index of 30 or higher is considered obese.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a person who is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 164
pounds has an index of 25. If that person weighs 197 pounds, the
index is 30.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that moderately overweight people should
at least try to stabilize their weight. If they have other medical
conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes, they should
lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   For obese people, the report said, weight loss is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Between the ages of 20 and 60, we gain an average of half a
pound per year. But being overweight is afflicting people of all
ages.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of overweight children have a medical complication
such as elevated cholesterol, triglycerides or insulin levels, a
new study shows, said William Dietz of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Children have been losing opportunities for physical activity
because their parents are less likely to let them walk to school,
and schools are less likely to emphasize physical education, Dietz
said.
</P>
<P>
   The more television children watch, the more likely they are to
be obese, Dietz said. And the TV-obesity relationship has grown
stronger in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly also are joining the ranks of the obese in greater
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When many people think of elderly persons, they think of tiny,
frail people,'' said Gordon Jensen, associate professor of medicine
at Vanderbilt University. ``They're actually frail, big people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen is conducting research on more than 12,500 elderly
residents of rural Pennsylvania, about one third of whom are obese.
He has found that as their weight goes up, so does the likelihood
that the person has trouble walking or climbing stairs, or even
getting into and out of a car.
</P>
<P>
   These elderly, he said, ``are often trapped in their homes,
can't bathe themselves, can't dress themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   People who are obese in old age tended to be overweight and
sedentary in middle age as well and continued gaining weight into
their 50s and 60s, Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bode well for the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess who's right behind them? The baby boomers. We're going
to be looking at greater and greater numbers of obese elderly
people,'' Jensen said. ``Vast numbers of older persons are going to
suffer the consequences of obesity.''  &LR; brk:Often overlooked
 &LR; tx:Just as the overweight often face social discrimination, they
also are slighted by government and by private health plans when
they seek medical help for their condition, said Judith Stern, a
nutrition professor at the University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health spends $100 million per year
on obesity research, she said. But that amount is dwarfed by the $1
billion spent on cardiovascular disease research and the $2 billion
spent on cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies often will not cover obesity treatment, she
said. In many cases doctors helping a patient lose weight may have
to seek reimbursement by treating the patient's obesity-related
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare and Medicaid do not cover obesity treatment, Stern
said. The armed services do not offer treatment for obesity, but
the condition can lead to a less-than-honorable discharge, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity treatment is one of just two categories of medical care
the Internal Revenue Service has ruled ineligible for tax
deductions, Stern said. The other category is cosmetic plastic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But however much medical treatment becomes available to
individual patients, it won't stop the obesity epidemic, Brownell
of Yale said. To do that, there must be social action to change the
country's ``toxic food environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This environment has been created by a food industry that
encourages people to eat too much of the wrong foods, Brownell
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, fast food is being offered in school lunchrooms,
Brownell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we do anything worse in our schools? This is second only
to having cigarette machines in our schools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownell proposed changing America's eating habits by levying a
tax on junk food and offering fruit and vegetables at a government
subsidized discount.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for regulating food advertising, particularly to
children, the same way tobacco advertising is controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think children should be exposed to Ronald McDonald
any more than to Joe Camel,'' he said.

AFRICA DESERVES BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   _ The woes of Africa can be surreal in
their horror.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are droughts that turn whole regions to ash, and
visitations by locust swarms so immense they block the sun and
leave crop fields as bare as slate.
</P>
<P>
   There are flies whose larva, deposited through a bite, migrate
to the eyes and destroy sight. And a worm, the Guinea worm, that
enters a wound on the foot and grows as long as the leg of its
human host.
</P>
<P>
   There are eruptions of genocidal fury so ugly and so often that,
for the most part, the world can only look away in sorrow and
revulsion.
</P>
<P>
   There is the ancient torment, malaria, present now in strains
resistant to the commonly used drugs. And there's the new plague,
AIDS, whose virus infects such appalling numbers in some parts of
Africa that it's impossible to imagine how the spread can be
halted, or even slowed.
</P>
<P>
   Not many years ago there was that wretched Central African
Republic, ruled by a self-proclaimed emperor, a cannibal who
literally ate his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and
potentially one of its richest _ so wrecked by the succession of
generals who've brutalized and looted it that much of its
population, especially in rural areas, has been reduced to hopeless
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And poverty explains the hellish catastrophe of recent days, in
which gasoline flowing from a pipeline valve opened by thieves
ignited, incinerating at least 500 villagers, possibly many more.
</P>
<P>
   The dead, it was reported, were using cups and cooking vessels
to dip from a lake of spilled gas when a spark touched off the
inferno. Nigeria produces 2 million barrels of crude oil a day, but
because its refineries are broken and derelict it must import
gasoline, which common people cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   The top police official of the region dismissed the victims as
people who ``came digging for free gold'' and ``got buried.''
Compassion like that is typical of thugs with a little power.
</P>
<P>
   I've been three times to Nigeria as a journalist. Except for a
few friends there _ decent people, who deserve better _ there's
nothing else about the place I find appealing.
</P>
<P>
   My last visit, nine years ago, was like a Hadean dream. The poor
were building their cooking fires in the unfinished concrete
cubicles of high-rise office buildings _ projects abandoned when
corruption had emptied the public treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Huge bridges vaulted partway out over brackish lagoons, then
stopped where the money ran out.
</P>
<P>
   The army at night rented its weapons to highway bandits. The day
I left, the air of the capital stank with burning rubber from tires
in roadblocks thrown up in some futile protest.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, an old woman ticketed on our flight was found to
be carrying an infant that had been eviscerated and sewn full of
heroin. And the last sounds I heard before boarding the plane were
the falsetto whinnies and screeches of a man who'd been dragged
from the waiting area to be beaten by police for no evident reason.
</P>
<P>
   The fire that consumed those unfortunate villagers, awful as it
was, was but a small part of the greater fire of failure that has
devoured their country and wrecked its hopes.
</P>
<P>
   For more than half my lifetime I've loved Africa with a passion.
But if I never go back to Nigeria again it will be soon enough.

CHANGE MAY BE SNEAKING UP ON YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   Is there any worker left in America who
doesn't know by now that there are no guarantees?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lifetime employment? Pffft. Insulation from downsizing? Forget
it. Ownership stability? Gone with the wind. Technological advances
that make future upgrades unnecessary? Ha.
</P>
<P>
   The only possible guarantee is change.
</P>
<P>
   So it's easy to be cynical when someone presents himself as a
``business futurist.'' The idea that anyone could know where the
business world is heading is preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, after listening to Bob Treadway give a daylong presentation
on ``Preparing Yourself for the New Millennium'' to the Kansas City
chapter of the Institute for Management Studies, I'd bet on him
guessing right.
</P>
<P>
   Treadway knows that information is power. He devours it. He
knows what's going on today, but he also watches signals sent from
``harbinger industries.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Treadway is watching retail move to the Web. An
executive from The Gap, which Treadway says is the largest lessee
of mall real estate in the country, told him the retailer expected
20 percent of its revenue to come from Internet sales within three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that say about the future of retail stores?''
Treadway said. ``They may become demo centers. They may be places
where you try out the merchandise but don't necessarily buy.''
</P>
<P>
   For similar crystal ball reasons, Treadway pays attention to
energy companies for their moves toward product branding, to
government for outsourcing and privatization, to high-tech
companies for how they attract and keep good workers, and to
telecommunications companies for perpetual innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Treadway warns not to look just inside one's own industry for
clues to the future. Competitors sweep in from unlikely angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to anticipate the razor slits of opportunity and
squeeze through the narrow openings,'' he said, referring to
industry and individual career choices.
</P>
<P>
   He said managers and organizations would succeed by being
``plate spinners'' _ by keeping options open until it's time to
focus. In addition to watching ``bleeding edge'' industries,
Treadway suggests broad-based reading and viewing. He recommends:
</P>
<P>
   Paying attention to new science fiction, especially books by
William Gibson and David Brin, and movies such as ``Gattaca,''
``Johnny Mnemonic,'' ``Disclosure,'' ``Trigger Point,''
``Sneakers,'' ``Demolition Man'' and ``Blade Runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading your daily newspaper and at least the section fronts of
a daily paper with a circulation of 1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Reading a weekly business magazine. He likes /{The Economist/}.
</P>
<P>
   Reading a monthly business magazine. He suggests /{Fortune/} or
/{Forbes/}.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribing to an executive summary newsletter. He favors
``Executive Book Summaries'' and ``Bottom Line Business.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading future-looking publications. His top picks are /{The
Futurist/}, /{Fast Company/} and /{Wired/} magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribing to on-line news clipping services. Explore search
engines to find one that you can tailor most efficiently to meet
your needs.
</P>
<P>
   Watching ESPN2 and MTV. The younger generation _ your workplace
competition _ is.
</P>
<P>
   And, even if you can manage all that, don't think you've got the
future figured out. Stay ready for unexpected change.

   BYE WEEK: Giants, Arizona, Dallas, Philadelphia, Washington and
Indianapolis
</P>
<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK:
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (5-1) vs. Denver (6-0) (Sunday, 4 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Jaguars (2) _ rushing ranking. Broncos (1) _ rushing
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: These teams have met four times previously, all at Mile
High Stadium. The last two were intriguing. In the '96 season's
playoffs, Jacksonville strode into Denver and shocked the Broncos,
30-27. Then in last year's playoffs, Denver got its payback,
crushing the Jaguars by 42-17. Terrell Davis (865 rushing yards,
more than 22 National Football League teams) is pitted against the
Jaguars rookie back Fred Taylor (5.7 yards a carry). That makes the
running matchup fun. John Elway is penciled in against Mark
Brunell. That makes the passing battle more fun. Because of a bye
last weekend, Denver enjoyed two weeks of preparation. That is too
much for the Jaguars to overcome. Broncos, 28-20.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (5-1) vs. Jets (3-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Falcons (110-46) _ second-half scores.
</P>
<P>
   Jets (43.4 percent) _ third-down conversion rate.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Falcons have never been 6-1. There are reasons they
are 5-1. Among them: they have won five of their last seven on the
road, they lead the NFL in possession time (33:06), Jamal Anderson
has rushed for 100 yards in four consecutive games, the defense has
not allowed a 100-yard rusher in 14 straight games, and the team is
on pace to score the most points in club history. Impressive stuff.
Especially for the Falcons _ or for any team. The Jets would like
to keep their momentum going after a thrilling victory at New
England on Monday night. But the Falcons are too sound. They make
it 2-0 at Giants Stadium this year, having beaten the Giants there.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons, 19-16.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (2-4) vs. Green Bay (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Ravens (22.7) _ Jermaine Lewis average yards a catch.
Packers (minus-6) _ turnover differential.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Ravens are not finishing what they start and it is
costing them. Their attention to detail and inability to make the
big play on offense is preventing a talented team from soaring.
Green Bay knows the feeling. It has dropped two straight, in its
division no less, and returns home to Lambeau Field where it has
not lost to an AFC team since 1990. Brett Favre has 12 touchdown
passes and 10 interceptions. Not Favre-like. The Packers are down
six in the turnover game. Not Packer-like. This game heals some of
its wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 27-16.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (6-0) vs. Detroit (2-4)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Vikings (7-6) _ Green's record vs. Lions. Lions
(319.8) _ Average ysrds allowed.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Viking coach Dennis Green has had his share of problems
with the Lions. Most teams do with this roller-coaster squad once
it is in the noisy Pontiac Silverdome. And this is a surprise: the
Lions allow fewer yards per game on defense than Minnesota does.
What works in the Vikings favor this time is a league-best plus 9
in turnover differential. And with a league-most 12 interceptions,
maybe the Vikings can harass rookie quarterback Charlie Batch into
mistakes. Don't count on it. Batch is for real and so are the Lions
in these do-or-die conference games at home. They have toppled
Tampa Bay and Green Bay in the Silverdome and now add the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Lions, 20-17.
</P>
<P>
   New England (4-2) vs. Miami (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Patriots (3) _ `97 victories over Miami.; Dolphins
(11.7) _ Average points. allowed per game.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Patriots were all over the Dolphins last year,
beating them twice in the regular seasons, including the season
finale. And then the following week they met again in the playoffs
and Miami lost again. Well, Miami hasn't forgotten. And it has a
defense to do something about it. It has two shutouts this year,
best in the league, and has allowed the fewest points (70) in the
league. Look for strong running from Miami back Karim Abdul-Jabbar.
He has six TD runs vs. New England, his most against any team.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, 17-13.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (5-1) vs. St. Louis (2-4)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: 49ERS (0) _ Turnover differential; Rams (0) _ Turnover
differential.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Well, the Rams and 49ers are evenly matched; they are
equal in turnover differential. Yeah, right. This series is so
lopsided that the 49ers are on a cliff and the Rams are in a
dungeon and guess who is looking down? San Francisco has won 15
straight in this series. One would think a blocked kick or fumbled
ball or wide field goal, something would have gone the Rams' way at
the end to win one of those 15. Oh, well. Make it 16. And in the
process watch Jerry Rice become the NFL's all-time leader in
consecutive games with at least one catch. One catch and Rice will
break Monk's mark of 183.
</P>
<P>
   49ers 34-3.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (3-3) vs. New Orleans (3-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Buccaneers (2) _ Rushing TDs allowed. Saints (9) _
Interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Saints coach Mike Ditka is 9-1 in home games vs. Tampa
Bay and 17-3 overall. But that was when Ditka was coach of the
Bears, when Tampa Bay was in his division and when the Bears were
great and the Bucs were duds. Ditka will find a new blood with the
Bucs, a fresher, faster team on defense. The offense remains stale
but the defense will handle the Saints and win this game in
dominating fashion. They make it tough on New Orleans on first
downs and in the Red Zone, especially.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers, 16-10.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES:
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (2-5) vs. Tennessee (3-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Bears (42) _ Rushing first downs. Oilers (4-0) _ Vs.
NFC in `97.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Both teams enter on high notes. The Bears upset Dallas
at home by 13-12 and Tennessee smashed Cincinnati by 44-14. The
Oilers' offense finally began to click and show in results what
appears to be so much promise. With Steve McNair at quarterback and
Eddie George in the backfield along with Yancey Thigpen at
receiver, no defense should shut down the Oilers. That is simply
too much talent not to move the football. And now the Oilers are
doing it. George has three 100-yard rushing efforts in his last
four games. Tennessee is 11-4 when George rushes for 100 yards. He
will get that against the Bears and the Oilers prime themselves for
a strong sprint in the season's second half.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers, 23-9.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (2-4) vs. Oakland (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Bengals (2) _ Turnovers committed. Raiders (45.4) _
Donald Hollas' qb rating.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Bengals are a strange franchise and they are having
a strange season. They have committed an NFL-low 2 turnovers this
season. They are plus 5 in turnover differential. Winning the
turnover battle is supposed to mean victories. It is not that way
for the Bengals. Too much shoddy play in other areas. Not enough
big plays in big time. The Raiders are continuing to improve. Their
defense is making wonderful strides. It allowed 381.3 yards per
game in its first six games a year ago. The Raiders have shaved
that to 262.8 yards per game through six this season. That is a
huge jump. Look for Oakland to keep trucking.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 17-11.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (3-3) vs. San Diego (3-4)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Seahawks (13.2) _ Average. points. allowed. Chargers
(72.0) _ Average. rushing yards. allowed.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: _ Seattle had a bye week to contemplate its furious
start and then dismal skid. The thinking time was much needed. This
is a group of players whose attention span has long been
questioned. Talented, no question, but committed, focused,
prepared? It's been hit or miss with this bunch. June Jones is the
Chargers' new coach and as a result we should continue to see a
more relaxed and improving Ryan Leaf at quarterback. But for Leaf,
this game will provide more growing pains. The Seahawks will be
hot.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks, 31-10.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (3-3) vs. Carolina (0-6)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Bills (10-5) _ Flutie's record as starter. Panthers
(11) _ Kevin Greene sacks.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Buffalo has won three straight and now looks like a
contender in the AFC East. This is a small miracle. There were so
many changes in Buffalo during the offseason _ coach, quarterback,
running back _ that the Bills looked as if they would need a year
just to settle down before being able to truly compete. But fresh
from beating previously unbeaten Jacksonville and from quarterback
Doug Flutie's heroics, Buffalo knows that it is quite capable of
beating most AFC teams. We can't say that about Carolina. What can
be said about the Panthers? High hopes mangled. A quarterback
(Kerry Collins) who was the franchise who is now no longer in town.
A winless team. It remains that way.
</P>
<P>
   Bills, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (4-2) vs. Kansas City (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Steelers (14.5) _ Average. points. allowed. Chiefs
(7-2) _ Record after byes.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Chiefs have not played since being punished by
40-10 at New England. That will be two weeks and one day by the
time game time rolls around. The Chiefs will be flying around at
home, spurred by the bright lights of Monday night and by the
raucous Chiefs' home crowd. Pittsburgh usually has an answer. The
Steelers are 10-3 under coach Bill Cowher on Monday nights and
often respond when pushed by pushing back. Problem is the Steelers'
offense remains too green to properly answer. This offense simply
has not meshed but should in the weeks to come. Not against the
Chiefs defense, however, which has allowed an average of 10.1
points per game at Arrowhead Stadium in its last 11 games there,
all victories. Chiefs, 23-13.

DAVID DORFMAN DANCE: LEAVE IT TO A STOCKY GUY TO DISCOVER A `CURE
FOR GRAVITY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (dl) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are two David Dorfmans. One is a choreographer
who can lift the spirit with luscious rollicking movement that
somehow communicates the great pleasure that might be felt by a
dancer who, like Dorfman, is stockier, older and less well-trained
than the norm. The other choreographer seems to hedge his bets with
words and cute humor.
</P>
<P>
   Both were present Tuesday night when David Dorfman Dance opened
a week at the Joyce Theater. The first Dorfman was evident in the
fussily reworked ``Gone Right Back.'' But the second Dorfman stole
the show with ``A Cure for Gravity,'' a handsome, boisterous and
poignant celebration of the music of Joe Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The world of ``A Cure for Gravity,'' a New York premiere, is
filled with warm orange light and dense darkness populated by six
men and women in stylish orange and cranberry-colored practice
clothes designed by Liz Prince. The curtain rises on a line of
three couples engaged in long, unbroken kissing. The dance's tone
of playfulness and fraught emotion is set in this first of six
sections, performed to racing instrumental music played on tape by
Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg on solo violin and Jackson on bongos.
</P>
<P>
   The couples tumble into new matches then part, reform and
finally scatter into a limb-thrusting tango for flung bodies. The
assembling and reassembling is a theme throughout, in
helter-skelter dance under a huge high-hanging open ladder, almost
a horizontal stairway through the air, that shifts slowly as the
piece progresses. The dancers bound and scamper with exhilarating
unexpectedness into geometric patterns, diagonals and half-circles
that seem to enclose a community's central, sacred dancing ground.
</P>
<P>
   Dorfman's changing presence is another motif. At one point, he
is simply a thick, bullet-shaped body exuberantly keeping up with
the others. At another, he is a distanced observer whose
ruminations are communicated silently to the audience in the
dancing he has given his five charges, his half-smile as sly as the
taped vocals by Suzanne Vega and Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Melancholy settles in, as does more complex physical
communication, the shifts signaled in part by the gradual revealing
of a backdrop, ink-blue and mottled. Reclining partners gently
manipulate each other's limbs, as if exploring how they work. Blown
kisses become lascivious, and an angry physicality takes over
briefly. At the end, a woman climbs up clustered bodies to reach
toward the unattainable stairway and sky; she rolls down, followed
by another woman.
</P>
<P>
   There is a post-apocalyptic feel to ``A Cure for Gravity.'' Its
enjoyably unself-conscious mix of same-sex and heterosexual couples
suggests the dance might almost be unfolding in a world changed by
the recent killing of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming. Full of
possibilities, the piece was made all the richer by the first-rate
performances of Jeanine Durning, Curt Haworth, Hetty King, Lisa
Race, Tom Thayer and Dorfman. The set was by Christopher Plant, the
backdrop by Andy Benavides and the lighting by Chloe Brown.

 &HT;    Andre Braugher one complex character
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 25: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's Pembleton-ish. Not that many people would notice. Until
Andre Braugher won a dramatic actor Emmy this year for his role as
Detective Frank Pembleton on NBC's critically acclaimed,
little-watched ``Homicide: Life on the Street,'' he was TV's best,
littlest-known actor.
</P>
<P>
   Even winning the Emmy hasn't raised his public profile that much
yet _ he jumped the show at the end of last season and won't appear
on TV again until early next year, when he stars in movies on TNT
and Showtime. He also co-stars with Alec Baldwin in the independent
feature ``Thick as Thieves,'' due out this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm racing from project to project. Trying to strike while the
iron is hot,'' he says of his post-Emmy career.
</P>
<P>
   How hot is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hotter than it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   For six years, Braugher, 36, created in the prickly, principled
Pembleton TV's most compelling male character _ not its sexiest
(George Clooney, Jimmy Smits and Noah Wyle are the ranking body
heat), not its grittiest (Dennis Franz drunk, Dennis Franz shot,
Dennis Franz naked), not its coolest (David Duchovny).
</P>
<P>
   Braugher inhabited a character so complex he almost couldn't be
categorized: a detective who went by the book, except when he threw
the book out; who could make an innocent man confess as deftly as
he could shake the truth from a guilty one; whose religious
conviction ran so deep he tested it far more than he trusted it.
</P>
<P>
   TV has produced few characters as dense and enigmatic as Frank
Pembleton. His scenes in ``the Box'' _ the ``Homicide''
interrogation room _ were TV's gold standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you will be privileged to witness is not an
interrogation, but an act of salesmanship,'' Pembleton advised a
rookie partner in the series pilot, ``as silver-tongued and
thieving as ever moved used cars, Florida swampland or Bibles. But
what I am selling is a long prison term _ for a client who has no
genuine use for the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Pembleton sold his ``client'' a prison term in that episode and
did the same in many memorable others. But because the show has
been a long-running ratings cripple, more people could tell you the
make of Don Johnson's car in ``Nash Bridges'' (yellow '71 Barracuda
convertible) than could tell you anything at all about Braugher in
``Homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people say, `Yo, Pembleton,''' Braugher says of his
off-screen life.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles. Braugher exists beyond Pembleton, of course, even if
it takes a minute to convince yourself of that when you first meet
him.
</P>
<P>
   He's in priest robes on this humid
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, standing in the parking lot outside a Stone Mountain,
Georgia basketball gym, where he's filming the TNT movie ``Passing
Glory.'' It's the true story of Father Paul Verrett (played by
Braugher), who in 1965 organized the first basketball game in New
Orleans between two undefeated Catholic high schools, one all-black
and one all-white. Co-starring Rip Torn and directed by Steve James
(``Hoop Dreams''), ``Passing Glory'' is scheduled to air in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Braugher's face is big and round and dark as a new moon (``You
could stare at his face forever and keep asking questions,'' series
co-star Michelle Forbes once said), and his easy smile is what his
wife, actress Ami Brabson (also his on-screen ``Homicide'' wife),
has called ``the most winning smile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to our show. Can I get you a drink of water?''
Braugher greets a visitor, smiling. His tone is welcoming and
at-ease-putting, but also a kind of sly test of how far you'll let
this friendliness go. It's how Pembleton might greet a visitor if
he was playing Braugher.
</P>
<P>
   The two are not unalike. Both have an intense kind of smarts and
ooze an uncommon integrity. Neither is the easiest cat to get a
bead on. Braugher has been called ``regal,'' ``naturally
commanding,'' a guy who ``disdains false intimacies'' _ flattering,
but at-arm's-length descriptions that could just as easily apply to
Pembleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not intimidating to me, but some people are put off by
the sheer force of his intelligence,'' Richard Belzer allowed of
Braugher during their ``Homicide'' days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of the man comes through, and in Andre it was the
perfect role,'' adds David Rosemont, co-executive producer of
``Passing Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of four kids raised in a blue-collar household in
Chicago, Braugher attended Stanford University as a pre-med
student, with a second major in mechanical engineering. He got
onstage by accident: A friend asked him to be a last-minute fill-in
as Claudius in a student production of ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried out, got the part, learned all my lines in days and
did it. And it was terrible. But I felt alive for the first time. I
switched my major (to drama) right then and there.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to get a master's degree from the Juilliard School in
1988. His career started immediately: stage (various Shakespeare
productions), TV (Telly Savalas' sidekick on ``Kojak''), film
(1989's ``Glory'').
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Los Angeles from New York to cash in on his small
but visible role in ``Glory'' as Thomas Searles, an idealistic
young soldier from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out (to Los Angeles) and sat by the phone, waiting for
something to happen. And nothing did.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned East to audition in 1991 for ``Homicide,'' a gritty
detective series put together by Oscar-winning director Barry
Levinson and Tom Fontana. Levinson said Braugher had the part after
reading four lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre is one of those actors who makes me think I'm a better
writer than I am,'' Fontana has said.
</P>
<P>
   The part had everything Braugher wants in a role: complexity,
keen language, lots of untidy drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play complex, contradictory men,'' Braugher says.
``(Pembleton) was a family man who liked standing over dead bodies
(talking) with cops on a cold March night. He was a devout Catholic
who rejects the church. A con man and manipulator who was loyal and
loving. His life was ebb and flow and tug _ like in our lives. He
wasn't jumping over walls with a shiny Magnum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of heroes (on TV): They spot the oil on the
crankcase, which leads to the warehouse where the bad guys are. I
don't understand them. It's impossible to play something that
pure.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite critical raves (he received two previous Emmy
nominations, and TV Guide once gushed, ``If there's anyone doing
better dramatic acting on TV these days, we haven't seen it''),
Braugher says his ``Homicide'' work didn't accelerate his career.
He got supporting roles in such features as ``Primal Fear,'' ``Get
on the Bus'' and ``City of Angels'' and continued working on the
stage, where he won an Obie (best off-Broadway) for the title role
in Shakespeare's ``Henry V.''
</P>
<P>
   But Braugher left ``Homicide'' at the end of the series' sixth
season, before he received his overdue Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to grow up and expand. It's easy to ossify as an
actor,'' he says. ``I loved working on (`Homicide'). But in 2015,
if you don't watch out, you can be like Peter Falk or Telly
Savalas, trapped in a character.''
</P>
<P>
   The Emmy finally has Braugher's phone ringing (he was so dazed
by his Emmy win he recalls thinking ``all these people are staring,
I better walk up. And then this beautiful, oddly familiar woman
handed me (a statue). I later realized it was Halle Berry''). Two
days after ``Homicide'' wrapped production last spring, he began
filming on ``Thick as Thieves.'' He then went to work on Showtime's
``Love Stories,'' a trilogy in which he directs one episode and
stars with Lynn Whitfield in another.
</P>
<P>
   This month he's been in Atlanta filming TNT's ``Passing Glory,''
co-written by acclaimed screenwriter John Sayles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like manna from heaven,'' says Andre Carey, TNT's
vice president of original programming, of landing Braugher. ``It's
no great leap to know what a great actor he is, and now he's
getting the attention he deserves. Makes us look like geniuses.''
</P>
<P>
   But Braugher's notions of success are unconventional in an
industry famous for ego and excess. He once told an interviewer he
hadn't seen the blockbusters ``Independence Day'' or ``The Rock''
because he didn't believe either was ``an honest movie.'' He's fine
with being a star _ but on his own terms. It can't take him away
from his wife and two sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably a cool place to be in,'' says actor Bill Nunn
(``Do the Right Thing''), also in ``Passing Glory,'' of Braugher's
respected place just below stardom's real heat. ``He doesn't have
to work on going out. He can do what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   He does. Braugher moved his family during his ``Homicide'' stint
from New York to Baltimore, where the series was filmed. He says
his was the only first marriage on the set. He has since moved the
family back to suburban New Jersey. He won't live in Los Angeles,
where he'd likely have more TV and film opportunities, unless
Brabson has to move there for her own career. She moved to
Baltimore for him; he'll move anywhere for her. He'd like to return
to TV next season, in a New York-based show, so he can go home
every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a family man _ I like to tuck the kids into bed, make the
PTA meetings,'' he says. ``(The Emmy) was a lovely token of my
peers' esteem and validation for the hard work I've put into my
craft. But it taught me to realize all the simple and beautiful
things I have in my life. If I was a miserable man with an Emmy, it
wouldn't make up for having an Emmy. I never want the profession to
overburden the more important aspects of my life. If I reach the
pinnacle and go home to an empty house, I've failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking out for 2015, when we (Braugher and Brabson) can
look back when we're 50, when the boys are grown, and say we spent
positive time with them, taught them the lessons that needed to be
taught. If I can look back and say that, we've been successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done,'' he then says suddenly and walks away across the
parking lot. Very ... Pembleton-ish.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Book review isn't poetry, but it is rhyme and reason
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 25: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edmund Wilson, as usual, said it with magisterial finality. For
114 days, beginning in the fall of 1962, a printers' strike left
New Yorkers without a daily newspaper _ and there were more dailies
then than now. It meant no sports pages, no stock market pages, no
crossword puzzles and, among other deprivations, no New York Times
Book Review. It no sooner was gone than Wilson said its
disappearance ``only made us realize it had never existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Into the breach came a fledgling biweekly calling itself The New
York Review of Books. It has been there 35 years this month, with
the same editors (Robert B. Silvers and Barbara Epstein), the same
distinctive covers and long blocks of type, the same brilliant
caricatures by David Levine.
</P>
<P>
   The strike was settled, the delivery trucks sent back out on
their routes and the Times Book Review returned to its role as
stolid bellwether of the book world. But the New York Review had
created a forum of its own, one in which books were the vehicle for
discussion of the full range of American intellectual life _ poetry
and science, art and politics, fiction and history. The New
Statesman, a good magazine gone to its grave, called its founding
``of more cultural import than the opening of the Lincoln Center.''
</P>
<P>
   The first issue sold out immediately. Here was a new kind of
magazine, one that took itself seriously but took its readers
seriously as well. It assumed they in fact were readers _ that they
were comfortable with ideas and had come to its pages with an
active intelligence, not the blank passivity that daily journalism
insists on assuming.
</P>
<P>
   And its editors and writers brought to those pages something
else: a political stance that started well to the left and has
never wavered. During the Vietnam War years, there was no more
committed opponent of American involvement than the New York
Review. The most famous cover in its history must be the one of
Aug. 24, 1967. During the midst of urban rioting, the New York
Review was showing its readers how to make a Molotov cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   The New Left and Old Left had already parted ways, but the
cocktail cover ended all hope of reconciliation. It moved Tom
Wolfe, who earlier called it ``The New York Review of Bores,'' to
declare it ``the chief theoretical organ of Radical Chic.''
</P>
<P>
   Home to nation's best writers
</P>
<P>
   But no one has ever doubted its standing as the leading
intellectual journal in the country. From the outset, it attracted
many of the country's best writers and thinkers and gave them acres
of space. The 35th anniversary issue finds Joan Didion reviewing
the Kenneth Starr report (accompanied by a Levine drawing of a
cigar-chomping Monica Lewinsky). In the same issue J.M. Coetzee
writes on ``Collected Fictions'' by Jorge Luis Borges; Louis Menand
reviews Norman Mailer's new novel, ``The Time of Our Time''; Alma
Guillermoprieto reviews three memoirs of Fidel Castro (one of them
out of print) and the Cuban revolution; and Luc Sante considers the
Walker Evans photography exhibition ``New York.'' Those five pieces
alone, most of them several thousand words in length, make up
barely a quarter of an issue that is vintage NYRB.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a magazine in which the reviewer gives a quick thumbs
up or thumbs down. Rather, as James Wolcott wrote recently in The
New York Times, its purpose is to have ``issues and authors
settled, sentenced and roped in a bag.''
</P>
<P>
   But the trials are not swift. The review may be the only
publication left (with the possible exception of Hungry Mind
Review) that doesn't recognize attention-deficit disorder. In the
35th anniversary issue, the legal scholar Ronald Dworkin wrote what
must be 6,000 words on ``The Shape of the River,'' William Bowen
and Derek Bok's densely statistical defense of affirmative action
in American colleges. (At least Dworkin _ unlike the Magi of many
editorial pages _ actually read the thing.) It is tough sledding,
and then, at the bottom of the last column of type, one comes upon
these words: ``This is the first of two articles.''
</P>
<P>
   A loyal following after 35 years
</P>
<P>
   If you wonder what market there could still be for a magazine so
chockablock with type, consider this: Thirty-five years after its
first issue, paid circulation is 124,538 and the average length of
subscription is eight years. More telling, the typical subscriber
reports spending an average of two hours reading each issue.
Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   No one could deny that the salutes accorded the New York Review
are well earned, and yet it is the third cheer that is given
halfheartedly. Five years ago, on the occasion of its 30th
birthday, I wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``For all its brilliance, its intelligence, its willingness to
ignore convention, The New York Review is a magazine that never
charms. To say so is to express more regret than dissatisfaction.
You can ask for too much, I suppose. It avoids all the sins of
everyday journalism _ the schmaltziness, the glibness, the numbing
idiocy _ but the words never quite rise off the page. They lie
there inert. They never shout, but neither do they sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words may not sing either. They are only a plea for an
occasional melody in a magazine that, once gone, will be missed
indeed. For now, one must say it's aging magnificently.

 &HT;    Girl's letters to `big big world' yield book of intriguing
replies
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_If the Coca-Cola Co. had printed menorahs on its soda
cans during the holidays, Naomi Shavin might still be waiting for
her 15 minutes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   But Coke didn't, so now the 7-year-old from Atlanta is in the
limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Naomi, who is Jewish, was feeling left out by
Coke's Santa Claus imagery. At the urging of her father, Mark, she
wrote the soft drink giant to ask why it didn't put Jewish symbols
on its cans. The company responded with a polite explanation: Coke
avoids religious symbolism, it said, and Santa's not religious.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi, then 5, was pretty impressed. She went on to write other
letters, typed by her dad for clarity, posing questions or making
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 58 letters later, Naomi has published a book called ``Naomi
Wants to Know: Letters From a Little Girl to the Big Big World''
(Fairview Press, $12.95). The book contains Naomi's letters, the
illustrations she drew to accompany them and the responses they
generated.
</P>
<P>
   -- Naomi asked Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: ``Are
you in charge of all the people in the United States of America?
Have you ever made a mistake?''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg replied: ``I am not in charge of all the people in the
United States, but I work hard to do my judging job well. And yes,
I have made many mistakes, but I try to learn from them so that I
will not make the same mistake twice.''
</P>
<P>
   -- She wrote to the National Labor Relations Board: ``I've got a
lot of problems with me and my little brother Adam. ... He talks
all the time. It keeps me up and I have nightmares that keep me up
and it's enough for me. Will you please try to solve my problems?''
</P>
<P>
   Chairman William B. Gould IV replied: ``I am not sure I can
solve the problems between you and Adam, but here are a few
suggestions. Since you are older than Adam and more grown up you
have a special leadership responsibility to show him the way. Maybe
if you are always willing to share your toys with Adam and never
hit him or pull his hair he will learn by your good example.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Naomi wrote to a homeless person at the Atlanta Union
Mission: ``I want to give you a present. ... I'm sending a Barbie.
I'd like to give you toys every weekend, but I don't have that many
to spare.''
</P>
<P>
   A girl, Irece Martin, wrote back: ``I am the one (who) got the
Barbie you sent as a gift. I just like to write you back and thank
you so much for thinking about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Naomi met Irece at the mission, and the girls played
happily.
</P>
<P>
   -- She wrote to Sen. John Glenn: ``Here's a joke for you. My
grandmother is 80 years old. I can't imagine her driving a
spaceship because she can't drive a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn replied with what appears to be a form letter, telling
Naomi that she too could travel in space. ``As long as you continue
to study and work hard you can achieve anything.''
</P>
<P>
   -- She put a note in a bottle and floated it down the
Chattahoochee: ``What's it like down the river? Do you see any
canoes?''
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, fourth-grader Dale Bailey, who lives 100 miles
downstream, replied: ``I found your letter. ... I was with my Uncle
Glenn and my dad Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Naomi wrote back to Dale, asking him to send her a
picture of him. Which he did.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi's book will hit stores this month, but Naomi seems
unaffected by the attention it's generated among her friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really that excited. My dad doesn't want me to get the
big head,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But it might be kind of hard not to.
</P>
<P>
   She's already pocketed a $3,500 advance from her publisher and
flown to Hollywood to do ``The Roseanne Show.'' The star treated
Naomi to her first limo ride, her first plane ride, a computer and
a trip to Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi will hold her first book signing from 7 to 9 tonight at
Borders Books in the Perimeter Village shopping center in Dunwoody.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Shavin, an executive producer for Fox 5 News, encouraged
his daughter to write letters shortly after she learned the
alphabet. It was a way of bonding; When Dad went home from work, he
would help Naomi practice her writing skills.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her early success in publishing, Naomi said she doesn't
want to be a writer when she grows up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a mom,'' she said. ``I'm not sure what else.''

   THE NEW ALBUM ``UP''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of this record as psychedelic. It's a good record to
listen to by yourself when you're hiding. You want to try to expand
your horizons without being a dilettante. This is not supposed to
be a record of great technical proficiency and dexterity. It's a
record of not trying to get it down perfectly, but having great
sounds and ideas come out. I just hope people give it a chance.
This is a record that takes two to three listens.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mike Mills
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't always provide these easy, hummable songs. I read an
article that said 99 percent of hit singles are midtempo ballads
about universal love. I thought, `Hey, we're fresh out of those
this time around.' It would take a complete revolution in the way
music is marketed to make a record like this be as big as a Celine
Dion record. And that's OK. I like to sell a lot of records, but
it's more important that we do something that's challenging to us,
and that will bring people along with us. As much as people seem to
want the same thing over and over _ like with Pink Floyd they want
`Dark Side of the Moon' every time _ if you give them that, then
after about three times they don't want that anymore.''
</P>
<P>

made.''

   THE SINGLE, ``DAYSLEEPER''
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked the 11 to 7 shift when I was a teenager, cooking at a
Waffle House. It's a song about someone who is a soldier ant in
this huge structure, working at night, isolated. They're working
this kind of very small but significant job in this much larger
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael Stipe
</P>
<P>
   ``The label picked it. I think they picked it because it's the
one song that might sound a little bit like R.E.M.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Peter Buck
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been really involved in picking out the singles,
but ever since we picked `E-bow the Letter' (the commercially
disappointing single from `New Adventures in Hi-Fi') well. ... The
singles we pick aren't necessarily predicated on the best
commercial use. We thought on this one, well, let's let the record
company do it.''

</P>
<P>
   GROWING OLDER
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels pretty great. I'm on top of the world. Twenty-two is
its own thing, 38 is its own thing. You can't really say that
you're happier now than you were at any other time in your life. Is
it easy to compare you at 22 with you now? I like now a lot, but I
like now then, too. I think I may have been a little more embracing
of the darker things when I was in my early 20s, but that's just
something you go through. I don't think you can put an age on
music. I don't feel that way. If other people do, well, they can.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael Stipe
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone that I went to high school with, when I see them, one
out of 10 of them buys new records. The rest of them still have the
same record collection, but now it's on CD. I'm an anomaly. I go
out and see lots of shows. I probably buy 10 records a week. I read
reviews and get excited about stuff. But generally, if I go to a
club, I am one of the older people there. And I'm not that old.
There might be one guy older than me. And you always wonder what
he's doing there.''

probably wouldn't have gotten back together. But he quit the first
day we were starting this record, basically. Between Mike (Mills)

I'm sure we might not have broken up, but we certainly would have
taken some time off and thought about things and said, `Well, let's
take a little break and see if we still want to do this.' We were
all geared up and excited about all this new stuff, and this new
approach to recording, so why quit? We had the songs written. Why
quit just because Bill doesn't want to do it anymore?''

 &HT;    Quiet and cohesive, R.E.M. in love on `Up'
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 25: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look at it this way. Now that R.E.M.'s stylistic legacy has been
recycled for the umpteenth time (check out that hopeful jangle
buoying the collegiate whimpering of current alterna-faves Sister
Hazel), why shouldn't R.E.M. recycle someone else's legacy?
</P>
<P>
   Replacing retired drummer Bill Berry with a fun house panoply of
vintage analog keyboards, percussive knickknacks and metronomic
synths, the newly defined trio has made an album that sounds like
an offhanded Kraftwerk tribute _ or electronic visionary Brian Eno,
or poppy British knob twiddlers Stereolab, or American indie-rock
stalwarts Yo La Tengo pretending to be Stereolab.
</P>
<P>
   It'll bore the pants off you the first time through, but slap on
some headphones _ as bassist/keyboardist Mike Mills suggests _ and
the music becomes progressively more involving: a core of intimate
revelation submerged in drones and pulses and waves and tweaky
smears of reverb, a harpsichord here, a stunted guitar solo there,
all paced at a stately tempo.
</P>
<P>
   At an extremely cohesive 64 minutes, ``Up'' bogs down in the
final stretch. The jauntiest tune is front-loaded: ``Lotus,'' with
its ``hey, hey!'' refrain and Three Dog Night keyboards layered
over vocalist Michael Stipe's bongo-cafe improv poetry (``ocean
flower aquarium''). Mostly though, Stipe is surprisingly direct and
uncontrived, much in the manner of ``Be Mine,'' from the previous
``New Adventures in Hi-Fi'' or the still, quiet moments of
``Automatic for the People,'' still R.E.M.'s finest hour. These are
love songs he's singing: ``Give me that smile/Just turn it on and
I'm lost again'' (``You're in the Air''); ``Someone has to take the
fall/Why not me?'' (``Falls to Climb''); ``I save your messages/
</P>
<P>
   Just to hear your voice'' (``At My Most Beautiful''). Underneath
its blatantly noncommercial slant, ``Up'' is as unabashed a display
of pop song romance as Mariah Carey's next lushly swathed trill.

 &HT;    Private moments with Sinatra
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got to hand it to Pete Hamill. Here it is, barely five
months since Frank Sinatra died, and already the colorful New York
newspaperman and best-selling author (``A Drinking Life,'' ``Snow
in August'') has churned out a book that purports to tell us ``Why
Sinatra Matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the chutzpah. Judging from the book's dated anecdotes,
the last time Hamill and Sinatra actually were together was in the
mid-1970s (although Hamill does tell us exactly where he was _ at
the Miami airport, watching CNN _ when he heard that Sinatra had
died May 14).
</P>
<P>
   At 185 pages, the book initially seems as slim and insignificant
as a certain bony-kneed, bow tie-wearing teenager who sang for
cigarettes and sandwiches in Hoboken, N.J. But appearances can be
deceiving. For just as young Frank Sinatra (``Francis Albert'' was
the stuff of legend, never his birth certificate, Hamill tells us)
attained larger-than-life status, there's also a surprising heft
and depth to Hamill's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their work all great artists help transcend the solitude of
individuals. ... They supply a partial response to the urging of
writer E.M. Forster: `Only connect,''' Hamill writes in the book's
too-cute-by-half ``Overture.'' ``In their ultimate triumph over the
banality of death, such artists continue to matter. So will Frank
Sinatra.''
</P>
<P>
   Forster? What, no Jilly Rizzo?!
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. The perfectly named sidekick/New York club owner
shows up early, part of a group drinking at P.J. Clarke's saloon in
1970. Legendary sportswriter Jimmy Cannon's there, too, along with
Sinatra (who makes them stop playing Sinatra on the jukebox) and
Hamill.
</P>
<P>
   But such name-dropping proves the exception in ``Why Sinatra
Matters.'' As for dropping himself into the narrative, well, after
a scary start, Hamill does that just frequently enough to gain some
essential storytelling ``cred'' _ he grew up in a Brooklyn, N.Y.,
tenement, looking over the water at Hoboken and listening to adults
listening to him on tabletop radios; later, the two became
``friendly'' and Hamill even toyed with the idea of writing
Sinatra's autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Sinatra Matters'' may not be autobiography, but it's a
very personal story nonetheless. It's the story less frequently
heard over the din of all those ``Rat Pack'' drinking tales, the
very public lovers' quarrels with Ava Gardner and Mia Farrow, the
accusations of mob ties and all the other high-pitched talk that
swirled around Sinatra for so many years.
</P>
<P>
   It's largely the story of one man's music _ how it initially
helped him rise up and out of obscure surroundings as the lonely,
only child. And then much later, after numerous personal and
professional failures, how it helped him find his place in the
world again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that ever permanently worked was the music,''
Hamill writes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the most intriguing aspects of ``Why Sinatra
Matters'' is Hamill's thesis that Sinatra's development as a
performer paralleled developments in 20th-century American society:
As the first-generation offspring of immigrants, Sinatra produced
music that resonated with that unique combination of disillusioned
world-weariness and unbridled optimism familiar to all those who'd
gambled everything on gaining a better life. As the fellow who
stayed home and sang romantic songs during World War II (his draft
classification was 4-F), Sinatra really came into his own only
around the time of the Korean War, when the more hardened,
questioning quality of his music spoke to many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But forget sociological commentary. It's a prerequisite that
Sinatra books be stuffed with colorful anecdotes and quotes, and
Hamill doesn't disappoint. (Sinatra on New Jersey: ``We thought
everybody was on the take. ... We thought if God came to New
Jersey, he'd get on line to get his envelope.'') But from the
Kennedys and Marilyn Monroe to Farrow and the Rat Pack, it's also
surprising what he chooses to leave out of a book that prefers to
bulk up the man, not the myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had made many of us wiser about love and human
loneliness,'' Hamill concludes. ``And he was still trying to
understand what it was all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Sinatra himself told Hamill while gliding through New York
on a snowy, early-'70s night: ``Maybe that's what it's all about.
Maybe all that happens is, you get older and you know less.''
</P>
<P>
   You've really got to hand it to Hamill.

 &HT;    Fox's `Brimstone' lacks fire, but plenty get iced
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television is going to heck in a handbasket, and Fox proves it
again with its new devil-made-me-do-it comic book drama,
``Brimstone'' (8 EDT tonight).
</P>
<P>
   Former ``thirtysomething'' hunk Peter Horton stars as Ezekiel
Stone, a highly decorated New York cop with a nagging health
problem _ he's dead.
</P>
<P>
   As we learn in the exposition-laden pilot, Stone was offed by a
two-bit punk (as opposed to the more expensive kind) and winds up
spending the last 15 years of his afterlife in hell.
</P>
<P>
   Although a goody-goody for most of his career, God is punishing
Stone for a vigilante rage during which he murdered his wife's
rapist.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what you've heard, ``Brimstone's'' devil (skull-faced
character actor John Glover) turns out to be a decent guy after
all. Ol' Scratch gives Stone a chance to redeem his sins by
returning to Earth and tracking down 113 of the world's wickedest
souls on the lam from Hades after ``a jailbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   Why hell needs jail is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   All whispery and grungy-looking, Stone first must track down a
child killer who has come back disguised as a priest to fulfill his
apocalyptic visions by slaughtering innocent altar boys.
</P>
<P>
   Since Stone's from-hell prey are already dead, the only way he
can destroy them is by shooting out their eyes, a running plot
point that guarantees a gory denouement every week made more
``artsy'' by the show's quick-cutting camera work.
</P>
<P>
   As undead fantasy hero, Stone is reminiscent of ``Spawn,'' the
cult comic book hero who's also an animated feature on HBO. But
``Brimstone'' is not as much fun as WB's kicky ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' or as morbidly mysterious as Fox's other spookfest,
``Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   At best, ``Brimstone'' is barely passable entertainment for
Horton fans, who get to watch him shrug off speeding bullets and
bound from tall buildings while looking all tortured and testy.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, it may appeal to viewers who are tired of ``Touched by
an Angel'' and are happy that Satan is finally getting equal time.

<P>
   There's nobody bigger in the big, big world of televised
wrestling than Bill Goldberg. He's not just big, he's huge.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg doesn't lose. The ex-Georgia Bulldog and ex-Atlanta
Falcon wipes the mat with all comers. All the time.
</P>
<P>
   So, pardon us if it feels just a little bit strange to hear him
crooning a duet with fellow wrestler Kevin Nash. And that they're
singing Bette Midler's ``Wind Beneath My Wings.'' To each other.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg and Nash visit tonight's ``Love Boat: The Next Wave''
(9 o'clock EDT on UPN), playing tag-team partners who ... well,
what does it really matter? They're here, aren't they?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Goldberg and Nash do wrestle on the boat. They act, too _
probably as well as anybody else on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's character is freshly married and he's a puppy around
his new bride. But it's clear Goldberg is having fun. Sometimes he
grunts his lines. Sometimes he just smashes the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Love Boat'' is all dolled up not only with Goldberg and
Nash but also with Robin Leach. Now there's somebody we'd like to
see Goldberg spear and jackhammer.
</P>
<P>
   Grades: A (for Goldberg _ we'd rather have him on our side)
</P>
<P>
   C- (for the ``Boat'' and all those namby-pamby cast regulars)

YOU CAN'T CHART THE ERA WITHOUT A PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Much as I enjoy the American theater, it has never
occurred to me that the programs we clutch as we settle into our
seats could be hung in a place of honor in the National Gallery of
Art in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is what lately happened to more than 150 programs from
one of the great ages of the avant-garde theater in Paris. Two
Washington collectors, Martin Atlas and his wife, Liane, devoted
themselves for more than 30 years to the search for them, and the
National Gallery was delighted to accept them as a gift from the
Atlas Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 of the programs are on view at the National
Academy Museum in Manhattan. They fill three large galleries, and
the point is well made that they matter as much to the history of
European art as they do to the history of the European theater.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1887 and 1900, there were three small theaters in Paris
that put on plays new and old that could not be seen anywhere else.
Whether at the Theatre Libre (1887-94), at the Theatre d'Art
(1890-92) or at the Theatre de l'Oeuvre (1893-1900), you could see
challenging and unfamiliar works.
</P>
<P>
   The plays ranged in date from 1632 (John Ford's `` 'Tis Pity
She's a Whore'') to 1892 (Maeterlinck's ``Pelleas et Melisande''),
1896 (Alfred Jarry's uproarious ``Ubu Roi'' and Oscar Wilde's
``Salome'') and 1897 (Ibsen's ``John Gabriel Borkman'').
</P>
<P>
   The theaters depended mainly upon subscribers. They were run by
gifted and highly educated young people who had known one another
since their schooldays. Nobody was in it for the money, which was
just as well, because there wasn't any.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best young painters of the day were full partners in
almost every production. They designed the scenery. They were also
responsible for every detail of the programs.
</P>
<P>
   Those programs were simplicity itself, consisting of a single
sheet of paper, sometimes folded and sometimes not. Printed on one
side only, and usually in one color, they listed the author's name,
the title of the play and (in very small type) the names of the
performers. Thereafter, the audience was on its own with a single
page on which the written word merged in unpredictable ways with an
image that spread every which way across the sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people grumbled. Where was the summary of the plot?
What kind of help were they getting from those peculiar images? Why
weren't they getting more for their money?
</P>
<P>
   With hindsight, we know that these programs were not an
impertinence. Nor did they give short weight in terms of their
lasting value. Regular patrons of the three theaters could form a
collection that we now recognize as museum material of a high
order. None of the images were copies or reproductions. Made
specially for the occasion, they appeared nowhere else. They were
the authentic ``artist's prints'' in a private world.
</P>
<P>
   The artists included Toulouse-Lautrec, Pierre Bonnard, Edouard
Vuillard, Paul Signac, Maurice Denis, Felix Vallotton and Theophile
Alexandre Steinlen. When Ibsen's plays became staples in the
repertory, the playwright's great compatriot, Edvard Munch,
designed the programs, often with hallucinatory effect.
</P>
<P>
   This was a historic alliance between art and the theater. In
1896, when Wilde's ``Salome'' (in its original French version) was
on the bill, Toulouse-Lautrec was delighted to design the program,
though Wilde at that time was disgraced and in exile.
</P>
<P>
   When the fare was lighter and easier, there were contributions
by a raft of Parisian illustrators who were never less than deft
(and often very amusing). No one would call Henri-Gabriel Ibels a
major artist, but the image on his program for a play called ``The
Fossils'' in 1892 is everyone's idea of a paradisal day by the
northern sea.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Aurelien Lugne-Poe formed the Theatre de l'Oeuvre in 1893,
he and his friends and colleagues were in their early 20s.
Lugne-Poe himself was only 23 when he played the key role of Golaud
in the first performance in Paris of Maeterlinck's ``Pelleas et
Melisande''.
</P>
<P>
   With a new production due every four weeks, it was grueling
work. But it was also enormous fun. When there was no scenery for a
coming production, Vuillard and Bonnard pitched in and painted
some. (None of that scenery has survived). When Ibsen's ``Peer
Gynt'' called for a group of trolls, one was played by Jarry, who
was to become famous no more than a month later as the author of
``Ubu Roi.''
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Lugne-Poe in December 1896, ``Ubu Roi'' is still
valid as the portrait of an implacable despot of a kind that is far
from extinct. (We can imagine why the great Irish poet William
Butler Yeats should have said, ``After us, the Savage God,'' as he
left the first performance.) Lugne-Poe could not have wished for a
more accurate estimate of why ``Ubu'' mattered then and why it
still matters now. So I hope that he overheard what Yeats had to
say.
</P>
<P>
   It was with ``Ubu Roi'' that the 20th century awoke to
nightmare. Country after country was to have its Ubu, and the last
decade of our century has had them in spades. ``Ubu'' is very
funny, but it also chills the blood. To have put it on the stage
may well have been the greatest achievement of Lugne-Poe as an
actor-manager. The production has vanished, but the program
designed by Jarry himself has not. Its raw power is amply evident
at the National Academy Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Lugne-Poe never set out to create a scandal. When he produced
John Ford's `` 'Tis Pity She's a Whore'' in 1894, he dropped the
original title and renamed the play ``Annabella,'' after its
principal character. But in the case of ``Ubu'' he was true to what
he had once said: ``I do not set out to be impudent, but if trouble
arises, I shall not shirk it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way theater should be.

CELINE DION COVERS HER HITS IN SURPRISINGLY INTIMATE SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Adult-contemporary goddess Celine Dion did
Wednesday what so many before her were never able to manage _ make
the yawning cavern of the Forum seem intimate.
</P>
<P>
   Dion, performing before a packed house of loyal fans from all
age groups, did it by placing her heart-shaped, high-tech stage
directly in the middle of the floor with the crowd surrounding her
on all sides. The result was an unusually pleasing concert
experience at a preposterous venue for music, a 17,000-seat sports
arena.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it helps that Dion strives to connect with her fans.
Throughout the entertaining and hit-filled set, she stopped to tell
anecdotes and jokes, to accept gifts and, at one point, reached
into the crowd to help a small girl on stage for a few hushed
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those moments were genuine or not _ and, to be sure,
there was plenty of Vegas-style show biz throughout the evening _
the French-Canadian chanteuse held the audience in the palm of her
hand and plainly delighted in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Known for over-emoting, Dion has taken critical jabs for being
horribly over-exposed; her reading of ``My Heart Will Go On,'' the
love theme to ``Titanic,'' was recently dubbed the most-played
radio hit in the history of the human race.
</P>
<P>
   It's thought that a typical human anywhere in the world hears
that ballad on an average of five times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the 30-year-old Dion is as tireless as she is
ambitious. Her 90-minute-plus set was a blur of choreography, tight
set pieces that included video-aided duets with Barbra Streisand
and the Bee Gees, and seemingly impromptu moments with the paying
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, Dion covered the bases, fronting a solidly rehearsed
if generic small band, plus backup singer-dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with her voice, which sometimes seems to veer into a
region only hamsters can appreciate, the secret to the rail-thin
diva's enormous success includes well-crafted material penned by
the top adult-contemporary hitmakers, evil geniuses cackling in
hidden laboratories high above Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Dion especially shines on the epic ballads _ ``It's All Coming
Back to Me Now,'' ``Because You Love Me,'' ``Immortality'' and,
especially, the ubiquitous ``My Heart Will Go On,'' which ended the
evening with Dion in flowing antique gown, leaning into a wind
generator against a mock-up of a ship's bow.
</P>
<P>
   Other crowd-pleasers included the gospel-tinged romp ``Love Can
Move Mountains,'' the disco tribute ``Stayin' Alive'' and a medley
of such tunes as ``The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,'' Eric
Clapton's ``Tears in Heaven'' and the Beatles' ``Because.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ronald Brown settled into a chair at a table in the
crowded restaurant, his backpack and dance satchel on the floor
beside him. It was lunchtime recently at Kelley &AMP; Ping, a popular
Vietnamese cafeteria-style hangout in SoHo. Brown gazed into space,
then broke into a slow, easy grin. ``I think I have a handle on
this now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It had been an unexpectedly dizzy race to this moment, only 10
days before Brown's modern-dance company, Evidence, was to open a
three-week season at Dance Theater Workshop in Chelsea. Included
are premieres of two full-evening works _ ``Incidents,'' which is
being performed this weekend, and ``Better Days,'' which follows
next week. For a small company like Evidence, this season is major.
And all Brown's meticulous planning was disrupted when, soon after
rehearsals began, six of the company's 10 members left to pursue
other kinds of jobs and lives. The gods who rule dance favor chaos.
</P>
<P>
   But by the lunch in SoHo, the dances were pretty much set. Brown
and his 14 company members, apprentice dancers and guest performers
were ready to go. And their preparations offer a window into how
dance is made.
</P>
<P>
   At 32, Brown has become known for a distinctive style of
high-energy choreography that merges African dance, ballet, hip-hop
and sensuous modern-dance movement. Implicit narratives, often
addressing social and cultural themes, are folded into the mix to
produce dance, Brown has said, that might be performed by a man
walking down a street in sneakers and that would ``tell my
grandmother's stories.''
</P>
<P>
   A black choreographer, he is intent on bearing witness to the
history of black Americans, training his performers to move in ways
that embody ``evidence'' of their lives and times. ``Few today can
match the depth of his ability to marry message and medium,'' Anna
Kisselgoff wrote of Brown in The New York Times in January.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's season is unusually long for Dance Theater Workshop, a
center for nnovative new modern dance. ``The idea is to allow
really significant artists to work in public a longer time, as in
ballet and the theater,'' David White, the workshop's director,
said.
</P>
<P>
   For Brown and Evidence, which he founded in 1986, the season
will be the culmination of a year that began with their critically
praised participation in the Altogether Different festival at the
Joyce Theater. ``Incidents,'' a dance about black women and
slavery, and ``Better Days,'' about life as a gay black man, grew
out of short pieces performed at the Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always intended for them to be a whole evening,'' Brown
said. ``I felt all the information was too much to fit into a
20-minute piece. The Joyce was my first stab at it.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Brown and his dancers took off for Abidjan, Ivory
Coast, for an intense three weeks working with Rokya Kone and her
Jeune Ballet d'Afrique Noire, which also fuses dance traditions and
cultures. In May, Evidence began seven weeks of rehearsals in New
York for the workshop season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown choreographs through the accretion of what he calls
``images,'' visions that settle into his mind and cannot be
ignored, waiting to be translated into dance. ``Like a mourning
choir,'' Brown explained, ``and the way the choir steps together.''
He records the images in notebooks that tend to cover six to nine
months. Eventually, sometimes over a period of years, a few images
nudge him to put them together in a dance. Often, those pieces
become a suite of dances, performable on their own but adding up to
a larger picture as a group.
</P>
<P>
   In the studio in May, the performers got the Joyce choreography
back into their muscles, then moved on to a few new images, in no
particular order, at the end of each rehearsal. In early June,
Evidence performed with the African group in New York at Aaron
Davis Hall. Soon after, the six dancers left Evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to keep dance companies together, particularly small,
hard-working ones like Evidence. There is better money to be made
on Broadway, for instance, and how can a dancer rehearsing all
afternoon five days a week make it to auditions?
</P>
<P>
   Brown's dancers _ most of whom have additional jobs dancing with
other companies, teaching and working in stores and restaurants _
earn $10 an hour fr rehearsals, which generally run from four to
eight hours, four or five days a week, before a season. They are
paid $500 a week for performing. Most of the $40,000 that Brown had
to raise for the DTW season, though it was subsidized by the
theater, went to rehearsal pay and studio rentals. The designer
Wunmi Olaiya managed to spend only $300 on costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Brown continued to work sketchily on ``Incidents'' and ``Better
Days'' through the summer. But only in mid-September, when he had
found all his new dancers, could he begin to work in earnest over
the mere five weeks before the workshop season.
</P>
<P>
   The last new dancer, Duane Holland, joined Evidence on Sept. 22.
``I'm pretty good at retaining information,'' Holland said. ``But
sometimes I'd think, `Oh, goodness, could you please slow down?'
But I think he demands a lot because he feels you are capable of
doing it, and so you pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, two of the remaining dancers, Angelica Patterson and
Telly Fowler, were comparative veterans of Evidence and knew the
work well. When Brown returned to the early choreography for
``Incidents'' in a rehearsal in late September, Ms. Patterson, the
only woman who had performed it, joined him at the front like a
lithe, long-bodied ghost, echoing his moves, filling them out a
little and watching, with Brown, to see when it was time to move
on. Sometimes Ms. Patterson gently (and worriedly) corrected him on
a move or sequence. ``You don't want to disrespect him,'' she said
later. ``And you never know. He may want to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown did not seem to mind her interruptions. ``He honestly has
a respect for his dancers that a lot of choreographers may feel but
don't always show,'' Ms. Patterson said. ``I think it has a lot to
do with the fact that he dances with us.''

ROWLANDS KEEPS `HOPE' AFLOAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ ``Hope Floats'' starts off when Birdee Pruitt (Sandra
Bullock) goes on a Rikki Lake-style talk show in Chicago, thinking
she is going get a makeover but instead is surprised by her best
friend and husband who tell her, along with a national audience,
that they are having an affair and want to be together. They have
picked the talk show, they say, because they want Birdee to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice take on America's growing obsession with doing its
dirty laundry in public, while at the same time showing how gutless
this whole business is _ that people are willing to ruin or
embarrass somebody in front of millions but can't confront them in
person.
</P>
<P>
   After a promising beginning, ``Hope Floats'' becomes one of
those heartwarming and life-affirming films that never sinks to the
level of total schmaltz but never has enough edge to make it
compelling. After her humiliation, Birdee takes her daughter,
Bernice (Mae Whitman), and returns home to Smithville, Texas, to
live with her mother, Ramona (Gena Rowlands), an earthy eccentric
who lives in a rambling Victorian-style house and makes her living
stuffing dead animals and turning them into decorations, like
``scaredy cats'' _ a pair of terrified-looking felines.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the film revolves around how Birdee, the three-time
Queen of Corn in Smithville, adjusts to her new old life as she
tries to cope with her daughter, who blames Mom, not Dad, for the
breakup. Of course, everybody in Smithville has witnessed her
public disgrace. ``Why did you go on that show in the first
place?'' Ramona asks. ``Because I wanted a free makeover,'' Birdee
says. ``Well, you got one.''
</P>
<P>
   Having no real skills, she tries to get a job but runs into an
old classmate, Dot, who Birdee had dumped on back in high school.
(There are others in town who are enjoying Birdee's fall.) ``I
don't see a listing here for prom queen,'' Dot says, but finally
helps Birdee land a job in a photo developing lab, where the owner
asks her to make extra prints of any ``interesting'' snapshots.
There is, of course, an old flame hovering, Justin (Harry Connick
Jr.), who's a bit too perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has some nice touches, the film is predictable. What
helps keeps ``Hope'' floating, though, is Rowlands, who seems to
making a living lately at playing off-center types. But we
shouldn't forget that Rowlands has been one of our best actresses
for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Her most memorable roles were in the films that she made with
her late husband, actor-director John Cassavetes. The couple made
six films together between 1968 and 1984 _ ``Faces'' (1968),
``Minnie and Moskowitz'' (1971), ``A Woman Under the Influence''
(1974), ``Opening Night'' (1979), ``Gloria'' 1980 and ``Love
Streams'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   Cassavetes, who died in 1989, made actor-friendly films, often
getting extraordinary performances as a result. Rowlands received
two Academy Award nominations (``A Woman Under the Influence'' and
``Gloria'').
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gloria,'' Rowlands plays a tough, street-wise gangster's
woman who is suddenly forced on the run with a young kid when a hit
on her neighbor goes awry. The chain-smoking Gloria tries to avoid
getting killed while saddled with a kid she doesn't want but is
unable to give up. It's a delightful performance as Rowlands pulls
out all the stops. ``Gloria'' is being remade with Sharon Stone
taking on the title role. In ``A woman Under the Influence,''
Rowlands plays a housewife cracking under the weight of domestic
bliss. At times, her mood swings are terrifying as she struggles to
hold her marriage together.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Opening Night'' she plays a similar character, this time an
alcoholic with the controlled panic of a person who desperately
needs a drink.
</P>
<P>
   A unique voice in American cinema, Cassavetes' first film,
``Shadows'' (1959), was shot in 16mm on a low budget. Made outside
the studio system, ``Shadows'' arrived at the same time as the
French New Wave and really was the forerunner to the independent
film movement of today. His films were about people and
relationships, usually talky, sometimes disjointed but often
compelling. Ironically, Cassavetes starred in a number of studio
films such as ``Rosemary's Baby,'' ``The Dirty Dozen'' and the
``The Fury'' to finance his own movies.
</P>
<P>
   The director often took his characters to extremes to find his
truth. That's what's missing in ``Hope Floats.'' So if you're
looking for an unchallenging, pleasant diversion, float through
``Hope.'' But if you want something weightier, check out Rowlands'
work with Cassavetes.
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands, by the way, will be honored next month at the
Stockholm Film Festival in Sweden. She'll receive a special
achievement award, and seven of her films will be shown.

 NEW YORK: with us.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, there was a warmth that verged on affection in the
rehearsal, in a studio on Wooster Street in SoHo. Brown smiled at
times, often unseen by the dancers but drawing fleeting grins from
them when they looked up and recognized approval and sometimes even
delight. There were no reprimands, only one or two chilling stares,
again unnoticed, when a dancer failed repeatedly to make it through
a sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers must learn more than the steps, of course, and as these
grew more secure, they started to bring more of themselves into the
choreography. A mercurial flea of a dancer began to jump higher and
with more gusto. Another one, rising at the touch of an absent male
partner, become a sensuous woman responding to a man.
</P>
<P>
   At the side, other dancers waited to be called, curled up on the
floor and even catnapping amid the jumble of water bottles and
dance bags. There was little air in the steaming studio. The smell
of lunch cooking drifted from the kitchen through this combination
living loft and rental studio. As the afternoon wound on, beads of
sweat formed on foreheads and on the men's bare backs, and extra
layers of dance clothes were peeled off and thrown to the side
without a break in concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Once the women learned the completed passages from
``Incidents,'' it was time to begin work on new material. Brown
changed tapes in the boombox in the corner, then returned to front
and center. He waited several beats, the dancers facing him like a
cluster of watchful deer, before diving into a new sequence. His
body an explosion of gutsy, urgent movement, wondrous and
impossible to copy, he darted into the dancers' midst, dipping and
straightening, scrabbling and stretching powerfully.
</P>
<P>
   At one moment he danced like an African village woman padding
across hot, flat earth. The next moment he was a little girl
sashaying down a city block. It was a choreographing of extremes,
dance that not only used every part of the body but also shifted
from one emotion to another as quickly as the dancers responded to
the shifting rhythms of disco music, a simple spiritual sung by a
very young Aretha Franklin and the sudden sharp exhalations with
which Brown counted the music's beat.
</P>
<P>
   The women looked on, hovering at the edge of motion before
slipping, like swimmers, into this turbulent sea. Watching Brown
from the corner of their eyes as they moved, the women picked up a
step here, a gesture there, gradually adding flesh to the skeleton
they were refashioning. Brown doubled back into the sequence
without breaking the flow of movement. The women followed, and with
each flowing repetition the steps gained color and substance,
looking less like imitation and more like freewheeling dance.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers did not end up looking like Brown. No one in the
room quite matched the juicy abandon of this new choreography as it
welled up from his body. But now he had something to work with, and
as he watched, he added a small spurting jump, an abrupt pivot, a
glide that suddenly and unexpectedly became a lunge.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was still randomly ``adding on the next chunk'' at this
point. The dancers grabbed hold of the vivid imagery with which he
guided them. They were mumbling old women, tomato pickers, women
holding their children's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are just making sure ain't nobody getting into that
dress,'' Brown called out over one youthful, warily flirty strut,
the dancers' hands gathering invisible skirts around them. ``Down,
down,'' he said a few moments later. ``Uh huh, like he hit you in
the neck.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an undercurrent of simultaneous power and helplessness
to the dancing. Walk down the street of this town, Brown told Ms.
Patterson in an early ``Incidents'' rehearsal, the air tight around
you, but walk with the feeling of having to hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought of my dances as being physical narratives
or physical journeys,'' Brown said. ``Angelica would have a whole
through-line here, but the choreography would probably look like a
sequence of movements.''

 NEW YORK: of movements.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Incidents'' was inspired by Brown's reading of several books
on slavery, including Linda Brent's ``Incidents in the Life of a
Slave Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to stage the book.'' recalled Brown, an avid
reader who once contemplated training in journalism. ``That would
be crazy. But images would come to mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Better Days'' was largely inspired by the writing of Brown's
favorite gay black poets, whose work will be spoken live and on
tape during the dance. Another inspiration was the atmosphere of
Better Days, a Manhattan club, now defunct, where gay men, Brown
has said, ``could find love and sex and dance their hearts out.''
</P>
<P>
   The slow, heavy house music he danced to at such clubs often
touched him with its oddly spiritual quality. ``It was always `lift
your spirit higher,' and I wanted this sense of the spiritual in
this piece,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The same quality was part of what appealed to White, the
workshop director. ``You see a joy of movement and a joyousness
that comes from the movement,'' White said. ``Such a joy can't be
underestimated in our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Older and busier now, Brown does not go to clubs as often as he
once did. His free nights are often spent catching up with the
company's administrative chores. ``When I'm working on something
like this, I begin teaching at 9:30 in the morning and have
rehearsals to 9 p.m. or even midnight. Any computer work is done
after rehearsal, with Mondays left for administrative work. My mom
used to be my company manager until she passed away in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister Yasmin, now 15, took on some of the work until this
summer, learning on the job from Renee Redding-Jones, Brown's
assistant, and Celeste A-Re, his production manager. ``She'll start
working again with me during the season. But she's a junior in high
school, and I wanted her to get a good start on the school year.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, ideas take hold of him in the hours after he shuts
down his computer at night, generally around 2 a.m. ``I throw in a
video of what I have so far, then things come to me.'' He laughed,
a little grimly. ``I would like that to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting exhaustion, he found that the temper that lurks beneath
his seemingly invincible calm and deliberateness began to make
itself felt. ``My partner has been really understanding,'' Brown
said of his companion, the writer G. Winston James. ``But as a
really good girlfriend told me, I was being evil to him because I
was so tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Also exhausted, the dancers have begun to add soothing yoga
sessions to their regular dance classes and warm-ups. But strangely
enough, Brown said, with such tiredness came better work in the
last days of rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something that happens the last week, when the energy
comes down,'' he said. ``I don't intend to tire people. I don't
want to fry their brains. But I feel we all learn more and work
better when we're tired. It kind of gets your ego out of the way.
You end up working more deeply, getting to the essence.''
</P>
<P>
   By the last week or so of rehearsal, Brown felt, the dancers
were internalizing the dances' underlying stories and could rely on
themselves to tell those stories. The ``stew'' of the dance was
settling on the stove, he said, the flavors asserting themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The light was dimming outside at rehearsal on a chill
mid-October afternoon as Brown and six of his male dancers worked
on a new section of ``Better Days'' to the even, pounding beat of
music by Stolen Moments. There was laughter at times, particularly
as Brown handed out several pairs of flowing leopard-print pants
that he admitted were ``scaring me to death.''
</P>
<P>
   But weariness took over between the new sequences. Holland, who
once was a gymnast, dropped to the floor to rest, unaffectedly
spreadeagle in the center of the studio.
</P>
<P>
   The men milled dreamily in one brief passage, a crowd of lost
souls seeking anonymous sexual partners at an imaginary club.
Almost imperceptibly, they paired off and sank down together only
to stand again, one man turning away to leave the other in a smooth
completion of the dance phrase. There was a haunting sadness to the
sequence. A dancer hung back a little, moving with his body but not
his heart. ``Straight boys do this, too,'' Brown called out,
teasing him gently.
</P>
<P>
   The dance phrase grew slowly but steadily as the dancers
continued to work. Then suddenly, the magic occurred. The men were
no longer enacting a cool gesture of dismissal or simply learning
to rise smoothly from the floor. All that had been replaced by a
single long unbroken spiral thread of movement alive with love,
disdain and exquisite physicality.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three weeks, Ronald Brown and Evidence will
present three programs at Dance Theater Workshop, 219 W. 19th St.
``Incidents'' will be performed Friday through Sunday at 8 p.m.;
tickets are $12. ``Better Days'' will be performed on Thursday
through Nov. 1 at 8 p.m., and a program of short pieces will be
presented from Nov. 5 through Nov. 8. Tickets for performances the
second and third week are $15. Reservations: (212) 924-0077.

</P>
<P>
   Along with 10 tracks from five previous hooker albums _ the ones
with cameos from the likes of Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt and Van
Morrison _ this compilation offers several new cuts featuring Ry
Cooder, Ben Harper and harpist Charlie Musselwhite spicing up
Hooker's one-chord boogie. Ultimately, the grizzled Hooker pretty
much cuts the same songs nowadays, so the album is down to the
soloists, particularly on a new reading of the bluesman's first
1948 hit, ``Boogie Chillen,'' with Clapton providing the fireworks.
If you happen to own any of Hooker's earlier discs, this album is
an obvious case of heard one, heard 'em all. 2 stars

<P>
   It's almost the punch line to a bad joke. Million-dollar startup
needs a hit badly. They sign the Eels, actually the nom de plume of
thoroughly depressed singer-songwriter Mark Everett. He hands in
the album. The marketing wheels start turning. Then, somebody
listens to the thing. Cue the sound of jaws dropping all over town.
``Electro-Shock Blues'' is a well-produced, fully realized
rumination on suicide, cancer, heart attacks, hospital food and
death. The Go-Go's it ain't. Everett gives us plenty to chew on,
but whether the mature audience this record requires will ever hear
it is another matter entirely. Somehow, we don't imagine ``bring
out your dead'' will ever replace ``party down'' in the fraternity
row lexicon. 3 stars

   With Gershwin tributes coming fast and furious on this, the
centenary of composer George Gershwin's birth, it's only natural
that the Red Hot Foundation turn its attention to this classic
songbook. Previous ``Red Hot'' albums have focused on Cole Porter
and the bossa nova sound, and, like those collections, ``Red Hot +
Rhapsody'' has enough variety to appeal to casual listeners as well
as Gershwin enthusiasts. The album has a bittersweet tone, mostly
due to the number of trip-hop artists present and the downbeat
songs they've selected. Highlights include Bobby Womack's funky
treatment of ``Summertime'' (one of two versions in the album's 17
cuts) and David Bowie and Angelo Badalamenti's ghostly rendition of
``A Foggy Day (in London Town).'' Not essential, but there are
several fine moments. 3 stars

   Guitarist Malone has been known lately for his stellar work with
Diana Krall. On this, his first solo album in four years, Malone
shows he has much to offer on his own, using his formidable
technique to craft a beautifully measured work. The title reflects
the laid-back Southern vibe of the album, which includes a lush
tribute to Malone's 10-year-old son, ``Song for Darius,'' and the
gospel-tinged closer, ``Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.'' Two shining
covers are also highlights: an engaging reworking of Herb Albert's
``Rise'' and a lovely melding of Malone's own ``Strange Little
Smile'' with the Billy Preston/Syreeta Wright hit ``With You I'm
Born Again.'' Malone, along with standout musicians Kenny Barron,
Ron Carter and Lewis Nash, seems inspired throughout, creating one
of the year's best jazz albums. 4 stars

Peterson's second great trio (bassist Ray Brown and drummer Ed
Thigpen) along with Clark Terry on trumpet and fluegelhorn. Terry's
energetic presence on this 1964 date makes this one of Peterson's
greatest albums; it's also the recording that begat Terry's famous
mumbling vocal work, used to great effect on three of the songs
here. Each musician soars in the high-spirited setting. For proof,

   Back when Wendy was Walter 25 years ago, she/he created
``Switched-on Bach,'' the soundtrack to ``A Clockwork Orange'' and
other early digital delights. Now comes a spooky set of seven
synth-drenched tracks, perfect for this scary season. Put it on as
background music to greet trick-or-treaters or send a shiver down
your own quivering spine. Despite her other transformations, Carlos
remains a techno-wonk, using cutting-edge computer audio tools,
creepy electronic instruments of her own creation and atmospheric
sound design to give the music extra dimensionality and an odd,
off-kilter lyricism. The centerpiece of the album is ``Clockwork
Black,'' a Boschian updating of the themes from Kubrick's dystopian
film. Overall, this is literally haunting music _ creepy, majestic

excellent for those. 3 stars

to the big book for inspiration on their first album of new
material in years that wasn't initially created for a CD-ROM title,
musical or some other medium. As the title promises, they've mined
the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, for some of the more
disturbing and odd tales of human foibles and deitical
inscrutability. They helpfully explain the passage behind each song
and even provide citations so disbelievers can ``look it up.'' The
Eyeballs' music, it turns out, is pretty good stuff, too. Oddly
entrancing, slightly spooky pop for weird souls, though I can't
even imagine how this all might play at the next Southern Baptist
Convention. 3 stars

IT'S NOT A BLACK-AND-WHITE WORLD IN `PLEASANTVILLE'

OUR RATING: 3 1/2 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Gary Ross' wonderful new film, ``Pleasantville,''
taps into our collective nostalgia for the simplicity of the good
old days and then forces us to examine whether that bygone era was
really as swell as we remember. In fact, the movie prompts us to
ask ourselves whether Father really did know best or if everything
we now remember about the Eisenhower era comes courtesy of Nick at
Nite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' has plenty of other ideas, too _ the film
delves into the hows and whys of censorship, intolerance, emotional
repression as well as the enormous shaping power of television.
Coming on the heels of ``What Dreams May Come,'' it's also a
shining example of the thoughtful ways digital effects can be used
to further storytelling instead of, say, destroying the Eiffel
Tower by meteor storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' is the name of a 1950s ``Ozzie and
Harriet''-style sitcom where no problem lasts longer than 22
minutes. It's the favorite program of the teen-age David (Tobey
Maguire), who uses the show's steady brand of blandness to
counteract the stark realities of his own broken home.
</P>
<P>
   David's sexpot sister, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), would
rather watch a test pattern than another episode of
``Pleasantville.'' One night while they're fighting over a remote
control left by a mysterious TV repairman (the perfectly cast Don
Knotts), the two teens are zapped through the television screen to
the black-and-white world of the show.
</P>
<P>
   And what a world it is. In Pleasantville, the temperature is
always 72 degrees, it never rains, and the bathrooms don't have
toilets. (Think back: When did you ever see Wally or the Beav
actually inside a bathroom?)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a flip side to this sterile perfection. Every
day follows the same routine; there are no surprises, no emotions,
no new ideas. The books inside the library are blank. Mom and Dad
(Joan Allen and William Macy) have two children, but they never
have sex or even sleep together. (Twin beds, you know.)
</P>
<P>
   After a few days, the presence of the two '90s kids begins to
upset the delicate balance of Pleasantville's world. Once Jennifer
takes her boyfriend up to Lovers Lane (Him: I wonder if we're going
too fast, what with us holding hands. Her: Maybe I should just
 &UR; !ital! &LR; pin &UR; !off! &LR;  you) and introduces sex into this Eden, the
daily routine takes an unexpected turn. The basketball team
actually loses a game. Kids don't know all the answers at school.
And the local soda shop, run by the mild-mannered, would-be painter
Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels), turns into a den of iniquity.
</P>
<P>
   Something else begins to happen, too. Dashes of color _ a red
rose here, a pair of blue eyes there _ begin to creep into
Pleasantville's black-and-white landscape. Citizens begin to feel
love, joy, fear and anger. Mom's wholesome facade begins to crack
when Jennifer gives her the talk about the birds and the bees. Soon
enough, Dad arrives home from work to a darkened house and no
dinner on the table. The words ``Honey, I'm home'' have never
sounded so forlorn as when Macy repeatedly delivers them and, not
hearing the cued response, wonders if he has done something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, ``Pleasantville's'' mix of worlds and colors is a
remarkable achievement, but the movie has a lot more to offer than
digital wizardry. Ross, who wrote ``Big'' and ``Dave,'' makes an
impressive directorial debut with another fable, this one a modern
 &UR; !ital! &LR; Alice in Wonderland. &UR; !off! &LR;  The story cleverly shows the
importance of opposites and extremes in a fully formed life, and
how you can't truly know love unless you've experienced hurt and
disappointment as well.
</P>
<P>
   Or as David eloquently puts it during a town meeting: ``I know
you want things to stay `pleasant' around here, but there are so
many other things that are so much better, like silly ... or sexy
... or dangerous ... or wild.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's cast is uniformly excellent. Particularly noteworthy
are Macy and Allen, Pleasantville's Adam and Eve, two innocents who
respond to their awakening desires with a mixture of wonder and
fear. It's easy to underestimate how difficult a job these two had
since basically they're playing characters who are acting in their
own lives. But once their routines are upset and they're forced to
become real people, both characters are confronted with the great
unknown. And Macy and Allen deliver performances of sublime
complexity, worthy of attention around Oscar time.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their work and everything else in this outstanding
gem of a film, you'll never be able to watch those ``classic''
reruns the same way again. &UR;

` APT PUPIL' SHOWS US THE VERY WORST OF THE HUMAN SOU L 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 4 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Apt Pupil'' is creepy in ways you almost can't
imagine. That's the source of its mesmerizing power; we know the
unimaginable did happen, and this film shows us how easily it might
again.
</P>
<P>
   A shrewd, superbly acted adaptation of a Stephen King story, the
movie is directed by the richly imaginative Bryan Singer of ``The
Usual Suspects'' fame. In the broadest sense, ``Apt Pupil'' is a
crackerjack mystery as well, only this one isn't a whodunit, it's a
how-could-they-have-done-it.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is so simple, it's absolutely chilling.
</P>
<P>
   If Stephen King's great gift _ other than making people jump
when he writes ``Boo!'' _ is his ability to evoke the horror
lurking at the edge of middle American normalcy, this story has got
to be his ultimate testament. Forgoing his usual supernatural
trappings, King tried in ``Apt Pupil'' to examine the nature of
evil in the human soul.
</P>
<P>
   Singer does a better job of it by not trying, paradoxically, to
get all psychological or trying very hard to come up with an
explanation. Though major portions of the film are devoted to an
old drunk and a teen-age boy talking, ``Apt Pupil'' is remarkably
cinematic in the way that it shows man's worst impulses expressed
in a dead-eyed glance or a subtle but triumphally cruel gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Renfro, the kid from ``The Client,'' plays Todd Bowden, a
16-year-old honors student in a pleasant, Southern California
suburb who learns about the Holocaust in school and, well, wants to
know more. After memorizing everything he can find at a nearby
archive, Todd starts thinking an old man who rides the same bus
with him looks oddly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Todd eventually confronts the elderly German gent in his
ramshackle home with indisputable evidence that he's really Kurt
Dussander, a concentration camp commandant who's been on the run
for four decades (the film takes place in the mid-1980s). After a
few feeble denials and empty threats, Dussander resigns himself to
the inevitable end of a life defined by ingenious deception,
paranoia and alcoholic loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   But Todd has a different fate for Dussander in mind. Rather than
turn the old Nazi in, he wants to hear his stories. All of them. In
gory, sadistic detail.
</P>
<P>
   Dussander initially balks, but the homespun Hitler Youth has
power over him and knows how to apply it. Over the months, as the
torrent of horror stories rolls, it starts affecting Todd's dreams,
his grades and _ most aptly _ his attitude. When he passes a
certain, inner point, woe befalls any weak or wounded creature that
finds itself in Todd's path.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Dussander, played with a balance of cranky, malevolent
brilliance and unnervingly avuncular charm by Ian McKellen, comes
to realize that he's being revitalized as much as threatened by the
boy. Having presumably suppressed his monstrous nature for 40
years, he sweetly surrenders to that awful, wonderful rush of power
over others, and it pumps life back into his atrophied veins.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing is more invigorating than calculating ways in which
he can turn the tables and gain advantage over Todd.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, power is the blood bond that links these two moral
vampires ever closer together, and Singer finds the true locus of
evil in its magnetic lure. It's the movie's could-happen-here, or
anywhere, thing; the fascistic promise of absolute control that
flatters the insecurities of pubescent boys and impotent old men.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, at least, Singer and screenwriter Brandon Boyce
have made a kinder, gentler movie about fascist pathology than the
story King wrote. There is only one outright murder depicted and,
somewhat amazingly, they've gotten the point across without
resorting to a single anti-Semitic or racial slur. Some could,
reasonably, call that a cop-out, the suggestion that evil can exist
free of hatred.
</P>
<P>
   But you can just as reasonably argue that that's how all of
those good Germans found the madman's power fantasy so
irresistible. At the close of this century of mass murder that also
happens to be the century of cinema, ``Apt Pupil'' doesn't presume
to tell us why the horror happened. But it gives us a shuddering
look at just how, individual by individual, it could.

HOLLYWOOD ROLLING OUT FILMS WITH A DISTURBING TREND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you flinched when Ben Stiller got his privates
caught in the teeth of his zipper in ``There's Something About
Mary'' or covered your eyes while Tom Hanks and company took Omaha
Beach during ``Saving Private Ryan,'' then you might want to avoid
going to the movies for the next few weeks. An avalanche of films
with disturbing themes, unsavory characters and creepy situations
are making their way into theaters, and audiences, if they're brave
enough, are going to have an unprecedented number of opportunities
to squirm in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Already in theaters in Todd Solondz's ``Happiness,'' a look at
suburban loneliness and alienation that features a sympathetic
family man who sexually preys on his son's school chums. Then
there's the trio of movies featuring Nazis _ ``Apt Pupil''
(teen-ager finds Nazi war criminal in neighborhood and adopts him
as a role model), ``American History X'' (neo-Nazi skinhead repents
and tries to save his kid brother from adopting him as a role
model), and Roberto Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful'' (a heartrending
tale of a father's love for his son while living in a Nazi death
camp).
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' actually doubles as a comedy, a rare
attempt to use humor to shed light on human depravity and a telling
illustration of how far filmmakers are willing to push the
boundaries of convention and taste these days. What's even more
interesting is that audiences seem to be responding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are crying for a departure from the
formulaic,'' says actor Edward Norton, star of ``American History
X,'' and no stranger to controversy from his work in the
much-debated ``The People vs. Larry Flynt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think it's great,'' Norton continues. ``There are lots
of completely valid goals of film and art. There's entertainment,
which is a very worthwhile goal and, sort of, escape, and then
there's also provocation, even agitation, which is sometimes very
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the confluence of controversial films is just a
reflection of the times. Last month at the Telluride Film Festival,
the moderator of a panel discussion picked up on an increased
cultural willingness to deal with bodily fluids when he said, ``Ten
years from now, we will look back on 1998 as the year of
`Happiness,' `There's Something About Mary'' and Monica Lewinsky's
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Or maybe people will look back on this year as the time
when films _ mainstream and independent alike _ finally began to
mirror America's tabloid culture, in which no subject, however
unseemly, is regarded as taboo. (Exhibit A: daytime talk. Exhibit
B: the evening news.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose with what the president is doing ... these really
are perfect movies for the times,'' says Brad Renfro, co-star of
``Apt Pupil.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
UGLY BEHAVIOR
</P>
<P>
   Consider some of the other films that are either playing now or
will be in theaters soon: the black comedy ``Very Bad Things,''
which follows the ramifications of a drunken bachelor party where
the good-looking swinging buddies murder the prostitute they hired;
``Pleasantville,'' a lighthearted, if pointed, jab at (among other
things) conformity in the suburbs; and ``The Celebration,'' a raw
look at a family tearing itself apart at the 60th birthday of its
father (the eldest son toasts his dad by accusing him of molesting
his sister and himself).
</P>
<P>
   There's also ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' Neil LaBute's
withering follow-up to ``In the Company of Men''; the marshal law
drama, ``The Siege,'' which already has Arab-American and Muslim
groups up in arms; the NC-17 rated ``Orgazmo,'' Trey Parker's
(``South Park'') story about a Mormon porn star; and ``Beloved,''
which features everyone's favorite talk-show host and role model,
Oprah Winfrey, confronting one family's nightmare with slavery in
graphic, unsparing detail.
</P>
<P>
   After all this, the Thanksgiving trio of ``A Bug's Life,''
``Babe: Pig in the City'' and ``The Rugrats Movie'' will be
welcomed by audiences as nothing short of an emotional catharsis.
Arriving as they do after this wave of films, though, people might
expect to see Babe roasting on a spit at a skinhead rally instead
of cavorting with his animal friends.
</P>
<P>
   Says ``Chicago Hope'' star and ``Very Bad Things'' director
Peter Berg: ``I think what many of these movies are trying to do is
take the monster and bring it in the house so you couldn't stay in
the house and look at it out the window. The monster is in the
house with you.''
</P>
<P>
   What's disappointing to some moviegoers is that while all these
monsters are on the loose now, studios, for the most part, keep
them caged up for the rest of the year. Indeed, once Thanksgiving
draws near, all these films will be shunted aside for big studio
fare like ```Meet Joe Black,'' ``Psycho,'' ``Star Trek:
Insurrection'' and the Julia Roberts tearjerker ``Stepmom.'' It
will be well into next year before we see this kind of challenging
fare again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there's just a slew of these things, really good
movies in many cases, which are going to be competing, regrettably,
for a relatively small portion of the audience,'' says horror
writer and film director Clive Barker, one of the producers of the
upcoming gay-themed film ``Gods and Monsters,'' which is about the
later life of ``Frankenstein'' director James Whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if we could come to the place where these
kinds of pictures would have more of a chance year round. As it is,
it feels like feast or famine.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the moment, it's feast, which means that studios are
doing everything they can to separate their movies from the
competition. Since most of these films don't feature A-list (or, in
many cases, Z-list) stars, the advertising campaigns often
highlight their perversity as a selling point.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost surprising that Good Machine, the production company
that picked up ``Happiness'' after Universal Pictures CEO Ron Meyer
ordered subsidiary October Films to drop it, isn't using a quote
from Meyer himself. He did reportedly say that he would throw
himself in front of a truck rather than let October release
``Happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Solondz: ``I kind of liked that. It's almost a badge of
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, it certainly is.

FILE TREY PARKER'S `ORGAZMO' UNDER STINKY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING:   1 star 
 
 
BY BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ ``Orgazmo'' aims for sophomoric but barely hits
moronic. This satire of the porno film industry is so inept, in
fact, it makes your basic amateur X-rated production look like
``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   The humor attempted here comes strictly from the breaking-wind
school, except most schoolyard jokes are funnier than anything this
movie has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by ``BASEketball'' and now this thing, Trey Parker, one
of the creators of ``South Park,'' should stick to scatological
cable cartoons. He wrote, directed and stars in ``Orgazmo.'' None
of these tasks were performed well.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's creative partner, Matt Stone, co-produced and has a
small role as a semi-consciously gay lighting guy. He gets three of
the film's five laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The idea here is that Parker's Joe Young, a naive Mormon
missionary, becomes a sex movie superstar in order to pay for the
temple wedding that Lisa, his fiancee back in Utah (Robin Lynne
Raab), has her heart set on. His film character Captain Orgazmo, a
kind of sexual superhero, becomes a cultural phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   When the guilt-ridden Joe tries to leave the trade, mob
pornmeister Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs in the worst movie
performance of the year), kidnaps Lisa. Captain O and his runty,
sex toy-bedecked sidekick (Dian Bachar, the runty sidekick in
``BASEketball'') then have to become real heroes. Some of this _ a
lot of this _ is played with unaccountable, if strained
seriousness, as if a plot like this was important or something.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the bad jokes that hurt more than the witless drama.
Consider the filmmaker's favorite running visual gag: Every time a
porn actress prepares to strip for action, some nude guy with a
hairy behind steps in front of the camera. Now that's satire of a
high order.
</P>
<P>
   Parker could probably argue that ``Orgazmo'' is only making fun
of what passes for humor in the adult video universe. He could,
also, reasonably contend that his film looks so consistently ugly
because porn often does, too. He might even put forth the
proposition that making fun of Mormons is an unenlightened thing to
do, so that's why the film's many gags at their expense are
uniformly stupid.
</P>
<P>
   What I'd doubt Parker could explain, though, is why anyone would
spend a few weeks and what was apparently a month's worth of lunch
money on a project as thoroughly unrewarding as ``Orgazmo.'' Or,
for that matter, on a ticket and the time it takes to sit through
this. &UR;  &QL;

   PRACTICAL MAGIC &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, Dianne Wiest, Stockard Channing,
Aidan Quinn, Goran Visnjic &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Griffin Dunne &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 05 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Being from a family of witches, the gorgeous Owens sisters,
Sally (Ms. Bullock) and Gillian (Ms. Kidman), have a problem with
men. By pronouncing a curse on the entire male gender, an Owens
woman of long ago sentenced mates of future generations to a
premature end.
</P>
<P>
   Sally marries a cheery fish merchant, only to have him hit by a
truck. Gillian, though, puts the destructive force to good use and
brings about the demise of her vile boyfriend, a bad idea named
Jimmy (Visnjic).
</P>
<P>
   But Jimmy, now dead and with eyes looking as if they've been
borrowed from a striped bass, won't stay put in the hole the
sisters have dug for him in the back yard of the strikingly
photogenic Owens seaside homestead.
</P>
<P>
   With Gillian possessed by Jimmy's body and soul, the plucky
Sally rallies the neighbors, who swallow their distaste for witches
and pitch in to wield broomsticks and prepare the potions required
to exorcise the evil among them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Jimmy cuffs Gillian around and tries to brand her with
his heated-up signet ring. Later there is much seething and
thrashing about as the women battle the dead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX No action but Gillian vamps about. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Now and then the obscenities fly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 Yes, there are witches, but they look like major movie
stars and come with relationship troubles and other baggage.
Besides, the film is too scary and too confusing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-9 They'll like the idea of witches, but this just isn't a
movie for small children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12 Ms. Bullock and Ms. Kidman aren't teen-agers, but
they seem to be at times as they bounce about a glossy-magazine
setting. The glamour will appeal, but parents have profanity and
domestic violence to consider. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP By this age, the film could be too tame and a
trifle silly. Teen-agers generally crave stronger stuff. Jimmy is a
creep, but he'd never make it in ``Scream'' or ``Scream 2,'' huge
hits with older adolescents, whose bad boys take no prisoners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOLY MAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy, Jeff Goldblum, Kelly Preston, Robert Loggia &QL; 
Directed by Stephen Herek &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG 113 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Ricky (Goldblum) and Kate (Ms. Preston) work at a television
shopping channel where they attract and repel each other while
honing pitches for glue guns and love scents.
</P>
<P>
   One day as they are changing a tire on an expressway, they
encounter a smiling, beatific fellow called G (Murphy), who
materializes amid the whizzing traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Kate and Ricky (though he has misgivings) sponsor G and soon the
mysterious visitor _ some kind of holy man? _ proves himself
overpoweringly wise and calming. Put on the shopping channel, he
eschews materialism and becomes a kind of guru to the masses, who
to everybody's delight buy more junk than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the world's leading religions take a crack at
explaining G's views, but only he knows for sure. Now, can he help
Kate and Ricky overcome their differences? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX One fleeting encounter and some smutty references tied to
home shopping. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Other than the above, none. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 Even if they understood, they'd die of boredom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-9 Ditto, especially the boredom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12 They may be enthused at the prospect of an Eddie
Murphy movie, but be warned that this one is slow and preachy with
no action or payoff that would be of the slightest interest to
children this age. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP Some teen-agers might sit through this film, but
again Murphy is not a particularly lively presence and they'll be
mighty itchy by the time Ricky and Kate get to the last half-hour
with the entire boy-loses-girl-boy-regains-girl sequence still to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Or in this case sales manager loses efficiency expert, which is
another drawback for an audience that doesn't exactly relate to the
travails of 30-something business people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER: THE MOVIE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An animated film with the voices of John Goodman, Debbie
Reynolds, Eric Idle, Bob Newhart and Whoopi Goldberg. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by William R. Kowalchuk &QL;
</P>
<P>
   G 90 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trot through the song lyrics and you have the spine of this tale
about gentle Santa (Goodman), the truculent ice queen Stormella
(Ms. Goldberg) and the much-maligned little reindeer called on to
lead the team through socked-in flying conditions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-8 The animation certainly isn't of Disney rank, but the
story will divert very little ones. One should also note that films
of this kind often reach the video racks sooner rather than later.

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the rehearsal hall, the dialogue was sliced tart
and true from the life and times of Monica Lewinsky, with no less
than three actresses taking a crack at the ultimate ingenue's role
in the inescapable national melodrama that has no copyright,
perchance no ending.
</P>
<P>
   The actors as much as the audience seemed mesmerized by the
hour-long experiment at the New Dramatists playhouse _ a scene of
grand jury inquisition about sex and love, pride and president and
all the attendant folderol that, inevitably, has raised the
question whether this stuff of life can offer something more
meaningful through the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an insecure person,'' declared the first Monica, Culver
Casson, reading the line of grand jury dialogue most sadly in
explaining why she seemed so often to be there on those
presidential rope lines. ``I would go early and stand in the
front.''
</P>
<P>
   The second Monica, Emme Shaw, played it far less for pity than
with a kind of savvy innocence. ``Can you guys call me Monica?''
she suddenly asked the grand jury amid all the testimony about
gifts and stains and embarrassment. ``I'm just 25. Please.''
</P>
<P>
   And the third Monica, Abigail Rose Revasch, a study in
wide-eyed, freefall anxiety, provided a confessional rush in
telling of haphazardly falling in love with, well, the president of
the United States. ``I thought, I thought: He had a beautiful
soul.'' Her spotlit Monica was all at sea. ``I don't know what the
truth is anymore,'' she keened. ``I don't know if it's based on him
being an actor,'' she said of the president, threatening the West
44th Street rehearsal hall with a play within the play.
</P>
<P>
   The strong applause and vigorous audience discussion that
followed the reading by the band of 10 actors on Wednesday night
marked the evening as something more than a stunt. It seemed closer
to ``a response to this public distress that we're in,'' as Todd
Lincoln, the artistic director, put it in his welcome to New
Dramatists, which has been developing playwrights for the past 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   The evening at least suggested that no plot line is too
far-fetched, nor has the nation ever been more provoked to needing
catharsis. With her grand jury chorus compulsively curious but
finally empathetic, the young woman chattily described a flirtation
suddenly exploding into a huge criminal investigation of the
president. No less did the performance feature ludicrous moments,
the audience guffawing at the true-from-life notion of the
president on crutches being lewdly, hurriedly serviced by the
office intern. ``Oh-my-God-this-is-so-embarrassing!'' said Ms.
Lewinsky as a helpful grand juror gently coached, ``You can close
your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the sound of Ms. Lewinsky has not actually been heard in
public despite all the months of Washington scandal traipsing,
Lincoln rotated three Monicas through the dialogue as a sample of
the possibilities, and he reduced the grand jury to five members.
The transition from the enacted scene to the discussion among the
75 people in the hall seemed well cued by one compassionate grand
juror's troubled line to Ms. Lewinsky: ``I can't figure out why you
keep going after things that aren't free.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the problem was analyzed by Moira Driscoll, a grand jury
actress finally speaking for herself: ``She didn't think through
the thong moment.'' Far more than that famously impulsive display
of undergarment, Ms. Lewinsky didn't think many things through, the
gathering agreed, always wondering why.
</P>
<P>
   ``She definitely wanted to be forgiven and to be loved,'' said
Kate Robin, a playwright. ``And she wins! The grand jurors loved
her, they offered her a bouquet at the end,'' she noted of their
parting gift. ``It was because she was so honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, another playwright, Barry Jay Kaplan, disagreed.
``No, no, no,'' he said. ``It's because she has spent a lifetime
learning how to do that _ how to please. She's really good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The now familiar Lewinsky Effect swept the audience _ the
inability by all sorts of well determined Americans not to discuss
the tale even as they pronounce it too pathetic for words.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about him?'' came one writer's question about the
president, somewhere far offstage amid Ms. Lewinsky's predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not in this scene,'' another professional dismissively
replied, savoring some of the good lines Monica gave herself
(``Inherent in a secret is a lie.'').
</P>
<P>
   The director, Sabrina Peck, a specialist in verbatim dialogue
drama on such topics as the Bosnian refugee tragedy, admitted to
doubts about the Lewinsky tale's gravity. ``We're all disgusted on
one level by the whole thing, but maybe there's some usefulness,''
she said, finally delighted by the strong audience reaction and
teased by the advice to ``make the second act Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   Comic relief continued to the closing lines. The audience
laughed at the 12-step double-entendre in a grand juror's avuncular
advice, ``Monica, none of us in this room are perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   By then the third Monica of the night was weeping in farewell as
she was asked if she had anything at all to add to her performance.
``I'm sorry, I'm really sorry for everything that's happened,'' she
apologized. Then, interrupting her sobs, she added, ``And I hate
Linda Tripp!''
</P>
<P>
   Most mercifully, the audience's closing burst of laughter
suggested the whole thing may prove more of a comedy than a
tragedy.

YANKEES EARNED PLACE AMONG BEST EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know about the 114 victories, the staggering 22 games they
finished ahead of the second-place Red Sox in the American League
East, and their steady march through the playoffs en route to the
inevitable triumph in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But it was even more of a Yankees year than you might think.
</P>
<P>
   They even won their Old-Timers Day game against the Dodgers when
_ get this _ Willie Randolph hit a home run over the left-field
fence.
</P>
<P>
   That's the final proof of just how much the year 1998 belonged
to the New York Yankees, and now the irresolvable debate begins.
</P>
<P>
   Were we looking at the Greatest of All? The natural defensive
tendency of anyone historically minded enough to be aware of the
1902 Pirates, 1927 Yankees, 1936 Yankees, 1939 Yankees, 1955
Dodgers, 1961 Yankees, 1972-73-74 A's, and 1975-76 Reds is to say
no, of course not. Baseball has changed. Expansion has dispersed
the talent too widely. And yeah, whom did they beat, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Don't buy it. The Yankees have earned a seat at the head table
with the best teams of all time, and their claim to being the
greatest is a lot better than traditionalist hardheads will ever
concede.
</P>
<P>
   The other teams come at you with Hall of Famers and arguable
Hall of Famers, and this Yankee team can't do that. The only
projected Hall of Famer on the 1998 Yankees is 24-year-old
shortstop Derek Jeter, and he is another 8-10 good years from
having anything concrete to talk about in terms of Cooperstown
enshrinement.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Honus Wagner, no Babe Ruth, no Lou Gehrig, no Joe
DiMaggio, no Roy Campanella, no Mickey Mantle, no Reggie Jackson,
no Johnny Bench, Pete Rose, or Joe Morgan _ in other words, not a
single, obvious, no-questions-asked, first-ballot Hall of Famer _
on this entire club. (Without getting into the Sargasso Sea of a
Pete Rose debate, you know what I mean by including him.)
</P>
<P>
   So?
</P>
<P>
   With the 1998 New York Yankees, it's all about team. That's it _
T-E-A-M. If we assume that the obvious goal of any general manager
is to assemble a 25-man unit that has a high level of expertise in
every conceivable phase of the game, then the new world champions
will serve as the model for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were 61-20 at the All-Star break, and they had zero
position player starters in the game, nor did they deserve any. The
Yankees have no members of the Silver Slugger club, the players
selected as the best hitters at their position. Their only Gold
Glove winner is Bernie Williams. It is highly unlikely that a
Yankee will be named MVP, although Jeter will finish high. All this
underscores the reality of their phenomenal team play.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they did have the best pitching staff in baseball.
Let's not forget that.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the assets of the 1998 New York Yankees: 1. Great
starting pitching. 2. Excellent middle relief. 3. Outstanding short
relief. 4. People who know how to get on base. 4. People who know
how to drive in other people. 5. Astonishing top-to-bottom
offensive balance in the batting order. 6. People who can catch the
ball. 7. People who can steal bases and take the extra base. 8.
People who know how to check their egos at the clubhouse door and
channel their energies toward one thing _ winning that day's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrific ball club when it comes to self-motivation and
determination,'' salutes manager Joe Torre. ``This ball club is
like no other club I've ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   There, by the way, is another extremely important New York
Yankee asset. In the Bronx, as in no other place in the baseball
world, it is vitally important to have the proper man running the
ball club. For there are but two types of major league managing
jobs _ the 29 on teams not run by George Steinbrenner and the one
working for George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Torre was handed the most complete baseball team he has ever
seen, and he knew exactly what to do with it. Baseball is the
longest season of all. It begins in February and it can last, if
you're lucky, until the last week of October. Keeping people
physically and mentally sharp is not easy, but Torre was able to do
it. He can praise the players for their self-motivation all he
wants, but those on the inside know how valuable his approach to
leadership was for this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe has been a great manager, a great leader for us,'' lauds
Williams. ``He has really taken the trouble to know what makes
everyone tick and how he can get the best out of everybody to play
up to the best of their ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds easy, right? It isn't.
</P>
<P>
   There should be credit enough for everybody. Start with Gene
``Stick'' Michael, a superb baseball man who has worn many hats
during his distinguished Yankee career. He is currently director of
scouting, but in a previous incarnation as general manager, he made
some great moves, the best of which was trading Roberto Kelly to
Cincinnati for a strong-willed right fielder named Paul O'Neill.
The latter is entrenched as the Yankees' No. 3 hitter. He is a
rock-steady .300 hitter, run producer, and defender. The former has
now been moved eight (8) times since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Credit is due 31-year-old rookie GM Brian Cashman, who looks
like _ bear with me _ a young, non-mustachioed Groucho Marx. Tabbed
as a future GM by Steinbrenner when he was in his early 20s, he has
been a superb liaison between The Boss and The Skipper (``He's
tough. He gives his opinion. He does a good job for me'' _ Torre).
Cashman also made the Deal of the Year, sending Kenny Rogers and
``cash considerations'' to Oakland for Scott Brosius, a k a Mr.
Series MVP.
</P>
<P>
   There is credit available for all the players. There is credit
available for Arthur Richman, a special assistant to Steinbrenner
who first suggested Torre as a possible manager to his Boss. There
is credit available for an amazingly credentialed coaching staff
(Jose Cardenal, Chris Chambliss, Tony Cloninger, Mel Stottlemyre,
Randolph, and Don Zimmer), which, almost without question, boasts
of the greatest playing accomplishments of any staff in baseball
history.
</P>
<P>
   And there is even credit available for Steinbrenner, who,
recognizing the greatness before him, stayed as quiet as he
possibly could (by Steinbrennerian standards, anyway).
</P>
<P>
   It all came down to this: The 1998 New York Yankees had as many
ways to beat you, with as many talented people on their 25-man
roster, as any team in baseball history. And with a final record of
125-50, they usually did.
</P>
<P>
   The Greatest of All? In knock-your-socks-off individual talent?
No. But in the combination of all-around skill and the desire to
get it done? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, bless his middle-aged heart, has compared his team to the
Old Celtics. ``Nobody really cared if they scored 30 points. They
worked together, and it was fun to watch them,'' Torre points out.
``They only really cared about the end result, which was winning.''
</P>
<P>
   And now we have the 1998 New York Yankees. ``The one thing I
would love to have people think about is there's no one name that
comes to mind but the team itself,'' Torre says.
</P>
<P>
   The team. What a refreshing thought.

EVIL KNOWS NO AGE LIMIT IN `APT PUPIL'
</HEADLINE>
 By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Stephen King's ``Apt Pupil'' may not be his
scariest story, but it's likely his most disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   It's built around the relationship between a bright California
high school kid, Todd Bowden, who has a morbid fascination with the
Holocaust, and Kurt Dussander, an aged, former concentration camp
commandant. When Todd discovers the disguised war criminal living
in his pleasant suburb, rather than turn him in the boy blackmails
him into sharing his every depraved memory. Then, one day, the old
Nazi strikes back ... but by this time, the teen-ager has learned
too much.
</P>
<P>
   No ghosts. No werewolves. No uplifting themes like those other
stories from King's ``Different Seasons'' collection that were
turned into the beloved movies ``Stand by Me'' and ``The Shawshank
Redemption.'' Just two thoroughly evil guys talking, mostly, then
finally acting on their dreadful impulses.
</P>
<P>
   How do you make a Hollywood movie out of that?
</P>
<P>
   For years, you didn't; the first of several attempts to bring
``Apt Pupil'' to the screen failed more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   But for Bryan Singer, the 32-year-old director who made a big
splash last time around with the intricate crime puzzler ``The
Usual Suspects,'' it's been a warped dream ever since he first read
the story as an adolescent. Now, with substantial changes to King's
plot and an unlikely pairing of two very different actors _
59-year-old Shakespearean Sir Ian McKellen and Tennessee teen-ager
Brad Renfro (``The Client'') _ Singer has done it.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the film tones down the bloodshed and eliminates
the racism found in the book, it's every bit as disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea, the essence, the theme, the relationship, the
characters, the cat-and-mouse and the transference of evil were all
in the story, and I tried to present them in the picture,'' Singer
says. ``The only differences are that the violence, which reads
really great in the story, would have been a bit repetitive and
dangerously exploitive if you were to try to show it in a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I made a conscious effort, also, not to bring up too much
Holocaust imagery and stuff like that,'' says Singer, who is
Jewish. ``It's not `Schindler's List,' it's not that kind of movie.
This movie is not about Nazism or racism, it's about the
pervasiveness of evil and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Renfro has a slightly different view of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about power and control,'' says the young actor, now 16.
``A lot of people ask, `What makes this boy so evil?' But it's not
really like he's seduced by evil. It's more like a playoff, a
matchup, a power game in which they're seducing each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Usual Suspects''' Oscar-winning screenwriter
Christopher McQuarrie, ``Pupil'' writer Brandon Boyce is one of
Singer's childhood friends from suburban West Windsor, N.J. (actor
Ethan Hawke was another, movie-mad neighbor). Like Singer, he saw
the movie as an opportunity to examine an abstract concept through
specific behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe evil does exist,'' Boyce says. ``It's like, you
couldn't write the character of Adolf Hitler. If you're going to
tell that story, you're going to have to accept the fact that he is
already this way, and this happens to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, this is more about the kid being a victim of his own
curiosity,'' Boyce adds. ``I think there was always the seed for
the way he is inside of him, and it just gets nurtured and
perpetuated by this sort of whirlwind with the old man.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHOWER OF COMPLAINTS
</P>
<P>
   Some kids who were extras in the movie say that they were
victims of another kind. According to attorney Martin Rub, suits
have been filed on behalf of nine minors (and at least one adult
extra) against various individuals and production companies
involved with ``Apt Pupil,'' claiming they were pressured into
performing nude for a gym shower scene that was filmed at
Altadena's Eliot Middle School in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-month investigation of the incident by a
sexual-crimes task force made up of local, state and federal
investigators, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office
determined that there was no cause to file charges. The sequence
that appears in the film was reshot in the summer of last year with
all-adult extras.
</P>
<P>
   Rub, who represents two of the minors and one adult, claims that
``the report to the DA confirms that the children were forced to
strip naked, but they said that there was no criminal intent and
that's why they didn't prosecute. They said that it appeared to be
a professional film shoot that was intimidating, and that they were
in a rush to get the scene shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``But children, by law, cannot give their consent on a contract
or anything else. To take advantage of children is just a dastardly
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer disputes the claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no merit and nothing happened that day,'' the
director says of the lawsuits. ``And that is a fact, from my
perspective and the perspective of many people who were there that
day _ and it also happens to be the District Attorney's opinion
after a months-long investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an unfortunate thing that occurs, I believe, when
one is working with a company that has a lot of money. I have never
experienced anything like that before, but I've been told by
friends who have been in the business a lot longer that I should
expect it not to be the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   CHARACTER DILEMMA
</P>
<P>
   Singer has his next time lined up: He's slated to direct the
big-budget, special-effects extravaganza ``The X-Men,'' based on
the popular Marvel comics and cartoon show superheroes. But even
with that franchise secured, Singer is understandably concerned
about how his hard-to-sell, my-mentor-was-a-Nazi movie is going to
be received.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a trick: How do you make a Nazi mass murderer
sympathetic?'' the director says. ``Well, you make him an old man,
living in seclusion, who becomes victimized by this annoying,
pervasive young boy. And he is merely a boy, so by his very
physical nature he is attractive and sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you've got to stop and think: What kind of boy blackmails
a Nazi? And by the time you're getting to the film's climax, you're
thinking: Wait a minute, he's a mass murderer! That's kind of an
interesting game to play, but part of the game is how do you make
depraved, unsympathetic characters sympathetic for at least long
enough so people at the movie care.''
</P>
<P>
   If you recall the elaborate plot of ``The Usual Suspects,''
cinematic gamesmanship clearly emerges as a major motif in Singer's
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the ability to deceive an audience,'' he admits.
``There's something exciting about trickery and about pulling the
wool over someone's eyes and manipulation. People complain, `That
movie was so manipulative!' Well, it might not have been good
because you were aware you were being manipulated. But if you can
be manipulated by a movie, then the movie was right on.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one observer feels he pulled it off this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephen King has seen the movie and embraced it,'' Singer
reports. ``He said, `If you had done it just like the book, it
would have been a different kind of movie. The wrong kind of
movie.''' A canny student of the marketplace himself, the director
knows ``Apt Pupil'' requires the same kind of careful tracking a
gifted but troublesome schoolboy needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kind of strange, dark, twisted movies need all the
support they can get,'' Singer says.

GOV. WILSON SAYS HE WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT IF HE GETS FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California Gov. Pete Wilson said Thursday that
he'll run for White House in 2000 if he can garner enough money to
mount a serious challenge for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very interested in running again if, realistically,
the money is there,'' Wilson told reporters. ``But that remains to
be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he would need about $15 million in his election
coffers in time for the first presidential primary held in New
Hampshire on February 22, 2000. Building such a treasury won't be
easy, Wilson conceded, adding that it would require an ``awesome
amount of fund raising.''
</P>
<P>
   The more money in the bank, the better equipped a candidate is
to buy advertising in local markets and get his message to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson ran for the Republican nomination in 1996 but his bid
quickly fizzled in part because the GOP faithful were not
enthusiastic for his politically moderate views on such hot-button
issues as abortion and gay rights. He also suffered a throat
ailment that affected his speaking ability.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, however, the political landscape is different.
For starters, there is no incumbent in the White House to unseat.
And Wilson wants to move up California's primary to March 7, 2000,
so that it coincides with primaries in New York and at least eight
other states.
</P>
<P>
   The action would contract the presidential nomination process
and favor better-financed candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who is leaving office this year under the state's term
limits, said that he will wait until leaving office in January
before investigating a presidential bid. He said he thought that
running for the White House as an ex-governor, as Ronald Reagan
successfully did in 1980, would be easier than trying to campaign
while still being governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that I was campaigning on the weekends because I was
doing a job during the week,'' Wilson said. ``If you are from a
large state, it is challenging to do both.''

'98 YANKEES THE GREATEST TEAM EVER? WELL ... MAYBE

  (ART ADV: A Yankees photo package was sent Wednesday to NYT photo

(JT) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even George Steinbrenner, who likes to brag about his
baseball team, was not ready to say outright that the 1998 Yankees
are the best ever, even after they completed their stunning
125-victory season with a World Series sweep of the San Diego
Padres on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say anything about us being the greatest,''
Steinbrenner, wet from Champagne, said. ``But there hasn't been
anybody better.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Steinbrenner was being a little cautious because he was
aware that there is no easy way to assign the 1998 Yankees their
rightful place in history. Baseball's rules have essentially
remained the same during the course of the 20th century, but the
sport has evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Players are bigger and stronger and faster, and 51 years ago,
baseball's segregation ended. Multiple expansions may have diluted
the quality of players _ particularly the pitching _ but at the
same time, the worldwide talent pool has mushroomed over the last
two decades. The World Series used to be the only post-season drama
in baseball, but now a team has to survive two rounds of playoffs
just to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if a basic standard for being the greatest is winning
baseball games, than perhaps the 1998 Yankees are the best ever,
for they won 125 games, nine more than any other team that has won
the World Series. And if another basic standard for being the best
is dominating the competition _ something that can be measured
statistically _ then the 1998 Yankees clearly are the greatest.
</P>
<P>
   By winning this year's World Series, the Yankees certainly
validated their 114 victories in the regular season. ``The thing
that concerned me the most,'' said Yankees Manager Joe Torre, ``was
not winning the World Series and having someone look down their
nose at what we accomplished this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Many great teams did not win the World Series, did not survive
their ultimate test of greatness: the 1906 Chicago Cubs won a
record 116 games during the regular season and then lost to the
Chicago White Sox in the World Series; the 1954 Cleveland Indians
won 111 games during the season only to be swept by the New York
Giants; the 1969 Orioles, with 109 regular-season victories, lost
to the upstart Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Before this year's playoffs began on Sept. 29, Bob Feller, a
pitcher with the 1954 Indians, said the 1998 Yankees could never be
called a great team until they won the World Series; Reggie Jackson
said the same thing this summer, on a visit to Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they have won, they have leapfrogged beyond the likes
of the 1906 Cubs, the 1954 Indians and the 1969 Orioles, to be
compared with those teams that did win it all.
</P>
<P>
   The 1927 Yankees have been regarded as one of the greatest teams
ever, and perhaps the best. They won 110 games during the regular
season and swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in the World Series; their
winning percentage of .722 in the regular season and post-season
combined is the best ever.
</P>
<P>
   They had the game's biggest star, Babe Ruth, who hit 60 home
runs that season, more than every other American League team. First
baseman Lou Gehrig, just 24 years old, hit 47 home runs and drove
in 175 runs. Second baseman Tony Lazzeri drove in 102 runs,
outfielder Bob Meusel drove in 103. The Yankees batted .307 and
scored 6.3 runs a game. The pitcher Herb Pennock, who would be
inducted into the Hall of Fame, won 19 games, and Waite Hoyt won
22.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago American Giants won the Negro National League that
year, with a record of 56-29. They did not play the Yankees, none
of the great Negro League players, such as Oscar Charleston, played
the Yankees; no team with black or Hispanic players played the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball was not open to non-whites until 1947,
Jackie Robinson's rookie year with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the
obliteration of the color barrier had an immediate and dramatic
impact on the caliber of baseball being played.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the roll call of players who would not be a part of the
1998 Yankees if the color barrier still existed: Bernie Williams,
Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Jorge Posada, Orlando Hernandez,
Hideki Irabu, Ramiro Mendoza, Chili Davis, Tim Raines, Darryl
Strawberry, Homer Bush, Ricky Ledee and perhaps Tino Martinez, a
player of Latin descent who looks white. Their absence obviously
would affect the majesty of the 1998 Yankees, or for that matter,
any league.
</P>
<P>
   Could the 1927 Yankees be considered the greatest team ever? For
that matter, could any team before 1947 _ the 1909 Pittsburgh
Pirates with Honus Wagner, the 1939 Yankees with Joe DiMaggio and
Bill Dickey, the 1929 Philadelphia Athletics with Jimmie Foxx and
Al Simmons and Mickey Cochrane?
</P>
<P>
   In the context of baseball's history taken as a whole, the 1927
Yankees were the best of an exclusive club, a team that dominated a
members-only tournament.
</P>
<P>
   So consider this: The 1998 Yankees rank third among the top 10
championship teams for total winning percentage, regular season and
post-season combined. The other nine teams in that category
accomplished their achievement before the 1947 season.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Torre suggested last week, is winning games.
Among all teams that won World Series titles from 1947 to the
present, the 1998 Yankees won the most number of games in the
regular season, 114. They had the best regular-season winning
percentage (.704) of any team after 1946. They compiled five more
victories than any other team since Major League Baseball shifted
from the 154-game schedule to the 162-game schedule in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   There have been modern dynasties that demonstrated their
greatness in the World Series: the Oakland Athletics won three
consecutive titles from 1972-74, and yet the most victories they
compiled in any of those regular seasons was 94 _ or 20 fewer than
the 1998 Yankees. The 1989 Athletics were a dominant team that won
99 games, or 15 fewer than the 1998 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Morgan, a member of baseball's Hall of Fame following his
exceptional career with the Cincinnati Reds and others, and now a
baseball broadcaster, has argued that the Cincinnati teams he
played on were better than the 1998 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The 1975 Reds that won 108 games and beat the Boston Red Sox in
seven games in the World Series had more star quality, with the
career hit leader Pete Rose, catcher Johnny Bench, the two-time
most valuable player Morgan and the first baseman Tony Perez. They
were immortalized as the Big Red Machine. But the debate over the
best team ever is not based on which team had players with better
careers; rather, the argument is over who had the best team in a
given year.
</P>
<P>
   Perez batted .282 that year, hit 20 home runs and drove in 109
runs; Tino Martinez hit .281 for the Yankees this season with 28
home runs and 123 RBI. Bench hit 28 home runs and drove in 110
runs; Paul O'Neill slugged 24 home runs this season and drove in
116. Morgan batted .327 with 17 home runs and 94 RBI and won the
most valuable player award; the Yankees' Derek Jeter batted .324
with 19 home runs and 84 RBI. The third baseman Rose hit .317 with
112 runs scored; the Yankees' Brosius hit .300 with 98 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan has said the Reds could win in many different ways, and
he is correct. They hit 124 home runs and stole 168 bases. The 1998
Yankees stole 153 bases and slugged 207 home runs. The Reds ranked
first in the National League in runs (840), second in hitting
(.271) and third in ERA (3.37); the 1998 Yankees ranked first in
runs (965), second in hitting (.288) and first in ERA (3.82).
</P>
<P>
   Fewer runs were scored in the Reds' era, and relative to the
rest of the league, Cincinnati's offense was better. Averaging 5.2
runs a game, they scored 26 percent higher than the league average;
the 1998 Yankees scored 19 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees' pitching is far and away more dominant than the
Reds. The cumulative earned run average in the American League this
year was 4.65, and the Yankees' ERA was 18 percent lower; the ERA
of the 1975 Reds was just 7 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' roster is clearly deeper than that of the Reds.
Cincinnati's bench _ those players beyond their regular lineup _
contributed 242 hits and 14 home runs. The Yankees mustered 282
hits and 42 home runs. The bottom line is winning. The 1998 Yankees
won six more games than the 1975 Reds in the regular season. The
1998 Yankees went 11-2 in the postseason, the 1975 Reds were 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   The 1986 Mets won 108 games in the regular season and eight more
in the post-season, beating Houston in the NL playoffs and the
Boston Red Sox in the World Series. They had a deep roster, graced
by the likes of Darryl Strawberry, Keith Hernandez and Gary Carter,
and excellent pitching. But the 1998 Yankees are a far superior
defensive team, and again, relative to their peers, the Yankees
fare better. The Mets scored 15 percent more runs than their
opponents and their ERA was 16 percent lower. The Yankees: 19
percent and 18 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   And winning is the bottom line. The 1998 Yankees won six more
games in the regular season than the Mets did, and the Mets'
cumulative winning percentage is 51 points lower than that of the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970 Baltimore Orioles had perhaps the best defensive team
ever, with Mark Belanger at shortstop, Brooks Robinson at third,
Davey Johnson at second. They had star pitchers in Jim Palmer and
Mike Cuellar. But the Yankees are a better offensive team, with
more speed and a deeper bullpen. The 1970 Orioles finished with 115
victories _ 10 fewer than the 1998 Yankees _ a .676 winning
percentage nowhere near this year's champion.
</P>
<P>
   The 1961 Yankees, loaded with power, hit 240 home runs; Mickey
Mantle hit 54, Roger Maris 61, and the Yankees won 109 games during
the regular season before beating Cincinnati in five games in the
World Series. But in a year when run production increased
dramatically with the American League's first expansion, the
Yankees' pitching staff compiled a 4.02 ERA, or 14 percent better
than the rest of the league. They scored 13 percent more runs.
</P>
<P>
   Add those two figures together for 27 percent, the lowest among
the five most successful teams since 1946 _ the 1986 Mets (31
percent), the 1970 Orioles (32 percent), the 1975 Reds (33 percent)
and the 1998 Yankees (37 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Merv Rettenmund, the San Diego hitting coach, has been a
first-hand witness to some of the best teams, playing with the 1970
Orioles and the 1975 Reds, coaching the 1989 Athletics and in the
last week, coaching against the 1998 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Torre's team, Rettenmund said, does not have the offense of the
1975 Reds, but has better pitching and more depth. The Yankees have
more offense than the 1970 Orioles, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the Yankees the best ever?'' Rettenmund said aloud. ``I
don't know. They're above average in every phase of the game.
They've got the whole package.''
</P>
<P>
   Rettenmund said that if he could pick one team from one year for
one seven-game series, he would pick the 1989 Athletics, with Jose
Canseco and Rickey Henderson and Mark McGwire _ a team that won 15
fewer games than the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there are those Yankee numbers: 114 victories in the
regular season, 125 in all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's incredible,'' Rettenmund agreed. ``That tells you
something about the type of team they have. That tells you a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the bottom line. The 1998 Yankees, the best ever.

`MOTHER HUBBARD': THIS MOTHER HUBBARD IS A MILITANT FEMINIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(dl) 
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nuyorican Poets Cafe does the best favor it
possibly could to Ishmael Reed in its production of his ``Mother
Hubbard.'' At the invitation of Miguel Algarin, the executive
producer at the theater, Ronald McIntyre has written a score, and a
few songs for which Reed supplied lyrics. The director, Rome Neal,
and a cast so exuberant it sometimes seems downright unruly, play
down the convoluted plot and treat the text as 10 discrete scenes
of comic cavorting. It is only on reflection afterward that you
fully realize what an emotional and intellectual muddle the play
is. But after you've been laughing for a good part of two hours,
the reflection doesn't much matter.
</P>
<P>
   This Hubbard is not the nursery rhyme Mother. She is the head of
a gang of militant feminists who take over California, run Gov.
Pete Wilson out of the state and decree the exile of all other men
within two months. But the coup collapses when a rabbit that has
become king of the U.S. fur trade hints that Mother Hubbard has a
secret in her past, and a young woman who is the world lightweight
boxing champion leads an assault on the Hubbardites' headquarters
by a rabble that includes her house husband, her trainer and a
bedraggled rat that was betrayed by the feminists. When Mother
Hubbard's secret is exposed, the women's movement is transformed,
along with the whole world, which becomes a brighter, more loving
place.
</P>
<P>
   The hilariously discontented rat (Theo Polites) and the rabbit
(Rod Bladel) _ a kind of Polonius turned robber baron _ are not the
only articulate animals. The ghost of a dog (Frank Swingler)
delivers a long sermon on injustice and liberal values that sounds
like the playwright undisguised.
</P>
<P>
   Among the human characters, Joy Styles and Elliott Williams are
finely matched as the aggressive lightweight with a soft heart and
her husband, whose absurd sensitivities can be cured only by money
and luxury. Frances McAlpine Sharp is a winning Mother Hubbard, a
commander with a dangerous tendency to lapse into kindness who has
to be recalled to duty often by her troops. Kathryn Chilson as her
adjutant is so brassy you suspect she would ring if someone hit
her, and William Williams as Mr. Money has the glitter of a silky
serpent set on seduction.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the actors who are given solos are up to singing them,
but the meters of some of Reed's lyrics would defeat a pro in any
case, and on the whole the poorer singers manage to transfer their
weakness to their characters, making their wobbles part of the
comedy. A few in the cast, like Williams and Styles, could probably
sing any song handed to them and, appropriately for her character,
Sharp sounds as if she could make herself heard above a large
gospel choir.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, then, the production is considerably larger than
this fractured fable of a play _ to the delight of the audience,
which reacts to it much as a crowd of wide-eyed children would to a
very ordinary cake hidden under wave upon wave of fantastic
frosting.

TODD COLLINS FOLLOWS INSTINCTS, AND DOES HIS HOMEWORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Last Dec. 28, in the second quarter of the
AFC wild-card playoff game against Miami, Todd Collins made a play.
A very good play. He picked up Dan Marino's check-off, knew the
Dolphins quarterback was calling a slant play and anticipated the
throw, made the interception, and ran 40 yards for a touchdown to
give the Patriots a 14-0 lead which turned into a 17-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Collins's great anticipation was a source of mystery. How did he
know what was coming? Did the Patriots know the Dolphins' plays?
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned into some big espionage thing,'' said Collins. ``We
didn't know their plays. When you play a team three times, you file
away certain numbers they use on their check-offs, and when you
hear it, you react. I do that in almost every game. There are
things you hear that you anticipate what's going to happen and get
them right. And there are other things you hear that you think you
know that you're wrong on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That turned out to be a big play in that game. But to say we
knew what was coming all the time _ that's just not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson reportedly changed his audibles and
did change his offensive coordinator and the entire offense after
that game.
</P>
<P>
   Marino still believes the Patriots knew a lot of what was
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they had an idea about some of them,'' he said during
his conference call this week. ``We had some of the stuff for quite
awhile. I'm sure they had a pretty good idea. I figured they were
game-planning pretty well against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said a smart player will listen and learn and try to
gain every advantage possible against a savvy veteran quarterback
like Marino. He knows it's unlikely he'll hear the same signals
Sunday at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they probably do some things differently now, but
it doesn't mean we can't study them and try to figure it out all
over again,'' said Collins. ``I know they do things differently now
where they emphasize the run more, but they still have to throw the
ball, and sometimes they like to go with their short passing game.
I think as a defense, you always have to anticipate things. And
we'll probably anticipate things again. That's not cheating or
knowing their plays. That's just trying to guess right.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the Patriots had the Dolphins' number last year,
but he's also aware how rapidly the situation can change. He
believes the Patriots will be particularly wary after suffering an
embarrassing 24-14 defeat to the Jets on national television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't play well and we got beat,'' said Collins. ``On
that night, they did all of the right things and we didn't play the
way we're capable of playing. But we have pride. We know this is a
divisional game and that this is a team we have to beat. We knew
that last year and we beat them in some big games. This is for
first place, and everybody wants it.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, a quiet, humble country boy from Tennessee, said he's
not upset that fellow linebackers Chris Slade and Ted Johnson seem
to get all the attention. Every year, it seems Collins, faces a
challenge from Tedy Bruschi, and every year he goes to camp and
proves why he belongs as a starter in the regular defense.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Jets, he didn't play that much because the Patriots
constantly were in the nickel package, which calls for Bruschi to
step in as a pass rusher in Collins's spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with being in the background,'' Collins
said. ``Don't get me wrong _ getting praise isn't bad, either. I've
gone through a growing process here. I don't worry about things
that I can't control. People are always going to have opinions
about you, good or bad. People are going to pick you apart and
people are going to praise you. One thing I learned from Coach
(Bill) Parcells is you can't get too high and you can't get too
low.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Parcells made him low. So low that Collins decided to
retire in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, it was probably best for him. Parcells
persuaded him to come back, and he did so with a new verve that
helped the 1996 Patriots to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   His contract is up at the end of the year, and he feels he's
having one of his best seasons, a continuation from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a process,'' said Collins. ``When you're a young kid,
you're not quite sure of yourself and where you're supposed to be.
You don't have that confidence. That slowly builds, and I think
from last year to this year, I have that now. I have an idea of
what's going on out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins won't be looking to break the bank in the offseason, but
he does want to finish his career here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy this system and this team and the people in it,'' he
said. ``I think this is a very good team that can go far if we put
our minds to it. The big thing is that I have fun playing
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Never so much fun as last Dec. 28.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow advisories were issued Thursday for the San Juan Mountains
in southeast Colorado as moist air drawn northward by a distant
upper-level low-pressure system over northern Nevada was forced to
ascend the sloping terrain. On Friday, the upper-level low will
weaken as it migrates slowly into western Montana, touching off
scattered showers in the northern Rockies and northern Great Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, isolated showers and a few thunderstorms will
develop over the southern Rockies in Arizona, New Mexico and
western Colorado as residual moist air left in the wake of the
Montana low is lifted over the mountainous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   A chilly, frosty morning over the middle Mississippi and Ohio
valleys will be followed by a sunny, mild afternoon under the
auspices of a sprawling high- pressure system centered over
southeast Missouri. The clockwise circulation of air around the
behemoth high will stretch from New England to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Along Florida's east coast, ocean winds averaging 15 to 30 mph
will pile up water at spots along beaches, raising the risk that
dangerous rip currents will develop. Gusts to 40 mph are possible
in spots. Meanwhile, widely separated showers and thunderstorms
will form over the peninsula, fueled by inbound ocean moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Across New England, winds from the west will send milder air
eastward from the Great Lakes. However, a warm front marking the
leading edge of the advancing milder air will meet with some
resistance, paving the way for spotty showers across northern New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Stormy Philippines
</P>
<P>
   Supertyphoon Babs, armed with winds over 150 mph, slammed into
the Philippine island of Luzon on Wednesday. The fierce landfall
followed on the heels of Supertyphoon Zeb, which lashed Luzon over
a week ago. The long north-to-south span of the Philippines places
the chain squarely within the main migration route of typhoons in
the western Pacific, which boasts a higher frequency of tropical
storms than any other basin in the world. The primary reasons for
the high frequency of storms are the large expanse of very warm
water and favorably steady upper-level winds from the east.

MIAMI'S APPROACH: A STINGY DEFENSE, A DULL BUT STRONG OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ One fascinating statistic stands out from the
Miami Dolphins' first six games. Miami has scored 6 points _ total
_ in the first quarter, while its opponents have scored 7.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're worried about forgetting to turn back your clocks
this weekend and missing the first quarter of the Patriots' game in
Miami, fret not. Not much happens early in Dolphins games.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pronounced lack of production even though the
Dolphins script every play of their early drives. Only Woody Hayes
might want to know what would happen if the Dolphins didn't script
their early plays.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Jimmy Johnson has wrought in Miami _ a quick,
aggressive, stingy defense that already has two shutouts, and a
dull, conservative offense with a journeyman at running back (Karim
Abdul-Jabbar), one journeyman wide receiver (O.J. McDuffie), and
one of the greatest passers of all time (Dan Marino) handing the
ball off play after play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can establish some sort of physical game, a game like
the Patriots like to play,'' said McDuffie, ``then it will be a
long, hard battle.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the Dolphins will try. Though team after team has
exploited the Patriots' pass defense, especially New England's
nickel and dime packages, the Dolphins likely won't be looking to
Marino to do the same, unless they fall behind. Johnson has told
his offensive players to look extra long at New England game tapes
to discern the Patriots' blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've learned their blitzes,'' McDuffie said
yesterday. ``We've simplified our offense enough now that we can
pick up their blitzes and not be confused again. We've been
confused more than anything (against the Patriots). It hasn't been
anything difficult that the Patriots did, but they just confused us
a lot. Now, with the simplification of our offense, we'll be more
ready to pick up the different things they bring at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches, as well as players, win games in the NFL. Bill Parcells
and the Jets coaches took away the Patriots' strengths on both
offense and defense Monday night. Conversely, Johnson may have been
at his worst last January when New England beat Miami in a playoff
game at Foxborough. Johnson's Dolphins seemed unprepared for New
England 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt helpless in that playoff game last year,'' said tight
end Troy Drayton. ``But last year we were more a passing team,
while this year we've been establishing the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the defensive game plan drawn up by the Patriots
coaches leave Miami totally confused, but the Patriots also knew
Marino's audibles, leading directly to a Todd Collins interception
and touchdown. Johnson reportedly knew that New England knew his
audibles but could not or would not change them; Johnson's decision
to sign troubled running back Lawrence Phillips a month earlier
looked savvy in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is gone and so are the audibles. Marino's option now
when he sees a defense he doesn't like is a ``check-with-me''
system in which he can change to another set play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we're more ready for them this time around,'' said
McDuffie. ``Our offense is a lot less complicated than it was in
terms of picking up blitzes and the different things they try to do
up front to confuse us. I think we're much better prepared for them
than we were.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins will go to great lengths to say this year's offense
is much different from last year's weak outfit, even though it
seems Miami once again looks to pass only when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if there is a difference, it is that Miami is sometimes
more conservative in its formations, often going to only two wide
receivers and lining up with two tight ends, a true running
formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing this year is we're trying to balance the running
game with the passing game,'' said Drayton. ``The balance is the
key to everything. Last year we didn't dictate the tempo of the
game on offense. We sat back and had four wide receivers and we
didn't get much out of that but a lot of pressure (on Marino). But
this year we have an attacking-style running game and an
attacking-style passing game, and that's the way to beat the other
team ... mano a mano.''
</P>
<P>
   Explanations aside, this appears to be the same side of beef,
only sliced differently. The Dolphins tried to run the ball last
year but often couldn't, just as they are intent on running the
ball this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having two tight ends not only helps us get out on pass
patterns but also helps out in protection,'' explained Drayton.
``When the defenses bring their linebackers or their strong safety
(on blitzes), we're more ready for that than last season. It brings
an extra dimension to our offense.''

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ANTZ,' starring the voices of Woody Allen and Sharon Stone.
Directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson (PG, 83 minutes). Computer
animation has advanced to the point where it can make a cute
romantic couple out of Allen and Ms. Stone. This and other surreal
tricks are shown off in a funny, ingeniously animated insect
picture that often reaches the anthropomorphic cleverness of ``Toy
Story'' and shows off Allen's sharpest comic timing with
one-liners. But ``Antz'' winds up overplotted in bizarrely
grandiose ways, with the threat of genocide invoked for a jarring
change of pace. Must every child-friendly adventure film, even one
with considerable potential to delight grown-ups, boil down to a
struggle for world domination? Surely a threat of bug spray in the
picnic basket would have done the trick. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `BELOVED,' starring Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton
and Kimberley Elise. Directed by Jonathan Demme (R, 172 minutes). A
transfixing, deeply felt adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel, with
all the complexity (and occasional opacity) that entails. Taking on
the most enticing yet daunting job of literary adaptation since
``The English Patient,'' Jonathan Demme succeeds in bringing the
novel's pulse to the screen. Though it begins too slowly and
literally, this daring effort escalates into a gripping,
imaginative film that mixes memories of slavery with the occult and
that isn't quite like any other. Its linchpin, Ms. Winfrey, is more
often a person acting than an intuitive actress. But she plays her
character, a onetime slave literally haunted by her past, with
enough presence to hold the film together. The other major
performances are extraordinary, especially Ms. Newton's in the
bizarre title role. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `THE CELEBRATION,' directed by Thomas Vinterberg (R, 100
minutes). Working under a set of self-imposed restrictions that are
meant to return filmmaking to a fundamental honesty, this Danish
director shows off dazzling ingenuity. The story of a family
reunion that becomes a black-tie, psyche-bashing blowout is told
with a hand-held camera, without any special lighting or props or
sound, and the effect is invigorating rather than austere.
Imaginative angles, nimble editing and fluid, agile camera work
keep the film spinning, as a large Danish cast makes the
festivities seem utterly real. The central drama is Shakespeare for
the tell-all age, as a patriarch is haunted by past sins and
vengeful children. ``It is quite a job being toastmaster tonight,''
says one partygoer, putting it mildly. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `HAPPINESS,' starring Jane Adams and Dylan Baker. Directed by
Todd Solondz (not rated; 135 minutes). In a much bigger film than
his ``Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' this audacious, deadpan filmmaker
explores loneliness in his murderously funny fashion. Outrageous
touches _ none more so than its title _ come easily to
``Happiness,'' and so do the dark secrets that would surely have
brought it an NC-17 rating. No point in cataloging this film's
perverse details: What emerges most clearly is a ruthless yet
tender portrait of suburban characters seeking romance, captured
with enough acid precision to make this a ``Bob and Carol and Ted
and Alice'' for totally dysfunctional times. Ms. Adams plays the
dartboard in a three-sister family with hilarious tremulousness.
Baker's gutsy portrayal of a bland-seeming pederast, who is also a
respected doctor and a loving father, is impossible to forget.
(Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `HOLY MAN,' starring Eddie Murphy, Jeff Goldblum and Kelly
Preston. Directed by Stephen Herek (PG, 113 minutes). For all the
funny possibilities of Murphy's transforming himself into a bald,
beatific sage, this comedy doesn't know what to do with him.
Especially when it drags him into a spoof of home-shopping sales
pitches on television, the barn-size target that achieves satire so
nicely by itself. After enjoying Murphy's guru shtick at first, the
film reduces him to a mere catalyst in the cubic zirconium between
Goldblum and Ms. Preston, as two slick television executives.
Dopey, smutty double-entendres don't make it any funnier. (Janet
Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `THE INHERITORS,' directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky (R, 90 minutes).
An enterprising new filmmaker sets this political allegory in rural
Austria during the 1930s, and shoots it as if revisiting the work
of the Dutch masters. But in telling what happens when a group of
peasants collectively inherit the farm on which they have been
working, he lets an arrestingly sharp premise go slack as it goes
along. Increasingly unfocused, his film sketches individual
characters archly but lets them grow dull. The workers' plan for
asserting a new order is expressed as much through wordless
slurping of soup as through resonant dialogue. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `LOLITA,' starring Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain. Directed by
Adrian Lyne (R, 137 minutes). At last, Lyne's fine, deeply felt
adaptation of Nabokov's diabolical masterpiece can be seen in the
large-screen format it truly deserves. Why go out? Because the
detail and texture of this lavishly produced film shine
theatrically in ways that weren't possible on Showtime, and because
the film's mostly unalloyed subtlety (except in its opening and
closing sections) rewards a closer view. Lyne's direction is the
best work of his career. Irons' splendid performance conveys a
tragicomic blend of ardor and conscience, while Ms. Swain plays the
title role as a startlingly unpredictable adult-child hybrid. For a
culture so obsessed with youth and beauty, this haunting ``Lolita''
is a fascinating sign of its times. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `THE MIGHTY,' starring Elden Hensen, Kieran Culkin and Sharon
Stone. Directed by Peter Chelsom (PG-13, 107 minutes). Though the
young-adult novel ``Freak the Mighty'' has been renamed for a more
inspirational effect on screen, it remains mostly a story for the
age group that would find ``freak'' the most enticing word in the
title. Two young actors play appealing misfits who form a fanciful,
symbiotic bond full of Arthurian daydreams. Ms. Stone, in
just-folks mufti, plays one boy's down-to-earth mom as earnestly as
she can. Extraneous melodrama features Gillian Anderson, Meat Loaf
and James Gandolfini. The director of ``Hear My Song'' and ``Funny
Bones'' makes his first American film without quite as much
beguiling whimsy as those earlier films displayed. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `ONE TRUE THING,' starring Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and
William Hurt. Directed by Carl Franklin (PG-13, 120 minutes). This
film adaptation of the novel by Anna Quindlen _ a former columnist
for The New York Times _ about an ambitious New York journalist
forced to move back in with her parents to care for her dying
mother strikes a sad and universal chord. And Ms. Streep and Ms.
Zellweger are beautifully matched as a mother and daughter who
achieve a grown-up understanding during this anguished time. But
the movie treads the line between soap opera and serious drama and
has far too many cute and sentimental touches. Its structure _ the
story is told in flashbacks that make the mother's death a kind of
whodunit (she dies from an overdose of morphine) _ also cheapens
the movie without ruining it. (Stephen Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `PECKER,' starring Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci. Directed
by John Waters (R, 87 minutes). Waters, the Trash King of
Baltimore, does his best to puncture New York art-world pretensions
in a film whose biggest joke is its title, though plenty of winking
smaller jokes are here, too. ``Flavor of Month Causes Tizzy in Art
World'' reads a headline summarizing the career of the title
character, a Baltimore shutterbug who just won't quit snapping
friends and neighbors. In the film, fame and fortune threaten
Pecker's trashy esthetic and gross-out chic. Waters' own style
hasn't had to sacrifice these at all. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `PRACTICAL MAGIC,' starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman.
Directed by Griffin Dunne (PG-13, 105 minutes). A new look for
Halloween: super-cute. In a bouncy, bubble-brained movie with the
look of a shelter magazine, it's Barbie Joins a Coven time as the
stars shake long flossy hair and play witch sisters. They flounce
through a story (based on Alice Hoffman's fanciful novel) in which
magic is for dealing with menfolk and brooms look all too cozily at
home. Fatuous and retrograde as this is, it's also guilty fun,
especially when Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing are on hand to
play the senior witches of this family. Aidan Quinn plays clean-cut
Right without casting a spell. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `RONIN,' starring Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Stellan Skarsgaard,
Natascha McElhone and Jonathan Pryce. Directed by John
Frankenheimer (R, 121 minutes). Directing like a world-weary
Hitchcock with a taste for the breathless car chase, Frankenheimer
propels this tale of intrigue through its tightly plotted paces so
expertly that he even makes an action hero of De Niro. European in
both its brooding tone and beautiful French settings, this story of
double-dealing mercenaries in pursuit of a metal suitcase features
a tough, expert cast and some sensational action sequences.
Frankenheimer directs them in fast, efficient, no-frills fashion
because no extra frills are needed. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,' starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom
Sizemore, Jeremy Davies and Edward Burns. Directed by Steven
Spielberg (R, 168 minutes). Spielberg's soberly magnificent new
film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning back the clock to
restore passion and meaning to the genre, he works in a spirit of
urgent communication to look at war as if it had not been looked at
before. Tour-de-force battle scenes are frank without
sensationalism, and the same great storyteller who made you believe
there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the closet has made this an
irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale. Hanks continues to astonish
with admirable modesty, and the rest of the casting is comparably
inspired. As he did with ``Schindler's List,'' Spielberg has made a
landmark film of devastating power. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER NEVER CRIES,' starring Leelee Sobieski,
Kris Kristofferson and Barbara Hershey. Directed by James Ivory (R,
120 minutes). Working without a classic at hand, the Merchant-Ivory
team adapts a novel by Kaylie Jones, James Jones' daughter, into a
colorful panorama weakened by autobiographical sprawl. With no real
narrative shapeliness and a loosely anecdotal pace, it vividly
recalls the coming of age of a sensitive young woman who (though
well played by 14-year-old Ms. Sobieski) remains a more slender,
peripheral figure than the film's ambitions require. Moving from
Paris to America, it succeeds more at evoking detail and atmosphere
than in finding the heart of her story. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,' starring Cameron Diaz, Ben
Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (R,
119 minutes). Sometimes Western civilization declines in
deliriously funny style. Hence this proudly obnoxious comedy is a
hoot in every sense, deserving a smidgen of disapproval and a whole
lot of helpless laughter. Set in motion by a prom, a crush and a
cruel, cruel zipper, this paean to low humor works ridiculously
well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all
appearances) authentically inane. The principal cast is bright and
appealing, with Ms. Diaz at her most beautiful and blithe. Do note
that this film strives hard for something to offend everyone, and
that a tolerance for zit jokes is unfortunately required. (Janet
Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `WHAT DREAMS MAY COME,' starring Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding
Jr. and Annabella Sciorra. Directed by Vincent Ward (R, 106
minutes). If the Gothic-romantic special effects in this turgid pop
fable set in the afterlife are some of the trippiest ever devised
for a serious drama, this sudsy fantasy about married soul mates
who meet after death never comes emotionally alive. Williams is at
his fake-sincere worst as the world's most devoted husband who dies
in a car crash and goes to heaven. Ms. Sciorra is simply blank as
the wife who commits suicide and must be rescued from hell.
Gooding, glaringly miscast, plays Williams' angelic guide. (Holden)
</P>
<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   `CREATING A NATION: THE CINEMA OF ISRAEL.' With a screening of
``Avanti Popolo'' at 7:30 Saturday night at the Walter Reade
Theater, the Film Society of Lincoln Center begins a 27-film
retrospective that traces 50 years of Israeli cinema. In Israel's
first 50 years, its films have confronted the issues that have
shaped the nation: conflicts with neighboring Arab states,
relations with Palestinians, cultural differences among Israel's
myriad Jewish communities. ``Avanti Popolo,'' directed by Rafi
Bukaee, follows two Egyptian soldiers stranded in the Sinai desert
during the final hours of the Six-Day War in 1967. Another series
highlight is Shimon Dotan's ``Smile of the Lamb,'' about the West
Bank. The series continues through Nov. 11 at the Walter Reade, at
Lincoln Center. Tickets: $8.50; $5 for Film Society members; $4.50
for the elderly at weekday matinees. Information: (212) 875-5600.

GLOBAL WARMING NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE DESPITE SENATE OPPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 25) (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last December world leaders, exhausted but
exhilarated, emerged from marathon negotiations in Kyoto, Japan,
with an agreement to cut emissions of greenhouse gases that many
scientists say are dangerously warming the earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton immediately hailed the agreement, known as the
Kyoto Protocol, as ``environmentally strong and economically
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   But while it called for deep slashes in emissions by industrial
nations, it exempted developing countries from similar cuts. That
angered the U.S. Senate, which earlier in the year had voted 95-0
to reject any treaty that did not impose the same requirements on
the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the Senate objections, the Clinton administration
planned to mount a year-long public relations campaign led by Vice
President Al Gore, a fervent supporter of environmental causes.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and its allies in the environmental movement
believed that such a campaign would keep the issue before the
public until negotiators met again on Nov. 2 in Buenos Aires.
There, they hoped, U.S. negotiators could persuade some of the
major developing countries, particularly China and India, to agree
to emission cuts.
</P>
<P>
   With some major developing countries on board and the American
public behind the agreement, the administration assumed it could
then persuade the Senate to ratify the accord.
</P>
<P>
   But that scenario blew up on Jan. 21, when the Monica Lewinsky
scandal broke. With Clinton fighting for his political life, the
Kyoto agreement, along with many other issues, was pushed aside as
the White House marshaled most of its energy on saving the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for people to focus on the melting icecaps in the
Antarctic when they're being titillated by Monica,'' said William
Bumper, an environmental lawyer here who is an expert on global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's troubles didn't stop opponents of the Kyoto agreement,
particularly industry groups, from waging their own PR campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With no counter-attacks from the administration, the campaign
succeeded to such an extent that even environmental groups have
acknowledged it has hurt their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were in trouble when my 13-year-old son was swayed
by a commercial that shows a pair of scissors cutting out
developing countries on a world map with a voice in the background
saying that these countries will be let off the hook,'' said Nancy
Kete, director of the global climate change program at the World
Resources Institute, an environmental group here.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's failure to rally public support for the
Kyoto accord also has allowed opposition to the treaty to harden in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost no support for the agreement as it stands in
the Senate,'' said Deb Fiddelke, press secretary for Sen. Chuck
Hagel, R-Neb., a leading opponent of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   And without Senate support, environmentalists concede that the
agreement has virtually no chance of being accepted by the world's
other industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is like the 800-pound gorilla in the living
room,'' said Alden Meyer, director of government relations for the
environmental group Union of Concerned Scientists. ``You just can't
ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   But nations backing the agreement are pressing ahead. When
diplomats from 160 nations meet on Nov. 2 in Buenos Aires, they
hope to hammer out details on methods to monitor and enforce the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   American negotiators _ led by Stuart Eizenstat, undersecretary
of state for economic, business and agricultural affairs _ will try
to entice some developing countries to agree to emission cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has made clear that developing countries
must be a part of any treaty,'' said David Sandalow, associate
director for International Environmental Policy for the White House
Council on Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   As it now stands, the accord would require the world's
industrial nations to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and
five other heat-trapping greenhouse gases to 5.2 percent, on
average, below their 1990 levels. The United States would be
required to cut emissions 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties, Kete and other environmentalists
believe the Senate eventually will ratify the accord. They cite
polls from environmental groups showing that a majority of
Americans, while not favoring the Kyoto agreement, nonetheless
consider global warming a major environmental threat.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, environmentalists argue, governments will be unable
to ignore the growing impact of global warming on the earth over
the next 10 or 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the country and the world begin to see more floods and
more droughts and higher temperatures, there will be no choice but
to act,'' said Daniel Lashof, senior scientist at the environmental
group Natural Resources Defense Council.

THEATER NOTES: SMALL BUDGETS, BIG SUCCESSES; ON THE DOTTED LINE; A
PERSONAL DRAMA; MAKING LIGHT OF `MEDEA'; RIGG IN `PHEDRE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three weeks into October, and three new productions
look like bona-fide hits. But unlike in years past, the early
winners are neither new Broadway musicals nor expensive revivals
but small-budget shows in unlikely off-Broadway venues.
</P>
<P>
   The best buzz is emanating from the MCC Theater, a 99-seat black
box on West 28th Street, where Margaret Edson's ``Wit'' has the
management scrambling to find seats for celebrities and for
producers dreaming of a run at a larger house.
</P>
<P>
   The play stars Kathleen Chalfant as a cancer-stricken literature
professor and was originally set for a four-week run. But the show,
co-produced by the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, Conn., has been
extended twice on the strength of glowing reviews, and this week
was extended again, to Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already getting people who are dying for tickets for
Christmas,'' said Bernard Telsey, an executive director. ``My
8-year-old son, Danny, and his friends were called in here on
Sunday to answer phones.''
</P>
<P>
   The extension may be part of a waiting game. Producers say they
are mulling over several offers to move the show, and visited the
Eugene O'Neill Theater on Wednesday, days after ``More to Love''
belly-flopped. Broadway insiders say other possibilities may arise
at the Helen Hayes, where ``Getting and Spending'' opens on Sunday,
and at the Booth, where Sandra Bernhard opens a limited run on Nov.
5.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the musty SoHo Playhouse, the producer Darren Lee
Cole was hiring extra staff to handle the crush of ticket requests
for ``Killer Joe,'' Tracy Letts' potboiler about a murder scheme,
which opened to strong reviews this week and was extended until
mid-December. ``It's going like gangbusters,'' Cole said, adding
that in three days the production sold more than $125,000 worth of
tickets for the 199-seat theater.
</P>
<P>
   Things are also good for ``The Mystery of Irma Vep,'' the
revived Charles Ludlam quick-change comedy at the 250-seat Westside
Theater. Total advance sales topped $350,000 this week, with
producers planning a run at least through January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the heart of the Broadway audience coming,'' said
Richard Frankel, one of the producers. ``We knew we would get young
people, and knew we would get a gay audience, but people are
bringing their children. It's just fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of the shows have recouped their initial investment
yet. ``Wit,'' in fact, is just breaking even, because of a large
cast and small house. And while talk of a Broadway move may
continue, some feel the play's true home is off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the subject matter, I think it's going to be an uphill
battle,'' said Rocco Landesman, president of the Jujamycn Theaters,
``regardless of the quality of the work.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Dotted Line
</P>
<P>
   Actors Equity decided late this week to allow the Tony-winning
Irish actress Anna Manahan to remain in the cast of ``The Beauty
Queen of Leenane'' through March. (She plays Mag Folan, the
overbearing mother.) Under the play's current Equity agreement, the
whole Irish cast was to leave on Jan. 3 to make way for American
actors.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the producers, Steven M. Levy and Leonard Soloway, said
Thursday that the remaining three roles _ played by Marie Mullen,
Tom Murphy and Brian F. O'Byrne _ would be taken over by Americans
in 1999. Kate Burton is considered likely to take Miss Mullen's
role.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Public Theater, the role that had been filled by
Blythe Danner in Arthur Miller's ``Ride Down Mount Morgan'' has
been taken by Frances Conroy. Ms. Danner left the cast on Oct. 13
because of a family matter. Despite the quick replacement, the
change has delayed the play's opening until Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   A Personal Drama
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a weekend for the Chilean playwright Ariel Dorfman.
First, he unveiled two new plays: ``Mascara,'' which opened Friday
at the Julia Morgan Theater in Berkeley, Calif., and ``Who's Who,''
which began Sunday at the Frankfurter Schauspiel in Frankfurt,
Germany. Both were written with his son, Rodrigo, 31.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Saturday came news that the former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, who had forced Dorfman into exile in the 1970s,
had been arrested in London. ``I've been dreaming of this for 25
years,'' Dorfman said. ``He's under arrest and I'm free.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everything was ideal. ``Mascara'' was smeared by the San
Francisco critics. ``Pinochet tried to destroy me,'' Dorfman said.
``I'm not so worried about critics.''
</P>
<P>
   Making Light of `Medea'
</P>
<P>
   Zoe Wanamaker has a secret: ``Medea'' makes her giggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first line of the script is something like `Ay-ay-ay,'''
Ms. Wanamaker said recently from her home in London, sounding
perfectly bubbly. ``I think I would crack up.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Ms. Wanamaker plays the unfortunate Electra, not the
murderous Medea, in the play coming to the Barrymore Theater next
month. But it is telling that Ms. Wanamaker sees humor, and
humanity, in classic roles that are usually approached with grim
faces.

   ``I think the deepest gesture in her is not violence, but
love,'' she said. ``The most important question is not why she must
avenge her father's death but what makes the grief so unbearable in
the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The role is a departure from Ms. Wanamaker's last appearance on
Broadway, in Joe Orton's farce ``Loot'' in 1986. That performance
resulted in a Tony nomination for her, as did her turn in 1981 in
``Piaf.''
</P>
<P>
   What does she make of her chances this time around?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know,'' she said. ``Nominations are nice, but
they're really just icing on the cake.''

<P>
   Rigg in `Phedre'
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Medea, it looks as if Diana Rigg is headed to New
York in ``Phedre,'' from London's Almeida Theater. A deal is nearly
complete to bring the show, along with another Racine play,
``Britannicus,'' to the Brooklyn Academy of Music for a two-week
run in January. Both are directed by Jonathan Kent, who directed
Ms. Rigg in ``Medea'' on Broadway in 1994.

TOUGH PART OF USC'S SEASON BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  &HT;     (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Southern California wide receiver R. Jay Soward
thought for a minute, trying to remember the last time the Trojans
played for stakes as high as this week's game with Oregon.
<P>
   It didn't take long to come up with an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been in a game like this before. I've never been a
contender for anything since I've been at USC,'' Soward said. ``We
haven't been in a big game.''
</P>
<P>
   For all but a handful of seniors who were members of USC's 1996
Rose Bowl championship team, this week's game is a new experience:
An important game that has bowl implicatons.
</P>
<P>
   There have been big games against Notre Dame and UCLA, but
nothing the past few years compares to this week's contest in
Eugene. The Trojans (5-2, 3-1) and the 12th-ranked Ducks (5-1, 2-1)
are basically playing a Rose Bowl elimination game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be interesting to see how we respond,'' Soward
said. ``I know the game means a lot more. We need a big win.''
</P>
<P>
   The loser can forget about a trip to Pasadena, while the winner
at least keeps its hopes alive. Each team's bowl possibilities
could also hinge on this contest.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have Washington, Stanford, UCLA and Notre Dame left
on the schedule after Oregon. Every team but Stanford has a winning
record, so a loss to the Ducks could be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the season is make it or break it,'' linebacker
David Gibson said. ``I had gone into this thinking we would beat
Cal and Washington State. We're on our heels. We're in a bind. We
can still go to a bowl game if we lose, but our goal is not to just
go to a bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as the Trojans would enjoy a trip to the Rose Bowl, it's
probably more realistic to say they need to win at least two of
their final five games to become eligible for a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   A small accomplishment? Not when you consider USC hasn't played
in a bowl in three years.
</P>
<P>
   It might be hard for the players to focus on that, however, when
they consider how close they are to being undefeated in the
Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   If the Trojans had not blown a 21-point lead against Cal two
weeks ago, this week's game would not be quite as crucial. Even as
USC focuses on Oregon, it's still difficult not to look back and
ponder that loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely on my mind still,'' linebacker Chris Claiborne
said. ``I just take it to each game with me.''
</P>
<P>
   As disappointing as the Cal game turned out for the Trojans,
they are still grasping with a new role: being Pac-10 contenders in
late October. The past two seasons, the Trojans have been busier
figuring out what went wrong with the first part of the season,
content to try and salvage some respect while most attention
focused on the status of the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been crazy the past couple years,'' Soward said. ``This
is a great opportunity for the football team. We're not pointing
fingers this year. The only thing going on is a slight quarterback
controversy.'
</P>
<P>
   By winning five of their first seven games, USC's on-field
performance finally remains the No. 1 priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' Gibson said. ``It hasn't been like this since
high school where we were in a playoff-type situation and you can
make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Even chronic problem issues of the recent past like team
leadership have been put aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to become a team and gain an identity,''
Claiborne said. ``This is the first year we've come together and
had a good record. When you win, all the complaints go away.''
</P>
<P>
   But winning in Eugene remains a formidable task. USC hasn't
exactly demonstrated the ability to win conference road games,
going 3-5 the previous two seasons. Last week's 42-14 victory at
Washington State was a start, although the Cougars are 0-2 at home
against Pac-10 foes.
</P>
<P>
   A far bigger task, with major ramifications, awaits Saturday
against the Ducks. At least the Trojans are not lacking confidence
_ something that couldn't be said the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can beat this team,'' receiver Mike Bastianelli said.
``They're not supermen. Is this a make or break game? Yeah.''

ON FIRST DAY OF TRADING, JAPANESE PHONE COMPANY'S SHARES SOAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (dl) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The world's largest initial public offering in dollar
terms got off to a soaring start Thursday as shares of NTT Mobile
Communications Network Inc., Japan's largest mobile telephone
company, jumped more than 19 percent in their first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The widely anticipated new stock closed 750,000 yen above its
3.9 million yen issue price, ending at 4.65 million yen, or
$39,500.
</P>
<P>
   The offering raised 2.13 trillion yen, or more than $18 billion,
which NTT Docomo, as the company is known, will use to pay down
debts and make capital investments. The biggest initial offering
before NTT Docomo belonged to its parent, Nippon Telephone and
Telegraph Co., which raised $13.6 billion in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   While the issue price was high, about $33,200, analysts said the
stock was deliberately offered at a discount to insure a successful
offering and allow individuals, who were allotted 45 percent of the
initial shares sold, to profit handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese institutional investors accounted for much of the
stock's jump, according to analysts. They were allotted just 25
percent of the offering, but because many of them gauge their
performance against the Topix index of stocks listed on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, they needed to buy more.
</P>
<P>
   The Topix is weighted according to market capitalization, and
NTT Docomo is now Japan's third-largest company by that measure
behind NTT, which owns 67 percent of NTT Docomo after the offering,
and the Toyota Motor Corp. Because of its size, the only way
institutions can hope to match the index is by owning at least some
shares of NTT Docomo.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the shares were allotted to foreign institutional
investors. Keiji Tachikawa, the president of NTT Docomo, said the
company would consider splitting its stock to make it more
accessible to individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   The stock is likely to continue to perform well, analysts have
said. NTT Docomo controls 57 percent of the Japanese cellular
telephone market, which continues to grow, and it is poised to
control a large chunk of the market for cellular data transmission
if it succeeds in transforming its money-losing PHS voice service
into a conduit for digital information.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, after the stock market closed here, the company
announced that it expected consolidated earnings for the six months
that ended Sept. 30 of 85 billion yen, a 97.9 percent increase
compared with results from the period a year earlier. Revenue is
expected to rise 11.9 percent, to 1.4 trillion yen.
</P>
<P>
   Tachikawa said the company would spend 40 percent of the money
it raised through the offering to pay down debt, while an
additional 40 percent would go to write off debts taken on by its
regional units to invest in PHS. The rest will go toward capital
investment, he said.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT: NETSCAPE SET US UP FOR ANTITRUST CHARGE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1995, the young designer of the first browsing
tool for the World Wide Web, tried to snare Microsoft Corp. in an
antitrust trap, the lead lawyer for the software giant charged in
federal court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said that when Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape
Communications Corp., was questioned about why he had taken such
detailed notes on his laptop of a June 21, 1995, Silicon Valley
meeting between key Netscape and Microsoft executives, he replied:
``I thought it might be a topic of discussion with the U.S.
government on antitrust issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen made the comment in a deposition taken in August 1997
by the Texas attorney general's office in Austin. Twenty states
(but not Texas) have joined the Justice Department in alleging that
Microsoft has abused its Windows monopoly to squash Netscape after
the browser maker spurned an offer to divide the market,
purportedly made at the June 21 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, a Netscape lawyer minimized Andreessen's
comments. ``He has this incredibly sarcastic temperament,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Andreessen's served as Netscape's 23-year-old chief
technology officer. His holdings in the Netscape later came to be
worth about $80 million, the fruits of his having led a team that
created Mosaic, the first graphical tool to surf the Internet,
while still a student at the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth day of the landmark antitrust trial, James
Barksdale, who was recruited in January 1995 to run Netscape while
the fledgling firm suffered from a deep cash crunch, described
Microsoft's alleged market-splitting bid.
</P>
<P>
   With his soft Southern voice rising in anger, Barksdale said
when ``the manufacturer of an operating system that controls 90
percent-plus of the world's (personal computer) platforms pulls the
browser into the operating system, (it) has stepped across the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Barksdale testified that a Microsoft
official ``proposed that a line be drawn between the area'' where
Netscape would compete against Microsoft, turning the potentially
lucrative Windows 95 market entirely over to Microsoft. In return,
Barksdale said, cash-laden Microsoft offered to make an investment
in Netscape and take a seat on its board.
</P>
<P>
   During a day of tough questioning by John Warden, Microsoft's
lead lawyer in the case, Barksdale said the bid prompted him to
ask, ``where is this line going to end, and what keeps the line
from moving?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this anything more than just a difference of opinion going
on between you and Microsoft about where the line is?'' Warden
wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were going to put the browser in your (new Windows 95)
operating system and give it away for free on all (computing)
platforms,'' he replied. ``In the June meeting, that's the first I
knew about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are a little company and you're a big company with
unlimited resources. You're going to move the line any time you
want against our economic interests,'' Barksdale said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft countered Barksdale's comments about monopoly
leveraging by introducing Netscape's own sales figures. They showed
that use of Netscape Navigator Web browser rose by more than 60
percent during a year-long period that government antitrust
investigators say Microsoft was engaged in a systematic campaign to
crush its Internet market rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only fair conclusion that can be reached is that Marc
Andreessen invented or imagined a proposal to divide markets and
that you and your company have signed on to this invention or
imaginary concoction in order to assist the Justice Department in
the prosecution of this lawsuit,'' Warden thundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a witness to it, and you weren't,'' Barksdale shot back.

SHUTDOWN OF TROUBLED CHINESE TRUSTS, INVESTMENT COMPANIES LIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dl) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ As signs of deep financial trouble in China's
trust and investment companies come to light, bankers and
economists say they expect the Chinese authorities to close down
dozens more debt-ridden financial houses.
</P>
<P>
   The action seems to be part of a deliberate policy shift in
Beijing rather than a sign of imminent financial crisis, like those
suffered by many other Asian nations. Insolvent trust and
investment companies, a rickety and somewhat outdated part of
China's half-reformed financial system, will no longer be saved.
</P>
<P>
   China is still in the early stages of a complex and difficult
process of making its financial system more responsive to market
forces, better regulated and less prone to manipulation by local
officials. It may take years, if not decades, before a modern
banking or securities system emerges.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Beijing still protects the state-run banks. Trust and
investment companies, however, have become so prone to financial
shenanigans and so dominated by local interests that clash with
those of the Chinese government that Prime Minister Zhu Rongji is
apparently ready to make hard choices.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the People's Bank of China, the nation's central
bank and the chief financial regulator, said trust and investment
companies would be examined case by case. But bankers and
economists said Beijing intended to drastically cut back the number
of such companies, to 40 or so from about 240 today.
</P>
<P>
   The closing early this month of the Guangdong International
Trust and Investment Co., also known as Gitic, has drawn fresh
attention to the crushing debt loads at other trust and investment
companies in China. Creditors understandably are more interested
than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in China's clunky banking system, which is at once chaotic
and secretive, it remains unclear how much of Guangdong
International's $2.4 billion in debt will be assumed by the
government. Most of China's other trust and investment companies
are thought to be deeply in debt as well, with a total of about $10
billion owed to foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investment and trust companies are the weakest sector of
the financial system,'' said Qu Hongbin, an economist with Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson in Hong Kong. ``I'm sure Gitic is not alone.''
</P>
<P>
   China's trust and investment companies, largely creatures of the
1980s, were set up to provide financing in a time before this
country had stock and bond markets, which are still small but
emerging as more efficient financiers.
</P>
<P>
   Because a typical Chinese trust and investment company
essentially operated as the investment arm of a local government,
business decisions were invariably affected by the political and
personal concerns of local leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Guangdong International, in the southern province of Guangdong,
like countless other such companies, used its political connections
for easy access to debt and sank much of its borrowing into real
estate ventures and derivatives. As long as banks were flush, there
was little pressure to repay debt, even when the property market
started to sink badly last year.
</P>
<P>
   Guangdong International's demise was prompted in part, bankers
say, by the way lending from Japanese and South Korean banks dried
up this year as the financial situation in those nations weakened.
Foreign lending to trust and investment companies has been

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Guangdong province government, whose interests have
sometimes seemed indistinguishable from those of Guangdong
International, proposed a detailed bailout plan to Beijing
authorities last month. The answer was no.
</P>
<P>
   That may have been a surprise to the Guangdong officials,
accustomed to having financial problems covered as long as their
political connections were in order. But the message was clear to
trust and investment companies throughout China: The central
government will no longer cover outsized debts automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing announced early this month that the Bank of China, a
commercial bank, would cover Guangdong International's foreign
debts. But the bank's officials said later that it could take
months to evaluate the debts and decide which to pay back,
frustrating many foreign creditors.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. banker in Shanghai complained that while Chinese
officials said they would honor debts that were properly registered
with regulators, there was no system in China to find out which
loans were registered and which were not.
</P>
<P>
   Qu, the economist, observed that the closing of Guangdong
International could not be seen as a purely financial event. Citing
China's president as well as his prime minister, he said: ``Jiang
Zemin and Zhu Rongji want to regain power from regions. Overhauling
the tax system, reining in the trust and investment companies _
these are part of a larger effort.''

JEWISH SETTLERS FEEL BETRAYED BY PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Jewish settlers, some with prayer shawls over their
shoulders and some with machine guns, took to the streets Thursday
for a second day of protests against a peace deal being hammered
out by Israeli and Palestinian leaders in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   As the likelihood of a deal grew, the settlers' protests
intensified. They gathered for early morning prayer vigils, blocked
roads that could soon come under Palestinian control, and waved
Israeli flags. At least five were arrested in confrontations with
police.
</P>
<P>
   For these ultranationalist settlers, the possible peace deal is
a betrayal of the promises that led them to vote for Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Simon Peres, who helped negotiate
the 1993 Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
   They pray for divine intervention to stop the deal. If that
fails, they vow to topple Netanyahu's fragile coalition through a
vote of no-confidence in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. And
they appear to have the votes to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is criminal treachery,'' said Elyakim Haetzni, a leader of
the settler community in Kiryat Arba who had demonstrated along the
road in Bet El Thursday. ``A Jewish leader, one we voted for, is
signing over Jewish land to the enemy. It is a betrayal to those
who voted for him.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 160,000 Israelis live in an archipelago of 144 Jewish
settlements scattered among the 1.5 million Palestinians in the
West Bank, which was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Six
Day War. They feel threatened by the current compromise, which
calls for a 13 percent further Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   They believe they are biblically ordained to control the land of
Judea and Samaria, as they refer to the West Bank. And they fear
for their lives if the Palestinians take control of the areas along
the roads they use every day to go to and from Jerusalem and Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only 13 percent,'' added Haetzni. ``This is the
end of the land of Israel, the severing of our link to the promise
land. We wil pay for this with our blood if we do not stop it. We
will punish Netanyahu. He will die a political death.''
</P>
<P>
   Their words and their banners can be apocalyptic. Some of the
violent rhetoric seems chilling three years after Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin was gunned down by Yigal Amir, a right-wing extremist
with deep ties to the settler movement.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kleiner, a hard-line settler, warned Netanyahu in the
Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv, ``We have a sword to your throat, and
when I am talking about a sword I am not merely philosophizing. ...
You can stop this.''
</P>
<P>
   But as some observers point out the protests are subdued
compared to the large crowds and deeper vitriol found in similar
demonstrations from 1994 through 1996, when Rabin's government
began the initial troop withdrawls from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that Netanyahu has marginalized the
ultra-nationalist movement by aligning himself with more
established members of the right, such as former general Ariel
Sharon, his new foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Take Oren Amit, a 22-year-old resident of the Dolev settlement
in the West Bank. He feels ``betrayed'' by Netanyahu's efforts in
Maryland, but he also realizes there is no real political
alternative to him. ``The truth is we don't know what other choices
we have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Keinon, a Jerusalem Post reporter who covers the
settlements, said: ``Rabin slapped the settlers. Netanyahu has
stroked them. He permitted construction in the settlements, brought
them into the inner political circle. So the streets are relatively
quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardliners have, to some extent, been coopted despite
their strong words,'' he added. ``There is no way for them to
muster real anger against an agreement made by Netanyahu and
Sharon. Now is Netanyahu just politically smart or truly empathetic
to the settlers' cause? I think it is both.''

COVER-UP CHARGED IN KILLING OF BISHOP IN GUATEMALA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY _ Forensic teams from three countries have tried
to unravel the mystery, but have come to radically different
conclusions. Nearly six months after Juan Gerardi, a Roman Catholic
bishop and outspoken human rights advocate here, was bludgeoned to
death, a solution to his slaying appears further away than ever,
even as the political controversy surrounding the case continues to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, the Guatemalan
government continues to maintain that the killing was a crime
without a political motive, and imprisoned a dog that prosecutors
say took part in it. But the Roman Catholic Church and human rights
groups say elements of the Guatemalan armed forces were involved in
the killing, and point to the increasingly bizarre turns the case
has taken as proof of an official cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gerardi's death has become a major test of the 1996
peace accord that brought an end to 36 years of civil war here and
was supposed to install the principle of civilian supremacy. With
prosecutors now implying that the bishop was the victim of a
homosexual ``crime of passion'' committed by a priest, many
Guatemalans appear to be increasingly suspicious of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most significant case of recent times, but what we
have is an investigation designed to cover up, not reveal, the
truth,'' said Frank LaRue, director of the Center for Legal Action
in Human Rights, a leading human rights group here. ``If impunity
is tolerated in this case, it will be an enormous step backward for
Guatemala and for the rule of law in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here last Friday, Jean Arnault, director of
the U.N. mission that is monitoring the peace accord, called on the
government to ``show bravery and determination'' in its
investigation and ``not let a single clue go unexplored.''
</P>
<P>
   Public suspicions of official involvement in the killing and of
a cover-up are ``a perfectly reasonable hypothesis'' that ``in our
judgment is fully justified,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we think of the recent history of Guatemala, we know that
groups exist that have both the capacity and the motive to carry
out a political crime that has the appearance of a common crime,''
said Arnault, who under the terms of the peace agreement has the
authority to investigate the case. ``The murder of Monsignor
Gerardi,'' he added, ``continues as a shadow over the state of
justice in Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism over the official version has taken root because on
April 24 the bishop made public an exhaustive study of human rights
violations conducted by a church group. Laying the groundwork for
possible prosecutions, the report concluded that the Guatemalan
armed forces and other official bodies were responsible for 80
percent of the 150,000 deaths and 50,000 disappearances that
occurred during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, as he was returning from dinner with
relatives, Gerardi, who was 75, was beaten to death in the garage
of his residence. Mario Orantes Najera, a fellow priest and the
bishop's housemate for the last eight years, reported finding his
bloody and battered body that night.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, police said the killing was a common crime
with no political links and arrested Carlos Enrique Vielman, 24, a
homeless man who often slept in a park across the street from the
parish house. But he was released after it was established that his
right arm had suffered injuries that made it impossible for him to
wield the 8-pound concrete block that police say was the murder
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the case took an even more surprising twist when the
parish house was surrounded by 70 heavily armed police officers and
Orantes was arrested, along with the parish cook, and accused of
the killing. At that point, government officials began to describe
the murder as a ``crime of passion,'' leading to news reports,
which Orantes has repeatedly denied, that the clergymen may have
been involved in some sort of secret homosexual group.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, prosecutors formally charged Orantes with the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   As proof of Orantes' supposed involvement in the killing, which
he denies, prosecutors described bites on the bishop's body that
they said came from a dog that is owned by Orantes and responds
only to his commands. The dog, a crippled 11-year-old German
shepherd named Baloo, was also taken into custody, and, like
Orantes, is still being held.
</P>
<P>
   But the Baloo hypothesis now appears to have collapsed. Late
last month, with a three-man team of American forensic experts
looking on at the request of the Roman Catholic archdiocese, the
bishop's body was exhumed and a new autopsy was performed by a
Spanish coroner whom human rights advocates accuse of covering up
military atrocities during El Salvador's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In a report made public last week, the American experts
concluded that Gerardi was assaulted by ``at least two attackers,
if not more,'' and that he was struck by another weapon, probably a
metal pipe, before his head was smashed with the concrete block.
They also determined that the dog's involvement was ``physically
impossible,'' noting that ``none of the wounds on the bishop have
the specific characteristics of a dog bite or tooth mark.''
</P>
<P>
   The special prosecutor in the case, Otto Ardon Medina, a former
legal adviser to the Guatemalan Air Force, did not respond to
requests for an interview. But in recent remarks to the Guatemalan
press, he and other government officials have questioned the
patriotism of human rights leaders, deprecated evidence indicating
military involvement in the killing and accused Arnault of
``conducting a parallel investigation, one that is beyond his
jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaining of a lack of cooperation, including the denial of
access to investigative reports that are supposed to be public
records, the church and human rights groups have conducted their
own investigation of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of loose ends, and government prosecutors are
simply refusing to look into them,'' said Helen Mack Chang,
director of the Myrna Mack Foundation, a leading human rights group
here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That unofficial inquiry has developed several leads that appear
to fly in the face of government assurances that its security
forces were not involved in the killing. For instance, a church
report said that a telephone call made from the house after the
killing but before the arrival of police was traced to a public
telephone near a military base.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, church officials said, witnesses observed a car
parked near the house at the time of the killing. The license plate
was noted, and has been traced to a military garrison east of here.
</P>
<P>
   Religious and human rights groups have also called for an
investigation into the actions of Capt. Byron Lima Oliva and his
father, Col. Byron Lima Estrada, a former head of military
intelligence, on the night of the killing. Citing what they call
``credible and confidential'' informants, the organizations now
suggest that the two military officers ``were responsible for the
murder.'' The two men have told prosecutors they had no involvement
in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the killing, Lima Oliva was reassigned to
Cyprus as an observer to the U.N peacekeeping mission there.
Because of the church's denunciation, he has since been recalled,
but human rights groups complain that they have not been allowed to
sit in on his interrogation, as is permitted by Guatemalan law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tired of tricks and tired of conspiracies,'' Ms. Mack
said. ``It is time for the government to assume its responsibility
and stop the manipulation and the threats, because if it does not,
no one will ever dare to take a case to court and impunity will
continue to reign in this country.''

BOSTON GLOBE SELECTS METRO COLUMNISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Globe editor Matthew V. Storin announced Thursday that
Globe State House reporter Adrian Walker and White House
correspondent Brian McGrory have been selected to become columnists
for the newspaper's Metro section.
</P>
<P>
   McGrory and Walker, both 36, have extensive experience covering
local news, government, and politics, including some of the biggest
stories the Globe has reported since both men joined the newspaper
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrian and Brian arrive at these jobs from different
perspectives and backgrounds, but both are well-trained, widely
experienced journalists who will add richness and texture to our
local news presentation,'' Storin said in an announcement to the
newspaper's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Walker and McGrory will join Eileen McNamara, the Globe's
Pulitzer Prize-winning Metro columnist, in writing twice-weekly
columns that appear on the Metro/Region front.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara will write her column for the Sunday and Wednesday
editions. McGrory's columns will appear on Tuesdays and Fridays,
while Walker will write for the Thursday and Saturday papers. Both
new columnists are scheduled to start the week of Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   McGrory and Walker will fill vacancies created by the
resignations earlier this year of columnists Patricia Smith and
Mike Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was asked to resign in June after she admitted fabricating
characters in four columns. Barnicle's resignation was requested in
August after he acknowledged that he did not know the identity of
characters he quoted directly in a 1995 column about two children
with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   McGrory, who has covered the White House for the Globe since May
1996, was raised in Roslindale, Mass., and Weymouth, Mass.. He is a
1984 graduate of Bates College. After working as a reporter at the
Patriot Ledger of Quincy and the New Haven Register, McGrory joined
the Globe in 1989 as a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, a native of Miami, attended Florida &UR;  &LR; International
University before joining the Miami News as an editorial assistant
in 1986. He became a general assignment and police reporter in
1987, and came to the Globe in 1989 as a general assignment
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, both new columnists expressed delight about their
new assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to take on an assignment that many consider the
greatest on a newspaper,'' Walker said. ``It's at once a huge
challenge, a great privilege, and an amazing opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Added McGrory: ``I look forward to getting back to Boston, the
greatest city in the country and a place where real people actually
care about real things. The challenge ahead is to find those things
people care about most and to tell their stories.''

KPTY-RADIO (Phoenix) - A Phoenix area radio station, struggling in

audience. By MICHAEL CLANCY. Story will move in the ``E''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PORK-ARIZONA (Washington) - Looking for example of egregious
Arizona pork in the new federal budget. By ADRIANNE FLYNN and JEFF
BARKER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOMELESS-KIDS-ART (Phoenix) - Three nights a week, Steven Serrano
and Linda Silva go out in a white van and drive slowly through the
worst areas in Phoenix and Tempe, looking for young homeless kids.
Invisible by day, the teenagers emerge from the dark shadows of the
street with their hands outstretched when they see the van. Every
kid out here has a different story, but there are similar plot
lines. The Children's Action Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy agency,
estimated in 1990 that there were 5,000 runaway and homeless youth
in Arizona. Now, estimates run as high as 10,000. With PHOTO. By
KARINA BLAND. Story moved in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GAGNON-COMIC (Phoenix) - More than 16,000 tickets to Celine Dion's
concert went on sale on a Sunday back in April. In only two days,
all were sold. You have to figure that at some point, about 15,999
of those buyers were looking at their tickets and wondering, ``Who
the hell is Andre-Philippe Gagnon?'' With CELINE DION-MUSIC. By
RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CELINE DION-MUSIC (Phoenix) - The gushing tone was undeniable.
``Celine Dion is just incredible,'' the woman on the phone said.
``She is such a diva.'' It made me pause. Celine Dion is a lot of
things. Wildly successful, sure. Canadian, of course. Multilingual,
oui. But a diva? I think not. With GAGNON-COMIC. By RANDY CORDOVA.
Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CONNIE FRANICIS-MUSIC (Undated) - Rock-and-roll stardom, drug
addiction, mental illness, violent crime _ it was just a matter of
time before someone made a documentary about Connie Francis.
Luckily, the Arts and Entertainment channel took up the task of
telling the singer's story, so ``Connie Francis: America's
Sweetheart of Song'' manages to be revealing without being too
sordid. Lord knows how the E! channel would have handled it. By
RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HERBS-FOOD (Undated) - Forty years ago, Anne Fischer was served
herb butter on her bread in a restaurant. ``I thought, `My
goodness, what is that stuff, and how do I find out about it?' ''
Fischer said. She went to the library and checked out a book. A few
decades and a lot of herbs later, Fischer is the author of the
Arizona Herb Association's ``The Low Desert Herb Gardening
Handbook,'' which focuses on planting, growing and harvesting herbs
in Arizona. She has learned a lot about cooking with herbs along
the way. With PHOTO and HERBS-HEALTH. By JUDY WALKER. Story moved
in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HERBS-HEALTH (Undated) - Doctors still grimace at the mention of
them. However, for the ever-increasing number of people who are
disillusioned with synthetic medicines and their often-harsh side
effects, herbal remedies have become more mainstream as the 20th
century comes to a close. With HERBS-FOOD. By THOMAS ROPP. Story
moved in the ``L'' catgory. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Undated) - It wasn't the first sneeze that scared
me. When I heard my husband sneeze a third, fourth and fifth time
from the living room, I still had no fear. I wasn't scared until my
husband woke up the next morning and shook me awake. ``Honey, I
don't feel so good,'' he squeaked out. ``My throat feels
scratchy.'' By LAURI NOTARO. Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PLEASANT-MOVIE (Undated) - If average Americans spend a quarter of
their lives watching TV, why not go all the way and live inside a
TV world? They do in ``Pleasantville,'' a mostly comic fantasy that
takes ``The Truman Show'' idea and turns it inside out. Unhappily,
writer/director Gary Ross pushes his metaphor too far, and the film
loses its sense of fun and becomes preachy. 3 stars. By BOB
FENSTER. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
APT PUPIL-MOVIE (Undated) - The attempt to bring Stephen King's
novella about the deadly friendship between a former Nazi war
criminal and a white-bread teen to the screen. It's had as many
headaches as it has camera shots. 3 stars. By BOB FENSTER. Story
moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ORGAZMO-MOVIE (Undated) - When a movie is rated NC-17, it usually
means that anyone younger than 17 can't get into the theater. In
the case of ``Orgazmo,'' it should mean that anyone with an IQ over
17 doesn't qualify. 1 star. By BOB FENSTER. Story moved in the
``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (Undated) - And now, ``A Tale of Two Grand Ams'': ``It
was the best of cars, it was the worst of cars.'' No kidding. Truth
be told, the two Grand Ams in question _ the sportier GT model and
the standard-issue SE _ were like Cain and Abel, Yin and Yang. One

HINDU PARTY IN INDIA RETREATS ON SACRED TEXTS IN SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dl) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Religion and politics, a combustible mix
here, exploded Thursday in a furor over a proposal to make the
study of sacred Hindu texts compulsory for all children in this
vast country of many faiths.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which is led by Hindu nationalists, circulated
the proposal to state education ministers before convening an
official conference here Thursday. A result was a whirlwind of
protest from opposition political parties and even some of the
administration's allies.
</P>
<P>
   When the national education conference opened, officials from 10
of the 25 states stormed out over what they described as an assault
on the secular fabric of India. They said they were outraged by the
decision of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party to open
the conference with the recitation of a hymn to a Hindu goddess,
Saraswati.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the conference began, the party, which dominates the
government, began distancing itself from the proposal, which
advocated that curriculums be ``Indianized, nationalized and
spiritualized'' and that the study of the Vedas and Upanishads,
Hindu Scriptures, be compulsory. On Thursday the party withdrew the
proposal entirely from official consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who heads the party, said
in his opening remarks that schools have to instill a respect for
all faiths. ``There must be no place for religious bigotry or
intolerance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The minister for human resources development, Murli Manohar
Joshi, said ``a group of experts'' had put together the proposal,
which had been offered only for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose of the conference, Joshi said, was to look for
ways to improve education in a country where tens of millions of
children simply do not go to school and where half the population
is illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over teaching Hindu philosophy almost completely
diverted attention from the broader goals of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say the dispute has also exposed fissures in
the Bharatiya Janata Party and highlighted the efforts of the rival
Congress Party, which has governed India for most of the country's
51-year history, to rebuild its support among religious minorities,
especially Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Next month the Bharatiya Janata and Congress parties face each
other in elections in New Delhi and in the states of Rajasthan and
Madhya Pradesh, the first since the new government came to power in
March and Sonia Gandhi became head of the Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Bharatiya Janata Party, in power in New Delhi and Rajasthan,
has been seriously weakened by skyrocketing vegetable prices and
shortages of electricity and water. It has been unable to pursue
its agenda of Hindutva, a cultural nationalism, because of
resistance from its partners in a shaky coalition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Increasingly the core supporters of the party have criticized
the government their party leads for failing to push the
construction of a temple to Rama, an incarnation of the Hindu god
Vishnu, on the site of a demolished 16th-century mosque in Ayodhya,
among other points.
</P>
<P>
   Joshi, a member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, is generally
seen as coming from the more militant wing of the party, and
Vajpayee is its more pragmatic and moderate face. Some analysts
speculate that Joshi made an ill-conceived attempt to satisfy his
political base, leaving the party leaders little choice but to
backtrack quickly when the political price grew too high.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Several months ago, Vice President Al Gore cringed
at the sound of someone introducing him as anything other than Vice
President Al Gore. But the introductions are changing, and so is
the look on Gore's face.
</P>
<P>
   At least four times on a campaign trip that took Gore to
Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico and California this week, he was
presented to the audience, in some form, as the next president of
the United States. Each time, he smiled broadly, offering no hint
of discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   For the vice president, a strict disciplinarian on the stump who
has dodged the question of presidential aspirations, this is a
fairly radical departure. Form and formality have always prompted
him to stress that his current focus is the 1998 elections, and
presidency of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet suddenly he is giving at least tacit approval to
introductions that paint him as a potential successor to President
Clinton _ a change that may be especially helpful in places like
Iowa, where early caucuses in presidential election years shape the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally spontaneous,'' Monica Dixon, a deputy chief of
staff to Gore, said of the presidential presentations. ``We've had
nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as August, several days after Clinton appeared on
television to acknowledge his relationship with Monica Lewinsky,
the White House intern, Gore winced when a politician in Hawaii
referred to his wife, Tipper, as the next first lady. No doubt
Gore's uneasiness then derived in part from the fresh talk of
impeachment, the more direct way for Gore to become president.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Nov. 3 midterm elections the last official barrier
to 2000 presidential campaigning and with Congress proceeding
slowly on impeachment issues, Gore seems more open to images of a
Gore presidency.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner Tuesday night in Indianola, Iowa, Dodie Boswell, the
wife of Rep. Leonard Boswell, introduced Gore as ``Mr. Future
President,'' and he smiled. Gore had the same reaction the next day
in Albuquerque, N.M., where Martin Chavez, the city's former mayor
who is running for governor, responded to ``Gore 2000'' signs in
the crowd by saying, ``Gore 2000 sounds great to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Los Angeles, the chairman of the California Democratic
Party, Art Torres, faced a boisterous rally of several thousand in
a high school gymnasium on Wednesday afternoon and said: ``And now
to introduce the next president, I mean, the vice president. Oh, I
think you like the first one better.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, appearing at a small dinner that generated $60,000
from actors and studio executives for Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, who is
running for governor, Gore was introduced by the hostess, Cindy
Horn, who said, ``I will do everything I can to make sure he is
elected our next president.''
</P>
<P>
   An obviously pleased Gore nodded and said, ``Thank you for that
introduction.''

COMMENTARY: WHAT ABOUT INFERNO?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RUSSELL BAKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tattoo parlor in the next block caught fire a half-hour ago,
and I dropped everything and went to watch the spectacle. We don't
get a lot of spectacles in Burgville, my hometown.
</P>
<P>
   I was composing something fancy about the good old Republican
Party being taken over by Bible-thumpers when the sirens started
rending the air.
</P>
<P>
   I know: Nobody says ``rending the air'' anymore. It's quaint.
``Corny,'' people used to say. Nobody says ``corny'' anymore
either. This antediluvian language comes out of me because of the
tattoo-parlor fire, which makes me think of fires of long ago.
</P>
<P>
   I ought to be thinking of Bible-thumpers destroying the good old
Republican Party, but why bother? You know all that:
</P>
<P>
   Parsons Robertson and Falwell luring sappy young Republicans
down the sawdust trail. Parsons Gingrich, Starr and Hyde trying to
dis-elect a fully elected president so as to improve the country's
moral tone. You know all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must have a death wish,'' I was going to say. In a
country notorious for loving sin, they are going to throw out a
whole presidential election because the winner is a sinner?
</P>
<P>
   And so on. I can't believe I ever meant to write about that, now
that I think about it here in the wake of the tattoo-parlor blaze.
It is dull, dull, dull and, also, has been thoroughly chewed over
already by every cud-chewer in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Was it Henry James who said, ``The civilized man knows when the
cud has been amply chewed''? Probably not. It was definitely Peter
DeVries, however, who said Henry James ``chewed more than he bit
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgville will miss the tattoo parlor. It was a touch of
raffishness in a town that's being obliterated under an onslaught
of ``antique'' shops. I won't explain those quotation marks around
``antique,'' as it would hurt the feelings of good Burgvillers who
run them.
</P>
<P>
   I'll just say that when a town like Burgville loses its only
tattoo parlor it's not like New York losing a corner hot-dog stand.
It is, as they say in learned circles, a quantum loss. The bumper
sticker on the tattoo artist's car said, ``You Think It, We Ink
It.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say why that was so much more enjoyable to read
than ``My Child Is An Honor Student At Egmont Elementary School''
or ``Dole For President,'' which are standards of Burgville's
bumper-sticker literature.
</P>
<P>
   Does it seem that the tattoo-parlor fire has unnerved me?
Perhaps it has. I detest fires. As a police reporter, I once had to
go to fires and phone stories to the rewrite desk.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know how little there is to be said about a fire? A fire
in which nobody is hurt is the hardest story in town because after
you've said the fire lit the night sky fetchingly, or grotesquely,
or whatever, what is left to say?
</P>
<P>
   If somebody is hurt, it is dreadful to stand there and watch. It
is horrible, when people are burned, to see the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Later I worked the rewrite desk. Do you know how many synonyms
there are for ``fire''? After ``blaze'' and ``conflagration''
you've exhausted the dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my fire hatred stems from a childhood afternoon when my
grandmother's henhouse caught fire and spread to an abandoned
blacksmith shop adjacent to the house.
</P>
<P>
   I was age 5 or 6 or 7 and spending summer with my grandmother in
a village where the women all took an afternoon nap, the men having
left for work at dawn. As the only person awake that summer
afternoon, I watched uneasily while the fire got a good firm grip
on the henhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Why did such things have to happen to me? Did I dare wake the
women? Absolutely not. Not, at any rate, until the henhouse was
gone and the flames had a good grip on the blacksmith shop and were
groping for the house.
</P>
<P>
   Hesitantly, I woke my grandmother, urging her not to be angry
with me, but suggesting that the house might burn down.
</P>
<P>
   The humiliation ensuing from that afternoon has haunted my life.
Such a timid spirit, I knew, would always disqualify me as a
leader, a boss, a star, a great killer CEO. And it has.
</P>
<P>
   The tattoo-parlor conflagration brings that melancholy memory
back from the depths. So sad. Not as tiresome, though, as a sermon
on the Republican descent into Puritanism and _ speaking of fire _
brimstone.

<P>
   LICHTENSTEIN-BAM (New York) _ Before I start examining their
edges and undersides, let me lay my cards on the table. Harvey
Lichtenstein _ who turns 70 next spring and who recently announced
his retirement, effective June 30, after 31 years as head of the
Brooklyn Academy of Music _ has been the most innovative and
influential performing arts administrator New York has known. This
is not a game, so there's no point in ticking off the not-so-long
list of his recent competitors, icons like Joe Papp, Ellen Stewart
and Morton Baum. But Papp, for one, is better known to the general
public than Lichtenstein, even now. So it's worth trying to explain
why Lichtenstein has been so important not just to the cultural
life of New York, but to the country and the world. By John
Rockwell. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA'S-MOVIES-IMAGE (Undated) _ Nearly 160 years ago, Alexis
De Tocqueville observed that Americans lacked an appreciation for
what he called the ``pleasures of mind.'' Instead, he wrote, they
``prefer books which may be easily procured, quickly read, and
which require no learned researches to be understood. They ask for
beauties self-proffered and easily enjoyed. ... They require strong
and rapid emotions, startling passages, truths or errors brilliant
enough to rouse them up and to plunge them at once, as if by
violence, into the midst of the subject.'' &UR;  &LR; Those words remain, in
fact, a pretty good description of the impulses that drive American
popular culture, what one might call a constant quest for ever
greater sensationalism. But the characteristics Tocqueville
ascribed to our books, poetry and theater are now no longer
confined to amusements; they have leached into almost every aspect
of American life. &UR;  &LR; Any putative Tocqueville looking at America
today would see a whole Republic of Entertainment in which strong
and rapid emotions, startling passages and rousing truths pervade
journalism, politics, education, religion, art and even crime.
Indeed, ours seems to be a world molded in the image of the movies
and intended for our viewing pleasure. By Neal Gabler. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   HEAVENLY-FILMS (Undated) _ What's disturbing about the latest
heavenly help type films isn't their stories. Who doesn't enjoy a
good supernatural yarn with a misty-eyed twist? It's their
grandiose air of sanctity that cloys. They are bloated reflections
of a narcissistic age obsessed with eternal youth. If love is
decreed by magic, you don't have to work at it. All you have to do
is gaze into your partner's eyes and ``know.'' If spiritual insight
arrives from on high, you don't have to waste precious time in
prayer, meditation and study. By Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   NIKOLAIS-LOUIS-DANCE (New York) _ For Murray Louis, landmark
events are not only the most obviously important occurences. The
Murray Louis and Nikolais Dance Company will celebrate a 50th
anniversary, for instance, in a weeklong season that opens on
Tuesday at the Joyce Theater. Louis and Alwin Nikolais, who died in
1993, taught at the Henry Street Settlement House and performed in
its theater from 1948 until 1970. By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-BALLET-THEATER (Undated) _ In its early days,
publicists for American Ballet Theater frequently called it ``a
museum of the dance.'' That remains a good phrase to describe the
company, provided one realizes that great museums can encourage new
art as well as preserve old. Ever since its debut in 1940, Ballet
Theater has done both. It has staged the classics, often in
elaborate productions. It has commissioned major world premieres.
Kevin McKenzie, the troupe's current artistic director, is
continuing these policies. the current season will give New Yorkers
their first look at John Neumeier's ``Spring and Fall,'' a work to
Dvorak from the repertory of Neumeier's Hamburg Ballet, and new
creations by Twyla Tharp, Nacho Duato and John Selya, one of Ballet
Theater's own dancers. By Jack Anderson. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews Tracy Letts's
violent, satiric and often dangerously funny family comedy,
``Killer Joe,'' at the SoHo Playhouse Off Broadway in New York.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   OLD-SETTLER-THEATER (Undated) _ It is 1943 in Harlem, with Ella
Fitzgerald crooning, newly arrived Southerners gawking and
housekeepers calling to Jesus in storefront churches and
lindy-hopping until dawn at the Savoy Ballroom. The playwright John
Henry Redwood recreates those heady days in ``The Old Settler,'' a
bittersweet comedy in previews Off Broadway at Primary Stages,
where it opens on Wednesday. It is the story of Elizabeth Borny, a
lonely, middle-aged domestic who rents a room in her apartment to a
naive young Southerner and falls in love with him, despite the
disapproval of her sister, Quilly, who knows better. By Rachel L.
Swarns. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   LICHTENSTEIN-BAM-MEMOIRS (Undated) _ &UR;  &LR; Harvey Lichtenstein, who
is retiring on June 30, recalls his tenure at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music as its director. By Harvey Lichtenstein. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   OUR-YOUTH-THEATER (New York) _ According to the playwright,
Kenneth Lonergan, almost every bit of ``This Is Our Youth'' is
true. ``It's essentially the life lived by my friends and me on the
Upper West Side in the 1980s,'' Lonergan said recently. ``I
remember sitting in those rooms, stoned out of our minds, with our
parents' money behind us and kind of levitating our way through
life.'' The dark comedy was popular with young theatergoers in its
first incarnation in 1996, an audience that its producers are
hoping to attract with an eight-week run of the latest production,
now in previews at Second Stage and opening on Nov. 3. By Jesse
McKinley. (Moved). &UR;  &LR; Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   ST.-LUKE-ORCHESTRA (New York) _ The Orchestra of St. Luke's was
born as an outgrowth of the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble, whose 21
players still form its core. A chamber style of performance is
first nature. In addition to its own concerts, it works for hire in
a variety of settings. Even the name has become a red herring,
since the many locations in which the organization performs rarely
include the Church of St. Luke in the Fields, in Greenwich Village,
where it gave its first chamber concerts, in 1974. This season the
organization is trying to address the world's befuddlement and
bring its image into sharper focus through the odd expedient of
attaching itself to another name: Haydn. The chamber ensemble plays
the composer's Symphonies Nos. 6, 7 and 8 (``Morning,'' ``Noon''
and ``Night''), conductorless, Sunday afternoon at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art and on Wednesday evening at Weill Recital Hall. By
James R. Oestreich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MOZART-OPERAS (Undated) _ Good help is hard to find these days,
snobs say, as if it were news. The complaint has been circulating
the globe since the race first cooked up the division of labor.
Like parent and child or mate and mate, master and servant make up
one of the handful of stock pairs in the theater of human
destinies. In the drama of all places and periods, their dance of
dominance and deference has been a constant. Two who observed its
intricacies with the sharpest eyes were Mozart and da Ponte, the
creators of ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' (1786), which will be given a
new production on Thursday evening at the Metropolitan Opera; ``Don
Giovanni'' (1787), and ``Cosi Fan Tutte'' (1790). By Matthew
Gurewitsch. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BARTOK-STRAVINSKY-MUSIC (Undated) _ I never could share his
lifelong gusto for his native folklore,'' said Igor Stravinsky of
Bela Bartok in 1959. And what is more, ``I couldn't help regretting
it in the great musician.'' Stravinsky was seeking distance from a
composer with whom, he felt, he was too often compared. On
Wednesday and Friday evenings, the Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff,
the Hungarian conductor Ivan Fischer and the Budapest Festival
Orchestra bring their countryman and the latter's unwilling Russian
counterpart back together at Carnegie Hall, setting Bartok's three
piano concertos in what the performers evidently consider their
proper Stravinskian context. It's about time. By Richard Taruskin.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   TRIP-HOP-MUSIC (Undated) _ When Massive Attack came on the
British dance-music scene in 1991 with its debut album, ``Blue
Lines,'' the group's bass-heavy beats and brooding spirit of
introspection became the onic blueprint for trip-hop. A
studio-concocted blend of hip-hop, ambient techno and reggae that
set the tone for fellow Bristol artists like Portishead and Tricky,
trip-hop seemed ideally suited to our globally aware, culturally
fragmented times. By Guy Garcia. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   POLLOCK-ART (Undated) _ When Richard Brown Baker bought Jackson
Pollock's ``Arabesque'' for $2,500 in 1955, he demonstrated a keen
eye, for the painting is now worth around $15 million and is a star
of a Pollock retrospective, which opens next Sunday Nov. 1 at the
Museum of Modern Art in New York. Baker, now 86, is one of the most
important collectors of 20th-century paintings, prints, drawings
and sculpture in the United States. By Johanna Garfield. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GIBBONS-ART (London) _ There could hardly be a more English
artist-craftsman than Grinling Gibbons. Master Carver to the Crown,
he invented a decorative style that dominated interiors in England
during the late 17th century. His name is imbedded in the
consciousness of the nation. Windsor Castle, Hampton Court Palace,
the grand country houses like Badminton, Burghley and Petworth and,
of course, St. Paul's Cathedral all abound with his baroque
cascades of fruit, flowers and foliage. By June Ducas. (Moved).
Photo.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENTIAL-LIBRARIES-ARCH (Undated) _ Some weeks ago an
article appeared in this newspaper in which various people were
asked to comment on how presidential libraries should deal with
embarrassing episodes in an administration's record. As I recall,
no one suggested that the embarrassing episode should be the major
focus of such institutions. But maybe that's the way to go. By
Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   OPRAH-SHOW-TV (Undated) _ Apparently the actual mechanisms of
mind and body are far more complicated than we were led then to
believe. Evidence of which is to be found on this fall's newly
revamped ``Oprah'' show. Now in its 13th national season, the show
has, like its host, undergone yet another makeover. A
psychospiritual Reformation really, in which any attempt to
entertain has been abandoned in favor of a search for Truth,
Wellness and Reduced-Fat Snacks That Still Satisfy. By Jeff
MacGregor. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   PLASTICS-ANTIQUES (Katonah, N.Y.) _ Remember the so-called
throwaway plastic culture of the 60s? Well, no one threw it away,
and 30 years later, pristine artifacts from that period are already
turning up in exhibitions. The 160 objects on view in ``Pop Goes
the Plastic: The Visual and Cultural Esthetic of a New Technology
1960-1975'' at the Katonah Museum of Art document the revolution in
industrial design fostered by the coming of age of plastics. By
Paula Deitz. (Moved).

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Coach Pat Burns put his players through a
grueling 75-minute skate Thursday with the objective of getting
back to basics.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have lost two games in a row to superior teams _ the
Phoenix Coyotes and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks _ and in both, they
looked as if they had shown up for a knife fight armed only with a
wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   They're missing two-thirds of their top defensive line _ Tim
Taylor is sidelined with an ankle injury and Rob DiMaio is serving
a two-game suspension for an elbowing incident in Phoenix. Also
missing are forward Anson Carter, who signed with the Utah
Grizzlies of the IHL, and defenseman Kyle McLaren, who is about to
sign with an IHL team.
</P>
<P>
   Already thin in terms of talent, the Bruins had their weaknesses
glaringly exposed in their last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got lucky with Paul Kariya whacking the puck out of the
air,'' said Burns, referring to a Ducks power-play goal in the
second period of Wednesday's 3-0 loss when Kariya showed amazing
hand-eye coordination to bunt the puck past goalie Byron Dafoe.
``But that first goal (by Jim McKenzie late in the first period)
was criminal. It was a sin. You've got a giveaway from a
defenseman, you've got a winger who doesn't get the puck on the
boards, you've got another defenseman standing in front of the net
looking for the puck ... that's probably the only goal McKenzie's
going to score. That's criminal. It should never happen. It
shouldn't happen against us, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are now 2-3-0 on the trip, which wraps up in New
Jersey tomorrow night. The power play has been abysmal the last two
games (0 for 11), a big reason the team hasn't generated any
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being pressured and we're not reacting very good yet,''
said Ray Bourque. ``The passes we are making, we don't have that
much time and it takes one good pass to kind of settle everything
down. Sometimes we're just dishing off one problem to the other
guy. He's being checked and doesn't have much time. We've got to
spread it out and find the right guy to settle it down and get them
running around instead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said his players just haven't worked hard enough during
the man advantage to earn a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're passing it around, but when we do get a shot from the
point, there's nobody there,'' the coach said. ``We want an easy
power play. We don't want a hard power play. We have to pay the
price a little bit more. We didn't pass the puck well, that's for
sure. When we did make a pass, we didn't help anybody out. We let
everybody go by themselves. You have to come over and support a
little more and help each other out. When you've got an opportunity
to shoot the puck, you've got to shoot it. You can't turn away from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Club morale has been down the last couple of days. Early in the
last two games, the Bruins' opponents have been all over them,
overwhelming them and forcing them to play catch-up. They can't be
successful that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't a whole lot of positive things to look at,''
said Burns of the effort against the Ducks. ``We came out and
played hard in the third period, but ... there weren't a whole lot
of positive things. I'm disappointed about the game. We have to go
back to the way we win hockey games. We're looking for an easy way
to win. There's no easy way. You've got to work and work hard for
60 minutes. We're not good enough to go out and think we're going
to win because we won last year. It doesn't make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said it hasn't helped that so many people are missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbie DiMaio and Tim Taylor are a couple of big pieces to the
team and they're not here right now,'' he said. ``To go along with
Kyle and A.C., that's four guys who aren't there for us. That
certainly has something to do with it, but we could play a lot
better. We've got to go out and play harder. The effort is there,
but we're not playing very disciplined or doing the things we need
to do to win. Look at the amount of shots we had (an average of
just 20 over the last two games). We're not creating all that
much.''

<P>
   CHEFS-CAREER (Undated) _ Food preparation is one of the fastest
growing occupations in America, but making it as a chef is
incredibly tough slogging. The training is expensive, the return on
investment slow in coming, the work tedious and the competition
cutthroat. We go behind the scenes at Le Cirque 2000 to see how
ambitious cooks get ahead. By Amanda Hesser.

<P>
   CALIF-UTILITIES (Undated) _ Californians will vote next month on
whether to halt one of the nation's most aggressive moves toward
utility deregulation. The campaign pits underfunded consumer groups
against every imaginable business group, and labor as well. The
politics reflect the economic realities of utility deregulation:
Unlike the advent of long-distance telephone competition, there is
little savings for the average consumer in the deregulation of gas
and electric power. Almost all the benefits go to industry. It's
not just in California where residents are beginning to wake up to
this reality. Across the country, there are signs that utility
deregulation is being second-guessed. By Agis Salpukas.

DODGERS MANAGE TO LAND DAVEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least I can sleep better now knowing that Kevin Malone, whose
frantic high-profile search for a manager was perhaps unprecedented
in baseball history for sheer high camp, finally has found someone
to manage the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The new Dodger GM had scoured the planet looking for the right
person to revitalize the team, consulting with everyone except
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Why, he even flew down to the Dominican Republic to beg Felipe
Alou to accept his seven-figure offerings, perhaps even
island-hopping over to Cuba to see if that venerable baseball
aficionado, Fidel Castro, was available to impart his vast
knowledge to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Natch, after all his well-publicized tomfoolery, Mr. Malone was
able to only come up with the well-traveled Davey Johnson, whose
success in previous managerial jobs with the New York Mets and
Cincinnati Reds and Baltimore Orioles was exceeded only by his
inability to get along with the management of those teams.
</P>
<P>
   In his first major move with the Dodgers, Malone has at least
showed the courage to hire someone unafraid to express his feelings
to those who sign his paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt Davey Johnson is a top-flight manager with a
strong personality who figures to inject some much-needed fire into
an underachieving Dodger team that desperately needs it.
</P>
<P>
   But one of my most hallowed theories in life is that people
don't change.
</P>
<P>
   How long will it be before Davey Johnson sasses Kevin Malone, a
guy whose hysterically funny handling of the Dodger managerial
search would give one the impression that he's just the type of
fellow that Davey Johnson will wind up sassing? ...
</P>
<P>
   I've consulted the Las Vegas bookmakers, and the under/overs on
Davey Johnson's stay in Los Angeles is a mere two years. I'm taking
the unders. ...
</P>
<P>
   I have nothing against Davey Johnson, but I'd have preferred to
see Kevin Kennedy, a San Fernando Valley native who lives in
Tarzana, get the job. I'm sure Kennedy's past ties to the Dodger
organizaHSg'5,'tion went against him with Malone, who's instituted
a wide-spread internal purge and brought in his own replacements.
...
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure Bobby Bonilla is turning joyful somersaults at the
thought of being managed again by Davey Johnson, as he was in
Baltimore. To say the two men didn't get along is like saying Tommy
Lasorda's favorite sports columnist is me. ...
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, I spotted Lasorda at Qualcomm Stadium before Game
3 of the World Series, and waved to him. He looked at me, and
turned his back.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Lasorda wind up sitting in box seats down the
right-field line while Malone and Charley McCarthy oops, I mean Bob
Graziano were ensconced in better seats between the bases behind
the Padres' dugout? ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, David Wells' indeed would never make it as a clairvoyant.
He predicted before the series the Yankees would win it in five
games. ...
</P>
<P>
   Only those who live in the past and, unfortunately, there are
too many people who do would demean these New York Yankees, who
statistically wound up having the greatest season in baseball
history.
</P>
<P>
   Artistically, they rank with any team that has ever played their
sport. ...
</P>
<P>
   Is there a luckier man in baseball than Joe Torre? He had been
fired from three previous managerial jobs when George Steinbrenner
tabbed him to take over the Yankees in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Torre figured to last a season or two before being detached by
the hair-triggered Steinbrenner, but darned if he hasn't won two
world titles during his bright Yankee incumbency. ...
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bochy came under severe criticism for moves that
constantly backfired during the World Series, but the Padres didn't
blow four straight because of Bochy. Moves tend to backfire when
you're managing a team not nearly as good as the one you're facing.
...
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees remain intact, doubtful because Steinbrenner
reportedly won't meet Scott Boras' absurd $15 million a year salary
demand for soon-to-be free agent center fielder Bernie Williams,
they'll probably return to the Fall Classic next October.
</P>
<P>
   They might, anyway, but the team won't have the same chemistry
without Williams, a well-liked figure in the Yankee clubhouse. ...
</P>
<P>
   I think those pundits saying the Yankees don't have a future
Hall of Fame player are wrong. Twenty-four-year-old Derek Jeter,
who covers as much ground as any shortstop in the major leagues and
is a dangerous hitter, will one day make it if he continues to play
as exceptionally as he has in his first three seasons in the big
leagues. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Padres might have sagged, but their redoubtable right
fielder, Tony Gwynn, certainly didn't. The 1977 Poly High graduate
wound up batting .500, and also played exceptionally in the field.
...
</P>
<P>
   San Diego is a wonderful metropolitan area, but its residents
and some members of its media still retain a small-town
provincialism. ...
</P>
<P>
   I thought my old friend Charlie Steiner and Kevin Kennedy did
exceptional work during the playoffs on ESPN radio. ...
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is doing what I've long been advocating getting rid of
its tiresome, tedious yawn of a regular season. The playoffs are
the only time anyone pays serious attention to the NBA, anyway. I
just wonder how long all those millionaire NBA players will remain
tolerant of their union leadership's tough negotiating stance with
the owners when the reality sets in that they're blowing hundreds
of thousands of dollars that never will be retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the players stay firm, I have a feeling the owners
eventually will lift the lockout because they stand to lose far
more money than do any of the players. ...
</P>
<P>
   I don't sympathize with either side in this labor dispute. To
me, it's a silly pillow fight among multi-millionaires, although
the players shouldn't give in to the owners' demands to institute a
hard salary cap. ...
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach tough guy cop and bon vivant bachelor Two-Fisted Ted
Husley informs me celebrity restaurateur Phil Trani is donating
$4,000, the proceeds from his annual golf tournament, to the Police
Athletic League. ...
</P>
<P>
   What a heart of gold Magic Johnson has in wanting to play a
pivotal role in Mike Tyson's career. I wonder if he'd show such
interest if Tyson wasn't boxing's greatest gate attraction? ...
</P>
<P>
   I never realized how dramatically my life would change with
Tommy Lasorda no longer a part of it. I've not only lost a close
friend for my Benedict Arnold betrayals but also my chief culinary
adviser, a bitter piece of linguini to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if ol' Tommy would forgive me for my journalistic sins
of printing those unflattering anti-Lasorda quotes from Bill
Russell if I wrote a fable that told of the great affection Russell
has for his former manager. ...

 By R.W. APPLE JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEQUON, Wis. _ Sen. Mitch McConnell cannot vote in Wisconsin. A
Republican, he represents Kentucky on Capitol Hill. But he may have
more to say than anyone else about whether his colleague, Sen.
Russell Feingold, D-Wis., retains his seat next month.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Feingold is the co-author
of a bill that would reform campaign finance, in part by
eliminating ``soft money'' _ funds spent by local or national
organizations on behalf of but supposedly independent of political
candidates. McConnell is the bill's archenemy, and he also happens
to be the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee,
which has plenty of soft money to spend.
</P>
<P>
   The result: At least a million Senatorial Committee dollars, by
local estimates, and maybe twice that many, have cascaded into
Wisconsin in recent months to buy television commercials promoting
Feingold's Republican rival, Rep. Mark Neumann. If Feingold wins,
campaign finance reform will get a lift; if he loses, the reform
cause will suffer a major setback.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome here in Wisconsin could also play a significant part
in determining whether the Republicans gain the five seats that
they need to give them 60, enough to stop a Democratic filibuster
on a party-line vote. Six or seven seats now held by Democrats are
in jeopardy, including that of Feingold, a soft-spoken, slightly
fey former Rhodes Scholar with a broad maverick streak.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wittenwyler, Feingold's campaign manager, speaks of a
``vendetta'' by McConnell against Feingold. A Republican lobbyist
in Washington said confidently that ``Mitch will spend what it
takes in Wisconsin.'' And a Republican senator said McConnell had
told him recently: ``Don't worry about campaign reform. Feingold's
going to be dead meat by Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen. But this much is clear: Before the
Republican television blitz began on Aug. 11 with a series of
commercials that Feingold allowed to go unanswered for a month, the
senator held a lead of 10 to 15 percentage points in most polls.
Afterwards, the race became a dead heat, and so it remains at the
moment, with less than two weeks left until Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold is running television commercials now, some of them
every bit as hard-hitting as his opponent's, including one accusing
Neumann of indifference to the plight of people unable to procure
needed health care through their HMOs. Both candidates have agreed
to limit direct or ``hard-money'' spending to $1 for each
registered voter, about 3.8 million, to accept no more than 10
percent of their campaign funds from political action committees
and to raise no more than 25 percent of the total from outside
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold has also appealed to potential soft-money groups to
stay out of the race. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
agreed, after warning him that he was jeopardizing his seat. Other
groups have come in on his behalf, including the League of
Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club and the AFL-CIO, but their
contributions are much smaller than the Republicans'.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the flood of soft money at a fund-raiser on
Wednesday night in an auto museum in this Milwaukee suburb, Neumann
bridled, calling Feingold ``an absolute hypocrite'' and charging
that he had benefited from ``hundreds of thousands of dollars of
soft money'' while pretending not to. In his own House race two
years ago, Neumann added, unions had poured in $1.2 million in an
effort to defeat him, and ``no reporters came out here and
questioned that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports at the time showed the labor federation spending only
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Feingold, boyish and sometimes puppy-like at 45,
sounds fatalistic if determined to fight for his seat and his bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``McConnell wants to kill McCain-Feingold,'' Feingold said in an
interview in his campaign van on Tuesday, on the way from Kenosha
to Milwaukee. ``He tells his buddies that if they can kill it, they
can control the Senate for 20 years. This is one of the most brutal
assaults of soft money ever, not only on television but huge
mailings and phone banks, all paid for by undisclosed contributions
from the big banks, oil companies and tobacco companies.''
</P>
<P>
   If that kind of talk sounds a little like ``Fighting Bob''
LaFollette and his heirs in Wisconsin's radical politics
campaigning against the big lumber companies and the rapacious
railroads generations ago, it is no accident. Feingold's father was
a Progressive organizer, and the senator himself said fervently,
``A hundred years after the founding of the Progressive Party, if I
was not going to draw the line in the sand this year, who was going
to do it, and when?''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Feingold is gambling his political career on the
premise that he can stick up for the principles embodied in his
reform bill, specifically its ban on soft money, and still win a
second term. From his point of view, he said, ``No career,
including mine, is as important as breaking the hold of this system
of legalized bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how close he was to saying, ``I'd rather be right than
re-elected,'' Feingold answered: ``Oh, I'm there already. Somebody
told me Sam Houston once said he intended to tell the truth and
suffer the consequences, and that sounds fine to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator said he had saved $800,000 for a final television
assault, and indeed he appears to have as many commercials on the
air as Neumann at the moment, at least in populous southeastern
Wisconsin. The independent advertisements for the Republican
nominee appear to have gone off the air for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is my issue now,'' Feingold said. ``We're on my
playing field. Is Wisconsin going to become another state where
money rules?''
</P>
<P>
   He is convinced that Wisconsin cares about campaign reform.
Neumann, a 44-year-old former teacher and real-estate developer, is
convinced that voters here care a lot more about partial birth
abortion, which he opposes and Feingold supports in some
circumstances; about the proposed flag-burning amendment, about
cutting taxes and especially about shoring up the Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's embroilment with Monica Lewinsky seems to
have vanished from the Wisconsin landscape. Voters seldom bring up
the subject, and Neumann, who has called on the president to
resign, said he was ``amazed by the silence, total silence.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Neumann's main commercials criticizes both Clinton and
Speaker Newt Gingrich on Social Security. Neumann says he favors
what Clinton ``only pretends to favor _ saving the budget surplus
to fix Social Security.'' As for Gingrich, the two have clashed
often, with the speaker describing Neumann as ``a pain in the
neck'' who did not know how to compromise, and Neumann refusing to
vote for Gingrich for speaker after the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann relies on an unusual tool, an overhead slide projector
in his campaign meetings, like the one he used this week at the
Waukesha County Technical College in Pewaukee, west of Milwaukee.
He calls them town hall forums, but they actually resemble sales
pitches, with multicolored charts and bar graphs designed to
demonstrate, above all, Republican thrift and Democratic
profligacy.
</P>
<P>
   Coatless, with his shirt sleeves rolled up, he said he hoped
that a generation from now Congress could ``give our children a
debt-free America,'' a Social Security trust fund from which no
loans have been made to the government's general fund, and lower
income taxes. In Washington, he has campaigned with unusual zeal
against spending, including pork-barrel projects for his district.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEQUON, Wis. _ Sen. Mitch McConnell cannot vote in Wisconsin. A
Republican, he represents Kentucky on Capitol Hill. But he may have
more to say than anyone else about whether his colleague, Sen.
Russell Feingold, D-Wis., retains his seat next month.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Feingold is the co-author
of a bill that would reform campaign finance, in part by
eliminating ``soft money'' _ funds spent by local or national
organizations on behalf of but supposedly independent of political
candidates. McConnell is the bill's archenemy, and he also happens
to be the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee,
which has plenty of soft money to spend.
</P>
<P>
   The result: at least a million Senatorial Committee dollars, by
local estimates, and maybe twice that many, have cascaded into
Wisconsin in recent months to buy television commercials promoting
Feingold's Republican rival, Rep. Mark Neumann. If Feingold wins,
campaign finance reform will get a lift; if he loses, the reform
cause will suffer a major setback.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome here in Wisconsin could also play a significant part
in determining whether the Republicans gain the five seats that
they need to give them 60, enough to stop a Democratic filibuster
on a party-line vote. Six or seven seats now held by Democrats are
in jeopardy, including that of Feingold, a soft-spoken, slightly
fey former Rhodes Scholar with a broad maverick streak.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wittenwyler, Feingold's campaign manager, speaks of a
``vendetta'' by McConnell against Feingold. A Republican lobbyist
in Washington said confidently that ``Mitch will spend what it
takes in Wisconsin.'' And a Republican senator said McConnell had
told him recently: ``Don't worry about campaign reform. Feingold's
going to be dead meat by Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen. But this much is clear: Before the
Republican television blitz began on Aug. 11 with a series of
commercials that Feingold allowed to go unanswered for a month, the
senator held a lead of 10 to 15 percentage points in most polls.
Afterwards, the race became a dead heat, and so it remains at the
moment, with less than two weeks left until Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold is running television commercials now, some of them
every bit as hard-hitting as his opponent's, including one accusing
Neumann of indifference to the plight of people unable to procure
needed health care through their HMOs. Both candidates have agreed
to limit direct or ``hard-money'' spending to $1 for each
registered voter, about 3.8 million, to accept no more than 10
percent of their campaign funds from political action committees
and to raise no more than 25 percent of the total from outside
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold has also appealed to potential soft-money groups to
stay out of the race. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
agreed, after warning him that he was jeopardizing his seat. Other
groups have come in on his behalf, including the League of
Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club and the AFL-CIO, but their
contributions are much smaller than the Republicans'.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the flood of soft money at a fund-raiser on
Wednesday night in an auto museum in this Milwaukee suburb, Neumann
bridled, calling Feingold ``an absolute hypocrite'' and charging
that he had benefited from ``hundreds of thousands of dollars of
soft money'' while pretending not to. In his own House race two
years ago, Neumann added, unions had poured in $1.2 million in an
effort to defeat him, and ``no reporters came out here and
questioned that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports at the time showed the labor federation spending only
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Feingold, boyish and sometimes puppy-like at 45,
sounds fatalistic if determined to fight for his seat and his bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``McConnell wants to kill McCain-Feingold,'' Feingold said in an
interview in his campaign van on Tuesday, on the way from Kenosha
to Milwaukee. ``He tells his buddies that if they can kill it, they
can control the Senate for 20 years. This is one of the most brutal
assaults of soft money ever, not only on television but huge
mailings and phone banks, all paid for by undisclosed contributions
from the big banks, oil companies and tobacco companies.''
</P>
<P>
   If that kind of talk sounds a little like ``Fighting Bob''
LaFollette and his heirs in Wisconsin's radical politics
campaigning against the big lumber companies and the rapacious
railroads generations ago, it is no accident. Feingold's father was
a Progressive organizer, and the senator himself said fervently,
``A hundred years after the founding of the Progressive Party, if I
was not going to draw the line in the sand this year, who was going
to do it, and when?''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Feingold is gambling his political career on the
premise that he can stick up for the principles embodied in his
reform bill, specifically its ban on soft money, and still win a
second term. From his point of view, he said, ``No career,
including mine, is as important as breaking the hold of this system
of legalized bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how close he was to saying, ``I'd rather be right than
re-elected,'' Feingold answered: ``Oh, I'm there already. Somebody
told me Sam Houston once said he intended to tell the truth and
suffer the consequences, and that sounds fine to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator said he had saved $800,000 for a final television
assault, and indeed he appears to have as many commercials on the
air as Neumann at the moment, at least in populous southeastern
Wisconsin. The independent advertisements for the Republican
nominee appear to have gone off the air for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is my issue now,'' Feingold said. ``We're on my
playing field. Is Wisconsin going to become another state where
money rules?''
</P>
<P>
   He is convinced that Wisconsin cares about campaign reform.
Neumann, a 44-year-old former teacher and real-estate developer, is
convinced that voters here care a lot more about partial birth
abortion, which he opposes and Feingold supports in some
circumstances; about the proposed flag-burning amendment, about
cutting taxes and especially about shoring up the Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's embroilment with Monica Lewinsky seems to
have vanished from the Wisconsin landscape. Voters seldom bring up
the subject, and Neumann, who has called on the president to
resign, said he was ``amazed by the silence, total silence.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Neumann's main commercials criticizes both Clinton and
Speaker Newt Gingrich on Social Security. Neumann says he favors
what Clinton ``only pretends to favor _ saving the budget surplus
to fix Social Security.'' As for Gingrich, the two have clashed
often, with the speaker describing Neumann as ``a pain in the
neck'' who did not know how to compromise, and Neumann refusing to
vote for Gingrich for speaker after the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann relies on an unusual tool, an overhead slide projector
in his campaign meetings, like the one he used this week at the
Waukesha County Technical College in Pewaukee, west of Milwaukee.
He calls them town hall forums, but they actually resemble sales
pitches, with multi-colored charts and bar graphs designed to
demonstrate, above all, Republican thrift and Democratic
profligacy.
</P>
<P>
   Coatless, with his shirt sleeves rolled up, he said he hoped
that a generation from now Congress could ``give our children a
debt-free America,'' a Social Security trust fund from which no
loans have been made to the government's general fund, and lower
income taxes. In Washington, he has campaigned with unusual zeal
against spending, including pork-barrel projects for his district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign,'' he said, ``is about taxes and Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes Neumann hits hard on abortion and flag-burning,
and ridicules Feingold for ``sending your dollars to Russia to
study monkeys in space'' and supporting a government study of
bovine flatulence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the bitterness that has stained the campaign since
the race narrowed, Feingold said that this state's other political
tradition besides progressivism, the legacy of Sen. Joseph
McCarthy, ``has reared its head in the most intensive form in
decades in this right-wing Neumann juggernaut.''

TEXAS REJECTS PLAN TO BUILD NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP IN SIERRA BLANCA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ To the glee of environmentalists from West Texas and
Mexico, state officials on Thursday delivered a fatal blow to the
17-year-old plan to build a radioactive waste dump amid the
tumbleweeds and sagebrush near Sierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a lack of information about whether the Hudspeth County
site could withstand an earthquake, along with unanswered questions
about the project's socioeconomic impact, the Texas Natural
Resource Conservation Commission unanimously rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite legal avenues to keep the Sierra Blanca option alive,
Gov. George W. Bush immediately pronounced it dead. And while
advocates have never called it a ``dump,'' Bush issued a terse
statement referring to it as just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state's environmental officials have determined the site
is not safe. Therefore, the dump will not be built at Sierra
Blanca, period,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   With a portrait of Bush looking over their shoulders, the
three-member commission, all Bush appointees, turned down a license
application from a state agency with a legislative mandate to find
a place to store low-level radioactive waste. The material would
come from nuclear power plants in Texas, Maine and Vermont, as well
as contaminated items from Texas businesses, universities and
research facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The quest began in 1981, long before the term ``environmental
racism'' was part of the legislative jargon. The Sierra Blanca
debate has included allegations that the site was picked because
its largely Hispanic population was relatively powerless to stop
it. The proposed site, less than 20 miles from the Rio Grande, also
has caused an outpouring of diplomatic and informal protests from
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Despite predictions that the commission vote will force the
state Legislature to study other sites in 1999, the agency seeking
the license, the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal
Authority, said it will try to keep the Sierra Blanca option
viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said authority director Rick Jacobi, who
said he would seek a rehearing. But the unanimous vote and Bush's
reaction were being construed as the kiss of death for the
long-embattled proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of utilities, businesses, research institutions and
other generators of radioactive waste, including Houston Lighting &AMP;
Power and Texas Utilities, said it isn't abandoning efforts to help
the state find an economic disposal site in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still too early to assess the full ramifications of the
decision, but we will continue to support the authority in its
efforts to receive a license at an appropriate site,'' said Edward
Selig, who heads up the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Texas' low-level waste will remain at more than 600
temporary storage locations, including several in Harris County,
Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Addington of Sierra Blanca, a leader of the opposition, was
pleased by the decision but reluctant to declare the battle won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still politics. If it had been politically feasible for
the commissioners to approve this site, they would have done it,''
he said. A year ago, he was calling approval ``a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other opponents grew more pessimistic in the summer when
Congress approved a pact allowing Maine and Vermont to ship
contaminated materials from decommissioned nuclear power plants to
Texas, if a site were were approved.
</P>
<P>
   With the interstate pact still valid, Addington predicted his
worry will soon be someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of what to do with this waste could be forced on
somebody else, putting their natural resources at risk. The
struggle must go on, and until I die, I will do what I can to stop
this insane, kitty litter-box technique of dealing with radioactive
waste,'' Addington said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican congressman Carlos Camacho of Chihuahua, the state lying
across the Rio Grande from Hudspeth County, rejoiced at the
``unbelievable'' outcome, and theorized that a series of Mexican
diplomatic protests, hunger strikes, international bridge
blockades, picketing and demonstrations must have had an impact on
the decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they never manage to say it, it was in their minds,''
Camacho said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy said it would be too expensive to look for another
place, but it would be more expensive to look at the same place,''
Camacho said.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, TNRCC Chairman Barry McBee of Austin and
Commissioners R.B. ``Ralph'' Marquez of Texas City and John M.
Baker Jr. of Temple adopted the negative finding of a panel of two
administrative law judges. The judges spent months analyzing
scientific, socioeconomic and other analyses of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   McBee, calling it a ``heart-wrenching decision,'' said the vote
was made harder by the fact that Hudspeth County is clamoring for
economic development. Besides ranching, rock-crushing and a new
sludge disposal site, jobs are scarce in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a part of Texas that is in great need, and this
facility could have helped that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners stated they were ``disappointed'' that the
authority didn't do a better job conducting geological and
socio-economic studies for the site.
</P>
<P>
   Plans called for digging trenches in the desert, lining them
with concrete, storing wastes in concrete canisters and burying
them as they were filled. The main unanswered scientific question,
the commissioners said, was whether a fault lying under the site _
which hasn't changed for 780,000 years _ and a second fault 20
miles away were capable of causing problems. &QL;

GETTING THERE FIRST: REFLECTIONS OF A COLLECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Oct. 25) 
(af) 
Johanna Garfield, a journalist, is Richard Brown Baker's literary
executor. 
 By JOHANNA GARFIELD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Richard Brown Baker bought Jackson Pollock's
``Arabesque'' for $2,500 in 1955, he demonstrated a keen eye, for
the painting is now worth around $15 million and is a star of a
Pollock retrospective, which opens next Sunday, Nov. 1, at the
Museum of Modern Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, now 86, is one of the most important collectors of
20th-century paintings, prints, drawings and sculpture in the
United States. In 1995 he donated a large part of his collection to
Yale University, of which he's a Phi Beta Kappa alumnus.
``Arabesque'' was a part of that $24.5 million bequest.
</P>
<P>
   Before the passion for collecting took over his life, Baker, a
Rhode Island native, was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University in
England, an equerry at the U.S. Embassy in Madrid, a journalist, a

   With little capital, Baker began to collect in the 1940s. He
moved to New York in 1954, and during the decades that followed,
his ability to spot the works of as yet unknown and still
affordable artists _ Lichtenstein, Kline and Johns among them _
earned him fame as a ``collector's collector.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker started keeping journals as a teen-ager and continued to
write in them almost daily until recently. He recorded the story of
how he came to buy ``Arabesque,'' and of a crisis that nearly
aborted that purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he described a meeting with Pollock and his wife, his
response to the artist's death and entries about the painting and
its escalating value. Following are excerpts from these largely
unpublished journals.  &QL;

<P>
   New York, Dec. 3, 1955
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, I went to see the Jackson Pollock retrospective
at Sidney Janis' Gallery, where I ran into David Herbert (a staff
member at Janis' gallery). On taking leave of him after looking at
the show, I remarked casually, ``I think I'd rather acquire a major
de Kooning than a Pollock.''
</P>
<P>
   David Herbert must have taken that as a challenge, for he no
sooner heard me express a preference for de Kooning than he said
impulsively, ``There's a picture in the racks that you must see,
and I even know the price of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He almost pulled me into the inner room, where he produced a
painting by Pollock entitled ``Arabesque.'' Herbert told me that
Lee Krasner Pollock told him it was painted in 1948 and hung over
the sofa in their home in Springs, L.I., until just before the
show, when it was brought to the city for possible inclusion in the
retrospective. Obviously, it was not hung in the show, a fact I'm
very glad about now.
</P>
<P>
   The moment I saw it I was surprised and enchanted. Surprised,
because until I saw ``Arabesque'' I had not felt any urge to get a
Pollock. Indeed I remember looking earlier at a modest-size Pollock
drip oil in the Art Lending Service of the Museum of Modern Art,
where it could be purchased for $500 or $600, and mentally
rejecting it as below the quality I aspired to in my collection.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here was a Pollock that I really did like. ``Arabesque'' is
a remarkable painting of great distinction, which almost
automatically won my enthusiasm. I am quick to make up my mind
about pictures and rarely reverse my judgment.
</P>
<P>
   It's a large picture, the largest I've ever bought (3 feet by
11{ feet), and Pollock's name is at the forefront of the new
movement. He's one of the few abstractionists about whom I'd heard
even before I reached New York. It seemed to me an unquestioned
opportunity and I took it.
</P>
<P>
   Departing the gallery, excited by this major purchase (from a
wonderful new acquisition I always get a feeling of exhilaration),
I went to dinner at the home of an art teacher friend who is also a
collector of early American landscape paintings. I sat during
cocktails next to a stranger who was described as a museum
specialist in restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Since I was introduced as a collector of abstractions, he
volunteered that he had seen the Pollock retrospective and was
convinced that none of the pictures would survive beyond a few
years. He claimed Pollock's canvases were neither stretched, sized
nor primed. I knew so little about the techniques of painting that
``stretched,'' ``sized'' and ``primed'' were meaningless words, but
I was upset.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, accompanied by advisers and translators of art
terminology, I paid a solemn call upon Sidney Janis. We demanded an
inspection of ``Arabesque'' by a restorer, who should report upon
its durability. When my friends pointed out that ``Arabesque'' was
indeed unstretched (Pollock probably laid the canvas on the ground
to drip paint on it and had never bothered to fix it to wooden
supports), we obtained Janis' agreement to have it stretched under
the supervision of the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Janis said he had never faced a situation quite like this. He
offered to refund my money. I found myself too enamored of
``Arabesque'' to give it up. Seeing that I was genuinely attached
to the painting and not just trying to get out of a deal I
regretted, Janis said soothingly: ``After all, Pollock is still a
young man. If this painting does disintegrate as rapidly as your
restorer friend claims, we can always get Pollock to replace it
with another.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York, Jan. 5, 1956
</P>
<P>
   Janis' restorer has rendered a written report that ``Arabesque''
will ``outlast my lifetime''; it's been stretched and re-signed by
Pollock, and I've added it to my collection.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   New York, April 9, 1956
</P>
<P>
   The de Kooning show at Sidney Janis opened a week ago. David
Herbert telephoned last Monday leaving a message with my cleaning
woman that I should come that day. I knew what he had in mind _
that I should get there early and take my choice. He was, I think,
accustomed to thinking of me as a purchaser, since I'd bought the
Pollock from him last December, a small oil by Matta last January
and a Bodhidharma in San Francisco when I ran into him at Gump's.
</P>
<P>
   I rather congratulated myself on escaping the temptation to buy,
as my return to New York from Providence was too late for me to
reach the gallery that day. The prices for a de Kooning may be low
compared to what they will become, but already they are virtually
out of my range, being about $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, arriving today a week late, I found the gallery rooms
crowded. Both Janis himself and David Herbert devoted some time to
talking with me.
</P>
<P>
   David suddenly presented me to a heavy-set man with a short
beard (beards are apparently the fashion with avant-garde painters
today, though certainly not with anyone else). The man, accompanied
by his wife, was looking intently at de Kooning's paintings. He had
a rather mountainous, closed look, as if he were grim and
inaccessible; his wife I thought ill-favored. This couple were Mr.
and Mrs. Jackson Pollock.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pollock acknowledged the introduction; her husband uttered
not a word. David explained that I am the possessor of a Pollock
painting. He described it. This aroused Mrs. Pollock's interest.
Still the painter did not speak. I imagine his mind was on the de
Kooning paintings, and he had no desire whatsoever to interrupt his
reflections by being gracious to a stranger. Mrs. Pollock
reaffirmed what David Herbert had told me: that they used to have
my painting hanging over the sofa in their living room.
</P>
<P>
   To ingratiate myself with the artist, I told them that Alan
Davie (another artist of the time) saw ``Arabesque'' in my
apartment, admired it and spoke of it as having ``elegance in the
best sense.'' This compliment stirred Pollock beyond a
monosyllable. He said they had met the Davies, but unfortunately at
that time they had not yet seen Davie's own work.
</P>
<P>
   David Herbert asked Pollock if after he did see it, he liked it.
Pollock said yes. The Pollocks then drifted off to another room.
Later, as they departed, Mrs. Pollock politely paused to say
goodbye to me. Pollock was kind enough to follow her lead and also
say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York, April 10, 1956
</P>
<P>
   On my way uptown I stopped at the dealer Catherine Viviano's to
look again at my recently purchased Alan Davie. I mentioned that
Jackson Pollock told me he liked Alan Davie's work and regretted
that he hadn't seen it at the time he met the Davies.
</P>
<P>
   He had seen it, contradicted Miss Viviano. Earlier in the
winter, Pollock came into her gallery ``tight'' (I have previously
heard that he drinks heavily) and denounced in obscene four-letter
words the paintings in her group show. She has so few opportunities
to hear explosive language of this nature that she was fascinated.
As Pollock was in this expressive mood, she was curious to learn
his reaction to Davie. Pollock resisted, but she brought out
several Davie paintings to show him, whereupon he fell silent,
looked at them studiously and expressed admiration.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York, Aug. 13, 1956
</P>
<P>
   I was shocked to read in this morning's paper that Jackson
Pollock was killed in the crash of his automobile on Saturday
evening near East Hampton, L.I. He was 44.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock made a strange impression upon me last winter when David
Herbert introduced us. I felt almost as if he were dead inside,
voiceless and inanimate, a silent, huge hulk of a man. From reports
of his addiction to alcohol, I sadly conclude that, in the old
pagan sense, he was the victim of nemesis. Fate destroyed him. It
is absurd to say it, but I have almost the feeling that he rushed
to meet death.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently he was driving at excessive speed. Perhaps he had been
drinking. With him were two 26-year-old women, artists' models, one
of whom was killed. The survivor says she had been urging Pollock
to drive slower shortly before the crash. It is a tragic loss,
unless the creative flame had already been extinguished within him,
as may perhaps have been the case.
</P>
<P>
   I recalled how Sidney Janis had reassured me, when I was
concerned that ``Arabesque'' wouldn't last, ``If this painting does
disintegrate, we can always get Pollock to replace it with
another.'' Alas, as it turns out, seldom was reassurance less
justified.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York, Aug. 18, 1956
</P>
<P>
   Sam Kootz (a dealer and friend of Baker's) rang and invited me
to dinner. I was delighted to accept. Sam and Jane Kootz spent the
summer at Juan-les-Pins in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   We naturally spoke of the death of Jackson Pollock. Jane said,
``It was a terrible shock to us all.'' Ibram Lassaw had described
to them on the phone the funeral service, which he considered to
have been badly mishandled. It seems that no reference to the
artist by name or career occurred during the service.
</P>
<P>
   I did not know it, but Jane told me that Mr. and Mrs. Pollock
had separated several months before his death. Of the two young
women with him in the accident, the survivor was his new
girlfriend; the girl who died was a friend of hers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the accident Mrs. Pollock was in Europe. She has
flown home. Jane intimated that their marriage had been a rocky one
but that Mrs. Pollock was ferociously loyal to her husband's work
as a painter. Sam said that in the last year or two Pollock's
artistic creativeness faltered. I said I understood he'd been
drinking. Sam said the excess drinking has gone on for years; that
wasn't new. I think Sam feels that Pollock's creative contribution
was over, and that the artist himself sensed this.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   July 1, 1960
</P>
<P>
   Four-and-a-half years have passed since I purchased
``Arabesque,'' and it may be bad taste to speak of prices, but the
Pollock purchase was apparently my outstanding coup as a collector.
I think this is so because I just read this quote from an Art
Market letter of the Richard Feigen Gallery, Chicago. ``Pollocks,
incidentally, now command up to $100,000 on the market. A Chicago
collector turned down that amount over a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollock's death is partly, but not entirely responsible for the
phenomenal increase in the demand for his work. I was actually more
lucky than foresighted. But I'm very glad I stuck by my theory for
collecting contemporary art, which is: get there first, with
adequate credit, and decide promptly. If the work is as good as you
think it is, other people, when they see it, may think the same.
You don't need cash. All you need is credit and confidence in your
own eye.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 3, 1962
</P>
<P>
   Most of the public surface transportation in New York being
stopped by a bus strike, I walked across Central Park to call on
Leo Castelli, who sells Pollocks often, to ask him his evaluation
of my ``Arabesque.'' He puts it higher than Janis, but says that
David Gibbs, by claiming $120,000, is ``over-optimistic.''
According to Leo, the big money people who want Pollocks are at
present Californians. ``What about Texans?'' I asked. ``Not yet.
They'll come later.''

 &HT;    Explaining Chipper case can help kids
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Parents can use the news about Atlanta Braves third
baseman Chipper Jones to emphasize responsibility to their children
and make it ``a learning experience,'' experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents will find themselves dealing with the issue in some
way, after Jones, perhaps the most popular Atlanta sports figure
among kids, disclosed this week that he had fathered an
illegitimate child.
</P>
<P>
   The news of his affair followed a recent revelation by Evander
Holyfield that the boxer had fathered two illegitimate kids soon
after marrying his second wife.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Dr. Laura'' Schlessinger, the radio talk-show host and
newspaper columnist, characterized both men as ``bums'' and
advocated that parents encourage children to rip down posters of
Jones or Holyfield ``instantaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's some more advice for parents :
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents should help children put the news in perspective, said
Dr. Tom Cummins, assistant professor of child and adolescent
psychiatry at Emory Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would try to make it a learning opportunity,'' he said. ``If
people do things that are wrong, it does not necessarily mean they
are bad people. They've made a mistake. The important thing is, you
realized it was wrong and you tried to do better in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Cummins said it's important to stress to children that there are
a lot of people who can be admired in everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the potential drawbacks of hero worship of public
figures is you don't really know who they are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents can underscore to children the importance of being
responsible, says Peter Elkon, a licensed professional counselor
with Families First, a nonprofit agency in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teach them (that) if they receive something, if they have a
lot of success, they have to handle the gifts that come with it
responsibly,'' he said. ``It takes a lot of power and
responsibility, if you get rich and famous, to resist temptation.''
</P>
<P>
   Elkon warns parents not to get too ``preachy,'' however.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to go in and get out quickly,'' he said. ``If you try
to branch out in too many directions at once, the kid's going to
turn off.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Schlessinger, however, says that being a hero has nothing to
do with hitting home runs or throwing hard punches in the ring _
and that Jones and Holyfield need not apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes both these men ... bums is that little children
were brought into the world without a family. They are not
heroes,'' she said in a telephone interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heroes are men and women of character who have sacrificed for
a greater ideal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paulette Holyfield, Evander's first wife, has had to deal with
the subject of infidelity and illegitimate children on several
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my Christian background, I let them know nobody's
perfect,'' she said. ``And that he's not less of a man, nor is he
more of a man, because he has a lot of kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also let them know it's always best for them to keep their
virginity until they're married. Sex is such an important
responsibility.

NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL CHALLENGES DIESEL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (dl) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York State Attorney General Dennis Vacco took
preliminary steps Thursday to challenge a huge national settlement
between federal authorities and diesel truck engine manufacturers,
saying it would do too little to prevent smog and acid rain in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   He acted shortly after the Justice Department and the
Environmental Protection Agency announced a billion-dollar
settlement with the seven leading manufacturers of heavy duty
diesel engines for evading pollution control standards. The federal
authorities called it the most significant environmental
enforcement action ever taken, whether measured by the $83.4
million in civil penalties or by the 75 million tons of air
pollution that they said would be avoided during the next 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Vacco signaled that New York state, which is not bound by
the settlement, might seek tougher remedies. He issued subpoenas to
the engine manufacturers late Thursday, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement appears to have serious deficiencies,'' Vacco
said in a statement. ``I am stepping up my own investigation to
ensure that New York state's interests are protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Fumes from diesel trucks are important contributors to smog,
which plagues New York City, and acid rain, which damages lakes and
forests in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   The federal authorities had charged that the engine makers
designed their engines with computerized controls that enabled the
engines to meet air pollution standards during certification tests
in the laboratories even though they violated the standards in
normal operations, such as when cruising on highways. As they
settled the cases, the companies asserted Thursday that the
allegations were untrue and that their engines meet applicable
standards, a claim that the EPA said was proven false by its
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us believe that we violated the law, and we were
prepared to litigate that,'' said John Farmer, general counsel of
Detroit Diesel Corp., who called the settlement a fair compromise
and urged third parties like New York State to accept it. ``They
have a big burden to overcome what I think is a rational result,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, the companies agreed to pay tens of
millions of dollars each in fines, to spend an additional $109.5
million on clean-air research and demonstration projects, to
accelerate the introduction of cleaner engines by two years, to
redesign new engines immediately and to pay for changes to about 1
million engines already on the road when they are returned for
routine rebuilding after several years of use. Altogether, the
companies are expected to spend $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency said it would not demand that the engines be
immediately recalled, which is the remedy specified in such cases
by the Clean Air Act. Instead, the dirtier engines will be cleaned
up at the manufacturers' expense when they are rebuilt, typically
after several years or a few hundred thousand miles of operation.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups that are already suing engine makers
separately under California state law said they would challenge the
federal settlement and demand a recall, and now it appears that
Vacco has taken their side. California, which alone among the
states has independent legal authority to regulate the truck
emissions, joined the federal settlement on Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vacco's spokesman, Mark Carey, said that the lack of a recall
meant that some trucks would remain on the road for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But Carol Browner, the EPA administrator, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, we are doing something that's much, much better than
a recall,'' she said. ``We chose a rebuild because we wanted to get
the best possible environmental result quickly, and that's what it
gave us.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kassel, senior attorney with the Natural Resources
Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group based in New York,
said that New York did not come out as well as California in the
settlement. California, as a party, was promised a big share of the
penalties and of the environmental projects that the companies will
undertake.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key pieces of this settlement had to be
supplemental programs that are really targeted to the cities that
are suffering the most,'' he said. ``Cities like New York are
crying out for relief from the millions of pounds of diesel exhaust
that millions of New Yorkers breathe every day.''

SEARCHERS RAISE CAR FROM CREEK, RECOVER FOUR BODIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRBY, Texas _ Firefighter Stan Irwin saw the headlights of the
car dim in the high water and then disappear.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sunday morning, about 1 a.m., and the car slipped
downstream into Salado Creek. ``Help'' was all he heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It floated for about two minutes,'' said Irwin. ``I tried to
swim out to them, but I couldn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, six days after the torrential rains socked San
Antonio with up to 20 inches of rain, the car was pulled from the
still-swollen creek. It was a white Lincoln Town Car, and in it
were four people, including a young mother and her infant baby, who
had been the focus of an intense San Antonio-area search.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating not to be able to do something for those
folks,'' said Irwin. ``We tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Dead are Donna O'Bar, 65, a mother of four, her son, Richard
Hartman, 47, Jennifer Allensworth, 20, the fiance of Hartman's
nephew, and their 2-month-old daughter, Mallory.
</P>
<P>
   They are among 27 people to perish in the severe weather that
struck Texas over the weekend. Seven others were swept away in
low-water crossings in the San Antonio area. But none of those
incidents involved as great a loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst feeling was when they found it,'' said Mark Hartman,
O'Bar's youngest son and brother to Richard. ``That's when it hit.
That's when you realize your worst fears have come true.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Bar and her family were returning to this suburb east of San
Antonio from a family wedding Saturday night about 35 miles south
of the city. At a gas station on the city's outer loop they were
told the inner loop was closed. So they sought another route home.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is quite sure how they ended up on Rigsby Avenue where
they encountered high water. Nor is it clear whether the low-water
crossing was barricaded. Irwin only saw flares posted by local
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell what led them there,'' said Carl Wedige, a
district chief for the San Antonio Fire Department, who did not
know if the road had been closed. ``People think they can cross.
Then they stall.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday friends, neighbors and family milled about O'Bar's
low-slung house on Ackerman Road. Their search, which involved
dozens of authorities and volunteers, was agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   Though they reported the four family members missing Sunday
afternoon, they had no firm leads until Wednesday when Irwin told
them during the ongoing search that he had seen a white car
disappear in high water.
</P>
<P>
   A firefighter with the nearby Leon Springs department, Irwin
said he reported the car to the San Antonio Fire Department, but
the Hartmans never learned of the possible connection. They sought
help from a missing persons group called the Heidi Search Center.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities suspected the car had been swept far down the creek.
But Wednesday they refocused their search closer to where the car
went off the road and, using inflatable boats, poles and a metal
detector, located the car Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   So devastated was Justin Hartman, Richard's son and
Allensworth's fiance, he fainted as the car was pulled from the
creek.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hartman described his mother as ``his best friend,'' a
straight-talking, domino-playing woman who raised kids and became
so successful selling appliances that she eventually bought an
appliance company.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd tell you how everything went,'' he said. ``But she'd
give you the shirt off her back. She'd give you her last dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hartman hauled trucks out of College Station. That's
where his nephew, Justin, also lived with Allensworth and their
baby Mallory.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was happy about being a momma,'' said Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, authorities in Caldwell County Thursday recovered the
body of 7-year-old Devon McCoy, who had been missing since
Saturday, when the vehicle his mother had been driving was washed
into Brushy Creek near Uhland.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Keith Conley said the
boy was found near the water's edge along a dam on private
property. Rescuers had searched that site Wednesday, Conley said,
but Devon`s body was not there then.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-year-old friend of the McCoy family, Heather Cottle, also
had been in the McCoy's car and drowned. Her body was found
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still missing are Leandro Acevedo, 71, and his wife, Melva, 60,
who left their son's Galena Park home about 11 p.m. Saturday headed
toward Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard anything from them,'' said Robert Pruett, an

EUROPE'S LARGEST MALL HAS LEIPZIG'S MERCHANTS WORRIED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This story, held last night, is now restored for

<P>
   LEIPZIG, Germany _ The immense railway terminal in this eastern
German city, erected in the heady years before World War I and
faithfully restored after the destruction of World War II, stands
like a temple to modern transport and commerce. But store owners in
narrow downtown lanes are praying that it will not mean the end of
their trade.
</P>
<P>
   Last year marked the completion of a two-year, $230 million
overhaul of Europe's largest rail terminus into Europe's largest
shopping mall. Turning train stations into shopping centers is in
vogue, and now in Leipzig 140 stores plus a dozen or so restaurants
line three levels of the station's 845-foot-long main concourse.
</P>
<P>
   So impressive is the finished product, with glass-enclosed
elevators and escalators buzzing shoppers from one level to the
next, that the head of France's national railways, Louis Gallois,
said during a visit that it impressed him, ``like a church, like a
cathedral.''
</P>
<P>
   But such hyperbole is little edification for people like
Eva-Maria Bachmann, who runs a quaint book shop in the 16th-century
Old Town Hall, on Market Square, a 10-minute walk from the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, the available buying power is not getting
bigger,'' she said. ``Roll the dough ever thinner, and at some
point it tears.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, she said, the new stores have benefited from
federal laws that permit shops in train stations to stay open later
and to open on Sundays for ``travelers' supplies,'' while ordinary
stores must close.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Saxony, taking advantage of Bonn's indulgence
toward the economically lagging eastern states, has chosen to
interpret the law unusually generously in the case of the Leipzig
station, which is under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Such tensions are familiar to Americans who have seen again and
again the arrival of a Wal-Mart cripple Main Street merchants. But
in Leipzig, population 430,000, in the heart of eastern Germany,
they assume a special quality. With the region's manufacturing
wiped out by the transformation of old East Germany's economy,
unemployment is 15 percent, said Angelika Rusch-Ziegner, a city
government spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   That may be modest in eastern Germany, where some regions suffer
double that level, but the only hope for creating new work in
Leipzig lies ``in the service industries, in banking, and above all
in retail trade,'' said Ms. Rusch-Ziegner, who supported the train
station development.
</P>
<P>
   The terminal project is not the Leipzig area's first push into
shopping malls. After the collapse of Communism in 1989, efforts to
restore the heart of the city were hampered by property disputes.
Much downtown property in Leipzig, a major prewar publishing
center, was owned by Jewish families who perished in the Holocaust,
and tracing heirs has been time consuming. That, coupled with the
low cost of farmland outside the city, led large western German
department store chains to throw up shopping centers in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the train station developers, led by the Deutsche Bank,
Germany's largest bank, argue they have reversed that trend by
creating the first major shopping center downtown. They have
created 800 new jobs, they say, and the rising tide of shoppers
should help lift the boats of shopkeepers all across the city's
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view ourselves as a magnet for the downtown area,'' said
Michael Mehnert, a spokesman for the developers. ``If the old city
is strong, we're strong, too.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   WMF, the big manufacturer of cutlery and household utensils,
appears to agree. Despite two stores in Leipzig, it opened a third
at the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``People not only browse, they buy, too,'' said Liane Zunft, the
store manager.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the train station has its magnetism. On an average
day, 100,000 people pass through, including 30,000 railway
passengers. Annual sales in the stores are projected to be more
than $5,000 per square meter, one-third more than in shopping
centers on the edge of Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a success, and we wouldn't have thought it,'' said Inis
Scheithauer, a shopper from the outskirts of Leipzig, as she sipped
soda with her husband and son at Ovidio's, an ice cream parlor.
When relatives visited recently from Hanover, in western Germany,
the one thing they wanted to see was the train station. From the
station, she often goes to the downtown area for more shopping, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Sparschuh, who follows retail trade at Leipzig's Chamber of
Commerce, said inner-city retailers are now divided between those
who believe that the train station attracts shoppers like Mrs.
Scheithauer, who then go on to visit the downtown stores, and
others, notably big inner-city department stores, who say they are
hurting.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber is supporting a lawsuit, now pending before a court,
to test the legality of the station's late closing hours as
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You simply cannot allow unfair conditions,'' she said.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHY WAS GEORGE BLUBBERING ON TV?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who was that silver-haired man in the white
turtleneck and blue blazer blubbering over the World Series trophy
on television Wednesday night?
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't possibly have been George Steinbrenner, not grumpy
George, not the Bronx bully. It had to be somebody else, maybe the
actor on ``Seinfeld'' who played the Yankees' principal owner.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it had to be the genuine George because the genuine
George's ego would not have allowed anybody else, certainly not an
actor, to accept the World Series trophy, much less blubber.
</P>
<P>
   But that only prompts two questions: what is the genuine George
really like now, and why was he blubbering?
</P>
<P>
   For all his bluster, George Steinbrenner is really a
sentimentalist, at least when the Yankees are winning. And with a
World Series sweep for 125 victories, these Yankees, his Yankees,
not only won more games in one year than any other Yankee team ever
had, they also won more games than any other team ever had.
</P>
<P>
   The genuine George was blubbering because these were his
Yankees, but the sentimentalist in him was blubbering because maybe
he knew it was the last time they would really be his Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   If all the talk about his selling the Yankees to Cablevision is
to develop into a real deal, the genuine George, who is 68, knows
now is the time. The value of America's most famous sports
franchise has never been higher. If an expansion pro football
franchise in Cleveland goes for $530 million, who's to say the
Yankees aren't worth $1 billion?
</P>
<P>
   Quite a tidy profit, considering that Steinbrenner and his
silent partners put up $10 million in 1973 to buy the Yankees from
the Columbia Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   Not that a sale would necessarily evict the genuine George from
his Stadium office. Part of the deal might be for him to remain in
control of the team. In the hours before Wednesday night's 3-0
Series clincher in San Diego, he growled, ``I will tell you this:
I'm never going to be in a situation where I have a token role.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Cablevision is the primary owner, the Yankees won't
really be his Yankees the way they have been all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his image as a big spender with big money, the genuine
George's cash flow is whispered not to be as strong as it once was.
</P>
<P>
   According to someone familiar with Cablevision's negotiations
with the genuine George, ``He needs the money.'' His shipbuilding
business is a memory. His baseball team is his primary source of
income. And if he's going to sell the Yankees eventually anyway,
strike while the franchise is hot.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that, more than anything else, the genuine George
is a promoter and a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   If he had blubbered over the World Series trophy because he's a
sentimentalist, it's because his Yankees won, not because he has
really changed that much, although maybe he has softened a little.
After the recent American League Championship Series, he told Brian
Cashman, his 31-year-old general manager, ``Good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The genuine George has yet to say ``good job'' to Bob Watson,
the general manager when the Yankees won the 1996 World Series;
Watson resigned early this year, citing health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   And if these Yankees, with their $65 million payroll, had
stumbled through the season, the genuine George would have been as
obnoxious and as obvious as ever. If he's a sentimentalist when the
Yankees win, he can still be a tyrant when they lose.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Yankees, the feeling has always been that the genuine
George would never bequeath his principal owner's power to his
29-year-old son, Hal, and his 43-year-old son-in-law, Steve
Swindal.
</P>
<P>
   Now the genuine George is saying: ``If Steve and Hal told me
they like running this thing, I can walk away. If my family wants
it, I should be willing to give it to them. I'm convinced that they
do want it.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the sale would include roles that would put Steve and
Hal in control eventually.
</P>
<P>
   But one way or another, if the genuine George sells the Yankees,
they won't be his Yankees anymore. Maybe that's why he was
blubbering.

CLINTON ASKS HIS HOME CHURCH FOR FORGIVENESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton has sent a letter to the members of his home
church in Little Rock, Ark., expressing his repentance and asking
their forgiveness for his sins.
</P>
<P>
   The two-page, handwritten letter was read aloud to the
congregation of the church, Immanuel Baptist, at the close of
morning services on Sunday by the pastor, the Rev. Rex Horne. A
church staff member said Horne did not plan to release the contents
of the letter because it was a private message about spiritual, not
political, matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president expressed repentance for his actions, sadness
for the consequence of his sin on his family, friends and church
family, and asked forgiveness from Immanuel,'' Horne said in a
one-sentence statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right thing for the president to do,'' Horne told
the Arkansas Baptist Newsmagazine after the services. He said he
sensed that a majority of the congregation was responsive to
Clinton's request for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joined Immanuel Baptist Church in 1980 and has retained
his formal membership there while living in Washington. The church
is a member of the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's
largest Protestant denomination and one whose leadership has turned
increasingly conservative in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since the president admitted to having lied about
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky last August, top officials of
the Southern Baptist Convention have called on Immanuel Baptist to
discipline Clinton by revoking his church membership.
</P>
<P>
   ```How can President Clinton claim to be Southern Baptist and
persist in this display of serial sin?'' said R. Albert Mohler Jr.,
president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, in a commentary
for Religion News Service. ``Only because the congregation which
holds his membership has failed to exercise any semblance of church
discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Paige Patterson, president of the Southern Baptist Convention,
said at a news conference in Louisville, Ky., in September that he
agreed with Mohler's call for Immanuel Baptist to discipline the
president. Both Mohler and Patterson have also called on Clinton to
resign as president. Referring to a biblical passage, Patterson
added, ``It is said that the church is to deal with them in public
so that all may learn to fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptist leaders have no power to force Immanuel Baptist
Church to discipline Clinton or any church member, however; each
local church is considered autonomous, and therefore has the
authority to decide who is eligible for membership.
</P>
<P>
   Horne has declined to respond to the calls to discipline the
president, but has emphasized Immanuel Baptist's autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Michael Seabaugh, chairman of the Arkansas Baptist
State Convention resolutions committee, said of disciplining
Clinton: ``I don't see what would be gained. He has confessed, he
has asked forgiveness, and forgiveness has been extended.''

WOMAN, 94, WHO REFUSED RESCUE ATTEMPTS DURING FLOODING, FINALLY
COAXED TO LEAVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEPHEN JOHNSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHARTON, Texas _ Fetid flood waters lapping at her doorstep
couldn't budge 94-year-old Ira Mae Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could game wardens, police, the Wharton Fire Department,
a city councilman and other emergency personnel.
</P>
<P>
   For two-days _ until the councilman brought Anderson's home
health care aide to the house Thursday _ the adamant woman waved
away would-be rescuers. She just didn't want to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick,'' Anderson had explained to those sloshing through
the waters to talk to her through a window. ``I``m nervous and when
I get nervous, I can't move and I'm gettin' more nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got high blood pressure and I don't feel like moving,''
she said. ``Sure, the water could come into my house, but it's just
better if I stay here and stay quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   A procession of Wharton police and fire personnel waded to her
house, begging her to leave. Texas National Guard trucks, air boats
and skiffs carrying emergency personnel came and went as the
ever-rising floodwaters threatened her neatly kept home.
</P>
<P>
   Since state law does not allow officials to forcibly evacuate
residents, persuasion was the name of the game.
</P>
<P>
   With flooding here expected to reach its apex Friday with the
cresting of the Colorado River at Wharton, about 70 miles southwest
of Houston, rescuers were feeling thwarted, but determined,
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about her like I would be for any person cut off
by high water,'' explained Wharton Fire Chief David Copeland. ``She
runs the risk of losing her power, and being surrounded by this
contaminated water is a real health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' said Copeland, ``she's 94!''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency personnel had ferried 30 residents from Anderson's
neighborhood to safety Wednesday night. Like Anderson, the 30 had
initially refused to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Game Wardens John Feist and Bobby Jobes accompanied by
Wharton Fireman Brian Van Horn roared down Anderson's submerged
street in an air boat to plead with her to leave Thursday.
``Thanks, but no thanks,'' Anderson politely told them.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, City Councilman Leroy Barnes arrived aboard the
V-8-powered air boat _ which is usually used in the pursuit of
poachers _ and made his own pitch for her to leave. She was
unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   However, Anderson admitted that she missed being visited by a
home health care aide who spent four hours with her each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``She stays with me and takes care of me,'' said Anderson. ``She
hadn't been here because she says there's just too much water.''
</P>
<P>
   In no time at all, officials located the aide Bessie Mae Pine.
She agreed to board the air boat for the trip to Anderson's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll use city councilmen, nurses or whatever it takes to talk
her out of that house,'' said Copeland, the fire chief.
</P>
<P>
   While the pistol-toting game wardens sat on the prow of the air
boat moored in Anderson's submerged yard, Barnes and Pine entered
Anderson's home. After nearly 15 minutes of negotiations, she
agreed to go home with Pine.
</P>
<P>
   Reassured by her aide and the good-natured Barnes, Anderson
changed clothes (after curtly ordering the city councilman
outside).
</P>
<P>
   After being carefully helped into the boat, she pulled on a hat
to protect herself from the wind and sat on the boat's prow.
</P>
<P>
   Why did she finally agree to leave, she was asked.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson gestured at her aide: ``I just didn't want to listen to
Bessie's mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Pine's just smiled as she sat across from Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The boat's engine jumped to life with an ear-splitting roar and
a smiling Anderson thanked everyone around her for their help
before heading for higher ground. &QL;

 &HT;    Braves' Jones tells of affair, illigitimate child

 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Braves third baseman Chipper Jones shocked the state
Wednesday with the revelation that he fathered an illegitimate
child during a binge of extra-marital activity that began two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The affair nearly ended his six-year marriage with his wife,
Karin, and left Jones living a duplicitous life as wholesome
baseball personality on the outside and fretting philanderer on the
inside. Although Jones has pledged to support the child, born seven
months ago, and has patched up his relationship with his wife
through counseling, the shock waves rippled through the same town
that only last month was stunned by another paternity confession
from heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I had to make a decision on what the most important
thing in my life was,'' Jones told Morris News Service reporter
Bill Zack. ``The most important thing was Karin. So, in order to
keep Karin around, I had to make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who is on a hunting trip in central Georgia, did not
return repeated telephone messages Thursday, and his Alpharetta
home was dark and locked Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The news was hardly welcomed at the Braves' front offices, where
another front-line player, Andruw Jones, who is single, already has
been subject to a paternity suit this year. The public clamor over
the team's early elimination from the postseason, fanned by some
flippant comments from Chipper Jones, had begun to subside, only to
be replaced by a larger public-relations concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever those concerns may be, they are insignificant next to
my concerns for Chipper and Karin,'' club President Stan Kasten
said. ``That's all I really care about.''
</P>
<P>
   It already was an important offseason for Jones, whose four-year
contract with the Braves expi

   NEW YORK_ Dressed in an awkwardly undersized black suit, plastic
click pens in his pocket and geeky glasses perched on his nose,
Michael Stipe looks anything but a rock 'n' roll deity. Standing
silently in a production studio in a low-rent area of Astoria, in
Queens, he appears more like a high school kid on his way to a
costume party, the theme being ``Revenge of the Nerds.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing here on the dark set of the music video
``Daysleeper'' that smacks of the glamour world of rock 'n' roll is
the catering _ a table spilling over with tiny spring rolls,
asparagus spears, bright yellow bananas and an espresso machine _
and a small group of foreign journalists plopped down in folding
chairs, waiting with microphones in hand for the moment Stipe will
talk to them. It's not clear when that will happen, but then
nothing ever seems to go predictably with the members of one of the
world's most revered rock bands, R.E.M.
</P>
<P>
   Take the band's much-debated new album, ``Up,'' which arrives in
stores Tuesday. Earlier in the day, Warner Bros. executives
provided a sneak peek to staffers and curious critics, who reacted
as if they had just been jettisoned through some kind of
mushroom-induced musical directed by Ken Russell, guru of '70s film
excess. The closely guarded CD may have the name ``R.E.M.''
scribbled on a homemade label, yet the sound is anything but.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things we had been used to doing, the ways we used to
work in the studio, were totally thrown out the window,'' Stipe
says of the new project. ``Typically, we would go into the studio
and do a basic track with a guitar, drum and bass. But this record
was nothing like that. Everything was backwards and sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   Band mates Peter Buck and Mike Mills aren't here today; their
video scenes will be shot later. Neither particularly likes the
tedium of making music videos. They've opted to head back into the
studio for one last listen to ``Up.'' Buck and Mills are
preoccupied with final mix of the project, like sculptors running
their hands over a bust before a public unveiling. And their
concerns may be justified.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the albums R.E.M. has produced in its 18-year career,
this one is perhaps being dissected and probed the most. It's the
first without longtime drummer and founding member Bill Berry, who
shocked his musical family in October 1997 by announcing he was
quitting the band. ``Up'' is also the second album recorded under
R.E.M.'s huge financial deal with Warner Bros., a reported $80
million contract Buck, Stipe, Mills and Berry inked with the label
in 1996. The band's previous CD, ``New Adventures in Hi-Fi,'' was
critically acclaimed but flopped commercially, yielding no hit
singles, despite the presence of some lovely ballads and vaulting
rock numbers. This record is being released at a time when
America's musical landscape is changing, the moody sounds of
alternative _ which R.E.M. virtually invented _ being edged out by
the more in-your-face rhythms of rap, hip-hop and bubbly
Hanson-pop.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the greatest pressure for Athens' most famous export
comes from the calendar. Stipe is 38. Buck is 41. And Mills is 39.
Their fan base, the young
</P>
<P>
   end of the baby boomers and the ``whatever'' clump of Gen X'ers,
are now raising families and signing up for 401(k)s. Yet much of
R.E.M.'s mystique and appeal is built squarely on the band's
iconoclasm, an attitude stitched to the members like a Prada label.
With the band and its core of followers squarely into middle age,
and the original lineup reduced to a trio, it is inevitable for the
media and music community to cast R.E.M. in the light of survival
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, boomer rocker John Mellencamp mused to The New York
Times, ``I'm interested in seeing what happens to R.E.M. because
they've entered my world now. The alternative era is over, and it
will be interesting to see how they handle being mature artists
rather than being this year's model.''
</P>
<P>
   It all begs the question: Can a group that has been the essence
of ennui and hipness for an entire generation remain vital well
into its graying, second decade?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question we had to ask ourselves,'' Buck says, relaxing
on a couch in the suite of the posh Hotel Plaza Athenee on the
Upper East Side of Manhattan. He responds to hints of a midlife
crisis this way: ``Rather than get a 22-year-old girlfriend and
drive a sports car, we decided to redefine ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   From the sounds of ``Up,'' R.E.M. certainly has.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with Berry's departure, and a tenacious desire to continue
to be perceived as artists as opposed to a product, the band has
come up with perhaps the most unexpected and avant-garde album of
its career. ``Up'' is a grand experiment, a quirky, somewhat
psychedelic journey into the possibilities of sound and studio
production. The band has virtually thrown its drum/bass/guitar
style out the window, opting for a more electronic and ethereal
mood drenched in alternative percussion (drum machines, xylophone,
bells, Mellotron) and production tricks that remind you of the days
when rock music careened through fat headphones from one ear to the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about this album is it really doesn't sound like
us,'' Buck says. ``Except for Michael's vocals, you couldn't tell
who was playing on it. Structurally, the songs are different than
anything we've ever done. There isn't such a band feel. A lot of it
is done to drum machines, not a lot of guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   All three band members concede the radical shift in style and
direction was, in part, due to Berry's exit from the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole impetus for this record sounding like it does is,
when Bill quit, I didn't feel like going and getting another
drummer and go right on rocking,'' Buck says. ``It's a record where
we're coming to terms with the fact that there's only three guys in
the band. We don't really have a drummer. We just don't approach
playing music the same way anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift in R.E.M.'s style apparently began in the final days
of Berry's tenure in 1996. Gathered in Hawaii to talk about where
to go musically, Buck and Mills were already preoccupied with
Buck's extensive collection of circa-1960s studio tricks _ drum
machines, old synthesizers and sound effects gadgets. As they each
hovered over the primitive demo tapes they were making, they
realized they liked the sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going differently even before we found out Bill was
quitting,'' Mills says, nursing a sprained wrist he damaged while
playing pingpong. ``We were already suggesting to him, `Hey, why
don't we on this record do less drums and bass and maybe do some
drum loops and rhythm loops and have some fun with that?' We were
started on that anyway, so when he quit, it just accelerated the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The band and producer Pat McCarthy began using the studio as a
toy, pushing the envelope on sounds, harmonies and instrumentation.
For example, on the second single ``Lotus,'' there's a barking
chorus with a voice shouting ``HEY HEY HEY!'' It's actually a
snippet of an old reel-to-reel tape Buck discovered after someone
had tossed it on a trash pile in his Seattle neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This album was more experimental than any other R.E.M. album
I've been connected with,'' says John Keane, the Athens-based
producer who helped engineer ``Up.'' ``I'd say when Bill left the
band, it really kind of pulled the rug out from under everybody. It
left them in kind of a quandary as to what direction to go in for
the next record. Peter and Mike had already created a lot of demos
based around drum machines and synthesizers, a lot of distorted
drum loops and things like that, which normally they would have
replaced with real drums. But I think they were sort of influenced
a lot by new groups like Radiohead and Massive Attack, where a lot
of different types of rhythm are going on. A lot of the finished
product is basically the demos they started with, with a lot of
other stuff built up around it, weird sounds that have been twisted
and looped and turned around backward.''
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M. seems delighted with its creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Well, if we can get away with this, then we're
gonna be OK,'' Mills laughs. ``People know we're not a jukebox.
We're the kind of band that's always going to take a left turn, or
try to anyway. Maybe people like to be challenged. Maybe people get
tired of being spoon-fed. Any record is a reflection of what's
going on in your life personally and professionally. We've been
though a lot in the last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics and industry insiders who have gotten a preview of
``Up'' say they feel like the band did exactly the right thing by
changing its sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they made a really smart move. It would have been
foolish to do anything else,'' says New York rock critic Anthony
DeCurtis (Rolling Stone), who is writing a biography of the band.
``I don't think this is a commercial record, but artistically, it's
an extraordinary record. It's impressive for a band that's been
together for almost 20 years to now be doing some of their
strongest work.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Fram, program director of Atlanta's modern rock station
99X (WNNX-FM 99.7), got a chance to hear the album and calls it
``very, very different. But that's what R.E.M. fans appreciate,''
she says. ``The true R.E.M. fans relish the fact that the band goes
wherever their hearts take them at the time. The '80s
alternative-radio listener is now moving into a more stable phase
of life. They've got a job, kids and a mortgage payment. But these
people still listen to music, and they want to be turned on by new
music from a band they grew up with. And even though our listeners
are a little bit older, Michael Stipe is still the voice of this
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impressive that Stipe has been able to stay in this kind of
demagogue relationship with his audience. Maybe it's because he's
really the anti-rock star, the guy who made being oddly eccentric,
androgynous and disaffected the essence of cool. With his shaved
head, gangly physique and art-school musings, Stipe was perhaps the
perfect response for a generation struggling to define itself
outside the tight-pants parameters of the British Invasion school
of rock.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the hotel, sipping on a cup of Lapsang souchong tea, the
singer is alternately animated about the new album but then, at
without a moment's notice, distant and removed from the
conversation. ``I like the album a lot; I'm really, really proud of
it,'' he says, his bright blue eyes lit up like an eager student.
Then, in the next breath, Stipe looks out the window and trails off
like credits rolling at the end of the film: ``I'm really not that
fascinating. ...''
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be some kind of secret place the rock star
disappears into when he's preoccupied, a right-brain retreat from
the left-brain pressures of show business. Fans have seen him go
there onstage, alternately posing like a monk in a trance or
dancing like a giddy schoolboy. His song lyrics certainly are born
in this place, often unintelligible references that sound like
pieces of a torn-up poem tossed to the wind. And personal
encounters with Stipe are often peppered with unpredictable shifts
between talkative, ``ordinary guy'' and distant occupant of
``somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   He flinches when asked about this duality. ``I think that's the
person I am all the time. We all experience subtle changes within
ourselves. I don't really think I have to go get some shoulder pads
or defensive outerwear to be Michael from R.E.M. as opposed to
Michael,'' he says in his trademark soft whisper, sounding like a
coffeehouse poet, something he might be if not for fronting a
multimillion dollar rock band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you mind if I smoke?'' Stipe pulls a cigarette out of a
baby blue pack with an Indian head on the front. ``They're called
American Spirit. Tobacco without additives. It's a company out of
Santa Fe. They're really good.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Warner Bros. publicist lights a fat, white candle to hide
the smoke, Stipe bristles at the next question: Would R.E.M. still
be making music as a band if it weren't for the big recording
contract?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm being defensive, which I don't like,'' he
says, followed by a very long pause. ``I just feel like it's
evident in the music and everything that goes into it, and the way
we carry on our business in general, that we enjoy what we're doing
and we're not doing it for the wrong reasons, the wrong reasons
being money. I'd love for every record to sell 10 million, but it's
probably not going to happen. The most important thing to me is we
make the record we want to make, and we're proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a much better writer now than when I was 22. When
I was 22, the records that we made I'm very proud of, but they
honestly reflect where we were as a band at that time. You can
watch the timeline for R.E.M., and if you care to, go record to
record and watch us grow and go through different layers and
periods, in and out of different moods. Lyrically, I'm most proud
of the last four records. I thought our last album was really an
accomplishment, but it wasn't embraced, and that's fine. I wanted
this record to be as good, if not better.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the media attention focused on this album (the headline
recently in Rolling Stone read ``R.E.M.'s Midlife Crisis''), the
three remaining members of the band seem to have come to some sort
of peace and confidence about the changes the group has been
through over the years, and the new direction in which they are
going. They sit together for a formal portrait, and go through the
motions of the label's meet-and-greet with casual grace. The only
time Buck, Mills and Stipe seem to look back is when Berry's name
is invoked. No, he hasn't heard the new record. Buck adds, ``I gave
him a call when we were in Athens, and said `Hey, we're in the
studio, come on down. He said, `Sure,' but I never saw him.''
</P>
<P>
   Observes Mills: ``He's happy doing what he wants to do,'' which
is spending his time on a tractor at his Watkinsville farm.
</P>
<P>
   Could the remaining members of R.E.M. ever follow Berry's lead
and walk away from this band?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would we want to?'' Mills asks rhetorically. Buck jumps
in. ``It's just not really conceivable,'' he says. ``R.E.M. is my
life.''

COMMENTARY: PRISONER OF BAGHDAD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Goal by goal and strength by strength, the U.N. inspection teams
searching out Saddam Hussein's weapons are being diminished in
purpose, effectiveness and dignity by Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
to the point of public insult.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In case Saddam Hussein and the world have any doubt about where
the secretary-general stands, Annan announces that U.N. members do
not have the will to use force to reopen Iraq to the hunt for
chemical, nuclear and biological weapons.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He also says the 100 percent removal of these weapons, as
ordered by the United Nations is impossible. A ``political''
decision, says he, is needed on whether Iraq is disarmed enough or
has any of those weapons left. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Political. For seven years, inspectors have been sent out by the
United Nations, specifically assigned to find, examine and destroy
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons until all, not some, were
destroyed, to make scientific and technical accountings, not
political judgment.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And he said that the inspection teams should avoid
confrontational inspections, which means any that Iraqis don't
want, and be more flexible, more conciliatory. No other
secretary-general has humiliated his own people in the field.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The downgrading of U.N. inspection automatically affects its
chief, Richard Butler, one of the more admired U.N. servants in
decades. It has gone on quietly for a year. Russia, France and
other courters of Saddam do their part behind the closed doors of
the Security Council. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In my last column, I wrote again about the campaign within the
United Nations against U.N. inspection. The purpose is to draw down
inspection, lift or wither the economic sanctions imposed by the
United Nations for years of Iraqi refusal to cooperate with
inspection, and get back to the tasty days of oil and weaponry
contracts between Saddam and favored countries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next day Annan met with editors and reporters of The
Washington Post and told them his thoughts and wishes, for
publication.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His comments undercut the United States and Security Council
demand for total destruction of Saddam's hidden mass-death
weaponry. And by announcing that U.N. members are against military
action to save U.N. inspection, Annan wipes out the critical power
of Chapter VII. That chapter gives the United Nations the right to
take military action to put down aggression or breach of the peace.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chapter VII was the pillar of U.N. action against Saddam after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the prod for his promises to disclose
his weapons within 15 days after he made them _ seven years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, all Saddam has to do is to make his hilarious
open-inspection promise again and under the Annan doctrine the
United Nations will review what it can do to make him happy, such
as minimal sanctions and ineffective inspection. Then, happy,
Saddam can proceed to make weapons of mass destruction again from
the material and technology the inspectors have not yet found. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ritter, who resigned from the inspectorate to talk out
against its throttling, says Iraq will need three years to produce
nuclear weapons, six months for biological weapons.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, former Israeli military chief of staff and now
leader of the Labor Party, agrees about nuclear estimates, and
thinks chemical weapons will take two years.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How did Annan get so brave as to cut across American policy?
Why, because the Clinton administration has inspired neither
respect, fear nor sense that its policy was more than to wait for
Iraq to go away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, with U.S. approval, he went to Baghdad and
made a deal with Saddam. Promise not to bar inspectors again, and
we will welcome you back penalty-free _ and speed economic things
along for you.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He got real carried away with Saddam. He called him wise,
courageous and flexible. He announced he ``could do business'' with
him. He created a layer of U.N. bureaucracy to shelter him from the
inspectors.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along comes Aug. 5. Saddam orders another blockade, which is
still going on, of almost all inspection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Annan could have liberated himself by saying that he had been
wrong to trust Saddam _ and would not again until Iraq surrendered
all its weapons of mass destruction.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But he did not have the courage to say that. So there he
remains, on the 38th floor of U.N. headquarters in New York, the
prisoner of Baghdad.

VAIL FIRES WERE ARSON, FEDERAL EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dl) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal arson experts in Colorado have concluded
that the fires atop Vail Mountain were almost certainly set
deliberately, law enforcement officials said Thursday, a finding
that means the case will be investigated as an act of environmental
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary arson findings came as investigators said they
found empty plastic jugs that contained gasoline used to ignite the
fires on Monday at several buildings and chair lifts at the
11,200-foot level on the mountain, the officials said. The fires
started at multiple sources at several buildings, strongly
suggesting the blazes were set on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fires emerged following a claim of
responsibility on Monday by a shadowy group, the Earth Liberation
Front, which said in e-mail communiques to news organizations that
it set the fires _ just weeks before the start of the ski season _
to stop a ski operator from expanding onto a ridge overlooking a
national forest that was a potential habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they regarded the Earth Liberation Front
claim as legitimate, although they appeared to have no suspects.
The fires are being investigated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, along with state and local authorities, and caused an
estimated $12 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, it seemed evident that although no one was hurt in
the blaze, federal law enforcement agencies regarded the Colorado
incident as a major case. The ATF dispatched two National Response
Teams comprised of arson investigators, chemists and other forensic
experts. At the FBI, agents in the domestic terrorism section of
the agency's national security division began organizing the search
of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have brought in a mobile laboratory. Evidence
collected at the sites, which officials described as two crime
scenes situated more than a mile apart, will be sent to ATF labs in
California and Maryland. It remained unclear what agency would take
the lead in the case, although terrorist inquiries fall under the
FBI's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The fires occurred at a site where Vail Resorts has planned an
885-acre expansion into a mountainous back-country area where the
company had begun clearing trees on Friday in a hotly contested
development plan opposed by environmentalists and many local
residents of Eagle County where the ski operation is located.

   ``Putting profits ahead of Colorado's wildlife will not be

referring to the the ski area as a habitat for the lynx. ``This

   In June, fires were set at government buildings here that had
been used to conduct animal research experiments. Environmental
militants in the West have destroyed fences, set fires to livestock
buildings and driven spikes into trees to prevent logging in
fragile areas.

   One law enforcement official said Thursday that little was known
about the membership and operations of such groups, although they
are believed to have a handful of active supporters. They are
organized in a manner similar to right-wing extremists adopting
formless structures of small leaderless cells which have proven
difficult for the authorities to penetrate.

TUFTS HEALTH PLAN WILL LIMIT DRUG BENEFITS FOR SENIORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tufts Health Plan, which offers the state's biggest health
maintenance organization for seniors, said Thursday that it will
limit prescription drug benefits for the elderly to $125 a quarter,
starting Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is the latest industry challenge to a popular
Massachusetts law requiring insurers to offer unlimited drug
benefits to seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors and patient advocates decried Tufts' new limit, saying
it will leave many low-income elderly without any means to pay for
medications. ``This is going to devastate many seniors,'' said Phil
Mamber, a member of Massachusetts Senior Action Council, an
advocacy group for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Tufts, which has 83,900 seniors in its Secure Horizons HMO,
said that the limit will actually benefit 89 percent of its current
membership, while leaving 11 percent _ roughly 9,000 seniors _
financially worse off than under the current terms.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tufts is not the first insurer to cap drug benefits. Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care last month said it will limit drug benefits to
$800 a year for each senior enrolled in First Seniority, beginning
Jan. 1. Harvard's limit would be based on the retail value of the
drugs, while the Tufts limit would be based on a discounted price,
or the cost to the HMO to reimburse pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, in a lawsuit filed
last month, alleges Harvard is violating a 1994 state law requiring
unlimited drug benefits. Harvard and the managed care industry have
argued that a 1997 federal law exempts HMOs from state laws
governing benefits. The suit, which is being closely watched by
other states as a test case on the ability of states to regulate
Medicare HMOs, is scheduled for a hearing Oct. 30 in federal
district court.
</P>
<P>
   If the court decides in favor of HMOs, seniors could face a
gradual erosion of their drug coverage, advocates said. Since
Medicare does not offer any drug benefits, HMOs are not required by
federal law to cover drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be nothing to stop HMOs from eliminating drug
benefits altogether,'' said Michael Miller of Health Care For All,
a consumer advocate group in Boston. In fact, HMOs would have an
incentive to be stingy with their drug benefits, Miller said. Since
sicker seniors with high medical costs are more likely to pick
plans with drug coverage, HMOs wishing to avoid these seniors and
to ``cherry pick'' healthy seniors could eliminate drug coverage by
relying on a federal exemption, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts argued that some seniors will be better off under the new
limit. All Secure Horizons members will automatically get the
$125-per-quarter drug benefit without having to pay a premium,
Davis said. Se-niors currently pay $74 a month for unlimited
prescription drug benefits. In addition, seniors will not have to
make copayments, now $8 for a 90-day supply of a generic drug, $15
for a brand-name drug. So a senior must take more than $1,500 worth
of drugs &UR;  &LR; a year to be financially worse off under the new limit,
said Michelle Davis, a spokeswoman for the Waltham health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts estimates that 9,000 seniors in Secure Horizons use more
than $1,500 worth of medications a year.

INTERNET MUSIC SELLERS TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: N.Y., Pa.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After weeks of negotiation, CD Now and N2K, the two biggest
Internet music sellers, agreed to merge Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The all-stock deal gives holders of CD Now 60 percent of the new
company and N2K holders 40 percent. That means that CD Now is
buying N2K for $7.83, a 42 percent premium over the $5.50 price its
stock closed at Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks of both companies have plummeted in recent months to
well below their initial offering prices, and a small fraction of
the highs they reached in a brief exuberant love affair with
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The companies now hope that their merger will cut costs and win
back the hearts of investors who worried that neither of them had
the clout to fight off new competitors such as Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have operating leverage from one brand, one service,
one back end and one management team. And we won't have to compete
against each other for marketing deals,'' said Jon Diamond, a
co-founder and vice chairman of N2K.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond will become the chairman of the new company. Jason Olim,
the president and chief executive of CD Now, will retain those
positions in the new company. Larry Rosen, N2K's chairman, and
David Grusin, another vice chairman, will serve on the company's
board but will not have management responsibility. Rosen is
recovering from heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will use N2K's offices at 55 Broad St. in Lower
Manhattan as its headquarters. But it will retain operations in
suburban Philadelphia. CD Now is headquartered in Jenkinstown, Pa.,
and N2K has a facility nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Olim said there would be some layoffs but he declined to say how
many.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the company will be called CD Now/N2K Inc., but the
company will hire consultants to help pick the brand and corporate
name. N2K's main store operates under the name Music Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a smart strategic move,'' said Maria LaTour Kadison, a
senior analyst with Forrester Research. ``There is no reason for
the two of them to duke it out and grab market share from each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said that Amazon still appears to have the upper hand,
even though it has just entered the music market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply have the brand recognition and loyal customer base
that these two combined don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies said that they would have more than 1 million
customers and would be the third most visited store on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   N2K has focused more on providing articles, reviews and other
content related to music. It operates sites about the major music
genres including Rocktropolis, Jazz Central Station and Classical
Insites.
</P>
<P>
   CD Now has countered by licensing music content from MTV and
Rolling Stone.

 STUDY HINTS AT A TYPE OF THINKING IN ANIMALS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Animals do not have language and therefore, savants
from Descartes onward have held, cannot think, because words are
coin of thought. A strong hint that animals can think, but in ways
that do not involve language, has emerged from a study of
Rosencrantz and MacDuff, two rhesus monkeys whose cognitive skills
are being explored at Columbia University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows the monkeys can arrange things in serial order,
an ability that is presumably part of the human heritage too and
that could be the origin of the ability to handle syntax, the rules
for arranging words in meaningful order in a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing at panels on a computer screen, the two primates have
shown in repeated trials that they can touch, in correct numerical
order, displays containing one to nine objects, according to a
report in Friday's issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the same as being able to count from one to nine,
because people when they count use the abstract concept of number.
Strictly speaking, Rosencrantz and MacDuff have so far demonstrated
only that they can recognize arranged numerical sets in correct
order, like someone saying ``First, second, third.''
</P>
<P>
   The monkeys may also have the ability to think ``One, two,
three,'' but that remains to be proved, said Elizabeth Brannon and
Herbert Terrace, the two psychologists who are studying them. They
plan to train the monkeys to associate sets of a given number of
objects with a specific texture. If the animals can symbolize
numbers in this way, it would suggest they conceive of cardinal
numbers as people do.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring how animals think is important because it promises to
shed light on the abilities from which the human mind evolved.
Terrace is well known for his experiment 20 years ago with Nim
Chimpsky, a chimpanzee named in respectful reference to the
linguist Noam Chomsky.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, ape language specialists believed that chimpanzees
trained with pictures or in sign language could string symbols
together in sentences, indicating the ability to use syntax.
Terrace argued there was no evidence for true syntax in the strings
of signs Nim put together, a view that became widely applied to the
other apes, too.
</P>
<P>
   Chimpanzees could be trained to press buttons for the four
symbols ``Please machine give apple,'' but whatever fanciful
interpretation human observers might put on the event, in Terrace's
view, the chimp was simply placing four symbols in an order it knew
would bring some reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I could teach a pigeon to do that, and I did,'' Terrace
said. ``Then I realized it was not a negative but a positive
experiment. The question of can animals learn language was replaced
by the question, `Can animals think without language?'''
</P>
<P>
   Terrace started to explore monkeys' adeptness at putting things
in sequence, believing the ability might be an important
evolutionary precursor in the primate line of the ability that in
humans led to language.
</P>
<P>
   One day this week, when Rosencrantz and MacDuff were not
working, Terrace showed a videotape of them touching a sequence of
panels displayed on a computer monitor. The monkeys seemed absorbed
in their task, which they performed as deftly as if it were
something a rhesus did every day.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to place things in order might indeed be useful to
monkeys in the wild, Terrace said, for example, in figuring out
their position in their troupe's social hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Although many other psychologists have studied animals' ability
to handle numbers, Brannon's and Terrace's new experiment is
important because it excludes the many possible confounding factors
``better than any other paper I know,'' said Dr. Susan Carey, an
expert on number learning at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carey believes that animals possess several different
number-representing systems. Rats, for example, can evidently
represent numbers as large as 45 in their minds because they can be
trained to press a bar 45 times and then switch to another bar.
Human infants know that one is less than two and two less than
three but cannot represent larger numbers. Presumably infants are
using a different system, or mental module, from the one rats use
to decide when they have reached 45 and that people use to list the
cardinal numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the list of whole numbers might seem an integral part
of everyone's vocabulary, some languages have a very truncated
counting system that goes ``One, two, many.'' That system may go
back to the earliest days of language, Dr. Carey believes, because
it is woven into the syntax of all languages in the form of the
single and plural forms of verbs. Many languages also had a dual
form, now often dropped though retained in tongues like Arabic, for
expressing the actions of two people.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be discovered how the large-number mental module,
the one-two-many module and the list-of-integers module are related
to each other and to the syntax module. ``That is a question in
evolutionary history, and the Brannon and Terrace experiment tells
a part of that story in a very elegant way,'' Dr. Carey said.

CLINTON PRESSES MIDEAST PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ Continuing the most intensive foreign diplomacy
of his career, President Clinton yesterday shuttled between
clusters of Israeli and Palestinian officials to try to resolve
knotty disputes, including the final stage of a West Bank pullout,
the fate of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and a Palestinian
charter that calls for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Palestinians stepped up their demands for
an end to Jewish settlements on disputed lands, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they reached a breakthrough during bleary-eyed
talks early Thursday, as Israelis and Palestinians tentatively
agreed to American proposals for increasing security in Israel. The
measures included using CIA officers as intermediaries to decide
which Palestinians charged with terrorist acts should be extradited
to Israel, according to those familiar with the heated discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Another sticking point, the plans for a Palestinian airport in
Gaza, was basically resolved, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest of more than 60 hours of face-to-face involvement,
Clinton spent the day discussing and debating fine points of the
agreeement as he alternated between Netanyahu and Arafat and their
aides, officials said. The president turned on the charm, and his
hard sell, as he arrived for his sixth day at the talks on
Maryland's Eastern Shore. ``The hardest decisions now at last are
on the table,'' he told reporters before going to the secluded Wye
Plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Prodding and cajoling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Clinton asked the two sides
to reach an agreement by late last night or early this morning, and
then attend a ceremony at the White House. As the sun went down
over the marshland surrounding the Wye Plantation, State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said the talks had entered a ``fairly
high-intensity'' stage. But ``there's definitely no deal yet,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The White House sees added urgency for a deal because Netanyahu
has talked about flying to Jerusalem or New York before the
Sabbath, which starts at sundown today. In addition, Americans said
they were jolted up by a grenade-throwing terrorist in Israel on
Monday and wanted Netanyahu and Arafat to make a commitment, shake
hands and sign a document before something else disrupts the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, Israeli hard-liners said they would tie up
a new surrender of the West Bank with political chaos if Netanyahu
made concessions to the Palestinians. Hanan Porat, a legislator and
member of the National Religious Party, said the right wing would
bring down Netanyahu's government and force early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to restore an atmosphere of congeniality after a tense
day of brinksmanship Wednesday, Clinton, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and US envoy Dennis Ross took walks through the
woods of the Wye Plantation throughout the day with Israeli and
Palestinian officials in the brisk fall breezes. Adding to the
sense of familiarity, Clinton brought his dog, Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the security agreement were sketchy, but one official
said it includes concessions by Palestinians to cooperate with the
CIA and turn over terrorists to Israeli authorities. In exchange
for the cooperation, Israel will hand over 13 percent more of the
West Bank in several stages during three months.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with his national security team in the morning,
Clinton spoke with Netanyahu while Albright spoke with Arafat.
Clinton talked to Arafat, and then the two Mideast leaders sat on a
couch and held a rare talk _ which Americans called an encouraging
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian delegations sat at different sides of a
cavernous dining room during a buffet lunch, but Rubin said
officials of the two groups mixed for talks.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they are not interested in a partial agreement
that leaves major issues to be decided. But they indicated that
some less-important topics had been scuttled for now, including
talks about a seaport that the Palestinians hope to build.
</P>
<P>
   Delegations and lawyers were meeting to decide when Palestinians
will build an airport and seaport and whether Israel will free a
group of Palestinians convicted and accused of terrorism from
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wouldn't have rolled up his sleeves today and
urged the leaders to get down to business if significant gaps did
not remain,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of US Jewish groups urged said they were in touch with
Netanyahu and his staff throughout the day, recommending a peace
pact that included a surrender of 13 percent of the West Bank so
long as Israel feels it will not be exposed to more terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overwhelmingly, the American Jewish community wants the peace
talks to succeed, just as Israelis do, but we know that Israelis
are the ones who pay the price if there isn't security,'' said
Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Hoenlein was one of about 150 leaders who spoke with Netanyahu
on a conference call Wednesday evening after the Israelis packed
their bags and threatened to leave the talks. Netanyahu said the
Palestinians were backtracking on agreements and showing bad faith
by keeping a charter that calls for destroying Israel.
</P>
<P>
   US officials spoke about Netanyahu's threat with a mix of
bemusement and trepidation Thursday. One official noted that as
Albright approached the Israelis' cottage Wednesday, members of the
delegation were placing suitcases on the grass, then removing them
and putting them back _ as if rehearsing the scene of a play.
</P>
<P>
   The peace summit, finishing its eighth day, has lasted twice as
long as planned. Asked how much the US government was paying for
food and lodging for approximately 50 Palestinian and Israeli
guests, Rubin said there was no figure yet. ``I think whatever the
tab is, it will be a small price to pay if we can advance the cause
of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The day started with Israelis and Palestinians reviewing a
20-page document put together by the Americans that outlined the
terms of the deal, especially the Israelis' withdrawal from 13
percent more of the West Bank, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, Clinton was nearing his 70th hour at the talks. He
has already postponed a two-day trip to California to campaign for
Democratic candidates for Congress, and the White House said the
president will stick to his new plan to depart Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's King Hussein arrived at the estate for a second day,
but by the evening he was still confined to a guest cottage, where
he was phoning Arab and Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians said they were demanding the release of thousands
of prisoners as part of this peace deal. They also asked the
Israelis to make a commitment to a further withdrawal from the West
Bank, which is called for in a 1995 peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has resisted talking about further withdrawals,
according to Americans who have spoken with him. ``The number of
issues has been reduced but the issues remaining are substantially
complex,'' Rubin said.

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sanford Weill, the co-chief executive of Citigroup, excels at
sizing up risks. He has swallowed up numerous firms, including
Salomon Smith Barney, to create the world's largest financial
company, winning praise for shrewdly negotiating the financial
pitfalls of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when it came to the hedge-fund giant Long-Term Capital
Management, Weill acknowledged that he did not know enough about
the dangerous bets that the fund was making.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital borrowed heavily, made risky investments
across many markets and last month nearly failed, surviving only
after a $3.6 billion cash investment by big brokerage firms and
banks under the guiding hand of regulators worried that the fund's
collapse would disrupt the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Why did seasoned financiers around the world not recognize the
problem earlier? Weill, one of the few Wall Street executives to
speak publicly about Long-Term, concedes the sheer star power of
the fund's financial brain trust blinded him to the huge risks
Long-Term was taking. The fund's managers included acclaimed
economists who last year shared a Nobel Prize, former government
officials and bond traders known for generating immense returns.
</P>
<P>
   The downfall of Long-Term Capital Management provides a rare
window on the clubby world of high finance, where decisions about
where to steer vast sums can be made with few questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   Like Weill, many of Long-Term's backers were satisfied for
nearly four years to put hundreds of millions of dollars at stake
with only a glimpse of the vaunted fund's trading and borrowing
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The fund provided a brief monthly financial statement, without
information on specific investments _ far less disclosure than many
other hedge funds. And at times it took secrecy to great lengths.
When representatives of a private Swiss bank met with the fund to
discuss investing more money, notepads and pens were whisked out of
the room so no one could take notes.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term also received generous terms on its loans _ including
a credit line of $900 million from Chase Manhattan and other banks
requiring no collateral _ and amassed far greater amounts of debt
than its competitors. All of this permitted it to make financial
bets far out of proportion to the amount of cash it had on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason no outsider knew the size of the fund's
problem for so long was that everyone had only a small piece of the
Long-Term puzzle. Lenders were unaware of the sums others were
extending, and firms trading with Long-Term did not know anything
about trades other than their own or about the fund's overall
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't met anyone who knew how big they were,'' said a
senior executive at a major bank who requested anonymity. ``They
wouldn't let anyone look at their positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did Long-Term get special treatment? ``When you have two
Nobel laureates, plus a former Federal Reserve vice chairman, a
cast of star bond traders, and have extraordinary returns for a
couple of years, the whole thing becomes self-reinforcing,'' said
Henry Hu, a professor of financial law at the University of Texas
at Austin who has testified before Congress on hedge-fund
activities. ``There was a willing suspension of disbelief by very
sophisticated investors when it came to Long-Term.''
</P>
<P>
   That opinion was echoed privately by Wall Street executives as
well as by regulators, consultants and other hedge-fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their lineage and Nobel Prize status allowed them to
provide less information, although I'm not in a position to know
entirely,'' said Leon Cooperman, chairman of Omega Advisors, one of
the world's biggest hedge funds. ``We provide investors with a lot
of information like balance-sheet statements. Long-Term was
apparently very different. Caveat emptor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board is now examining how well the banks it
regulates gauged the riskiness of their loans to and trades with
Long-Term, and is paying special attention to whether firms used
computer models to test how the investments would fare in a market
plunge. Banking regulators in Switzerland are conducting their own
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Weill, who says his company began taking a close look at
Long-Term's activities only in June, now expects more disclosure
from his trading partners. ``I think the lesson of this is that if
it's structured so that you can't get more than a fraction of the
picture,'' he said, ``then in the future we will be taking our
business elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds _ largely unregulated investment pools open to
wealthy investors and big institutions _ aim to provide
consistently outsized returns on stocks, bonds, currencies or other
securities while limiting losses from market downturns. Like the
baseball slugger Mark McGwire, such funds swing for the fences. And
like McGwire, winning funds attract a devoted, often rhapsodic
following.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term provided eye-popping gains on the billions of dollars
it managed. In 1995, investors hauled in almost 43 percent after
fees and nearly 41 percent the following year, before returns
dropped to about 17 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, what you get in a bull market is people who
forget there is a down side, especially if they have stardust in
their eyes,'' said Paul Roth, an attorney with Schulte Roth &AMP;
Zabel, a law firm that represents hedge funds.

   WYE MILLS, Md. _ President Clinton pressed Israeli and
Palestinian leaders to ''capture the momentum of peace'' on
Thursday and embrace a high stakes land-for-security deal, but
talks among the parties ground to a ninth-inning snag over life and
death concerns on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   As an eighth excruciating day of Mideast summitry stretched into
the night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat continued to meet around a roaring
fireplace here in rural Maryland, but they remained far apart on
half a dozen issues that frame the heart and soul of a peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sticking points were questions over Israeli troop
withdrawals, the treatment of suspected terrorists by Palestinians
and the status of a Palestinian covenant calling for the
destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of the issues and the severity of the remaining
gaps, after eight days and nights of negotiations, left the talks
suspended in a stomach-wrenching netherworld between culmination
and collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''What will happen is very much an open question,'' U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issues remaining are sufficiently complex and emotionally
laden and difficult for the parties involved for us to be unable to
know whether this will come out with an agreement or not,'' Rubin
said. ''The critical gaps in some of these areas have not been
closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Journeying to the secluded Wye River Conference Center on
Maryland's Eastern Shore for the sixth time in eight days, Clinton
lent the prestige of his office and the force of his will to the
talks, while U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright shuttled
back and forth between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders,
prodding, encouraging and offering her own suggestions on how to
move beyond impasse and toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the parties will seize this opportunity and not retreat
from the clear moment to capture the momentum of peace,'' Clinton
said at the White House, before journeying by helicopter to the
summit, where he has spent more than 65 working hours since talks
began a week ago Thursday. ''The hardest decisions now, at last,
are on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of bargaining at its most earnest, Netanyahu and
Arafat held a rare one-on-one meeting for two hours in the
afternoon, as their aides huddled in side meetings trying to come
to terms with various aspects of an overall deal.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, though, they had yet to reach agreement on a host
of important issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting there, on some of them,'' said Rubin, who
compared the atmosphere to that of a last-minute political
horsetrading session on the eve of a critical legislative vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had a little bit of the flavor of a legislative session,
drawing toward the close, where people were working very hard,''
Rubin told reporters gathered near the conference center, where the
talks are unfolding at a 1,000-acre riverside retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ''But that doesn't mean that they will draw to a close,'' Rubin
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still obstacles,'' he said. ''I would say it's in
the half-dozen category.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the talks is a proposal for Israeli troops to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the occupied West Bank,
in exchange for a Palestinian commitment to combat anti-Israeli
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement would leave some 40 percent of the West Bank
under full, or partial, control of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Under a U.S. proposal, agents of the Central Intelligence Agency
would assist Palestinians in handling difficult terrorist problems.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is seeking additional promises from the Palestinians,
specifically over the issue of how to handle suspected terrorists
in territory under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is also insisting on the specific rescinscion of a
provision in the Palestinians' charter that calls for the
destruction of Israel. Arafat counters that the policy-making arm
of the Palestinian Authority has rescinded the provision -- even
though it is yet to be officially excised by a broader, 700-member
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, for his part, is pressing for promises of additional
Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank, as called for in the
1993 Oslo accords that spawned the current peace process.
</P>
<P>
   That process has been stalemated for 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye talks are an attempt to advance the process toward
so-called final, or permanent, status talks, which, under the Oslo
accords, are to be completed by May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent status talks would be aimed at resolving the most
difficult issues remaining in a conflict that has endured for half
a century, including the future of Jerusalem, which both Israelis
and Palestinians claim, and a host of economic, territorial and
security issues.

 UNDATED: hedge funds.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exclusive List of Big Clients
</P>
<P>
   At its outset, Long-Term established relationships with global
banks that it deemed strategic investors. The initial pitch,
according to a person close to the fund who requested anonymity,
was to a hand-picked group of fewer than 10 commercial and
investment banks that were offered the exclusive opportunity to
invest in the hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the arrangement, the hedge fund got research and
intelligence on markets around the world, while the bank investors
got advice on risk management from Long-Term's usually reclusive
brain trust and such other perks as speakers for seminars. ``We
hoped the relationship would be mutually beneficial,'' said the
person close to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Big banks in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America
each invested $10 million to $100 million in the fund for this
privilege. The investors were heavily European and Asian, and
included Dresdner Bank of Germany, Sumitomo Bank of Japan, and
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., which helped raise much of the original
capital for the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Merrill and Long-Term Capital blossomed
over the years. In September 1997, about 10 executives from
brokerage powerhouse Merrill, including the retired chairman,
Daniel Tully, convened at the famed Waterville golf course in
Ireland to meet with the course's owners, which included
Long-Term's founder, John Meriwether, and several other Long-Term
partners. The group golfed and fished for trout by day and
discussed global markets over sumptuous dinners.
</P>
<P>
   The golf weekend was a rare event, since Long-Term was so
ardently sought after as a business partner that it seldom engaged
in the wining and dining that normally cements business
relationships on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether, a legendary bond trader who left Salomon Brothers in
the early 1990s in the wake of a trading scandal, recruited a
coveted cadre of bond traders from his former firm.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term's partnership rolls also included some marquee names:
David Mullins, a former Harvard Business School professor and a
former Federal Reserve vice chairman, and Robert Merton and Myron
Scholes, two economists who would win Nobel Prizes for their work
in the field of modeling financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met Myron Scholes I was like `Wow, I'm meeting Myron
Scholes _ Nobel Prize _ this is something special,''' said a senior
executive whose multinational bank traded with Long-Term but who
requested anonymity. ``They were asked fewer questions because of
their pedigrees. No question.''
</P>
<P>
   The Attraction of Celebrities
</P>
<P>
   As Wall Street celebrities, Meriwether and his cohorts needed
little salesmanship, attracting $1.3 billion by the time the fund
began trading in February 1994. Still, whenever Long-Term's
partners visited a bank abroad, they often played golf or had
dinner with its executives. The banks never sent their junior
people _ only senior executives met with Long-Term partners.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term's partners liked the idea of knowing their business
associates personally, so disputes about trades could be worked out
quickly and amicably, according to the person close to the hedge
fund. And partners emphasized that their own money was at stake as
``a selling point.'' They initially put in $100 million and later
used a financial contract to increase their stake substantially.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the fund's partners agreed to furnish only
sketchy information about their practices and not to play favorites
by giving some investors, lenders or trading partners more
information than others, according to people close to Long-Term and
bankers.
</P>
<P>
   They provided investors a monthly statement of two pages. The
first page showed the net asset value for the fund, a
profit-and-loss tally, and any additions or withdrawals. The second
page was an abbreviated balance sheet with quarterly information on
broad categories of investing, like government bonds and equities,
but no information on specific securities.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Bernheim, president of Dome Capital Management, which
advises institutional investors about hedge funds, said some funds
send not only a detailed write-up discussing strategy each quarter,
but also a list of their 10 biggest positions. ``Now the trend is
toward more openness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term's penchant for secrecy extended to a meeting during
the last year with bankers from Bank Julius Baer &AMP; Co., a private
bank in Switzerland. At that meeting, pens and notepads were
removed so the bankers could not jot down any information,
according to people familiar with the visit. Julius Baer declined
repeated requests for information about the incident or its
relationship with the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Even with sketchy information, big banks were lining up to lend
to Long-Term, according to investment and commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers typically lend to hedge funds on an overnight basis,
requesting daily information to reassess the quality of the
collateral, but some of Long-Term's lenders provided financing for
months at a time without checking the fund's books, according to a
person familiar with Long-Term's books. Though some lenders wanted
daily information about asset values and positions, Long-Term
refused to give it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fund's big debts was a credit line of $900 million led
by Chase Manhattan that was parceled out to two dozen other banks
and not backed by any collateral _ which is unusual for hedge-fund
loans. Long-Term used $500 million of that credit line, which has
since been repaid with the proceeds of the rescue fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say that banks were eager to do business
with Long-Term because the firm had strong relationships and
sizable positions,'' said Bernheim of Dome Capital. ``It was the
lender's responsibility to demand more information. They should
have had a much bigger picture of the overall balance sheet, and
that seems to have been missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say they had warned banks about easy lending to hedge
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had concerns about lending standards to hedge funds,
and on April 28, 1994, we put out a letter to all banks expressing
concern about the growth of trading activities to institutional
investors, including leveraged funds,'' said Peter Bakstansky, a
spokesman for the Federal Reserve's New York branch. ``It has been
a matter of continuous supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such concerns, the Fed says it did not become aware of
how much debt Long-Term Capital had on Sept. 20, when the fund
verged on collapse.

   Long-Term Balks at Disclosing Details
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy is not uncommon among hedge funds. They are not required
to report their positions even to their investors. But several
managers of big hedge funds said that along with providing regular,
detailed statements, when investors call them to inquire about
their trading strategy or even a specific position _ say, in a
stock or a bond _ they gladly disclose it.
</P>
<P>
   Bank representatives who visited Long-Term were told what the
hedge fund was doing in concept only, not anything specific about
trades. Long-Term worried that if its trading positions or
strategies became too widely known, competitors would take
advantage of them. And the fund's financiers deliberately did not
share data with one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned about exchanging information too much,''
said David Komansky, Merrill's chairman and chief executive. Firms
lending to Long-Term Capital did not have a clear idea how much
each had loaned, he said, and sharing such information could have
had legal repercussions. ``Collusion is illegal,'' Komansky added.
</P>
<P>
   A top executive at another Wall Street firm echoed that belief
and pointed to the painful experience of the Nasdaq trading
scandal, in which many firms agreed to pay hefty fines after
regulators said they had illegally fixed prices.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to trading, Long-Term engaged in a bit of bravado.
In mid-1997, the partners approached Credit Suisse about making a
$100 million trade that the fund would increase in value. Credit
Suisse sought to protect itself in the deal by taking a stake in
the fund. When the fund faltered, Credit Suisse took a hit. The
complex transaction contributed to a $55 million reduction in
revenue that Credit Suisse announced last month.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term got generous agreements with its trading partners as
well as its lenders. Typically, a borrower wanting to buy $100
million in Treasury securities might be asked to provide $10
million of its own assets in addition to the Treasury securities as
collateral. In some cases, Long-Term did not have to put up any
assets other than the newly purchased securities for collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the appeal for banks doing business with Long-Term was
the enormous fees it generated. Long-Term was one of the top five
money-making clients for many of the big brokerage firms, according
to people on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The list of firms investing or trading with Long-Term ultimately
became a who's who of the international financial world: Merrill;
Morgan Stanley; Goldman, Sachs; Chase Manhattan; Bankers Trust;
J.P. Morgan; Citigroup; Union Bank of Switzerland; Credit Suisse;
Deutsche Bank; Sumitomo _ even the foreign-exchange office of
Italy's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some Key Officials Join the Firm
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term's global clout was enhanced by the presence of former
government officials at the firm. Mullins joined in 1994 as soon as
he left the Federal Reserve, a move made possible because the Fed,
unlike the Treasury Department, does not have a mandatory waiting
period for its former officials' return to the financial sector.
Mullins declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looking to move on'' and asked Long-Term for advice,
said the person close to the fund who requested anonymity. The
fund's partners knew Mullins _ besides other duties, he was the
Fed's point man on the bond-trading scandal at Salomon Brothers _
and invited him aboard.
</P>
<P>
   This person said that Mullins joined after the firm had
completed its initial fund raising, but later helped with such
efforts. His government experience gave the firm no special
advantages in the bond market, the person added. Mullins' key role,
he said, was devising strategies to maintain the firm's financial
stability as it engaged in complicated trades.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, people close to the firm said that Alberto Giovannini,
a former Italian treasury official, played no role in encouraging
the Italian central bank to become involved with the firm.
Giovannini worked as an economist at Long-Term but was primarily
involved in setting up a new asset-management business for
Long-Term in Italy, according to the person close to Long-Term.
</P>
<P>
   Although central banks are generally conservative investors, the
Italian central bank put a considerable amount of money into
Long-Term. The foreign-exchange office of Italy's central bank had
a $100 million equity stake in the fund and lent it $150 million
more. Antonio Fazio, head of Italy's central bank, said in a recent
press conference that there was ``nothing illegal'' about the
investment.
</P>
<P>
   While questions are being raised in Italy, regulators in
Switzerland are investigating its bankers' relationships with
Long-Term.
</P>
<P>
   One report has indicated that Union Bank of Switzerland at least
suspected how much debt Long-Term was taking on. According to an
internal credit report cited by the Reuters news agency, UBS knew
Long-Term was heavily indebted as early as December 1996. The bank
report refers to a limit on dealing with a client that had
``leverage,'' or the ratio of debt to assets, of more than 30 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Yet UBS estimated that when derivatives activities were
accounted for, Long-Term Capital's leverage might be 250 to 1,
according to the report. UBS did business with the hedge fund
anyway. UBS declined to comment on the Reuters report or anything
else having to do with Long-Term, citing the Swiss investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But it recently announced a loss of about $700 million because
of its exposure to Long-Term. Several top UBS executives, including
the bank's chairman, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Merrill Lynch replaced the person who had been
in charge of risk management at the firm for 11 years _ a move that
analysts attributed to a quarterly loss for the firm and in part to
the Long-Term Capital fiasco.

   As Markets Sour, Questions Arise
</P>
<P>
   Once financial markets began to plummet this summer, Long-Term's
creditors and trading partners pressed the rapidly deteriorating
hedge fund for more information _ and got it. It was only then that
Weill _ whose firm was suffering from its own errant bond bets and
would announce a month later that it was exiting the arcane
business of bond arbitrage _ had his minions begin to closely
examine Long-Term's bond-trading strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Others started to look closely, too. A banker who requested
anonymity said he visited Long-Term's partners in August ``and sat
with them for about two-and-a-half hours and talked about the kinds
of things you would want to know when there's stress in the system,
and I got much more disclosure than previously.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, what bankers heard was disconcerting. Besides the
extraordinary debt burden, the fund had been engaging in risky
trades and had been responsible for big moves in certain markets.
In one instance, a major bank estimated that Long-Term's trading
was responsible for 30 percent of the volatility on the major
French stock index, the CAC-40, during much of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers also discovered that Long-Term's computer model was
terribly outmoded in its capacity to test how the fund's
investments would perform in an unusually rough market.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, once a little daylight was let in, Long-Term was
reminded why it never wanted to broadcast its trading positions or
strategies. Investors were invited in over the summer to help
inject some money into the firm to keep it afloat. But individuals
close to the fund's operations believe that some potential
investors simply used what they learned to begin speculating
against Long-Term, betting the fund would collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators, also late to discover the size of the problems
lurking behind Long-Term's glittering facade, feared that the hedge
fund's collapse would undermine the global financial system. So a
rescue of the hedge fund by a consortium of investment and
commercial banks was arranged in late September.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever infatuation Wall Street bankers once had with
Meriwether and his colleagues, they are now putting distance
between them. When members of the banks arranging the rescue
gathered at the offices of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &AMP; Flom one
day late last month, Meriwether was not invited.
</P>
<P>
   When he did show up the next day, he was sequestered in an
office far away from the meeting room, said people who attended. To
talk to Meriwether, bankers stepped out into the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   And the starry-eyed interaction that characterized previous
encounters was notably absent. ``There wasn't any back-slapping,''
said one person at the meeting, ``and there was no talking about
golf.''

   Journeying to the secluded Wye River Conference Center on

<P>
   ''But that doesn't mean that they will draw to a close,'' Rubin
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still obstacles,'' he said. ''I would say it's in
the half-dozen category.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the talks is a proposal for Israeli troops to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the occupied West Bank,
in exchange for a Palestinian commitment to combat anti-Israeli
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement would leave some 40 percent of the West Bank
under full, or partial, control of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Under a U.S. proposal, agents of the Central Intelligence Agency
would assist Palestinians in handling difficult terrorist problems.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is seeking additional promises from the Palestinians,
specifically over the issue of how to handle suspected terrorists
in territory under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is also insisting on the specific rescinscion of a
provision in the Palestinians' charter that calls for the
destruction of Israel. Arafat counters that the policy-making arm
of the Palestinian Authority has rescinded the provision -- even
though it is yet to be officially excised by a broader, 700-member
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, for his part, is pressing for promises of additional
Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank, as called for in the
1993 Oslo accords that spawned the current peace process.
</P>
<P>
   That process has been stalemated for 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye talks are an attempt to advance the process toward
so-called final, or permanent, status talks, which, under the Oslo
accords, are to be completed by May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent status talks would be aimed at resolving the most
difficult issues remaining in a conflict that has endured for half
a century, including the future of Jerusalem, which both Israelis
and Palestinians claim, and a host of economic, territorial and
security issues.

TEEN SURVEY WILL HELP ADVERTISERS DECIPHER MEANINGS OF `WHATEVER' 
</HEADLINE>
  (dl) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Young consumers have been under scrutiny from the
1940s, when Seventeen magazine popularized the term ``teen-ager,''
to the 1960s, when Paul Lynde asked ``What's the matter with kids
today?'' in ``Bye Bye Birdie,'' to the 1990s, when adults learned
that the word ``whatever'' could have an almost infinite number of
meanings. Now a major agency is enlisting teen-agers themselves to
help explain and predict their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, called Teen Link, is a yearlong qualitative look at
the booming teen-age market by Bates USA in New York, part of the
Bates Worldwide agency owned by Cordiant Communications Group. The
survey, conducted with Teen-Age Research Unlimited in Northbrook,
Ill., is intended to offer marketers insights into a growing
demographic group that spent an estimated $91.5 billion to $122
billion last year and is significantly changing the way such
products as apparel, food and soft drinks are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The participants in Teen Link form a panel of 36 students in
grades nine through 12, who live in 13 urban and suburban markets
across the country. They were selected to provide a cross section
of contemporary teen-age life styles; for instance, about a third
come from one-parent households or families affected by divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers are delivering reports every other month on such
disparate subjects as gender perceptions and stereotypes, life 15
years from now, their relationships with adults and heroes.
Participants are asked to submit their material in nontraditional
ways. Once, for example, they were sent disposable cameras and
asked to photograph the people, places and objects they deem most
significant in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to help clients gain a sustainable competitive
advantage in the marketplace,'' said Marylin Silverman, executive
vice president and director for strategic planning and research at
Bates USA, which works for advertisers like CVS, the Warner-Lambert
Co. and Wendy's International Inc. ``To do that, you have to know
consumers, how they live, breathe, eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``An in-depth understanding of teen-agers is particularly
important,'' she added, ``because they're so changeable, less set
in their way. To talk to them, you have to keep on top of those
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   While teen-agers ``have always been an important market,'' Ms.
Silverman said, ``this group, the children of the baby boomers, is
much more powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many teens are now responsible for grocery shopping for the
family, and they influence, and participate in, buying decisions
for products like cars and computers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, three Teen Link assignments have been fielded out to the
participants. The responses so far indicate that they ``have values
that will make them different from the baby boomers and Generation
X,'' said Janice Figueroa, a senior vice president and senior
strategic planner at Bates USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to understand their values so we can keep up
with them as they grow up,'' she added. ``And these teens feel good
about themselves and about the future. They enjoy being teens and
think they can make a difference in the world. And they believe you
can be cool, but still be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   One insight already gleaned from the survey, Ms. Figueroa said,
is that if teen-agers feel comfortable with who they are,
advertising that tries using appeals to insecurity and ``peer
pressure tactics'' to influence buying decisions ``is not going to
work with this generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another insight, Ms. Silverman said, was that marketers ought to
``give these teens a voice in'' and ``an opportunity to interact
with'' campaigns because of what Ms. Figueroa described as ``their
access to an amazing amount of information from the Internet,
numerous television channels and other sources.''
</P>
<P>
   That was reflected in the assertive responses the panel
participants gave to many questions they were asked. For instance,
in the survey about life in 2013, one teen-ager replied: ``I will
be out of school and have my master's in marketing. I will have a
job with a big corporation. I won't be the boss yet, but in a
couple of years I will be.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe thinking of awarding an account to the agency that
sent those surveys back in 1998?  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THESE YANKS DOMINATED  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They won the World Series with their fifth-string left fielder,
for goodness' sake. They won two huge games with a pitcher who had
emerged from the roiling seas. Their World Series hero was
underestimated by everybody, at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Their owner was a warm and fuzzy guy who disarmed everybody in
the clubhouse with his moist eyes and his soft voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was George crying?'' people kept asking afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the old blunderbuss was misty, and there's nothing wrong
with that. Was he brooding that he might be selling off his team to
protect his heirs from inheritance taxes? He wouldn't say. But
there's nothing wrong with getting weepy at the end of one of those
landmark years when one team gets much of it right much of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees of 1998, under a patient and wise manager
named Joe Torre, performed at such an exalted level that adults
could tell the next generation, ``That's how you play the game of
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Matter of fact, that's how you do your homework. Do your job.
Live your life. Pay attention to the details. Show respect for
people around you. Enjoy yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I came here,'' said Hideki Irabu, who never
pitched in the post-season but smoked a cigar and smiled all the
same. ``This is why I wanted to play for the Yankees. I wanted to
wear the pinstripes and I wanted to wear a championship ring.''
</P>
<P>
   What a clubhouse. Not a creep in it, all season long. There were
grown-ups like Chili Davis and David Cone, who have been around,
who know some stuff. On Wednesday evening, after they had fought
off Kevin Brown for the second time in a week, they were chanting
``Dar-ryl! Dar-ryl! Dar-ryl''! and then they switched to ``Scot-tie
Bro-sius! Scot-tie Bro-sius!'' honoring both their stricken pal and
their poker-faced October hero. They sounded like high school kids
who had won the regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   In the melee, there was a man lighting a cigar. ``Felicidades,
hombre,'' I said. Congratulations, man. Pointing at the cigar, I
asked, ``Que tipo?'' What kind?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cubano,'' he said, holding out his hand. He had been saving
the good stuff for the world championship.
</P>
<P>
   That was El Duque. They didn't have enough talent as it was, the
poor Yankees, so they went out and signed a man who had sailed out
of his own personal coventry back in Cuba, and in a stunningly
short period of time got his body and his psyche together. When
they needed a big victory in Cleveland, Orlando Hernandez was a
blend of Luis Tiant and Satchel Paige and Juan Marichal. I never
thought I'd ever hear Bob Sheppard introduce a player as ``El
Duque,'' but on a warm October night I did.
</P>
<P>
   They all knew it was a special season, and they acted like
adults, from George Steinbrenner to the cast of thousands who
shared left field and never whined. (``You wouldn't dare,'' Davis
said.)
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner said it was as good a team as he had seen. Torre
said it was the best team he had seen in his 40 years of baseball.
Cone said it takes a terrific team to battle through three levels
of playoffs. Even with a few swigs of Champagne, they did not get
giddy and proclaim themselves the kings of the world. They were
respectful of Ruth and Gehrig, Mantle and Maris, Reggie and
Catfish, Bench and Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Was this the greatest team of all time? Does that matter? There
were roughnecks back in the early part of this century who were as
good as the evolution of the game allowed them to be. Ty Cobb. The
Yankees of 1927 were fence-busters. The Cardinals of the '30s
played with panache. The Big Red Machine of the '70s could
steamroll you.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I think the crusty 1961 Yankees had the best single
season I ever covered, or maybe that was because I was kid reporter
out of college. Maris was a wonderful player, Elston Howard was in
his prime, Whitey Ford and Luis Arroyo had career years. Oh, and
don't forget Mickey and Yogi.
</P>
<P>
   You want the best team of all time? Do I really have to play
this silly game? All right, I'll take my 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers, the
team of my youth, the Boys of Summer, as Roger Kahn called them. In
a perfect world, in the ultimate World Series, Jackie Robinson
steals home on El Duque's windup. There, I said it.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we should tell our children and our
grandchildren about the 1998 Yankees, how good they were on the
field, and how, when they won the World Series, they did not crow
too much.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent evening, a crowd of elegantly dressed
people, many of them Democrats, gathered at the Hilton Hotel in
Manhattan to honor a Brooklyn housing group founded by one of the
state's most famous liberals, Sen. Robert Kennedy. And there,
seated near the front, was an unlikely guest of honor: Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, the three-term Republican running hard for a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato had just completed another day of attacking his
Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer, as being a Brooklyn
liberal. But this evening, the senator accepted an award for his
work on behalf of the nonpartisan group, the Bedford Stuyvesant
Restoration Corp., and then launched into a speech peppered with
phrases Kennedy would have appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group is about investing back in people,'' D'Amato said,
his voice rising in volume and pitch. ``It is about fighting to
take back our communities and our homes and our schools, about
empowering youngsters, empowering the community.''
</P>
<P>
   To his critics and supporters alike, this was Alfonse D'Amato
doing what he seems to do best these days: dancing away from a
Republican Party that seems anathema to many New Yorkers, and
surgically slicing at the grand coalition that has sustained New
York's Democratic Party from the days of Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   But a review of D'Amato's most recent term shows that, for all
his shifting on the edges, he remains a fundamentally conservative
politician _ among the most conservative senators the state has had
since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He staunchly opposes abortion and gun control, regularly
advocates tougher penalties for criminals and has rarely met a tax
cut he did not like. He endorsed major portions of Newt Gingrich's
Contract With America in 1995 and hailed the Republican takeover of
Congress as a stinging repudiation of liberalism. And he continues
to receive among the highest ratings in the Northeast from
conservative groups like the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good bet, though, that many New Yorkers are not familiar
with D'Amato's conservative credentials; a recent New York Times
poll showed, for instance, that 71 percent of voters did not know
his position on abortion and only 39 percent considered him a
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   That is largely because for the last three years, facing what he
expected to to be the most difficult re-election campaign of his
career, and recognizing that the conservative revolution of 1994
had fallen precipitously from favor, D'Amato has worked harder than
ever to clothe his conservative core in the gauzier attire of a
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   One of the wiliest pragmatists in Congress, he has done this in
signature D'Amato fashion: grabbing a few, high-profile, emotional
and mostly non-ideological issues that appeal to targeted
constituencies, and then fighting for them in as tenacious, and
showy, a way as possible.
</P>
<P>
   He has championed the cause of breast cancer victims, repeatedly
threatening to hold up legislation on the Senate floor to get what
he wants. He has chided his own majority leader, Trent Lott, for
equating homosexuality with a sin _ and has won the endorsement of
a major gay and lesbian group for his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   He has demanded that Swiss banks release the stolen assets of
Holocaust victims _ and has won accolades within a community that
Democrats consider a fundamental part of their base. And he has
been silent on President Clinton's problems in the Monica Lewinsky
affair, just a few years after he grabbed headlines with his
aggressive investigation of Clinton as chairman of the Senate
Whitewater Committee.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's supporters say he has never been a rigid ideologue and
has always been able to work with Democrats. Indeed, his advisers
say what could make or break his re-election chances is that so
many beneficiaries of his work as ``Senator Pothole'' have been
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Even an old nemesis, former Gov. Mario Cuomo, who was ousted in
1994 by D'Amato's protege, George Pataki, acknowledged that ``when
I asked for help as governor, he was there.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Cuomo added in the next breath, ``There is no question he
will deliver little packages the way old politicians did with bags
of coal in the winter. But we also need an intelligent position on
gun control, on abortion, on helping with education and HMO's and
all of this. And he's nowhere on that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1995 autobiography, ``Power, Pasta and Politics,''
D'Amato, 61, talks of two major movements that shaped his political
thinking: the rise of Barry Goldwater and the Republican Party's
conservative wing in the early 1960s, and the emergence of the bloc
of conservative working-class voters who became known as Reagan
Democrats in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling how he gave out American flags during his 1970
campaign for receiver of taxes in the town of Hempstead in Nassau
County, D'Amato described his attempts to reach those
conservatives: ``I won because patriotism wasn't just a gimmick, it
was something that my generation and my parents' generation knew to
be fundamental about being an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, when he was presiding supervisor of Hempstead,
D'Amato stunned the political world by handily defeating the
state's liberal Republican senator, Jacob Javits, in the primary.
With Javits drawing votes on the Liberal Party line from the
Democratic candidate, Elizabeth Holtzman, D'Amato won the general
election with just 45 percent of the vote, carried along on Ronald
Reagan's coattails.
</P>
<P>
   Under D'Amato's leadership, the state Republican Party proceeded
to oust the moderates who had dominated it for decades, refashioned
itself in his hard-edged image and forged close alliances with the
Conservative and Right to Life Parties, which have endorsed D'Amato
in all his Senate races.

CLINTON PRESSES MIDEAST PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ Continuing the most intensive foreign diplomacy
of his career, President Clinton yesterday shuttled between
clusters of Israeli and Palestinian officials to try to resolve
knotty disputes, including the final stage of a West Bank pullout,
the fate of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and a Palestinian
charter that calls for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Palestinians stepped up their demands for
an end to Jewish settlements on disputed lands, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they reached a breakthrough during bleary-eyed
talks early Thursday, as Israelis and Palestinians tentatively
agreed to American proposals for increasing security in Israel. The
measures included using CIA officers as intermediaries to decide
which Palestinians charged with terrorist acts should be extradited
to Israel, according to those familiar with the heated discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Another sticking point, the plans for a Palestinian airport in
Gaza, was basically resolved, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest of more than 60 hours of face-to-face involvement,
Clinton spent the day discussing and debating fine points of the
agreeement as he alternated between Netanyahu and Arafat and their
aides, officials said. The president turned on the charm, and his
hard sell, as he arrived for his sixth day at the talks on
Maryland's Eastern Shore. ``The hardest decisions now at last are
on the table,'' he told reporters before going to the secluded Wye
Plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Prodding and cajoling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Clinton asked the two sides
to reach an agreement by late last night or early this morning, and
then attend a ceremony at the White House. As the sun went down
over the marshland surrounding the Wye Plantation, State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said the talks had entered a ``fairly
high-intensity'' stage. But ``there's definitely no deal yet,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The White House sees added urgency for a deal because Netanyahu
has talked about flying to Jerusalem or New York before the
Sabbath, which starts at sundown today. In addition, Americans said
they were jolted up by a grenade-throwing terrorist in Israel on
Monday and wanted Netanyahu and Arafat to make a commitment, shake
hands and sign a document before something else disrupts the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, Israeli hard-liners said they would tie up
a new surrender of the West Bank with political chaos if Netanyahu
made concessions to the Palestinians. Hanan Porat, a legislator and
member of the National Religious Party, said the right wing would
bring down Netanyahu's government and force early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to restore an atmosphere of congeniality after a tense
day of brinksmanship Wednesday, Clinton, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and US envoy Dennis Ross took walks through the
woods of the Wye Plantation throughout the day with Israeli and
Palestinian officials in the brisk fall breezes. Adding to the
sense of familiarity, Clinton brought his dog, Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the security agreement were sketchy, but one official
said it includes concessions by Palestinians to cooperate with the
CIA and turn over terrorists to Israeli authorities. In exchange
for the cooperation, Israel will hand over 13 percent more of the
West Bank in several stages during three months.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with his national security team in the morning,
Clinton spoke with Netanyahu while Albright spoke with Arafat.
Clinton talked to Arafat, and then the two Mideast leaders sat on a
couch and held a rare talk _ which Americans called an encouraging
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian delegations sat at different sides of a
cavernous dining room during lunch, but Rubin said officials of the
two groups mixed for talks.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they are not interested in a partial agreement
that leaves major issues to be decided. But they indicated that
some less-important topics had been scuttled for now, including
talks about a seaport that the Palestinians hope to build.
</P>
<P>
   Delegations and lawyers were meeting to decide when Palestinians
will build an airport and seaport and whether Israel will free a
group of Palestinians convicted and accused of terrorism from
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wouldn't have rolled up his sleeves today and
urged the leaders to get down to business if significant gaps did
not remain,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of US Jewish groups urged said they were in touch with
Netanyahu and his staff throughout the day, recommending a peace
pact that included a surrender of 13 percent of the West Bank so
long as Israel feels it will not be exposed to more terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overwhelmingly, the American Jewish community wants the peace
talks to succeed, just as Israelis do, but we know that Israelis
are the ones who pay the price if there isn't security,'' said
Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Hoenlein was one of about 150 leaders who spoke with Netanyahu
on a conference call Wednesday evening after the Israelis packed
their bags and threatened to leave the talks. Netanyahu said the
Palestinians were backtracking on agreements and showing bad faith
by keeping a charter that calls for destroying Israel.
</P>
<P>
   US officials spoke about Netanyahu's threat with a mix of
bemusement and trepidation Thursday. One official noted that as
Albright approached the Israelis' cottage Wednesday, members of the
delegation were placing suitcases on the grass, then removing them
and putting them back _ as if rehearsing the scene of a play.
</P>
<P>
   The peace summit, finishing its eighth day, has lasted twice as
long as planned. Asked how much the US government was paying for
food and lodging for approximately 50 Palestinian and Israeli
guests, Rubin said there was no figure yet. ``I think whatever the
tab is, it will be a small price to pay if we can advance the cause
of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The day started with Israelis and Palestinians reviewing a
20-page document put together by the Americans that outlined the
terms of the deal, especially the Israelis' withdrawal from 13
percent more of the West Bank, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, Clinton was nearing his 70th hour at the talks. He
has already postponed a two-day trip to California to campaign for
Democratic candidates for Congress, and the White House said the
president will stick to his new plan to depart Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's King Hussein arrived at the estate for a second day,
but by the evening he was still confined to a guest cottage, where
he was phoning Arab and Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians said they were demanding the release of thousands
of prisoners as part of this peace deal. They also asked the
Israelis to make a commitment to a further withdrawal from the West
Bank, which is called for in a 1995 peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has resisted talking about further withdrawals,
according to Americans who have spoken with him. ``The number of
issues has been reduced but the issues remaining are substantially
complex,'' Rubin said.

 NEW YORK: Senate races.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In style, D'Amato is only slightly more buttoned down than he
was in those early years. He still screams at aides in his office,
particularly when guests are present, calls men he doesn't know
``buddy'' and ``big guy,'' and kisses women on the hand. The
epithets flow as freely as ever, as evidenced in his calling
Schumer ``putzhead'' during a meeting with Jewish leaders earlier
this week. In public, he is a whirling dervish of energy,
alternately overbearing and charming. ``Hey, Chollie,'' he bellowed
at Rep. Charles Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat, before bear-hugging
him outside the Senate chamber recently.
</P>
<P>
   But if D'Amato's style remains much the same, the political
ground has shifted dramatically beneath him.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's election in 1992 gave new vitality to a more
centrist wing of the Democratic Party. And the rise of the
Christian right created unease among moderate New York Republicans,
many of them suburban voters crucial to D'Amato's political
calculus.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' midterm victory in 1994 seemed to vindicate
D'Amato's more conservative positions, at least briefly.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1996, polls showed that Gingrich and his Contract with
America were deeply unpopular in New York. Bill Clinton trounced
D'Amato's candidate for president, Bob Dole. Mr. D'Amato's role as
chairman of the Whitewater Committee was panned in New York. His
approval ratings plummeted into the low 30s.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, the repositioning of D'Amato was well underway. He
stopped attacking the president _ a trend that continues today,
with D'Amato refusing to condemn Clinton's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky or to take a public position on impeachment. And he seized
on a host of traditionally Democratic issues, from the environment
to reforming health insurance to restoring welfare benefits to
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's supporters argue that his work on many of those issues
was not related to political trends. His efforts on breast cancer,
for instance, began in 1990 when the group ``One in Nine''
approached him about getting federal funds to study the high
incidence of the disease on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   They also note that long before he began hectoring Swiss banks
to release the assets of Holocaust victims, he was a strong
supporter of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And when D'Amato first announced to the world his support for
civil rights for homosexuals _ a floor speech supporting
homosexuals in the military in January 1993 _ he had just won
re-election and was not under political pressure to adopt
Democratic stances, his allies contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a year he could have coasted,'' said an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But to many Democrats, D'Amato's leftward march has been a
cynical, poll-driven effort to rebuild his low approval ratings,
and they contend that he has done the same thing before. They point
to D'Amato's voting record in 1992, when he last ran for
re-election and how then, as now, he often supported positions
advocated by liberal interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, for instance, the AFL-CIO gave D'Amato a relatively
high 70 percent rating. Once re-elected, his labor rating fell to
zero in 1995. In 1992, D'Amato received a 58 percent score from the
League of Conservation Voters, but got zeroes in 1994 and 1996. In
1992, his rating from the Consumer Federation of America was 67
percent. But in 1995, it had fallen to 13 percent. In most of those
cases, D'Amato's low ratings were the result of votes in favor of
portions of the Contract with America.
</P>
<P>
   Though such score cards rarely sway blocs of voters, they are
used by interest groups to decide endorsements. That may be one
reason, analysts say, that for the last three years D'Amato has
been championing high profile issues and bucking his leadership
more often. Indeed, the number of times he voted with the
Republican majority fell from 90 percent in 1995 to 67 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a real feel for how to capitalize on symbolically
important issues to key constituencies,'' said Thomas Mann,
director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, a
policy research organization.
</P>
<P>
   This year, D'Amato voted with the minority to raise the minimum
wage. The vote may have helped prevent the state AFL-CIO, usually a
Democratic bastion, from endorsing Schumer this year, union
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   He also sponsored legislation intended to reduce acid rain and
testified at Senate hearings on the subject last month. The move
won him accolades from a number of conservation groups in the
Adirondacks at a time when other organizations, like the Sierra
Club, were harshly criticizing D'Amato's lifetime environmental
record.
</P>
<P>
   On the Banking Committee, D'Amato has pushed hard for a number
of consumer rights measures, including legislation to prevent
mortgage insurance companies from overcharging customers, and rules
that require banks to make loans in their communities. Those
efforts have helped counter Democratic assertions that he uses the
committee to do favors for banks and securities firms that give him
large campaign contributions, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more pro-consumer than any other Republican on that
committee,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, director of consumer programs for
the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, an advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional experts say D'Amato has never had a major impact
on domestic or foreign policy, or been known for his skills in
writing legislation. But on one thing, many Democrats and
Republicans agree: the senator is a master at getting things out of
the Federal bureaucracy and bringing those things home.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he arrived in Washington, D'Amato became a master of
the appropriations process, which requires a horse trader's sense,
good personal relations and a lot of badgering. He was soon dubbed
Senator Pothole, a title of derision that he now wears as a badge
of honor.
</P>
<P>
   This year, D'Amato helped lead a fight to prevent senators from
the South and West from sharply reducing federal mass transit
spending. Though he was slow to enter the battle, D'Amato's threats
to block a huge highway spending bill and his influence with Sen.
Pete Domenici, chairman of the Budget Committee, helped win a major
increase in New York's transit funding, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of senators from the Northeast who would stop
by and say, 'D'Amato's told us to do this,''' said Domenici,
R-N.M., who is one of D'Amato's closest friends in the Senate.
``D'Amato was ginning up all these guys to talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato resourcefulness also led to one of his major legislative
triumphs: using the Defense budget to finance breast cancer
programs. D'Amato devised the financing scheme, which has provided
$900 million since 1992, to get around the spending restrictions
then in place on other federal departments.
</P>
<P>
   For politicians across the state, D'Amato has become known as
the go-to senator. And in Congress, Democratic officials say
D'Amato always returns their calls promptly. ``I would think a lot
of Democrats would have a difficult time campaigning hard against
D'Amato because of their good relations with him,'' said the chief
of staff to a Democratic member of Congress. ``If you need anything
done, you've got to go to D'Amato. Distasteful or not, you've got
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For a man who has spent much of the last six years attacking,
investigating and trying to unseat the president, there is
something oddly Clintonesque about D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have been the subject of repeated inquiries by Congress
and prosecutors. Both men are considered consummate politicians and
deal makers. And both have had to use every ounce of their
political skills to recover from lapses in judgment.
</P>
<P>
   And like Clinton's detractors, Schumer clearly believes that the
weight of D'Amato's past will bring him down.
</P>
<P>
   Though Schumer has not made ethics a central campaign issue, his
aides are not shy about recounting the senator's past problems. In
1991, the Senate Ethics Committee rebuked the D'Amato for allowing
his brother Armand to write a letter on behalf of a law client on
Senate stationery. In 1992, a Puerto Rican developer was charged
with funneling $32,000 in illegal contributions to his campaign;
the charge was the later dismissed. In 1993, he made a $37,125
profit in one day of stock trades with a firm that had been
repeatedly investigated by securities regulators. In none of those
cases was D'Amato found to have broken any laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Schumer camp also likes to suggest that New Yorkers are
embarrassed by their junior senator, from his singing ``Old
MacDonald had some pork'' during a floor debate in 1994 to his
heavily accented imitation of Lance Ito, the judge in the O.J.
Simpson murder trial, on the Don Imus radio show in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But what D'Amato may have going for him, some Democrats say, is
precisely what Schumer is hoping will be his Achilles heel: people
already know much about him. He has been thoroughly investigated.
His Senate record has been pored over. And, D'Amato's handlers
contend, just enough voters are comfortable with what they see,
warts and all.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, an embattled Alfonse D'Amato will still be
tough to beat, many Democrats acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is not as good as D'Amato,'' said Cuomo. ''D'Amato
swims at the tops of waves.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a mirrored cafe on Palestine Street in Ramallah,
the Palestinian men smoking water pipes, playing cards and talking
politics were deeply wary.
</P>
<P>
   In a sleek coffee bar in the business district of Tel Aviv, the
Israeli young professionals sipping espresso were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   And in a hilltop market in the West Bank town of Ofra, the
Jewish settlers buying diapers were not nearly as alarmed as their
leadership proclaimed them to be.
</P>
<P>
   As peace talks between Yasser Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu
entered their eighth day, Palestinians and Israelis, be they
religious or secular, found themselves in complete accord today on
one thing: Wye was not Oslo in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   A legal agreement signed at the Wye Plantation in Maryland by
two Middle East leaders who deeply mistrust each other would not be
cause for either the panic or the celebration engendered by the
Oslo peace accord in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe anything I hear when every two minutes, they
tell me something else,'' said Gilad Reich, 29, a lawyer in Tel
Aviv. ``Whatever they decide at Wye Plantation, if the attitude is
not one of cooperation, it will not work.''
</P>
<P>
   From Gaza to the Golan, the waiting game has been excruciating,
and excruciatingly boring. During the eight days of talks, as their
leaders hovered between a handshake and a walkout, Israelis and
Palestinians found themselves engaged in speculations trivial and
large: How much did Sara Netanyahu's visit by the hairdresser cost?
Would Ariel Sharon, the new foreign minister, finally consent to
shake Arafat's hand? Would Netanyahu emerge politically
strengthened or weakened by a deal? (The consensus: Strengthened,
with a realigned, centrist constituency.)
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they waited for Wye to be over so they could return to a
daily routine, putting aside their own hopes and anxieties about
the peace effort, which were brought to the surface by the
lengthening talks in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian radio reported with near certainty all
day that an agreement was at hand. Supporters of peace were
reluctant to rejoice, and opponents were hesitant to take to the
streets, although almost everyone said they had wanted movement of
some sort. The 19-month stalemate in talks has been a frustration
for those who wanted some resolution to the issues raised by Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the longer the pregnancy, the more beautiful is the
child,'' said Motti Cohen, 43, the manager of a falafel shop in
Jersualem. ``So apparently it will be a beautiful peace because it
has been so difficult to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Brazil sits opposite the vegetable market on the main
street of Ramallah on the West Bank, and all day long the men come
and go, drinking sweet hot tea and talking of deceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a piece of paper?'' said Abu Othman, 61, a farmer from
a nearby village. ``Netanyahu will not implement anything.''
</P>
<P>
   His cafe companion, Abu Ahmad, 38, a laborer, said: ``When he
returns, he will surrender to the right wing in his coalition. He
wants to gain time now. His goal is to blow up the process.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Oslo accords and after Israeli troops withdrew from
their town, they took to the streets with Palestinian flags. They
whooped and plastered the walls with pictures of Arafat. Then many
experienced unanticipated hardships: They were locked into the
territories by frequent Israeli border closings, denied work
permits, subjected to humiliating harassment at checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were enthusiastic after Oslo until we discovered it meant
very little _ or worse,'' Abu Ashraf, a physical therapist, said as
he dealt a hand of cards. ``But I think anything we get from
Netanyahu will be a victory, because it is like water from a
stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Palestinians said they tried to stifle the hope they feel
when they dream about a state of their own. Steady work, a stable
life and a secure future are the more pragmatic aspirations they
proclaim now. But, at the cafe, when they got talking, they
acknowledged that some things promised in the agreement would
change the lives of many.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past our expectations were very high,'' said Odwan
Nimr, 35, a teacher. ``Arafat talked about our becoming the next
Singapore. Now we will be content with some more land and the small
steps of progress. A Palestinian airport, an industrial park, safe
passage between Gaza and the West Bank, these would be a big deal.
And here we have to put our hopes in the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The cafe owner, Abu Ali, came by and smirked. ``The Americans?''
he said. ``Only Islam can solve our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday morning, the leadership of the Jewish settlers,
anticipating a peace agreement, threw a protest, but not very many
people came. They tried to blockade the roads in the West Bank at
many key junctures by wrapping themselves in prayer shawls and
praying on the highways. But at most crossroads, they were far
outnumbered by the police, and their human fence was so porous that
Palestinians drove their cars right through.
</P>
<P>
   The words of the leaders were harsh. Aharon Domb, the director
of the settlers' umbrella group, called an agreement ``a death
sentence for dozens of settlements, which will be surrounded by the
terrorists of the Palestinian Authority.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mood at a typical settlement, Ofra, a sprawl of
red-roofed homes in the rock hills north of Ramallah, was quite
calm Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I happy? No,'' shrugged Yehuda Wiener, 62, the settlement's
treasurer. ``It's a threat, but people here are strong. They're not
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlers in Ofra, a community of about 2,000 religious Jews
that is a flagship of the settler movement, feel that they have
been down this road before. The watershed moment was after the Oslo
accord was signed, and Israeli troops withdrew from the major
cities in the West Bank. Suddenly, they were traveling to and from
home on newly built roads that bypassed Arab towns, but the rhythm
of their daily lives went unchanged then, as they expect and hope
it will be now.
</P>
<P>
   They are not thrilled. ``If the road connecting us north and
south will be transferred to the Palestinian Authority, life will
be worse,'' Leah Hoffman, 52, a teacher, said as she carried
groceries to her house. ``It won't be pleasant to drive on the
road.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Tali Hass, 25, an English teacher, painted a nightmare
scenario as she pushed a baby stroller through the quiet streets.
``The Arabs will take over land and come and go here as they
please,'' she said. ``There will be shooting on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, like others, she sounded more confused than anything else
by the prospect of a new reality that would startle her
preconceptions. ``How will I be able to trust a Palestinian police
officer?'' she said. ``If he approaches me with a gun, is he
stopping me for speeding? Is he coming to kill me? Or to protect
me?''
</P>
<P>
   Far from Maryland, six shopkeepers pushing retirement age held
their own peace negotiations over a backgammon board in a funky
pedestrian mall in the Nahalat Shiva neighborhood of Jerusalem.
Longtime conversational sparring partners, they knew everyone's
political positions, but no one's last name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ezra, he's a peacenik,'' said Baruch Eliyaz, pushing a chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baruch, he's no Arab lover,'' said Ezra Harel, pushing another
and claiming a conquest.
</P>
<P>
   Harel, 51, a gas station owner, said: ``I'm not political, but
you feel the tension in the air, and enough already. I'm working
with Arabs. I feel their reaction. I want this agreement because
it's better than continuing this way, on the path to explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you about Arabs culturally,'' Eliyaz said to his
friend. ``They go to Washington and pretend they're Western. But
later they never keep their word. The paper they sign is as good as
toilet paper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want then?'' Harel asked. ``You don't want
peace?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want peace,' his friend said. ``I want a cease-fire.''

COMPROMISE ON BUDGET MAY HURT REPUBLICANS   IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The strategy was simple: Hit the pause button on
the Republican revolution, strike a budget deal with the White
House, and avert a high-stakes government shutdown before the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the price of bargaining away key elements of the GOP
conservative agenda in the compromise may be steep for House
Speaker Newt Gingrich and other congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after President Clinton signed the controversial, $520
billion spending package into law, several GOP conservatives
predicted Thursday that Republican congressional leaders could face
serious divisions within their party's ranks as a result of their
election-year gamble to appease the White House by abandoning tax
cuts and other budget initiatives dear to the conservative
movement.
</P>
<P>
   But the most severe fallout is expected to occur when the next
Congress convenes in January. Gingrich, in particular, could suffer
as he tries to retain his speakership and position himself for a
possible presidential candidacy in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has created a huge problem for himself going into the next
Congress,'' said David A. Keene, chairman of the American
Conservative Union. ``He has coasted on the goodwill and the debts
owed him by many members who realize they couldn't have gained a
majority in 1994 without him. That has allowed many sins to be
forgiven. But the outrage over this deal is very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Before lawmakers scrambled away from Capitol Hill this week for
their reelection races, many Republican members foreshadowed the
potential strife by firing parting shots at Gingrich and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, the chief congressional architects of
the spending deal.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative critics said the 4,000-page, 40-pound package
represents a massive capitulation by Republican leaders who were
more concerned about preserving pre-election stability than
standing by their principles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to forgoing a tax cut, GOP leaders agreed to
spending proposals that exceeded last year's budget cap by more
than $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma, who entered the House
with the ``Republican revolution'' class of 1994, was quoted in the
Capitol Hill newspaper, Roll Call, Thursday as saying of the budget
deal: ``How we can call ourselves conservatives after that, I can't
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Largent, a member of the National Football League Hall of Fame,
added, ``I wish I could have negotiated my NFL contracts with this
leaderhsip.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who barely survived a coup attempt last year by GOP
conservatives, faces the likelihood of similar threats in the
future from Largent and other Republicans in the class of 1994.
They have formed a New Conservative Leadership Fund aimed at
electing enough conservatives to wrest control of the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, in a meeting Wednesday with reporters, appeared to be
positioning himself for a possible backlash, indicating he would
pursue the conservative agenda more vigorously next year. ``I think
you can be much bolder in the year immediately after an election,''
Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican strategists said the budget compromise has
enabled GOP leaders to stave off potentially devastating attacks
against them as overseers of a ``do-nothing'' Congress. By agreeing
to fund many of Clinton's top priorities, including $1.1 billion to
hire as many as 100,000 new teachers, Republican leaders also may
have muted criticism that they have blocked efforts by Democrats to
improve public education and address other social problems.
</P>
<P>
   And very few Republican incumbents, if any, are likely to be
turned out of office by conservative voters, particularly when the
opponents are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The budget package passed the House, 333 to 95, and the Senate,
65 to 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're mad at Clinton for pushing the spending and mad at
Gingrich for allowing it, you're going to vote for the candidate
who is saying, `Damn, this budget is too big,' '' said Grover
Norvquist, the head of Americans for Tax Reform. ``And that
candidate is probably going to be one of the Republicans who voted
against the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution and former director of the Congressional Budget Office,
predicted a ``significant backlash'' against Gingrich and the
current budget process in Congress next year because of the
spending deal.
</P>
<P>
   But how much the dynamics change, he said, will depend largely
on whether Republicans expand their slim, 11-seat majority in the
House. ``Unless the Republicans pick up more than 10 seats,''
Reischauer said, ``the House majority is going to remain very
fragile, which will continue to make it difficult for the leaders
to move forward without risking defeat on the floor.''

GETTING TO FIRST BASE IS SURE WAY TO STAY IN YANKEES' GOOD GRACES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Imagine the Yankees without Bernie Williams. No, not
if he leaves as a free agent this winter, but if he had not made
the team at all.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Michael, the Yankees' director of major league scouting,
talked in the aftermath of the team's latest World Series
championship about how that might have happened _ if Williams had
not measured up in a statistic to which the Yankees pay particular
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bernie had a low on-base percentage, he wouldn't be here,''
said Michael, who was the general manager when Williams became a
member of the Yankees. ``He wouldn't have been nearly as appealing.
He wouldn't have been the player we wanted. One of the attractions
about Bernie when he was in the minor leagues was that he was
selective at the plate and he had a high on-base percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about the Yankees this year centered on the number of
victories they were amassing. But the number Michael and other club
executives believe contributed significantly to the team's success
was on-base percentage, a statistic that has always been
overshadowed by batting average.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' high on-base percentage _ at .364, they led the
American League for the second year in a row _ is the result of the
patience they showed at bat all year. It was the part of their game
that attracted the most notice among fellow professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that impresses you most about them is they work a
pitcher,'' San Diego's Tony Gwynn, who knows something about
hitting, said halfway through the World Series. ``They ain't
swinging at nothing. They're not chasing anything. They're going
out there; they're trying to get a pitch they can handle. To me,
that's what they've done really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Working pitchers deep into the count, forcing them to throw more
pitches than they care to, was not a new development with the
Yankees this year. It has been a style and a strategy in the making
since 1990, the year Michael began his second term as general
manager, the year the Yankees decided to seek players with high
on-base percentages.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you score more runs,'' Michael said. ``That's what
prompted it. In 1990, we started switching to get that kind of
player here. We wanted high on-base percentage players. Every
player we acquired after 1990 was a high on-base percentage guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael said the team's hitting coaches in that time, Rick Down
and Chris Chambliss, were told of the Yankees' desire and that they
were to work accordingly with the hitters. The Yankees' minor
league instructors were also indoctrinated in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Michael said that he and Mark Newman, the vice president for
player development, were talking the other day about ``how we
wanted high on-base type players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want players to take pitches,'' Michael said. ``We want
players to become selective.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no mere whim that prompted the Yankees to sign Wade Boggs
as a free agent from the Boston Red Sox before the 1993 season. By
design, he became the team's role model of selectivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boggs rubbed off on a lot of people by working the count,''
Brian Cashman, the current general manager, said. ``That's when our
team really started developing a higher on-base percentage. A lot
of players benefited from Boggs when he was here. I think it's all
contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' on-base percentage for the 1990 season was .300,
lowest in the American League. It improved steadily for the next
four seasons, making a major leap in the season Boggs arrived to
.353, then to a league-leading .374 the next season. The Yankees
have led the league the last two seasons at .362 and .364.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've proven this year we're the most patient,'' Michael said.
</P>
<P>
   A high number of base runners can be a productive substitute for
a big home run hitter, something the Yankees don't have. ``Things
started to fall in place in terms of our team being a high-scoring
team without a 40-home-run-type guy,'' Cashman said. ``It was
because we were a very strong on-base percentage club.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Yankees would reject the big home run hitter. ``If
a guy hits .250 and hits 45 home runs and isn't too high in on-base
percentage, that's OK,'' Michael said, ``but we haven't had that
kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind taking pitches is at least twofold. Obviously,
the more runners a team puts on base, the more runs it has a chance
to score. The Yankees led the major leagues in scoring this season,
with 965 runs. In addition, the more pitches hitters take, the less
of a chance pitchers have to last far into games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming the middle-inning pitching on most teams isn't as
good as the starters,'' Michael said, ``if the starters have to
throw a lot more pitches, by the fifth inning they throw way more
pitches on average than they do against other teams. So they're
going to be out of the game quicker and you're going to get into
their bullpen a lot faster. It's one of the controllable things you
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   When players can't or don't do it, they find themselves playing
elsewhere. Where Bernie Williams has always been selective, Michael
said, that was not so with Gerald Williams, who was once thought to
be a future starter with Bernie in the Yankees' outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that detracted from Gerald,'' Michael said,
``was he wasn't a high on-base percentage guy.'' He was traded in
1996 to the Milwaukee Brewers. Michael recalled that when the
Yankees traded for Tino Martinez three years ago, his good on-base
percentage was one of the attractions. ``If Tino had been a .320
on-base guy, he wouldn't be here,'' Michael said.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman offered a similar assessment of last winter's
acquisitions of Chili Davis and Chuck Knoblauch. ``They get
themselves in hitters' counts,'' the general manager said.
``They're very patient.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees study possible moves this winter, they will do
their homework and scrutinize the column headed OBP.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we looked at last winter, and we'll look at it this
winter,'' Michael said. ``We'll try to keep the players we can.
Bernie's a big cog in that on-base percentage. That's why Bernie's
still here.''
</P>
<P>
   But good on-base percentage or not, for how long?
</P>

PLANTATION DAYS: ALONG WITH HARD TALK, GOLF CARTS AND WHIMSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-RDP, MIDEAST-REACT) 
(gm) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ ``Welcome to Day 8 here at the Wye River Middle
East Peace Conference,'' intoned James Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, with just a hint of the cabin fever that everyone was
beginning to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, pitting the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, against the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, with
Americans as active umpires, had already gone twice as long as
anyone intended. But then exhaustion has always been the real
grease of hard negotiations, and there was ample evidence that
President Clinton's tactic was to keep the two sides cooped up
until they gave in or gave out.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's attempt to foment a crisis by threatening to walk
out on Wednesday seemed only to make it less likely that he or
Arafat could cop out on Thursday. Officials disclosed that
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright had anticipated such a
move, though she did not know whether it would be Netanyahu or
Arafat _ both masters at brinksmanship _ who would try it.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, when asked directly about the onset of cabin
fever, Rubin issued the mandatory denials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think `cabin fever' would be appropriate,'' he said.
``What we've tried to do is create a balance between having people
in the same location _ that is, the Wye River facility _ but not on
top of each other. So the times that they've spent together,
there's a lot of walking that's done _ walking along the river,
walking in the woods _ between the key negotiators, and time to
look out over nice vistas, time to meet in very small rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he talked, Rubin noted, Clinton was meeting with leaders
of the two delegations _ in a large room, ``where there is room to
move around.''
</P>
<P>
   The day's main negotiations, he said at his next briefing, were
in fact in the main dining room, with the supporting cast of
technicians and experts in an adjacent tent. ``It has a little of
the flavor of a legislative session drawing to a close,'' he said,
and quickly warned reporters, ``Don't overinterpret that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rubin's repeated references to the main actors as ``the
president,'' ``the king,'' ``the prime minister,'' or ``the
chairman,'' all moving in and out of ``the Tent,'' evoked the image
of a Mideastern court or bazaar more than a congressional
cloakroom.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the picture of Arabs, Israelis and Americans
wandering two by two among the oaks and sycamores or gazing out
serenely over the Wye River as they pondered how best to bring
peace to their peoples was charming, but not entirely convincing.
Leaks from the ``plantation,'' as the conference center was more
commonly referred to, offered a somewhat different account of how
the delegates spent their time.
</P>
<P>
   In the first days, when time seemed short, many delegates
gravitated in their spare time to a nearby outlet mall. Three
senior Palestinian negotiators, Ahmed Qrei (or Abu Ala), Mahmoud
Abbas (Abu Mazen) and Yasser Abed Rabbo, accompanied by American
bodyguards, were spotted at a men's clothing store. (``Abu'' in
Arabic means ``father of,'' and both names are pseudonyms adopted
by the men in the Palestinian underground.) As they prepared to
leave, a guard leaned over and quietly asked a clerk, ``Now, where
can they buy perfume?''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Abu Ala and Abu Mazen, a Palestinian described an
early photo session at which Ms. Albright posed with the two senior
negotiators, and someone suggested that they form a rock group
called ``Albright and the Two Abus.''
</P>
<P>
   The shopping forays presumably supplied delegates with enough
clothing for the extended stay, though Rubin himself said he had
sent home for fresh shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Though by all accounts walks were taken _ notably when Netanyahu
wanted to brief his new foreign minister, Ariel Sharon _ delegates
said golf carts were the preferred means of cruising around the
1,000-plus-acre complex. According to one report, Arafat took an
extended cruise around the grounds, with American and Palestinian
bodyguards jogging alongside. There were conflicting reports that
Arafat made the tour on a bicycle, but these were deemed inherently
less reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Trying hard to supply reporters' hunger for color, the trade
name for cute tidbits with which to pack the space left open by
lack of real information, spokesmen doled out reports like the one
that Clinton had brought his dog ``Buddy'' to the farm and had
shown him to Arafat. As a rule, dogs are considered unclean beasts
in Islam, but Arafat was said to have appreciated this particular
specimen.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Netanyahu's 49th birthday on Wednesday. The first
to congratulate him was Ms. Albright, who called him at 2:15 a.m.
Though Netanyahu was not yet asleep, he was reportedly taken aback,
and said, ``Is that really why you called?''
</P>
<P>
   But these images of harmony failed to conceal the fact that
there was tension galore. For one thing, the occasional reports
that Arafat and Netanyahu had conferred by phone suggested that
these two, at least, were not yet prepared for regular strolls into
the setting sun.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's first meeting with Netanyahu a week ago, one
official overheard the president say to an aide: ``Might as well
watch the World Series. This isn't going anywhere fast'' _ or words
to that effect.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was also some grousing about the food. Though Rubin
described a mouth-watering menu including rack of lamb, rockfish,
and mango ice, Israelis who did not want to be named reported that
it was not that tasty. Nobody suggested, however, that this was
another American gambit to push the participants to agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Chesapeake College, a community college a couple of miles from
the plantation where reporters kept vigil, also seemed to be
getting a bit weary of the television vans parked on their lawns
and the reporters occupying their theater. A sign reading ``Welcome
to the International Press'' on the front field went down after a
few days, and officials said several events planned for the
theater, which Rubin used for his briefings, had to be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray K. Hoy, the executive vice president of the college,
gamely insisted said that the experience was ``very interesting''
for the student body. ``To host the international press was
certainly the responsible thing to do,'' he said gamely, noting
that the students went out and bought cookies, apples, soda and
fruit for the reporters when they first arrived.

 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent evening, a crowd of elegantly dressed
people, many of them Democrats, gathered at the Hilton Hotel in
Manhattan to honor a Brooklyn housing group founded by one of the
state's most famous liberals, Sen. Robert Kennedy. And there,
seated near the front, was an unlikely guest of honor: Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, the three-term Republican running hard for a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato had just completed another day of attacking his
Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer, as being a Brooklyn
liberal. But this evening, the senator accepted an award for his
work on behalf of the nonpartisan group, the Bedford Stuyvesant
Restoration Corp., and then launched into a speech peppered with
phrases Kennedy would have appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group is about investing back in people,'' D'Amato said,
his voice rising in volume and pitch. ``It is about fighting to
take back our communities and our homes and our schools, about
empowering youngsters, empowering the community.''
</P>
<P>
   To his critics and supporters alike, this was Alfonse D'Amato
doing what he seems to do best these days: dancing away from a
Republican Party that seems anathema to many New Yorkers, and
surgically slicing at the grand coalition that has sustained New
York's Democratic Party from the days of Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   But a review of D'Amato's most recent term shows that, for all
his shifting on the edges, he remains a fundamentally conservative
politician _ among the most conservative senators the state has had
since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He staunchly opposes abortion and gun control, regularly
advocates tougher penalties for criminals and has rarely met a tax
cut he did not like. He endorsed major portions of Newt Gingrich's
Contract With America in 1995 and hailed the Republican takeover of
Congress as a stinging repudiation of liberalism. And he continues
to receive among the highest ratings in the Northeast from
conservative groups like the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good bet, though, that many New Yorkers are not familiar
with D'Amato's conservative credentials; a recent New York Times
poll showed, for instance, that 71 percent of voters did not know
his position on abortion and only 39 percent considered him a
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   That is largely because for the last three years, facing what he
expected to to be the most difficult re-election campaign of his
career, and recognizing that the conservative revolution of 1994
had fallen precipitously from favor, D'Amato has worked harder than
ever to clothe his conservative core in the gauzier attire of a
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   One of the wiliest pragmatists in Congress, he has done this in
signature D'Amato fashion: grabbing a few, high-profile, emotional
and mostly non-ideological issues that appeal to targeted
constituencies, and then fighting for them in as tenacious, and
showy, a way as possible.
</P>
<P>
   He has championed the cause of breast cancer victims, repeatedly
threatening to hold up legislation on the Senate floor to get what
he wants. He has chided his own majority leader, Trent Lott, for
equating homosexuality with a sin _ and has won the endorsement of
a major gay and lesbian group for his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   He has demanded that Swiss banks release the stolen assets of
Holocaust victims _ and has won accolades within a community that
Democrats consider a fundamental part of their base. And he has
been silent on President Clinton's problems in the Monica Lewinsky
affair, just a few years after he grabbed headlines with his
aggressive investigation of Clinton as chairman of the Senate
Whitewater Committee.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's supporters say he has never been a rigid ideologue and
has always been able to work with Democrats. Indeed, his advisers
say what could make or break his re-election chances is that so
many beneficiaries of his work as ``Senator Pothole'' have been
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Even an old nemesis, former Gov. Mario Cuomo, who was ousted in
1994 by D'Amato's protege, George Pataki, acknowledged that ``when
I asked for help as governor, he was there.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Cuomo added in the next breath, ``There is no question he
will deliver little packages the way old politicians did with bags
of coal in the winter. But we also need an intelligent position on
gun control, on abortion, on helping with education and HMO's and
all of this. And he's nowhere on that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1995 autobiography, ``Power, Pasta and Politics,''
D'Amato, 61, talks of two major movements that shaped his political
thinking: the rise of Barry Goldwater and the Republican Party's
conservative wing in the early 1960s, and the emergence of the bloc
of conservative working-class voters who became known as Reagan
Democrats in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling how he gave out American flags during his 1970
campaign for receiver of taxes in the town of Hempstead in Nassau
County, D'Amato described his attempts to reach those
conservatives: ``I won because patriotism wasn't just a gimmick, it
was something that my generation and my parents' generation knew to
be fundamental about being an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, when he was presiding supervisor of Hempstead,
D'Amato stunned the political world by handily defeating the
state's liberal Republican senator, Jacob Javits, in the primary.
With Javits drawing votes on the Liberal Party line from the
Democratic candidate, Elizabeth Holtzman, D'Amato won the general
election with just 45 percent of the vote, carried along on Ronald
Reagan's coattails.
</P>
<P>
   Under D'Amato's leadership, the state Republican Party proceeded
to oust the moderates who had dominated it for decades, refashioned
itself in his hard-edged image and forged close alliances with the
Conservative and Right to Life Parties, which have endorsed D'Amato
in all his Senate races.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In style, D'Amato is only slightly more buttoned down than he
was in those early years. He still screams at aides in his office,
particularly when guests are present, calls men he doesn't know
``buddy'' and ``big guy,'' and kisses women on the hand. The
epithets flow as freely as ever, as evidenced in his calling
Schumer ``putzhead'' during a meeting with Jewish leaders earlier
this week. In public, he is a whirling dervish of energy,
alternately overbearing and charming. ``Hey, Chollie,'' he bellowed
at Rep. Charles Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat, before bear-hugging
him outside the Senate chamber recently.
</P>
<P>
   But if D'Amato's style remains much the same, the political
ground has shifted dramatically beneath him.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's election in 1992 gave new vitality to a more
centrist wing of the Democratic Party. And the rise of the
Christian right created unease among moderate New York Republicans,
many of them suburban voters crucial to D'Amato's political
calculus.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' midterm victory in 1994 seemed to vindicate
D'Amato's more conservative positions, at least briefly.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1996, polls showed that Gingrich and his Contract with
America were deeply unpopular in New York. Bill Clinton trounced
D'Amato's candidate for president, Bob Dole. Mr. D'Amato's role as
chairman of the Whitewater Committee was panned in New York. His
approval ratings plummeted into the low 30s.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, the repositioning of D'Amato was well underway. He
stopped attacking the president _ a trend that continues today,
with D'Amato refusing to condemn Clinton's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky or to take a public position on impeachment. And he seized
on a host of traditionally Democratic issues, from the environment
to reforming health insurance to restoring welfare benefits to
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's supporters argue that his work on many of those issues
was not related to political trends. His efforts on breast cancer,
for instance, began in 1990 when the group ``One in Nine''
approached him about getting federal funds to study the high
incidence of the disease on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   They also note that long before he began hectoring Swiss banks
to release the assets of Holocaust victims, he was a strong
supporter of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And when D'Amato first announced to the world his support for
civil rights for homosexuals _ a floor speech supporting
homosexuals in the military in January 1993 _ he had just won
re-election and was not under political pressure to adopt
Democratic stances, his allies contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a year he could have coasted,'' said an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But to many Democrats, D'Amato's leftward march has been a
cynical, poll-driven effort to rebuild his low approval ratings,
and they contend that he has done the same thing before. They point
to D'Amato's voting record in 1992, when he last ran for
re-election and how then, as now, he often supported positions
advocated by liberal interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, for instance, the AFL-CIO gave D'Amato a relatively
high 70 percent rating. Once re-elected, his labor rating fell to
zero in 1995. In 1992, D'Amato received a 58 percent score from the
League of Conservation Voters, but got zeroes in 1994 and 1996. In
1992, his rating from the Consumer Federation of America was 67
percent. But in 1995, it had fallen to 13 percent. In most of those
cases, D'Amato's low ratings were the result of votes in favor of
portions of the Contract with America.
</P>
<P>
   Though such score cards rarely sway blocs of voters, they are
used by interest groups to decide endorsements. That may be one
reason, analysts say, that for the last three years D'Amato has
been championing high profile issues and bucking his leadership
more often. Indeed, the number of times he voted with the
Republican majority fell from 90 percent in 1995 to 67 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a real feel for how to capitalize on symbolically
important issues to key constituencies,'' said Thomas Mann,
director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, a
policy research organization.
</P>
<P>
   This year, D'Amato voted with the minority to raise the minimum
wage. The vote may have helped prevent the state AFL-CIO, usually a
Democratic bastion, from endorsing Schumer this year, union
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   He also sponsored legislation intended to reduce acid rain and
testified at Senate hearings on the subject last month. The move
won him accolades from a number of conservation groups in the
Adirondacks at a time when other organizations, like the Sierra
Club, were harshly criticizing D'Amato's lifetime environmental
record.
</P>
<P>
   On the Banking Committee, D'Amato has pushed hard for a number
of consumer rights measures, including legislation to prevent
mortgage insurance companies from overcharging customers, and rules
that require banks to make loans in their communities. Those
efforts have helped counter Democratic assertions that he uses the
committee to do favors for banks and securities firms that give him
large campaign contributions, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more pro-consumer than any other Republican on that
committee,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, director of consumer programs for
the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, an advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional experts say D'Amato has never had a major impact
on domestic or foreign policy, or been known for his skills in
writing legislation. But on one thing, many Democrats and
Republicans agree: the senator is a master at getting things out of
the Federal bureaucracy and bringing those things home.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he arrived in Washington, D'Amato became a master of
the appropriations process, which requires a horse trader's sense,
good personal relations and a lot of badgering. He was soon dubbed
Senator Pothole, a title of derision that he now wears as a badge
of honor.
</P>
<P>
   This year, D'Amato helped lead a fight to prevent senators from
the South and West from sharply reducing federal mass transit
spending. Though he was slow to enter the battle, D'Amato's threats
to block a huge highway spending bill and his influence with Sen.
Pete Domenici, chairman of the Budget Committee, helped win a major
increase in New York's transit funding, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of senators from the Northeast who would stop
by and say, 'D'Amato's told us to do this,''' said Domenici,
R-N.M., who is one of D'Amato's closest friends in the Senate.
``D'Amato was ginning up all these guys to talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato resourcefulness also led to one of his major legislative
triumphs: using the Defense budget to finance breast cancer
programs. D'Amato devised the financing scheme, which has provided
$900 million since 1992, to get around the spending restrictions
then in place on other federal departments.
</P>
<P>
   For politicians across the state, D'Amato has become known as
the go-to senator. And in Congress, Democratic officials say
D'Amato always returns their calls promptly. ``I would think a lot
of Democrats would have a difficult time campaigning hard against
D'Amato because of their good relations with him,'' said the chief
of staff to a Democratic member of Congress. ``If you need anything
done, you've got to go to D'Amato. Distasteful or not, you've got
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For a man who has spent much of the last six years attacking,
investigating and trying to unseat the president, there is
something oddly Clintonesque about D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have been the subject of repeated inquiries by Congress
and prosecutors. Both men are considered consummate politicians and
deal makers. And both have had to use every ounce of their
political skills to recover from lapses in judgment.
</P>
<P>
   And like Clinton's detractors, Schumer clearly believes that the
weight of D'Amato's past will bring him down.
</P>
<P>
   Though Schumer has not made ethics a central campaign issue, his
aides are not shy about recounting the senator's past problems. In
1991, the Senate Ethics Committee rebuked the D'Amato for allowing
his brother Armand to write a letter on behalf of a law client on
Senate stationery. In 1992, a Puerto Rican developer was charged
with funneling $32,000 in illegal contributions to his campaign;
the charge was the later dismissed. In 1993, he made a $37,125
profit in one day of stock trades with a firm that had been
repeatedly investigated by securities regulators. In none of those
cases was D'Amato found to have broken any laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Schumer camp also likes to suggest that New Yorkers are
embarrassed by their junior senator, from his singing ``Old
MacDonald had some pork'' during a floor debate in 1994 to his
heavily accented imitation of Lance Ito, the judge in the O.J.
Simpson murder trial, on the Don Imus radio show in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But what D'Amato may have going for him, some Democrats say, is
precisely what Schumer is hoping will be his Achilles heel: people
already know much about him. He has been thoroughly investigated.
His Senate record has been pored over. And, D'Amato's handlers
contend, just enough voters are comfortable with what they see,
warts and all.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, an embattled Alfonse D'Amato will still be
tough to beat, many Democrats acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is not as good as D'Amato,'' said Cuomo. ''D'Amato
swims at the tops of waves.''

DAVID WALKER: HANDS-ON MANAGER TO HAVE HIGH PROFILE AT AUDITING
AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (dl) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just before adjourning this week, the Senate
approved a 47-year-old accountant for one of the government's most
powerful and important positions: comptroller general of the United
States, the chief auditor of all federal programs, contracts and
operations.
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, the official, David Walker, will be head of the
General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress that
sooner or later infuriates almost every senior official by exposing
waste, fraud, incompetence or plain silliness in remote corners of
government.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, a partner and managing director in the Atlanta office of
Arthur Andersen LLP, will be only the seventh comptroller general,
a job that carries a 15-year term and an exceptional degree of
independence. Walker differs from his predecessors in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   He seems likely to have a higher profile than most other heads
of the GAO, who were anonymous, somewhat aloof and virtually
unknown outside Washington. Friends and associates say Walker is a
hands-on manager, deeply engaged in any project he undertakes. He
is likely to be a strong advocate for the solutions he recommends,
especially in his areas of expertise, which include Social
Security, Medicare, pension policy and employee benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Nadel, another partner at Arthur Andersen, said that
congressional leaders, who helped select Walker, probably ``don't
know what they're getting themselves into.'' And he explained:
</P>
<P>
   ``David is not your typical CPA. He's not a paper-pusher. He
doesn't just go with the flow. He definitely speaks his mind. He
makes things happen. He's always looking at the big picture. He's a
very strong influencer of policy. He's done this within our firm
and with clients. He helps you make changes. He's a mover and
shaker. He will have a lot to say about the cost and financing of
Social Security, as well as other programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker has led the expansion of Arthur Andersen's work as a
consultant on human resources issues. The firm's revenues for such
work have increased to $250 million this year, from $10 million in
1989, he said. Clients include Lockheed Martin, Nationsbank and
Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Nadel said that Walker typically becomes ``the focal point of
any meeting: When he speaks, people stop and listen because his
views are so well reasoned.'' He described Walker as ``a tremendous
networker,'' who developed a huge number of useful contacts in
government and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers said Walker had turned down more than a few lucrative
assignments because he saw conflicts of interest or other ethical
problems with the work.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Walker volunteered this insight into
his values: ``The two presidents I identify with the most are Teddy
Roosevelt and John Kennedy. Both were conservative on economic
policy, but they were also progressive on social policy. That's
basically where I'm at, from a philosophical standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1976 to 1997, Walker said, he was a moderate Republican.
Before that, he was a conservative Democrat. And since last year,
he has been an independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it became evident that I was a leading candidate for
comptroller general, I felt it was important to become independent
in mind, action and word,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller general is paid $136,700 a year, about one-sixth
of what Walker makes at Arthur Andersen. The GAO has 3,300
employees (down from 5,300 in 1992) and an annual budget of $363
million. It prescribes accounting standards for all federal
agencies, passes judgment on the legality of federal spending and
evaluates hundreds of government programs each year.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The office of comptroller general has been vacant since October
1996, when Charles Bowsher stepped down. During his 15-year term,
Bowsher sounded early warnings about the savings and loan crisis,
investigated the 1987 stock market collapse and exposed scandals at
the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who is registered as an investment adviser in several
states, appears well prepared for issues likely to dominate his
tenure. From 1990 to 1995, he was one of two public trustees of the
Social Security and Medicare trust funds. In that role, he
submitted annual reports to Congress describing the programs'
financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he has written a book explaining how to plan for
retirement (``Retirement Security,'' John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1997). And
he has worked with clients, including a major telecommunications
company, to solve problems in their pension plans, showing them how
they can provide better benefits at little or no additional cost.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford G. Ross, the Democratic representative on the board of
trustees, said that Walker was ``an excellent choice'' to head the
accounting office. ``I don't think they could have gotten anybody
better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said that he and Walker ``did everything on a bipartisan _
indeed, nonpartisan _ basis'' while they were trustees. ``Dave has
tremendous energy,'' Ross said. ``He's a man on the move, but
always available when you need him.''
</P>
<P>
   David Michael Walker was born on Oct. 2, 1951, in Birmingham,
Ala. His family lived in Birmingham, Tuscaloosa, Selma and Mobile,
Ala., before moving to Coral Gables, Fla., when he was in the
seventh grade. His father, David Sellers Walker Jr., worked for
Southern Bell, eventually as head of governmental affairs in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Walker received a B.S. degree in accounting from
Jacksonville University in Florida in 1973. He was a 19-year-old
sophomore when he married Mary Etheredge, who was then a senior.
``Dave was instantly a husband and had a future to think about,''
his brother Steven recalled. ``He was very conservative as a
student, sticking to the books and focusing on his goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple has two children, Carol, 24, and Andrew, 21.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Walker worked at two big accounting firms,
Price Waterhouse and Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, and then at an executive
recruiting firm. From 1983 to 1989, he worked in government. For
two years, he was a senior official of the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp., which insures private pension plans. He then moved to the
Labor Department, where he became the assistant secretary in charge
of regulating pension and health benefits for workers and retirees
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   When he advises clients as a management consultant, Walker
emphasizes one message above all others: Smart personnel practices
enhance the value of a company and its stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given labor shortages, skill gaps and demographic trends,'' he
said, ``the real winners in the 21st century will have to put a
higher priority on their employees and invest more in human
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   In a book published this month (``Delivering on the Promise,''
Free Press), Walker and two partners at Arthur Andersen say that
``capitalism has not achieved its full potential'' because many
employers underestimate the importance of human capital _ the
talents and skills of their employees.

<P>
   Joe Torre was eating a late dinner with his wife, Ali, on a
brisk night in San Diego last Tuesday when a question that he has
occasionally pondered sneaked up on him again. Torre spoke the
words softly and simply across the table: why me?
</P>
<P>
   Torre was trying to understand why he had been selected to
manage the Yankees three years ago, when it looked as if his
managerial career had died forever. He wanted to figure out why he
had flourished under George Steinbrenner's regime to coolly
chaperone the Yankees to greatness. He had to decipher what he had
done to deserve this delightful opportunity and the even more
delightful results. Why me?
</P>
<P>
   The same question nagged Torre after the Yankees silenced the
Padres, 3-0, Wednesday night for their second World Series
championship in three seasons, and he joined the giddy players in a
celebration on the field. One by one, every player hugged Torre and
thanked him. Torre was startled. That was supposed to be his line.
Why were the players thanking him? Again, why me? Torre took in
their gracious words and wept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone seems to think that I've paid my dues and I have it
coming, but I don't see it that way,'' he said. ``I've been really
lucky. I wonder why it's happened to me. I feel very fortunate with
all that's happened. People who know me don't give it a second
thought. I'll rely on their opinions, but knowing that this is all
the product of hard work keeps me working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the calm leader of the Yankees, the 58-year-old New Yorker
who returned home in 1996 against the advice of his brother, Frank,
to find his own version of baseball nirvana in the South Bronx. In
a mature and simple way, Torre presided over a team that won an
astounding 125 games this season and nurtured his players so that
every game was just as pivotal as the last game they played on
Wednesday at Qualcomm Stadium. Sometimes, it sounds so easy. It
only appears that way because Torre, his rugged face usually as
expressionless as a mannequin's, makes it look that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's perfect for this city because he makes everything seem
like it's not that big of a deal,'' General Manager Brian Cashman
said. ``No matter how tough the situation is, he makes it seem like
it's not that tough. Joe's done everything in this game. When
you're looking for leadership, he's the guy you look at. He's been
down every road, so everyone can relate to him because he's been
everyone at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Torre really everyone? Steinbrenner, who barreled through a
crowd of reporters in a soggy clubhouse Wednesday night to embrace
Torre, believes so. With guile and guts, Torre has fostered a
successful relationship with Steinbrenner, the team's principal
owner, and will sign a contract extension soon. No publicized
spats? Billy Martin would be bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a New Yorker and he's a battler,'' Steinbrenner said.
``He understands New York and he understands people. He exudes that
feeling. The players respect him. He's a great manager, the best
I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   There was always something comforting about the way Torre
carried himself this season, from the first day of spring training
when he called the Yankees ``a special team'' to the final out of
Game 4 when he called them ``the best team in my lifetime.'' His
players noticed Torre's demeanor and fed off of his tranquil
disposition. If Joe looked relaxed, then everything must be
copacetic, they figured. Usually, it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get rattled,'' Don Zimmer, the bench coach, said.
``If he has something to say, he'll say it. If you don't like
playing for Joe Torre, you better get yourself checked out. That's
the best way I can put it.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre could have panicked when the Yankees started the season
1-4, but that did not happen and a team meeting followed by a 22-2
streak solved any woes. Torre had Tim Raines, Chad Curtis and
Darryl Strawberry vying for at-bats in left field and at designated
hitter, but he spread the playing time around and convinced each
player of his importance to the team, so no one groused.
</P>
<P>
   Torre could have had a delicate time keeping the Yankees focused
after they sprinted out to a 15-game lead by July, but they played
with passion every day. The Yankees did it to chase history, but
they also did it because of Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the epitome of what a manager should be,'' Chili Davis
said. ``It's not about making moves, or running out there and being
noticed, or saying I did this or did that. He took 25 players and,
whatever he said to us, he made us all want to go out and bust our
butts for him. To me, when you're going to manage a major league
team, that's the key. You got to have 25 players who want to die
for you. That's exactly what Joe did.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The manager is no fool. Torre, who waited 4,268 games as a
player and manager to get to his first World Series in 1996, knew
what was unfolding, and he carefully watched the daily effort from
a team that could have easily taken a vacation this September. It
inspired him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see that this has lasted for three years, for guys to play
hard, sort of puts an exclamation point on what you think is the
right thing to do,'' Torre said. ``No manager can feel any better
than when he doesn't have to worry about if his ball club is going
to be ready to play. These guys never took a day off.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre would not let them. The intensity of trying to validate a
114-victory regular season placed tremendous pressure on the
Yankees because they were expected to win, but Torre never let
these concerns show. While he worried that people ``would look
sideways'' at these special Yankees if they collapsed before a
title, the always unflappable Torre remained always unflappable to
his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I show them honesty and I trust them, and I just ask the same
in return,'' he said. ``It's not always going to be wonderful, but,
this sounds pretty corny, it's togetherness. If we win, we win. If
we lose, we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre abhors team meetings; he favors casual one-on-one sessions
by the player lockers. The manager questioned David Wells'
conditioning after a terrible start in May and then met with him to
discuss the pitcher's approach. Wells tossed a perfect game two
weeks later and was the Yankees' best pitcher for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a player's manager,'' Wells explained. ``We had two
rules: play hard and be on time. You know what? He never said
anything else. That's what makes him one heck of a manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez, another sensitive sort, had his mind massaged by
Torre, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe is awesome, man,'' Martinez said. ``He knows how to handle
guys for six months when you're struggling or playing well. He's a
very calm manager who gets the most out of his players. He's the
best manager I've ever played for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the rookie Ricky Ledee, who actually thanked the manager
for starting him in the World Series, added: ``He doesn't say much,
but, when he does, everyone listens. I've seen him for just two
months, but he's the best manager I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The best manager for the Yankees was thinking about that nagging
question again: why me? Ali Torre finally responded to it in the
restaurant on Tuesday. She told Joe that he was a true leader. She
told him she was proud of him because he motivated his talented
players and they needed that from him. She told him that was why he
was picked to manage them. Why me? That is why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with Joe for 17 years,'' she said. ``We've been on a
lot of losing teams. It's kind of overwhelming. It's such an
exciting time. You want to pinch yourself. That's why he asked
himself that. You wonder why.''
</P>
<P>
   Why me? The question still hounded Torre on Wednesday night. But
it was late and the Champagne and cigars were waiting, so Torre
poked at the simple yet complex question. Why me?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the good Lord didn't think I could appreciate all of it
before now,'' he said. ``I know one thing. After doing this the
first time, you really want to do it again. This was even sweeter
the second time. This was great.'' &QL;

LAWYER'S CRUSADE ENDS IN MAN'S LIBERATION FROM PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEARNY, N.J. _ Do not be deceived by Priscilla Read Chenoweth's
sweet manner, the dust on her resume, the spectacles on her nose or
her matronly appearance. Do not dismiss this 68-year-old widow as
some kind of amateur Angela Lansbury with a law degree.
</P>
<P>
   That is what prosecutors did seven years ago, Mrs. Chenoweth
believes, when she decided to try and save a stranger who she
believed had been wrongly convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought, `Here's that old grandma and her bleeding
heart,''' she recalled this week during an interview in her home
here.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Luis Kevin Rojas, Mrs. Chenoweth's cause and
crusade since 1991, an aspiring engineer who had spent a third of
his life in prison or on trial for a murder he swore he did not
commit, was freed for good, in large part because of her singular
persistence.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-week trial in state Supreme Court in New York City,
a jury acquitted Rojas of charges that, at age 18, he provided the
gun used in the 1990 shooting death of another teen-ager on the
streets of Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1991, after reading an account of the case in a New
Jersey newspaper, Mrs. Chenoweth spent much of her savings and many
of her days, nights, weekends and vacations chugging up legal hills
for Rojas. Mrs. Chenoweth, a lawyer who gave up her practice to
become an editor at The New Jersey Law Journal, smelled injustice
in a jury verdict that year that sent Rojas, a high school senior
with no prior record, to prison.
</P>
<P>
   So from the tiny cluttered study of her red-brick home here,
aided by her daughter, her sister and three retired detectives, she
set out to reinvestigate the crime and prove it was a case of
mistaken identity. She read transcripts, filed motions, interviewed
witnesses, enlisted the help of three dozen lawyers and ultimately
spent $50,000 of her own ``old age'' money _ more than a year's
salary.
</P>
<P>
   Before she was through, Mrs. Chenoweth and her team of paid
professionals and conscripted volunteers established an alibi for
Rojas: He was half a mile away at the time of the shooting. In
1995, they succeeded in getting the original conviction overturned.
And with the acquittal in the retrial state Supreme Court, they
rolled back the rest of the stone.
</P>
<P>
   For this effort, Mrs. Chenoweth has received all the
compensation she ever wanted _ thanks and affection from Rojas,
flowers from his family, and, perhaps most important to her, the
respect of all those high-priced lawyers she prodded into working
with her.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that, in this case, all those noble adages of
American jurisprudence, like ``justice will prevail,'' only proved
true because of Mrs. Chenoweth. Without her, they said, Luis Rojas
would still be working the sanitation detail at the Coxsackie
Correctional Facility, near Albany, N.Y., just halfway through his
15-year-to-life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the system worked,'' said Jethro Eisenstein, the lawyer
who donated his services and won Rojas' acquittal. ``But it only
worked because of Priscilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Even her adversary, Peter Kougasian, an assistant district
attorney, was impressed. ``I have never seen anyone pour their
heart and soul into an effort like this for a stranger,''
Eisenstein said he told him.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chenoweth said she became involved because it was obvious
to her that Rojas, a stable student with no history of violence,
was incapable of playing a role in a murder. Even though the murder
victim's family still believes that Rojas played a part, Mrs.
Chenoweth said his involvement just never made sense to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no record, no gang, nice friends,'' she said. ``They
were all going to college or were skilled technical workers. He had
a reputation for peaceableness.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred just after 2 a.m. on Nov. 18, 1990, when
two groups of teen-agers tussled on lower Broadway, near Waverly
Place. One teen-ager in a Day-Glo orange, reversible jacket pulled
out a gun, shot into the air, then passed the weapon to another
youth in a green jacket, who fired at the other teen-agers as they
fled. Javier Bueno, a 19-year-old planning to attend New York
University, was shot in the neck and died three weeks later. Rudy
Quesada, 17, was shot in the leg. The shooter, the youth in the
green jacket, has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, from Union City, N.J., was spotted by police several
minutes later in the nearby PATH station on West Ninth Street. He
was wearing a similar Day-Glo jacket, but the orange side had been
turned inside out. One of the friends of the youths who were shot
was brought to the station and identified Rojas, now wearing the
jacket orange side out, as the youth who had supplied the gun.
Police then brought Rojas to the crime scene, where other friends
of the victims identified him.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest shocked Rojas' friends at Emerson High School in
Weehawken, N.J., where 150 students wrote letters to the judge in
the case on his behalf. Though he had once taken a car without
permission and had been caught hopping a turnstile, Rojas was
viewed as a gentle soul, someone who counseled his peers on the
dangers of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas told police that on the night of the shootings, he had
been at a nearby restaurant with a friend and was returning home to
New Jersey when he was arrested. He said he had reversed his jacket
to wear the burgundy side out because he did not want it to get
dirty. That was the way he usually wore it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But police had seven witnesses who said Rojas was involved and
they did not believe his account.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chenoweth and her team would later undermine the
reliability of those identifications. Several witnesses had been
drinking or only picked out Rojas after seeing him in handcuffs.
The defense team contended that since police had Rojas wear the
jacket with the orange side out, the sight of him in custody, in
the jacket, within minutes of the shootings, overpowered the
ability of those distraught witnesses to make a reliable
identification.
</P>
<P>
   One of the witnesses identified someone else in the PATH station
that night as also having been involved in the shooting. But that
person turned out to have an ironclad alibi.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The police lineup the next morning was also stacked against
Rojas, Mrs. Chenoweth's team asserted. The ``fillers'' in the
lineup were well-rested, clean-shaven police cadets with crew cuts.
Rojas had medium-length hair and had been up all night.
</P>
<P>
   Few of these apparent holes in the evidence were brought forward
during Rojas' first trial, which ended in 1991 with a jury
convicting him of second-degree murder. The defense mounted by his
lawyer for that case, David Fronefield, was later derided by the
Appellate Division. ``It almost appears, at times, that Fronefield
acted as a second prosecutor,'' the appellate panel wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At home in New Jersey, Mrs. Chenoweth read an article about the
case in a local newspaper at her daughter's suggestion. She focused
on a statement from one of Rojas' teachers, who said the
teen-ager's involvement was simply impossible. Something moved her
to speak to the teacher and members of Rojas' family. Within weeks,
Mrs. Chenoweth was off to meet Rojas himself at Rikers Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear to me that it was a gross injustice,'' she said.
``The legal system had harmed this man, and the legal system should
right the wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chenoweth had some history at trying to right wrongs. She
had been involved in the civil rights movement for many years and
was arrested in New Jersey in 1963 for sitting down in front of a
truck to protest the lack of construction jobs for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But it had been 17 years since the mother of three and
grandmother of five had practiced law, a career she left because
``the money was a little erratic and I wasn't terribly good at
business.''
</P>
<P>
   While rusty, she did not lack for confidence. After all, she was
the daughter of a Harvard-educated stockbroker so convinced of his
abilities that he used to write corrections in the margins of the
encyclopedia. Still, she had only practiced for six years _ 1968 to
1974 _ and in that time, she had done only a smattering of criminal
cases, most of them misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd had court experience,'' she recalled, ``but never a jury
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, nonetheless, liked her from the very start. ``She really
believed in me,'' he said early this week in Eisenstein's Manhattan
law office..
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, whose mother had died while he was in prison, came to
rely on Mrs. Chenoweth for emotional support. He sent her cards on
Mother's Day. She told him to cut his hair. She carried a sport
coat in her briefcase for him to wear in court and worked to
persuade experienced lawyers to get involved in his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, I only saw myself as a conduit,'' she said, but
she ended up doing a lot of the legal work herself. She also heard
about a selfless retired New York City police detective who tried
to crack unsolved murders. Soon, Denis O'Sullivan, was part of her
team, putting up his own house to secure Rojas' $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Another retired police officer, Mike O'Connor, found a critical
witness _ a PATH police sergeant, John Apel. The sergeant
remembered that on the night of the crime, he had watched Rojas
just miss a train as it left the station. Research showed that the
train departed that night no later than 2:03 a.m. That meant Rojas
could not have been involved in the dispute on Broadway, a
half-mile away, at 2:07 a.m., when the shooting started.
</P>
<P>
   When Rojas' appeals lawyer, Tina Mazza, introduced this evidence
to the Appellate Division in 1995, it overturned the conviction,
citing as well ineffective counsel by his original lawyer and the
tainted identifications.
</P>
<P>
   After more than four years in prison, Rojas was out on bail. But
prosecutors decided to retry him. Their reasoning: The witnesses, a
solid, stable group of college students, still believed Rojas was
the man in the orange jacket who helped kill their friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also had circumstantial evidence,'' said Barbara Thompson,
a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, ``so we decided
to let the jury decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision made Mrs. Chenoweth's blood boil. ``They were not
interested in justice. They were interested in securing and keeping
a conviction,'' she said. ``It's like a pride of lions giving up a
kill.''
</P>
<P>
   The families of the victims applauded the move, however. They
still believe Rojas was involved. ``I think he got away with a big
lie,'' said Jose Bueno, whose brother was killed. ``Seven people
saw him pull out the gun. Luis Rojas will have to live with that
for his whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   For the retrial, Mrs. Chenoweth persuaded Eisenstein, a former
criminal defense lawyer, to try the case for nothing. Their
relationship was close but difficult. Mrs. Chenoweth liked to
second-guess. ``She had some loony ideas about what the rules of
evidence allowed,'' he said. But if he mentioned that, he
remembered, ``she would say to me, `Well, it's my loony ideas that
got Kevin this far.'''
</P>
<P>
   At that trial, Apel's alibi testimony was critical. Another
witness, William Davis, said he had told the police on the night of
the shootings that Rojas was the wrong man. The man in the orange
jacket had had a ponytail and was built like a body builder. Rojas
was 5-foot-7 and weighed all of 125 pounds. Jurors noted that there
was no finding of gunpowder on Rojas' jacket, and the witnesses'
accounts about who had done what during the shooting began to
conflict on cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the jury deliberated 24 hours before coming back with a
verdict: Not guilty on all counts. Mrs. Chenoweth and Eisenstein
wept. Rojas, who is now working as a construction laborer, smiled
and began thinking about how to get his orange jacket back. He
wants to wear it again, a final symbol of vindication. ``It's my
jacket,'' he said plainly. ``I didn't commit any crime in it.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Mrs. Chenoweth took the train home to New Jersey, by
herself, had dinner with her daughter and started fielding phone
calls. People have been asking her now to get involved in another
case of someone they say was wrongly accused.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Chenoweth has a heart condition, asthma and a family
that believes she cannot handle the strain of another crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have taken a blood oath,'' Mrs. Chenoweth said, with obvious
reluctance, ``that I will not get involved in any more.''

MANY AMERICANS ARE IN MEXICAN JAILS ON GUN CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Ohio, Texas, Ala., N.M.)  (lb)

<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico _ Johnny Manuel sat in the interview room
at the Centro de Readaptacion Social Para Adultas, a dusty and
sun-bleached prison at the foot of the Sierra de Juarez, telling
his story in the bitter monotone of a man who has seen his
nightmares grow bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you've been swallowed up by a big monster,'' said
Manuel, a slight man in a loose-fitting hunting cap who drew
hungrily on one menthol cigarette after another. ``I made a bad,
bad mistake. Ruined my whole damn life, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel said his mistake was inadvertently crossing an
international bridge while looking for a parking space _ with three
guns belonging to his fiancee, a prison guard, in his car. He has
been in this Juarez prison for nearly eight months, barely cracking
the five-year sentence he drew for arms smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel, a 49-year-old butcher from Lake Charles, La., is one of
78 U.S. citizens who are in Mexican jails after being arrested this
year on arms charges. Seventy-two of them were arrested at or near
the border and most, U.S. officials say, were apparently guilty of
simple blunders.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Albanese, 24, and William Patterson, 25, friends from
Ohio who were on a rattlesnake and coyote hunting trip to West
Texas, said they, too, found themselves on the Mexican side of the
border, with their hunting guns, before they could turn around.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Brown, 48, was leading 15 members of his family in two
rented vans from Birmingham, Ala., to Oakland, Calif., when he said
he made a wrong turn and ended up on a bridge he did not intend to
cross, with a shotgun and a World War II rifle. James Gray was
taking his family camping in New Mexico when he decided to visit
Juarez for a Mexican dinner, not thinking about the 9-mm pistol in
his vehicle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent case, five Louisiana men in their late teens
and early 20s, including two members of the University of
Southwestern Louisiana football team, were arrested at an
international crossing in Nuevo Laredo on Oct. 10 while on a South
Texas hunting trip.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on both sides of the border are debating the reasons _
from lenient gun laws in Texas to overzealousness by Mexican
authorities _ but the arrests have caused enough concern that the
issue was raised in talks in June between the U.S. secretary of
state and her Mexican counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 135 Americans have been arrested this year on firearms
charges. Fifty-seven were released on bond, had their charges
dropped or were convicted and sent back to the United States as
part of a prisoner-exchange program. The rest, like Manuel, sit in
crowded Mexican jails and count the seconds.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not simply having guns. The same charges that apply to
possession of a weapon also apply to possession of ammunition, and
some U.S. citizens have been jailed for having anywhere from a box
of bullets to a handful of shotgun shells in the car. The charge
depends to some degree on the caliber of weapon involved. Anything
more powerful than a .38-caliber gun is considered a military
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans imprisoned on arms charges at the
Mexican border has soared from just a handful of cases last year to
scores this year, State Department officials said, not because more
people have been arrested but because Mexican officials have been
prosecuting more cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a heck of a lot of difference in the number of
arrests,'' said a State Department official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is different is the outcome of the cases,'' the official
said. ``Before, when someone inadvertently entered Mexico with a
weapon, they were briefly detained and usually informally allowed
to return to the U.S. with the weapon seized. Now, in the same
situation, they could end up in jail a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican customs and police officials deny this, and say they
have no explanation for the increase in weapons prosecutions. ``The
policy in Mexico has not changed; it is the same,'' said Juan
Manuel Rodriguez Cid, administrator of Mexican customs for the
crossings in and near El Paso, Texas. ``We don't know what the
reason is for this increase.''
</P>
<P>
   James L. Ward, U.S. consul general in Juarez, said he was not
sure why more weapons prosecutions have been occurring. It could be
that the Mexican government had decided to crack down on weapons
cases, Ward said, or simply that looser gun laws in Texas and other
states, combined with eased travel restrictions, led to more people
driving into Mexico with guns in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and State Department officials emphasized that the Mexicans
had legitimate concerns about guns crossing their border. Mexico
has seen an increase in the number of weapons coming south, partly
because of the drug trade and partly because of arms-for-profit
schemes involving criminal gangs or rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the border officials tell us they don't have the
discretion, or at least they perceive they don't have the
discretion, to distinguish between cases that reach them,'' Ward
said. ``Even when it's fairly clear that it is not an arms smuggler
that they're dealing with, that it's a person who made a simple
mistake, they often make no distinction. We're not saying Americans
should get off scot-free. But to imagine that some guy would take
two vans filled with 15 people in order to smuggle two weapons into
Mexico just strains credulity.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. citizens arrested at the border tend to fall into three
categories, U.S. officials said: those who did not intend to enter
Mexico, those who forgot they had firearms in their vehicles and
those who were not aware they carried firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are also genuine cases of arms smugglers,'' one U.S.
official said, ``though in our experience these are few and far
between.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue was discussed in talks in June between Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Mexican Foreign Secretary Rosario
Green, and the U.S. State Department issued an announcement on Aug.
3 warning U.S. citizens against taking weapons or ammunition into
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A bill is under consideration in the Mexican Congress that would
give border officials more discretion in deciding which cases to
pursue most vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   None of this does anything for those under arrest and in prison,
and especially for the handful, like Manuel, who have been
convicted and sentenced. Families of those in prison say they have
spent thousands of dollars, sometimes tens of thousands, fighting
weapons charges.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Albanese and Patterson had their charges reduced from possession
of military weapons _ a .22 semiautomatic rifle, a 20-gauge bolt
action and a 12-gauge pump shotgun _ to a lesser charge and were
expecting to pay a bond and be released as early as Thursday night
and then return home to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Albanese and Patterson were in high spirits recently when they
returned from a hearing where they learned that the prosecutor's
attempt to reinstate the harsher charges against them had failed.
``It's almost over, I can't believe it,'' Patterson said. ``It's
like you fell into a big black hole and there's no way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel offered them one of his cigarettes, but his eyes clouded
when he heard their good news. ``I wish I was going home with you
guys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In El Paso, where Interstate 10 runs less than a quarter-mile
from the Rio Grande and a wrong exit can easily feed a driver onto
a border bridge, U.S. officials say they have been improving the
signs warning Americans about carrying firearms into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On the Mexican side of the bridge in Juarez, there are 10 lanes
for those with nothing to declare and two lanes for those who have
something to declare.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they come to us and declare that they have a firearm, we
will allow them to leave it with us and pick it up on their way out
of Mexico, no problem,'' said Rodriguez Cid, who added that no one
has ever done this. ``But if they go through one of the other lanes
and are pulled over and searched and we find firearms after that,
even if they volunteer them to us, we must consider that they have
intentionally not declared them and that they are being brought
illegally into Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The best idea, Rodriguez Cid said, is for Americans ``to leave
their weapons at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the man who was leading two vans of relatives to
California and now is awaiting trial on weapons charges, said he
wished he had done that.
</P>
<P>
   His wife died of breast cancer in July. The trip to California
in August was, in part, an attempt to break out of the grief from
that loss, he said. As he sat in a corner of the noisy prison yard,
his eyes misted and he talked about his 16-year-old daughter and
14-year-old son, now left without their mother and him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go through anything myself, but when I think about
those kids,'' he said, and then stopped and wiped his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who like the other Americans in the jail in Juarez said
he had been treated very well, recently started to work out and has
asked permission to run laps on a jogging track. He has to toughen
himself, he said, in case he ends up spending five years or more in
the prison.
</P>
<P>
   He took another deep breath and looked through the bars toward
the distant peaks of the Sierra de Juarez, leading back toward El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the people I was sorry,'' he said. ``What else can I
do?''

AUTOPSY ATTRIBUTES TRACK STAR'S DEATH TO ASPHYXIATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (a and s coding)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florence Griffith Joyner, the glamorous Olympic gold-medal
sprinter who died unexpectedly last month, asphyxiated during an
epileptic seizure in her sleep, authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy showed no evidence of either drug use or heart
problems, they added.
</P>
<P>
   ``In layman's terms, she suffocated,'' said Dr. Richard
Fukumoto, chief of forensics for the Orange County, Calif., sheriff
and coroner. Apparently, he said, she had been lying on her stomach
when the seizure caused her limbs to stiffen and turn her head to
the right, where her breathing was constricted by covers and
pillows.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy discovered that Griffith Joyner, 38, had a
congenital blood vessel abnormality called a ``cavernous angioma''
on the front left part of her brain. It is found in 1 in 400
Americans, according to Dr. Marc Nuwer, a neurologist and
co-director of the adult epilepsy program at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sufficient explanation for a seizure,'' said Dr. Steven
Schachter, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical
School and an epileptologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center in Boston. ``Had she lived and this had been discovered, she
probably would have been put on seizure medication.''
</P>
<P>
   The abnormality has never been associated in medical research
with steroids or any other drugs, Fukumoto said. It may have been
present at birth.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner died at her Mission Viejo, Calif., home Sept.
21, and investigators had been trying since to determine the cause.
Her husband, 1984 Olympic triple jump champion Al Joyner, called
paramedics that morning after awakening to discover that his wife
wasn't breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Griffith Joyner was hospitalized overnight after
suffering a seizure on a flight from St. Louis to California, but
apparently, she had no further incidents until the seizure that led
to her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Epilepsy is usually defined as two or more seizures,'' said
Schachter, who is on the professional advisory board of the
Epilepsy Foundation. ``Usually, people are not treated after their
first seizure, especially if there is no reason to believe they are
at tremendous risk. Presumably, she was evaluated and there was no
reason to believe she was at risk for a second seizure.''
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference Thursday in Santa Ana, Calif.,
sheriff's spokesman Lt. Hector Rivera cut off questions about
Griffith Joyner's medical history and whether the condition had
been diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Griffith Joyner had been shadowed by rumors, which
she vigorously denied, that she was using banned substances when
she won her three gold medals and set world records at 100 and 200
meters in 1988. But she never failed a drug test, and toxicology
tests after her death ``showed there was nothing unusual in terms
of drugs,'' said Lt. Frank Fitzpatrick, head of forensic sciences
for the Orange County Sheriff's Office. Tests showed only that she
had recently taken about one tablet each of the over-the-counter
painkiller Tylenol and antihistamine Benadryl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now hope that this great Olympic champion, wife, and mother
can rest in peace,'' said Bill Hybl, president of the US Olympic
Committee. ``It is time for the whispers and dark allegations to
cease and for us to move on with the dream she shared for young
girls and women in sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Stones, former world record-holder in the high jump,
called Griffith Joyner ``the most tested athlete'' of the 1988
Olympics. ``I think this is fabulous and phenomenal vindication for
her and her family,'' he said Thursday. ``Now they should just
leave her alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Epilepsy is a neurological condition that from time to time
produces brief disturbances in the normal electrical functions of
the brain. When someone has epilepsy, normal brain activity is
interrupted by intermittent bursts of electrical energy that are
much more intense than usual. About 1 in 200 people has some form
of epilepsy, with an unknown number untreated and undiagnosed.
Although it primarily affects children and young adults, it can
occur at any age.

U.S. RECEIVED WARNING BEFORE NAIROBI EMBASSY BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
(sw) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER with JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Nine months before the attack on the American
Embassy here, U.S. intelligence officials received a detailed
warning that Islamic radicals were plotting to blow up the
building, according to Kenyan and American officials.
</P>
<P>
   The warning forecast the Aug. 7 bombing in several particulars,
the officials said. It came from an Egyptian man who American
officials now believe was involved in the simultaneous terrorist
assaults on the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, is now in jail in
Tanzania, charged by local prosecutors with bombing the embassy
there.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombings, the State Department has maintained that it
received no specific warnings about threats to its embassies in
East Africa. But late on Thursday, a spokesman acknowledged that
the CIA had sent the State Department two reports about Ahmed that
prompted the embassy in Kenya to step up security for several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When no attack materialized, the embassy's precautions returned
to normal. No further steps were taken to improve the building's
physical security.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of the warning raises new questions about the State
Department's protection of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
which did not meet the department's own minimum standards for
security. Until now, department officials have insisted that the
embassies faced only a minimal threat from terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the bombings, the administration acknowledged
that it had spurned requests from the American ambassador in Kenya,
Prudence Bushnell, to move the entire embassy to a safer location.
The State Department would not say whether her cables mentioned
Ahmed's warning.
</P>
<P>
   According to American officials, Ahmed walked into the Nairobi
embassy last November and told American intelligence officials that
he knew of a group that was planning to detonate a bomb-laden truck
inside the diplomats' underground parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interrogation by Kenyan intelligence officials,
which was relayed to the Americans, Ahmed said he had already taken
surveillance photos of the embassy for the attack, which was to
involve several vehicles and stun grenades, Kenyan officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at the CIA were unable to link Ahmed to any terrorist
group but they nonetheless sent two reports last November about his
statements to various government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, American officials said, included several caveats.
The CIA said that a foreign intelligence service that cooperates
with the agency believed that Ahmed was a fabricator of
information. In the reports, CIA analysts said that they could not
rule out the possibility that Ahmed's threats were serious. But
they said that the threats might also be a sophisticated ploy by
terrorists to observe and then counter the defenses the embassy
would take against a possible attack.
</P>
<P>
   After Ahmed appeared at the embassy, American officials alerted
their Kenyan counterpars, who questioned the Egytian and then
deported him. Soon after, Ahmed made his way to Tanzania where,
American officials now believe, he participated in the Aug. 7
bombing of the embassy that left 11 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy attack in Kenya unfolded that same day much as Ahmed
had said it would: A team of terrorists using two vehicles
attempted to drive an explosives-packed truck into the parking
garage. One of the attackers tossed stun grenades to frighten off
the locally hired security guards. When an exiting car blocked
their access to the garage, the attackers set off the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official acknowledged that the embassy
in Kenya had received a specific warning about an attack. ``It is
embarrassing,'' this official said, quickly adding: ``It is
tragic.'' Asked why the embassy took few steps to improve its
security after the warning, he said: ``That's the 64-million-dollar
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials defended the government's handling of the case,
noting that American intelligence is deluged with warnings about
terrorist plots, most of which prove groundless.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Tanzanian authorities have not allowed Ahmed to be
interviewed, and it was unclear what motivated him to alert
authorities about a plot in which he appears to have played a role.
He told the Kenyans that in the past he had provided authorities
with information about Islamic radicals because he wanted to see
them arrested and rehabilitated rather than caught committing a
crime for which they would be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed has said he is innocent of the charges and his lawyer,
Abdul Mwengela, said his client's information about the bombings
stemmed solely from a conversation he had overheard the previous
year in a Nairobi hotel.
</P>
<P>
   A Tanzanian court refused to release Ahmed on bail this week and
ruled that FBI agents would be permitted to interrogate him.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzanian investigators suspect he was a central figure in the
plot. They are now examining whether Ahmed drove one of the
vehicles used in the Dar es Salaam bombing and whether the 400
pounds of explosives used in both blasts came into Tanzania in a
shipment of rice imported by one of his companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not sought to extradite Ahmed
from Tanzania event though federal law permits the United States to
bring charges against anyone who attempts or conspires to murder
Americans anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   American prosecutors have already brought to the United States
several other people accused of complicity in the bombings or of
having ties to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who American
investigators have identified as the mastermind of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The American Embassy in Dar es Salaam declined to answer any
questions about Ahmed and why Washington was not seeking his
extradition. American diplomats in Tanzania, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, suggested the prosecution was being left to
the Tanzanians because there were no American victims. A White
House spokesman said the case was appropriately handled and that
the United States had no plans to extradite Mustafa because the
Tanzanians had expressed interest in trying him.
</P>
<P>
   Several non-American diplomats in the region speculated that the
United States is allowing the Tanzanians to try Ahmed because they
fear his trial in America might bring to light his dealings with
American authorities and other Western intelligence services.

CUERO, TEXAS, FLASH FLOOD VICTIMS RETURNING TO LIVES CHANGED
FOREVER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUERO, Texas _ When William B. Smolik, 78, returned Thursday to
his meat market after being rescued by boat from the family
business Tuesday morning, he peered at the debris as if searching
desperately for something he already knew was gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kinda numb right now. I don't know,'' said Smolik, whose
family immigrated to Texas from Moravia after the Civil War. ``It's
pitiful. I don't know where to start.''
</P>
<P>
   He then dropped the brim of his cowboy hat and raised his right
thumb and forefinger to his eyes to catch the tears.
</P>
<P>
   Families returned to homes wrenched from their foundations by
floodwaters that rose more than 10 feet in four hours and swept
through Cuero like a tidal wave.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the death toll from the devastating floods rose to 27
Thursday as the bodies of five more victims were discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The Guadalupe River crested here at 49.78 feet early Monday and
sent water surging over its banks and through portions of the city
at 138,974 cubic feet per second.
</P>
<P>
   The force of the water left homes standing in the middle of
streets, boats balancing precariously on the hoods of pickup trucks
and debris hanging from fencelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two-thirds of our city affected, probably of that
two-thirds, half of that is what I call a war zone. I mean it's
totally devastated,'' said Cuero Mayor Michael Thamm.
</P>
<P>
   Areas expected to withstand 100-year and 500-year storms were
submerged when floodwater swept through the western and southern
parts of this community of 6,700.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that 160 homes were destroyed by the water
surge and that hundreds more suffered substantial flood damage.
Luther Boysen, DeWitt County emergency management coordinator,
estimated that the toll will rise to more than 300 homes destroyed
once crews can inspect flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
   Thamm said miraculously no one was killed or injured. He said
damage cost estimates had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is the public safety right now, trying to do
as much as a I can for these people; 3,000 of the 7,000 people here
have been affected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross officials fed 1,700 people displaced by the flood
Tuesday and had sheltered more than 1,000 the night before.
</P>
<P>
   The flood surge cut through Cuero just before noon Tuesday,
without warning. With no local radio station to broadcast an alert,
no one was aware the rising water was coming so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Vavrusa said residents were told the crest would not
occur until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem here,'' Thamm said, ``this time the river rose so
fast we had no time to prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents with permits began returning to their homes Thursday
on Cuero's west side as floodwaters began to recede. The areas
worst hit by floodwaters, in southern Cuero, were not opened until
Thursday afternoon, after utility crews plugged natural gas leaks
and shut down electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   David Smolik, 43, was dumbfounded when he first saw the damage
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm speechless right now,'' said the younger Smolik as his
eyes misted and he looked into the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Several blocks behind Smolik Quality Meats, Alfred Anzaldua, 59,
and a friend loaded the two barber chairs found on the side of a
road two blocks from where his barber shop had stood. Behind him, a
dirty yellow pulpit bearing a plaque with the word ``Peace'' stood
in the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my open and closed sign, but today I'm closed,'' said
Anzaldua, grinning as he slapped the mud from the sign on his
thigh.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his barber shop, the roof and front wall with a
barber's pole still attached, rested on top of Mark Vavrusa's
tractor in his front yard, another block away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventeen acres, and I believe I caught just about everybody's
belongings,'' said Vavrusa as he surveyed the junkyard his property
had become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my neighbors, what's theirs is theirs,'' he said. ``I
ain't fighting nobody over nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Colorado River rose to record levels and
continued to force evacuations in much of Wharton while other
swollen waterways in South and Central Texas receded, leaving
behind hundreds of millions of dollars in destruction across 60
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims of the unprecedented flooding were four
members of a San Antonio-area family whose bodies were found inside
their car in a creek. They had been missing for five days. Also
recovered Thursday was the body of a 7-year-old boy missing since
the weekend in Caldwell County, south of Austin. A Lockhart area
couple is still missing.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton earlier declared 20 Texas counties federal
disaster areas, making them eligible for federal aid, as state
officials put preliminary damage estimates at $400 million. Gov.
George W. Bush asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to add
to the declaration five more counties in Southeast Texas _ Austin,
Fort Bend, Harris, Montgomery and Waller.
</P>
<P>
   In Wharton, 55 miles southwest of Houston, authorities tried to
prevent any more loss of life by taking airboats and Army trucks
into the Colorado River floodwaters to urge people to leave. The
city's west end was under water Thursday night and about 300 people
had taken refuge in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area's continuing to take on water and it probably will
all day long,'' Fire Chief David Copeland said earlier Thursday as
he stood across from one neighborhood swallowed by the river.
</P>
<P>
   And ranchers whose herds graze near the Guadalupe and San Marcos
rivers were trying to round up as many as 50,000 cattle and calves
that moved downstream when the swift waters knocked down fences.
The cattle were dodging floating logs, snakes, fire ants and other
animals.,
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire ants float on top of the water in big balls, and they
get around the cow's eyes and nose,'' said Trey Hamlett, manager of
the Luling Foundation farm where hundreds of strays have been
corralled by volunteers. ``The cow's hide is thick, but the ants
are still a problem to them.''

 &HT;    Gingrich stumps for Michigan candidates
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAND, Mich. _ Wherever Speaker Newt Gingrich campaigned
Thursday in Michigan, he leveled criticism at pairs of Democrats,
the local Democratic member of Congress and Geoffrey Fieger.
</P>
<P>
   The former lawyer for Dr. Jack Kevorkian, Fieger won his party's
nomination for governor against popular Republican Gov. John
Engler.
</P>
<P>
   Polls say Fieger is hopelessly behind.
</P>
<P>
   But on his way to a near-certain defeat in November, he has
offended nearly every major religious group, made insulting
references to Engler and, perhaps most important, given Republicans
the notion that his antics will keep Democrats from voting in
November and result in Republican gains in Michigan's congressional
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich (R-Ga.) spoke and raised money in four Democratic-held
districts in which the incumbents normally would be expected to win
rather easily in a year that appears friendly to elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's day began at the northern end of Lake Michigan, where
he appeared at a fund-raising breakfast for state Rep. Michelle
McManus, who is trying to oust three-term Democratic Rep. Bart
Stupak.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker repeatedly tried to tie Stupak to Fieger, even
though Stupak, who won 71 percent of the vote in 1996, has publicly
refused to endorse his party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Fieger-Stupak team, no matter what Stupak tries to
say,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in this western Detroit suburb, the speaker told a small
audience that to Rep. Lynn Rivers, ``party means everything, no
matter how unusual the nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers, who won election amid the Republican revolution of 1994,
also has chosen not to endorse Fieger. In an interview, she called
the governor's race ``crazy'' and referred to Fieger as ``a sort of
wild candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Republicans have kept up a steady drumbeat about
Fieger, predicting that he will demoralize Democratic voters and
keep them at home, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for those not offended by Fieger, Clinton's problems will
be a turnoff. And not a single Democrat will vote in Michigan,''
Rivers said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it overdone? ``Just a tad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tom Hickey, the small-business owner who hopes to take
Rivers' place in Congress could muster a crowd of only 50 or so
adults at an afternoon rally that Gingrich headlined. A marching
band and a few dozen high school students _ one of whom yelled,
``You rule, Newt'' _ provided the event with some enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   University of Michigan political science professor Gregory
Markus said he has been struck by the lack of excitement over
political campaigns this year and he doubted whether Fieger's
candidacy would be much of a factor in the election results.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledged, if people choose not to vote, ``Low
turnout makes for quirky outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   That prospect is motivating Republicans to send party leaders to
Michigan to boost the troops. House Majority Leader Dick Armey and
Rep. John Linder, chairman of the House Republican campaign
committee, will campaign for McManus next week.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who is expected to visit 20 states in a pre-election
blitz, criss-crossed the state, also attending closed-door
fund-raising events for the Republicans challenging two senior
Democrats, House Minority Whip David Bonior and Rep. Sander Levin.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker mainly stayed away from the House's impeachment
inquiry, other than to criticize the media for overemphasizing
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In Acme, Mich., where Gingrich spoke in the morning, Linda
Wiseley, an official with the Associated Builders and Contractors,
said she believes voters will allow their opinions of Clinton and
Fieger to influence their choices in other races.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next breath, she conceded that challengers from both
parties would have trouble gaining traction this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, things are pretty good,'' Wiseley said. ``People are
working.''

 &HT;    Police compare hotel slayings in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A motel slaying in College Park, Ga., that occurred
just two days before the weekend triple murder at an upscale
downtown Atlanta hotel has investigators from both agencies
comparing notes to determine whether they are related.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Police Maj. Mickey Lloyd said Thursday that Atlanta
investigators contacted College Park this week to discuss the Oct.
15 fatal shooting at a Days Inn on Old National Highway and the
Oct. 18 triple, execution-style murders at the downtown Atlanta
Hilton &AMP; Towers on Courtland Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to them and we've met with them to talk about the
cases,'' Lloyd said. ``We haven't ruled anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerrold Shropshire of Altamonte Springs, Fla., Ronnie Gutkowski
of Leesburg, Fla., and Phillip Dover of Gainesville, were found
shot in the back of the head in room 2414 of the Hilton early
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Deputy Chief C.B. Jackson has said the men probably were
shot sometime after midnight on Sunday in a hotel that was only
half-occupied.
</P>
<P>
   There was no forced entry to the cramped, cream-colored room,
which overlooks two tennis courts and the city's skyline.
</P>
<P>
   College Park Detective David O'Neal said his case bears some
similarities to Atlanta's.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, 19-year-old Ladaris Hawkins was shot in the face
with a handgun after he either let someone into his motel room or
perhaps gave someone a key. O'Neal said Hawkins, who lived at the
hotel, was found on his bed, but did not die until he arrived at
the hospital. Crack cocaine also was found in Hawkins' underwear,
O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a robbery-homicide,'' O'Neal said. ``The victim
didn't have a wallet on him. We believe he may have been awoken by
this person.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal would not discuss other similarities between the two
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The victims' bodies also have been released to the families for
funerals, the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office said. Blood
samples to determine whether the victims had drugs and alcohol in
their systems have been sent to the GBI.
</P>
<P>
   Dover's funeral was Thursday. Mourners in Central Florida plan
to say goodbye to Gutkowski, 51, and Shropshire, 50, in services
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in Atlanta asked their counterparts in Central
Florida this week to look into the background of Gutkowski and
Shropshire, and a search turned up no evidence that Florida police
have had dealings with either man.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Don Gregory of the Lake County, Ga., Sheriff's Department
said their search for any police contact yielded results that jibe
with descriptions from friends and relatives that Gutkowski and
Shropshire were family men who went to church and steered clear of
trouble. ``We have no indication of these gentlemen being involved
in anything,'' Gregory said Wednesday. ``We've done a complete
history.''

CLINTON PRESSES MIDEAST TALKS, AS PROGRESS IS REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVEN ERLANGR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ President Clinton pushed into the night
Thursday to close a deal with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyhau, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, on the eighth
day of talks here.
</P>
<P>
   But solutions seemed to be found on significant issues,
including a Palestinian agreement to revise its charter in a way
Israel wants and to rearrest 30 of the 36 prisoners Israel
originally wanted extradited.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said a deal on a third redeployment of Israeli
troops from the West Bank, as the Palestinians demand, is near.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clear breakthrough on all questions,'' the Israeli
Cabinet minister, Natan Sharansky, said Thursday night. But the
deal was not finished.
</P>
<P>
   As rumors of a deal floated from both delegations, the State
Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, earlier attempted to deflate
expectations of a rapid conclusion, saying that some half-dozen
issues of varying importance remained to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely no deal yet,'' he said. ``On the contrary,
there are still obstacles'' on what he called ``the most complex
and emotion-laden issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do feel we're down to a serious moment of serious
bargaining on serious issues,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues, officials say, include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Israeli demand that the full Palestine National Council
amend the Palestinian charter, formally removing clauses calling
for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   This issue was resolved, Israeli officials said, when the
Palestinians agreed to convene the council along with all other
relevant Palestinian institutions from inside the territories
within a few days of the end of this three-month deal. But American
officials say it's more complicated, involving a main decision by
the Palestinian Executive Council, to be ratified later, in a more
informal way, by ``all relevant bodies, including the PNC.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Palestinian demand that the Israelis guarantee a third
redeployment from the West Bank, called for under the 1993 and 1995
Oslo accords, and not simply subsume that third withdrawal into
talks about a final settlement that would also settle the
Palestinian Authority's final boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say language is being worked out on this issue. A
commission of both sides working in parallel with the final-status
negotiations will handle the timing and size of the third
redeployment, essentially postponing the issue for now, but in a
way, American officials said, that should prevent it from blocking
talks later the way these redeployments have blocked the peace
process for 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Israeli demand for the extradition of 36 Palestinians _ 31
of them wanted for capital offenses like murder. This issue was
resolved with a Palestinian agreement to arrest 30 of the 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Palestinian demand that Israel release some 3,500
Palestinian prisoners arrested for security offenses, as called for
under the Oslo accords, while Israel says it won't release those
``with blood on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials say the Israelis have agreed to release
``several hundred'' prisoners, and that this may be enough for a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   _ The exact method by which Israel will provide safe passage for
Palestinians traveling between the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who arrived Thursday morning for his sixth
day of intense personal involvement here, spent the evening talking
first to Netanyahu while Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
spoke with Arafat, and then vice-versa, in what the Americans
called ``tag-team diplomacy.'' Jordan's King Hussein spoke to the
leaders on the telephone from a nearby farm.
</P>
<P>
   The main discussions were taking place in a tent off the main
dining room, to keep the numbers of participants small, officials
said. Thursday night, Clinton reconvened a joint meeting of the key
members of both delegations to try to finish off the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday evening, the Israeli and the Palestinian
delegations, of about 20 people each, were about 20 feet apart in
the dining room, the Israelis gathered around a fireplace on
couches and chairs and the Palestinians sitting at a table. The
Americans were at the main dining table, with Clinton, Albright,
Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, and special envoy
Dennis Ross huddling over bridging proposals to bring to one side
or another.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin compared the atmosphere to ``a cloakroom, with the feeling
and flavor of a legislative session drawing to a close,'' as final
deals are being made. ``But that doesn't mean that they will draw
to a close,'' Rubin hastened to add. ``But it certainly had that
flavor of a lot of people standing in different parts of the same
room, shuttling between one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin spoke over a speakerphone to a huddled mass of journalists
crowded around a small table in the press center here, at
Chesapeake College.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders were working with the text of an American plan given
to them at dawn Thursday morning. After 19 months of stalemate, the
American plan, a product of hundreds of conversations and many
drafts, seeks to lay out a deal whereby Israel will redeploy from
another 13 percent of the West Bank _ 3 percent to be a nature
reserve _ in return for specific Palestinian steps to combat
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans have been briefing both sides for months on
drafts of the plan, this is the first time it has been physically
handed to the parties.

AUTOPSY ATTRIBUTES TRACK STAR'S DEATH TO ASPHYXIATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (a and s coding)

 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florence Griffith Joyner, the glamorous Olympic gold-medal
sprinter who died unexpectedly last month, asphyxiated during an
epileptic seizure in her sleep, authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy showed no evidence of either drug use or heart
problems, they added.
</P>
<P>
   ``In layman's terms, she suffocated,'' said Dr. Richard
Fukumoto, chief of forensics for the Orange County, Calif., sheriff
and coroner. Apparently, he said, she had been lying on her stomach
when the seizure caused her limbs to stiffen and turn her head to
the right, where her breathing was constricted by covers and
pillows.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy discovered that Griffith Joyner, 38, had a
congenital blood vessel abnormality called a ``cavernous angioma''
on the front left part of her brain. It is found in 1 in 400
Americans, according to Dr. Marc Nuwer, a neurologist and
co-director of the adult epilepsy program at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sufficient explanation for a seizure,'' said Dr. Steven
Schachter, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical
School and an epileptologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center in Boston. ``Had she lived and this had been discovered, she
probably would have been put on seizure medication.''
</P>
<P>
   The abnormality has never been associated in medical research
with steroids or any other drugs, Fukumoto said. It may have been
present at birth.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner died at her Mission Viejo, Calif., home Sept.
21, and investigators had been trying since to determine the cause.
Her husband, 1984 Olympic triple jump champion Al Joyner, called
paramedics that morning after awakening to discover that his wife
wasn't breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Griffith Joyner was hospitalized overnight after
suffering a seizure on a flight from St. Louis to California, but
apparently, she had no further incidents until the seizure that led
to her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Epilepsy is usually defined as two or more seizures,'' said
Schachter, who is on the professional advisory board of the
Epilepsy Foundation. ``Usually, people are not treated after their
first seizure, especially if there is no reason to believe they are
at tremendous risk. Presumably, she was evaluated and there was no
reason to believe she was at risk for a second seizure.''
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference Thursday in Santa Ana, Calif.,
sheriff's spokesman Lt. Hector Rivera cut off questions about
Griffith Joyner's medical history and whether the condition had
been diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Griffith Joyner had been shadowed by rumors, which
she vigorously denied, that she was using banned substances when
she won her three gold medals and set world records at 100 and 200
meters in 1988. But she never failed a drug test, and toxicology
tests after her death ``showed there was nothing unusual in terms
of drugs,'' said Lt. Frank Fitzpatrick, head of forensic sciences
for the Orange County Sheriff's Office. Tests showed only that she
had recently taken about one tablet each of the over-the-counter
painkiller Tylenol and antihistamine Benadryl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now hope that this great Olympic champion, wife, and mother
can rest in peace,'' said Bill Hybl, president of the US Olympic
Committee. ``It is time for the whispers and dark allegations to
cease and for us to move on with the dream she shared for young
girls and women in sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Stones, former world record-holder in the high jump,
called Griffith Joyner ``the most tested athlete'' of the 1988
Olympics. ``I think this is fabulous and phenomenal vindication for
her and her family,'' he said Thursday. ``Now they should just
leave her alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Epilepsy is a neurological condition that from time to time
produces brief disturbances in the normal electrical functions of
the brain. When someone has epilepsy, normal brain activity is
interrupted by intermittent bursts of electrical energy that are
much more intense than usual. About 1 in 200 people has some form
of epilepsy, with an unknown number untreated and undiagnosed.
Although it primarily affects children and young adults, it can
occur at any age.

GRIFFITH JOYNER DIED OF SUFFOCATION, AUTHORITIES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Olympic sprint champion Florence Griffith Joyner died of
suffocation a month ago after suffering a seizure while she slept,
medical authorities said Thursday in southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure was caused by a congenital abnormality of blood
vessels in her brain called cavernous angioma, said Dr. Richard
Fukumoto, the chief forensic pathologist for the Orange County,
Calif., coroner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicology tests showed that Griffith Joyner, 38, had taken a
tablet of the painkiller Tylenol and the antihistimine Benadryl,
but tests for evidence of alcohol, recreational drugs and
performance-enhancing drugs were negative, authorities said at a
news conference in Santa Ana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Fukumoto said that he did not find any abnormality of Griffith
Joyner's heart during an autopsy, saying that she had a ``normal
athlete's heart'' that was in ``good form.'' At the time of her
death on Sept. 21, a family spokesman had said that a heart seizure
was believed to have been the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Zaias, a neuropathologist with the coroner's office,
said that the blood vessel abnormality is found in about 25 percent
of the population and many people live their whole lives without
knowing it. Others suffer from headaches or seizures, brought on by
microscopic bleeding, she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fukumoto, Griffith Joyner had been sleeping face
down when the seizure apparently caused her to turn her head into
her pillow, restricting the flow of oxygen into her lungs and
causing her to asphyxiate. Not all such seizures are grand mal
seizures that would be noticed by another person, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In layman's terms, she suffocated to death,'' Fukomoto said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors did not release any information from Griffith Joyner's
medical files and declined to say whether she was aware that she
had a blood vessel abnormality or whether she had suffered previous
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, her family said that she had suffered a seizure
while on a flight two years ago, and had been hospitalized
overnight, but that no cause of the incident had been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Fukomoto said that he knew of no connection between the use of
performance-enhancing drugs and cavernous angioma. ``I don't see
how you can tie it in at all,'' Dr. Gary Wadler, an internist and
sports medicine expert from the New York University School of
Medicine, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner, the winner of three gold medals at the 1988
Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, died while she slept at her
home in Mission Viejo, Calif. Her husband, Al Joyner, the 1984
Olympic triple jump champion, called paramedics, saying that she
was unresponsive and not breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner was a spectacular presence on the world track
circuit with her long fingernails, her flamboyant racing suits and
her searing speed. But because she shattered previous world records
at 100 and 200 meters and retired soon after the Seoul Olympics,
she also faced rumors and accusations from competitors that she had
used such performance-enhancing drugs as steroids or human-growth
hormone.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after she died, however, doctors cautioned against
trying to link her death to the use of illicit substances and
pointed out that the science was murky in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner denied taking any banned substances and passed
every drug test that she took, although no test exists to detect
the presence of human growth hormone in a urine sample.
</P>
<P>
   Her family took Thursday's announcements as affirmation that she
had been a clean performer and as a chance to assert her legacy as
a great champion, devoted wife and mother, author of children's
books and ebullient worker with underprivileged children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coroner's investigation was very thorough,'' Al Joyner
told reporters Thursday. ``My wife passed the ultimate drug test.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Meyer, the Joyners' attorney, said: ``The results of the
investigation confirm the fact that Florence Griffith Joyner passed
away from a congenital vascular malformation in her brain. There
were no heart problems and there was no indication of any drug or
steroid use, past or present. Her remarkable achievements remain
unspoiled.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hybl, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, said in a
statement that he hoped Griffith Joyner's admirers would now be
allowed to celebrate her legacy to sport and her work with children
and that it was ``time for the whispers and dark allegations to
cease.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Flo-Jo is deeply missed, but her gifts to sport, and to
children, will outlast all of us who were fortunate to see her in
moments of triumph and greatness,'' Hybl said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Maback, chief executive officer of the U.S. track and
field federation, said that news of the cause of Griffith Joyner's
death ``reaffirms our belief that our focus should be on supporting
her husband, Al, and daughter, Mary Ruth, in their time of need,
and on celebrating what she gave the world in her grace, style and
speed.''

MO VAUGHN TAKES STEP TOWARD FREE AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a procedural move clearing the way for him to file
for free agency, Red Sox first baseman Mo Vaughn informed the team
Thursday that he is not exercising the option in his contract for a
1999 salary of $6.75 million, slightly more than the $6.6 million
he was paid this past season.
</P>
<P>
   It actually was a dual option, meaning either the club or the
player could refuse to exercise it. The Red Sox offered him the
option, but there was never a question that Vaughn would refuse it,
and in past negotiations, the Red Sox already had offered Vaughn a
contract extension for far more than the previous option would have
paid.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was not among the eight players who filed for free agency
Thursday, the first day on which potential free agents could
declare their intentions, but he is expected to do so in the next
few days.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox also are expected to meet with Vaughn's agents
sometime in the next 15 days, the period when players who have
filed for free agency can talk only with their present teams. Sox
officials have been in contact with Vaughn's agents in the
postseason, and GM Dan Duquette, who was in San Diego during the
World Series, broached the possibility of meeting then, but
Vaughn's agent, Tom Reich, was in Pittsburgh on business for his
hockey client, Mario Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   While it is assumed the Red Sox are preparing another offer for
Vaughn, it appears that the Sox first baseman will not sign until
after he has entertained offers from other clubs. He has said that
since a deal was not struck by now, he intends to see what his
value will be on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Despite speculation that Vaughn will be pursued vigorously by a
group of teams that may include the Yankees, Dodgers, Angels,
Orioles and perhaps the Rangers, the Red Sox will have their shot,
though at a price nuch higher than the deal they could have had
done last spring, when they insisted Vaughn undergo an alcohol
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   With such top stars as catcher Mike Piazza, American League
batting champion Bernie Williams and pitchers Kevin Brown and Randy
Johnson eligible for free agency, it seems likely that the $12.5
million average annual value of Pedro Martinez's precedent-setting
contract last winter will be eclipsed.
</P>
<P>
   Other star players eligible to file by the Nov. 5 deadline
include World Series MVP Scott Brosius, Baltimore second baseman
Roberto Alomar and Chicago White Sox third baseman Robin Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox pitcher Butch Henry, who missed almost the entire 1998
season after undergoing knee surgery, was one of eight players who
filed for free agency Thursday. That list included former Sox DH
Jose Canseco, who hit 47 homers and drove in 107 runs for Toronto;
Rangers pitcher Todd Stottlemyre; Brewers outfielder Darrin
Jackson; Cardinals outfielder Brian Jordan; Dodgers catcher Tom
Prince; Twins right-hander Bob Tewksbury; and Mariners right-hander
Mike Timlin.
</P>
<P>
   Henry was paid $1.367 million last season after making an
apparently successful comeback from tendon-transfer elbow surgery.
He began the season in the Sox rotation, but made just three starts
before undergoing surgery for a torn ACL, an injury to which he may
have become vulnerable when he pulled a hamstring while running the
bases in a game late in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox also exercised the $750,000 club option for 1999
they were holding on reliever Jim Corsi, who was the team's most
dependable setup man last season. Corsi, 37, held lefthanded
batters to a .211 average last season and made a career-high 59
appearances. The Red Sox may decide to offer a contract extension
to the Newton native, especially with Dennis Eckersley likely to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox already offered a two-year deal for around $2.8 million
to lefthanded reliever Greg Swindell, but he turned it down and is
eligible to file for free agency.

AFTER EMBARRASSMENT OF MARCOS CASE, SWISS BANKS CHANGE RULES  
</HEADLINE>
  (dl) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The case of some $500 million stashed in Swiss banks by
the former dictator of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos, has
prompted reforms that make it harder for corrupt rulers and
criminals to stow assets here.
</P>
<P>
   Despots and crime barons, large and small, have deposited
millions in Switzerland for decades without consequence for most.
But the Marcos fortune was different because of its size and the
embarrassment to the Swiss from the lengthy efforts of the
country's government to retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   It took 12 years for the Marcos money to be returned to the
Philippines. Moving to close loopholes in the country's banking and
legal structure as efforts to restore the money stalled, Swiss
lawmakers made money laundering a crime for the first time, and
overhauled its legislation for assistance to foreign governments
seeking return of illicit wealth. It is now easier for Switzerland
to give back disputed monies.
</P>
<P>
   The case prompted Swiss bank regulators to make significant
changes in banking's inner sanctums, which had routinely welcomed
enormous sums with few, if any, questions asked. For the first
time, banks were obliged to scrutinize funds from foreign political
figures. Banks also had to take greater steps to ascertain the true
owner of funds before accepting them for deposit.
</P>
<P>
   Briefcases filled with cash were no longer welcome. Even if they
were, new money laundering regulations now demand that bankers
report suspicious transactions to legal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, the Swiss authorities announced that they had
seized more than $90 million in Swiss accounts from Raul Salinas de
Gortari, a brother of Mexico's former president, after a police
investigation said that he had received the money for protecting
drug shipments. Salinas has denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   The Marcos millions that fueled these changes were uncovered in
1986, the year a popular revolt drove the dictator from power. The
money had been deposited by four Marcos-controlled foundations,
based in Liechtenstein and Panama, in branches of major Swiss
banks, Credit Suisse and Swiss Banking Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Learning of the large sums, said to be siphoned from
international financial aid, Japanese war indemnity payments, state
monopolies and directly from public and state gold reserves, Swiss
government ministers invoked their emergency powers to freeze the
accounts. Bankers publicly criticized the move as endangering bank
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Bank secrecy had been almost sacred here since it was instituted
in the 1930s. But today, banking secrecy's aura has been all but
destroyed with revelations of its use in hiding Holocaust victims'
accounts, and accepting Nazis' looted gold.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's original explanation, however, was that bank
secrecy would stave off Nazi inquiries into accounts maintained by
Jewish and other refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't stop with the Nazis,'' said Mark Pieth, a Swiss
expert on money laundering. ``The story goes on because after the
war, the practice of accepting money from anyone looking for a safe
place was a boost to the banking system. But the banks let it
deteriorate into a pirate's harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Banking secrecy remained inviolate as late as 1979, when the
Swiss refused to cooperate with Iranian investigators seeking
access to accounts of the deposed Shah of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the early 1980s, millions turned up in Switzerland that
belonged to Mexico's state-owned oil company, as well as to various
dictators, including Jean-Claude Duvalier of Haiti and Haile
Selassie of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   While these cases exposed flaws in banking practices, the Marcos
case would cast a spotlight on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marcos case was a dividing line.'' said Daniel
Zuberbuhler, senior director of the Swiss Federal Banking
Commission. ``Quite a few banks had relations with foreign corrupt
dictators. They argued that if the government had dealings with
them, why shouldn't they?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, two years after the Marcos millions hit the headlines,
Switzerland's banking watchdog instituted a rule that required
in-depth scrutiny of funds from foreign political figures. But with
continued revelations that drug dealers and insider traders, among
others, were depositing money in Switzerland, the effort to clean
up the pirates' haven image was stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, the rule was strengthened so such transactions are
now reviewed at the bank's highest management level. At the same
time, the law bolstered provisions of a ``due diligence'' rule
mandating that banks uncover the actual owner before accepting
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss moved to criminalize money laundering, which had not
been illegal. Last year, the Swiss Parliament again tightened
controls so all money managers, not just banks, must report dubious
assets under threat of strict penalties.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Marcos money also publicly pointed up the weaknesses in
Swiss law for countries seeking to retrieve funds in the country's
banks, said Peter Cosandey, Zurich's veteran prosecutor, who was in
charge of the case for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times I've wondered if the money would be transferred
before I took my pension,'' Cosandey said in an interview in his
Zurich office.
</P>
<P>
   While the case was winding its way through Swiss courts, Marcos
died in 1989 in exile in Hawaii, after his efforts to regain the
millions were rebuffed. In December of the next year, Switzerland's
highest court ruled that the Marcos wealth could be returned to the
Philippines if the country obtained a criminal conviction in a
trial that met European human rights standards.
</P>
<P>
   While the Philippines was struggling to meet that requirement,
years passed and the money sat in Swiss banks, accruing interest as
well as fees for bankers, and swelled to some $570 million.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the return was a tangled series of rulings by
American courts, dealing with claims by victims of persecution
under Marcos, as well as an Atlanta-based company that claimed the
former dictator stole a solid gold statue of Buddha found by a
treasure hunter. When a 1995 decision awarded $1.9 million to
10,000 abuse victims, Swiss banks fought back, successfully arguing
they could be forced to hand over the money twice _ once to U.S.
courts and a second time to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Swiss Parliament, after much debate, overhauled
its 1983 law governing help to foreign countries trying to reclaim
missing funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, there is no question the Marcos case
influenced and shaped the discussion on mutual assistance,'' said
Martin Kurer, a lawyer in Zurich for the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
   The new Swiss legislation also made another key change by
leaving the door open to releasing disputed assets before a foreign
country has concluded its criminal process. The Swiss high court,
which has ruled on the Marcos money nearly 30 times over the past
decade, waived the final conviction requirement in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Tribunal said it was against Swiss interests ``to
serve as a safe haven'' for funds of an ``apparently shady
origin.'' The judges approved returning the funds if the Philippine
government would guarantee that its courts would observe
international human rights standards in deciding who gets the
money.
</P>
<P>
   This summer the money finally was sent back to the Philippines,
where the election of a Marcos family ally as president may allow a
political settlement that could leave Imelda Marcos with some of
the fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss banks have taken a cautionary cue from the Marcos debacle,
and ``the message has gotten through'' about suspect funds, said
Zuberbuhler, the Swiss banking official. He said bank accounts of
the ousted ruler of Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko, and the former
Pakistani prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, serve as examples of
successful Swiss reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these cases, you only found tiny sums in our banks,'' he
said. Mobutu had some $3.4 million, and Ms. Bhutto at least $13.8
million in Swiss accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the very public lessons from the Marcos fortune, it is
unclear whether Switzerland will ever shake off a reputation as a
haven for ill-gotten wealth. Many bankers say the Swiss government
has gone overboard with openness and has crippled its banks'
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But financial watchdog groups contend that every time a dictator
is toppled, not only do reports turn up of suspected Swiss bank
accounts, but quite often the accounts themselves.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his exuberance over the remarkable New York
Yankees season that ended with a World Series championship on
Wednesday night, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has momentarily set aside
his many differences with various politicians - and there are many
_ to invite them all to Friday's Yankees parade that begins at
Battery Park and ends with a reception in front of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable beneficiary of the mayor's good cheer is Peter
Vallone. As speaker of the City Council, Vallone might well expect
to be invited to a citywide, apolitical celebration _ but not
necessarily one thrown by the mayor, and particularly not one
centering on the Yankees organization.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, the Democratic candidate for governor, irked both the
mayor and the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, by
promoting _ unsuccessfully, it seems _ a referendum on whether to
use public financing for a new stadium in Manhattan. The mayor
wanted to preserve that option in negotiating to keep the team in
New York, if not in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   One reflection of the mayor's anger over Vallone's maneuver was
to not invite him to a rally at City Hall this summer that honored
David Wells, a Yankees pitcher, for pitching a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   But victory has a way of breeding generosity. Not only did the
Giuliani administration invite Vallone to Friday's celebration, but
it has included him on the reception's dais, along with various
dignitaries, ballplayers and Yankees officials. A more delicate
matter, perhaps, will be where to seat Vallone in relation to where
Steinbrenner sits, and to where the speaker's opponent, Gov. George
Pataki, sits.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Giuliani adversaries have been invited as well, all
of whom might argue that decorum would require their attendance,
notwithstanding the mayor's mood of the moment. Among others, they
include H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller; Sheldon Silver, the
speaker of the State Assembly; and Mark Green, the city's public
advocate. C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, and
Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president _ both of whom have
differed with the mayor over the Yankee Stadium issue _ have also
been invited, along with the city's three other borough presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Many other political leaders that the mayor does get along with,
more or less, have also been invited, including U.S. Sens. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse D'Amato. Moynihan will not be
attending; D'Amato will.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Roche, Giuliani's press secretary, said that no one
should be surprised by the relatively open invitations, which are
roughly following the etiquette of the city's World Series parade
and reception for the Yankees in 1996. ``This is a time to
celebrate the New York Yankees, arguably the best team in the
history of the game,'' she said. Referring to the mayor's various
political disagreements, she added, ``It's time to put aside those
differences and celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're my best friends,'' marveled Bruce Bender, Speaker
Vallone's chief of staff, who admitted to expecting some tension
over the Yankees celebration. Instead, he said, the mayor's office
is providing a double-decker bus for Council members who want to
participate in the parade, as well as seats for the reception at
City Hall. ``It worked out well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some suspicious types on the City Council side even speculated,
rather uncharitably, that by being so magnanimous, the mayor was
effectively denying Vallone the sympathetic press coverage that a
mayoral snub might create. But the mayor's aides scoffed at such
speculation, and said, simply, it's a celebration of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, City Hall looked more like a catering hall before
an elaborate wedding Thursday than a building for the business of
government. City workers set out some 5,000 chairs in the parking
lot, draped red-white-and-blue bunting onto the 1812 building's
facade, and hung a sign thanking the Yankees for their season of
125 victories. The mayor's name appears on the sign, but only on
the bottom, and in significantly smaller type than the rest of the
lettering.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday _ in which reporters watched as
Giuliani promoted flu shots by receiving a shot himself _ the mayor
talked excitedly, and at great length, about the Yankees and the
parade. Among other observations, he said that the Yankees'
manager, Joe Torre, is the best he has ever seen, that this season
exceeded the city's Subway Series of the 1950s in excitement, and
that _ when asked about students cutting classes to attend the
parade _ he probably learned more by playing baseball than by going
to school. ``About life,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why City Hall was being opened to invited guests for the
Yankees event when recent concerns about terrorism have prevented
it from being used for more mundane rallies, Giuliani said that
access will require a ticket, and that security will be extremely
tight. ``The front of the Capitol of the United States is used for
the inauguration of the president, but they do not allow
demonstrations that create insecure problems and issues for the
members,'' he said. ``So this is a common-sense distinction that's
made all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   By equating a baseball celebration to a presidential
inauguration, Giuliani revealed the giddiness that the Yankees have
been known to bring out in him. He made no apologies: ``I mean,
this is baseball history.''

 &HT;    Tarnished golden boy
 &HT;    Many saw him as a role model, but Jones acknowledges `a
hypocritical life'
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   March 4, 1997. A Tuesday evening in Palm Beach. Already an hour
late, a man drives another 15 minutes lost in the dark, winding
through the streets of PGA National before finally finding the
spring-training rental home of one of baseball's most glamorous
young couples. The doorbell rings. The front door opens. And there
are Chipper and Karin Jones, asking, ``Where ya been? We were
worried about you.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three hours, catching up with the Joneses was a
pleasure. Karin fixed a salad and pasta. Chipper relaxed on the
sofa. Over _ what else? _ a Coke. He recalled his baseball
upbringing in Pierson, Fla., and meteoric rise in the major
leagues; she spoke of their courtship and marriage. Despite the
lingering disappointment of the 1996 World Series, they seemed to
have the world at their bare feet.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, their world was just starting to unravel. That
month, as Jones revealed Wednesday, he began an affair with a
waitress at a Hooter's restaurant in West Palm Beach. The woman
became pregnant and gave birth in March to a son. For Jones, who
has acknowledged paternity and vowed to support the child, it was
one of several extramarital affairs he had after the '96 World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   It has cast Jones, now apologetic and repentant, in a far
different light from his public image. Home and away, he's by far
the most admired, envied and popular Brave. He does more local
endorsements and commercials _ Wendy's, Coca-Cola, a Volvo
dealership, the ``Ask Chipper'' question-and-answer segments on WSB
radio _ than any of his teammates. Teenage girls shriek his name
the way their mothers once shrieked for Paul, John or any of the
Beatles. Until Bobby Cox reprimanded him for outspokeness in a team
meeting before Game 3 of the NLCS, Jones' was the most vocal and
oft-quoted voice in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   That public voice was stilled until right after Atlanta lost
Game 6. The next time Jones spoke for public consumption was
Wednesday, when he admitted to the Morris News Service that he had
committed adultery and fathered an illegitimate child. He publicly
apologized to his wife, fans and the Braves organization.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper and Karin both said their marriage nearly ended but is
stronger now. Still, that union has been much like the cover photo
shot of a September 1996 Sports Illustrated profile of Chipper: A
roller-coaster ride of emotions from '91, when they first met, to
the giddy heights of celebrity and the '95 World Series title in
his rookie year, to the personal trauma of the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Atlantans were stunned by the news of Jones'
infidelity. It is different from Andruw Jones, a single man
involved in a paternity suit over a child born out of wedlock to an
unmarried woman. Different even from Evander Holyfield, who
admitted after his heavyweight title defense last month that he'd
had two more illegitimate children with two separate women. This is
the golden couple, Chipper and Karin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs are scenes from a marriage that has been both highly
public and privately painful:
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of '91, Karin Fulford was between her junior and
senior years at Wesleyan College in Macon. Born in Atlanta and
raised in DeKalb County, the daughter of a now-retired DeKalb
juvenile-court judge, she graduated from Tucker High School, class
of '88. Karin was majoring in early childhood education at Wesleyan
and dating Tyler Houston, a catcher for the Macon Braves, Atlanta's
Class A affiliate in the South Atlantic League. She was waiting for
Houston at a Macon sports bar one night in '91 when she met Jones,
the Braves' No. 1 draft pick in 1990 and Macon's new shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw him, he was not my type at all,'' Karin told
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution during the '95 World Series. ``I
was into preppie guys. And he was sitting there wearing a lot of
gold chains and driving a Corvette.''
</P>
<P>
   A shiny black Corvette, with a vanity license tag: CHIP10. To
this day, Chipper Jones signs his autograph by writing his number,
10, in the lower loop of the script J.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was an immediate attraction,'' Karin recalled. ``We
joked around all night.''
</P>
<P>
   She sensed Jones was too shy to ask her out. So she asked him
for his phone number. He wrote it down on a scrap of paper _ which
Karin still has _ and, eventually, they went out.
</P>
<P>
   Both were blond, good-looking and quickly smitten. When Chipper,
then 19, told his father about the young woman _ two years his
elder _ he'd fallen in love with, Larry Jones was hesitant. But
Chipper said, ``Dad, she's just like Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 12, 1992, Chipper and Karin were married at Mountain
West Church of God in Stone Mountain. After his spectacular 1993
season at Class AAA Richmond, Jones was set to start the '94 season
in left field in Atlanta but tore the anterior cruciate ligament in
his left knee in the last week of spring training and missed that
entire strike-shortened season. The young couple nearly had to sell
their house in Marietta; Karin took a job as a substitute teacher
at Smitha Middle School in Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   For the Joneses, the world was never better than in 1995. One
night, before Chipper hit a dramatic home run, Karin was captured
on TV spilling a drink while walking up an aisle in Atlanta-Fulton
County Stadium. Both the homer, and the spill, were shown later
that night on ESPN's ``SportsCenter.'' The Joneses saw that and
laughed. The next night, a fan held up a sign in the ballpark: ``If
I Was Married to Chipper Jones, I'd Spill My Drink, Too.''
</P>
<P>
   At season's end, Chipper, the Braves new third baseman, was
runner-up to Hideo Nomo as the NL Rookie of the Year. More
importantly, the Braves won the World Series in six games over
Cleveland. And America came to know both Chipper and Karin.
Sportswriters from around the country likened him to a young Mickey
Mantle. When he caught a popup for the final out of Atlanta's Game
1 win, NBC's TV cameras showed Karin in the stands, wearing her
good-luck white cowboy hat and cheering for Chipper.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Chipper Jones was an All-Star, hitting .309 with
30 homers and 110 RBIs. His fans were legion. One afternoon during
the '96 season, a Fernandina Beach, Fla., woman named Dot Williams
was in her home when she heard a sing-song coming from the next
room. Quietly, she peeked around the corner to find her daughter,
Anna, 8, singing a parody of Billy Paul's ``Me and Mrs. Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Me-ee-ee-ee and CHIP-per, Chipper Jones, we got a thing going
on. ...'' It seemed everybody, from big-league general managers to
little girls with a crush, was enamored of Mr. Jones. Later that
summer, the Joneses invited the Journal-Constitution into their
home, for an ``At Home With...'' photo shoot and story. The
four-bedroom Marietta house was casual and comfortable. Hoping for
more space and privacy, however, they were considering a move to a
larger house, and have since moved to Country Club of the South.
One with a nursery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had really hoped to be pregnant by now,'' Karin said then.
``I'm, like, the only Braves wife without kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got lots of time,'' Chipper replied.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1996 World Series ended in Yankee Stadium, Chipper
Jones was in the on-deck circle as Mark Lemke popped out to
complete an Atlanta collapse. After taking the first two games in
the Bronx, the Braves lost four in a row. Sometime after that
crushing ending, Jones told Morris on Wednesday, his extra-marital
activity began. ``I was going through a rebellious period where it
didn't matter what Karin said,'' he said. ``I was going to do the
opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   During the second half of the '97 season, rumors of Jones'
extra-marital activity cropped up in the Braves clubhouse. That
August, the club was slumping badly and playing terribly, and Jones
had committed several uncharacteristic base-running blunders and
mental errors. Some players and people in the organization wondered
privately if Jones was distracted by personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors persisted this season. There were at least two instances
when Jones was heckled at Turner Field. Once was when he was
stepping into the batter's box; after the at-bat, Jones walked to
the stands and confronted the heckler.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the extent of Wednesday's disclosure stunned many. The
Joneses underwent marriage counseling earlier this year. That
alone, Karin said, wasn't enough to convince her the marriage was
worth saving. She nearly left, but has since seen fundamental
changes in her husband. He, too, hopes to atone for ``leading kind
of a hypocritical life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask,'' Chipper Jones said, ``for forgiveness.

CLINTON PRESSES MIDEAST TALKS, AS PROGRESS IS REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVEN ERLANGER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ President Clinton pushed into the night
Thursday to close a deal with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyhau, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, on the eighth
day of talks here.
</P>
<P>
   But solutions seemed to be found on significant issues,
including a Palestinian agreement to revise its charter in a way
Israel wants and to rearrest 30 of the 36 prisoners Israel
originally wanted extradited.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said a deal on a third redeployment of Israeli
troops from the West Bank, as the Palestinians demand, is near.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clear breakthrough on all questions,'' the Israeli
Cabinet minister, Natan Sharansky, said Thursday night. But the
deal was not finished.
</P>
<P>
   As rumors of a deal floated from both delegations, the State
Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, earlier attempted to deflate
expectations of a rapid conclusion, saying that some half-dozen
issues of varying importance remained to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely no deal yet,'' he said. ``On the contrary,
there are still obstacles'' on what he called ``the most complex
and emotion-laden issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do feel we're down to a serious moment of serious
bargaining on serious issues,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues, officials say, include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Israeli demand that the full Palestine National Council
amend the Palestinian charter, formally removing clauses calling
for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   This issue was resolved, Israeli officials said, when the
Palestinians agreed to convene the council along with all other
relevant Palestinian institutions from inside the territories
within a few days of the end of this three-month deal. But American
officials say it's more complicated, involving a main decision by
the Palestinian Executive Council, to be ratified later, in a more
informal way, by ``all relevant bodies, including the PNC.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Palestinian demand that the Israelis guarantee a third
redeployment from the West Bank, called for under the 1993 and 1995
Oslo accords, and not simply subsume that third withdrawal into
talks about a final settlement that would also settle the
Palestinian Authority's final boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say language is being worked out on this issue. A
commission of both sides working in parallel with the final-status
negotiations will handle the timing and size of the third
redeployment, essentially postponing the issue for now, but in a
way, American officials said, that should prevent it from blocking
talks later the way these redeployments have blocked the peace
process for 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Israeli demand for the extradition of 36 Palestinians _ 31
of them wanted for capital offenses like murder. This issue was
resolved with a Palestinian agreement to arrest 30 of the 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Palestinian demand that Israel release some 3,500
Palestinian prisoners arrested for security offenses, as called for
under the Oslo accords, while Israel says it won't release those
``with blood on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials say the Israelis have agreed to release
``several hundred'' prisoners, and that this may be enough for a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   _ The exact method by which Israel will provide safe passage for
Palestinians traveling between the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who arrived Thursday morning for his sixth
day of intense personal involvement here, spent the evening talking
first to Netanyahu while Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
spoke with Arafat, and then vice-versa, in what the Americans
called ``tag-team diplomacy.'' Jordan's King Hussein spoke to the
leaders on the telephone from a nearby farm.
</P>
<P>
   The main discussions were taking place in a tent off the main
dining room, to keep the numbers of participants small, officials
said. Thursday night, Clinton reconvened a joint meeting of the key
members of both delegations to try to finish off the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday evening, the Israeli and the Palestinian
delegations, of about 20 people each, were about 20 feet apart in
the dining room, the Israelis gathered around a fireplace on
couches and chairs and the Palestinians sitting at a table. The
Americans were at the main dining table, with Clinton, Albright,
Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, and special envoy
Dennis Ross huddling over bridging proposals to bring to one side
or another.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin compared the atmosphere to ``a cloakroom, with the feeling
and flavor of a legislative session drawing to a close,'' as final
deals are being made. ``But that doesn't mean that they will draw
to a close,'' Rubin hastened to add. ``But it certainly had that
flavor of a lot of people standing in different parts of the same
room, shuttling between one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin spoke over a speakerphone to a huddled mass of journalists
crowded around a small table in the press center here, at
Chesapeake College.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders were working with the text of an American plan given
to them at dawn Thursday morning. After 19 months of stalemate, the
American plan, a product of hundreds of conversations and many
drafts, seeks to lay out a deal whereby Israel will redeploy from
another 13 percent of the West Bank _ 3 percent to be a nature
reserve _ in return for specific Palestinian steps to combat
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans have been briefing both sides for months on
drafts of the plan, this is the first time it has been physically
handed to the parties.

MARKET PLACE: A TALE OF EXECUTIVES AND EGOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jan Leschly, the chief executive of the London-based SmithKline
Beecham, has never been short for words. He's more than willing to
tell you about Paxil, his company's popular anti-depressant, and
how its sales increased 21 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what Leschly has on his mind these days. He wants
the world to know that he has no intention of retiring early,
regardless of what investors say privately, and of how high his
company's stock has risen _ partly on speculation that he may
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of rumors that I may retire early,'' Leschly
said. ``It is absolutely not true. This is entirely a UK issue,
started by the UK press. People just write too much here in the
UK.''
</P>
<P>
   Leschly's troubles have become a popular topic throughout the
pharmaceutical industry, as well. After watching the falling apart
of three huge drug mergers this year _ attributed largely to a
clash of the chief executives' egos _ investors are scrambling to
find ways to defuse the next boardroom brawl before it can spoil
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this controversy are Leschly and John Stafford,
chairman of American Home Products, who have each had two failed
mergers this year. Analysts have attributed the casualties to the
refusal of both executives, in separate deals, to share power.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the merger between American Home Products and Monsanto
fell apart last week, there has been increasing speculation about
what decisions the top-level executives should be allowed to
make,'' said Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta Partners, a
biopharmaceutical investment firm. ``We may never know the number
of mergers that have gone sour because of people issues, because
most of the deals die before they become public.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors and analysts have been toying with ways to prod a
chief executive to forget his ego and complete whatever deal is
pending. While some analysts think Stafford and Leschly have acted
responsibly in aborting their merger, others are far from
convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Several big institutional investors in Britain seem suspicious
of Leschly's intentions. According to analysts, investors including
Mercury Asset Management are so annoyed by Leschly's aborted merger
with Glaxo Wellcome that they have asked SmithKline's board to buy
him out.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury, along with two other large British investors _
Prudential Portfolio Management and Scottish Widows Investment
Management _ declined to comment. A spokesman for SmithKline denied
that Leschly was about to be asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for American Home Products said its aborted merger
with Monsanto had nothing to do with Stafford personally but was a
mutual decision by both boards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the talk of removing Leschly has touched off an
interesting debate. By allowing a chief executive to block a merger
for personal reasons, the company's directors are putting the
bosses' interests over those of the shareholders. Yet jettisoning a
chief executive who refuses to share power could rob the company of
a savvy leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board members have to think if the strategy they choose is
going to help the company,'' said James Westphal, an assistant
professor of management at the University of Texas. ``You don't
want to throw out a chief executive just because of a failed
merger. That's only one part of his job.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does a board know when it's time for the boss to leave?
Management consultants say the ideal test is to see what happens to
the company's shares when news of that likelihood hits the market.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction could be startling. In the late 1980s, the
departure of Occidental Petroleum's chairman, Armand Hammer, had
been so much anticipated that the company's stock went up after
Hammer once slipped in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock price is a gauge for dismissal, Stafford won't be
leaving any time soon. Shares of American Home Products are up 26.8
percent this year, even after investors took profits earlier this
week. Leschly may not be so fortunate. A person who snapped up
SmithKline shares in London two weeks ago would be 20 percent
richer on speculation about Leschly's imminent departure and a
resulting merger with Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   Still, fans of Leschly and Stafford think that the two are well
worth the headaches their botched mergers have caused. Analysts
point out that Stafford has expanded American Home Products _ the
company bought American Cyanamid, the maker of Centrum vitamins,
four years ago _ and has introduced several promising new drugs
including Rota Shield, a vaccine against rotavirus, the most common
cause of severe diarrhea in children.
</P>
<P>
   Leschly has stocked SmithKline's pharmaceuticals pipeline. The
company has several potential blockbusters under development,
including Avandia for diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leschly may have lost some credibility with the unsuccessful
mergers, but no one wants to see him leave,'' said Nigel Barnes of
Merrill Lynch in London. ``It wasn't just Leschly with the aborted
merger to Glaxo; it was the entire management team. And who could
think SmithKline and Glaxo will merge now? There's no way they
would trust each other.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When SmithKline reported its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday,
Leschly said he would not retire early or be forced out. But
analysts say that the hatchet is far more likely to hit Leschly
than Stafford, mainly because of where their companies are based.
</P>
<P>
   British institutional investors generally have more influence
over domestic companies than their American counterparts do. They
often take larger positions in their home companies and are vocal
about getting the greatest return possible.
</P>
<P>
   Management experts were split on what path SmithKline's board
would ultimately take. Some thought it would allow Leschly to make
his own decision, virtually ensuring his tenure, while others said
he could go, given the positive reaction the stock price has had to
such an outcome.
</P>
<P>
   But there is room for compromise. Leschly could reopen merger
discussions with Glaxo Wellcome, a move that would give investors
substantial short-term gains. When Glaxo announced its intention to
merge with SmithKline at the end of January, the company's American
depository receipts rose 16.6 percent in one day.
</P>
<P>
   Not even rumors of Leschly's leaving have been able to produce
that kind of gain.

AT LEAST 100 BOEING PLANES IN PRODUCTION NEED REPLACEMENT PARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At least 100 airplanes now in various stages of
production at Boeing's Renton and Everett plants have suspect
electrical connectors that must be replaced, and the time-consuming
work has only just started, the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was an acknowledgment of the seriousness of its latest
assembly-line problem.
</P>
<P>
   Planes on the flight lines at both locations that are in
pre-delivery testing have been grounded until they can be inspected
and, if necessary, the suspect parts replaced.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, no planes have been delivered late to customers
because of the parts problem, a Boeing spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   President Harry Stonecipher, in a conference call with reporters
to discuss the company's third quarter results, said airplane
warranty reserves will be used to cover the unexpected costs and
earnings will not be affected. He declined to estimate those costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very little idea how big this is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer disclosed Wednesday that wire shop
testing had found a high failure rate in a batch of 18,000
electrical connectors known as ``Burndy blocks'' that Boeing
received from one of its suppliers. The problem involved a cracked
conductive plate inside the blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Connectors from the suspect shipment were installed on planes in
Everett and in Renton, though none were delivered to customers,
Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, which has
quality control inspectors at Boeing's plants, said the agency is
aware of the problem, but because no planes with the suspect parts
are believed to be in service it does not consider the matter a
serious safety issue.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is serious for Boeing, though, as it struggles to
recover from a series of production woes that caused profits to
tumble and planes to be delivered late to customers. The company is
under the gun to to deliver 550 planes by the end of the year, but
it is running behind schedule and anything that disrupts or
threatens production is cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing does not know precisely which planes have the potentially
faulty parts, so every 747, 777 and 767 jet in production in
Everett must be inspected, as well as all next generation 737s in
production in Renton.
</P>
<P>
   Those inspections can take take upwards of 5 hours per plane,
depending on the model.
</P>
<P>
   The part in question provides a connection for the miles of
electrical wiring in an airplane. The small connector, about 1 inch
by 3/4 inch, is used to transmit power voltage or as a ground.
</P>
<P>
   The number of these connectors in a Boeing plane varies widely,
depending on the model. A 777, for example, has 380 Burndy blocks.
A 747 has only 10 and a 767 has six. The next generation 737, the
plane most effected by Boeing's previous production difficulties,
has 570 Burndy blocks.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Post-Intelligencer Tuesday night, Wolf
Glende, Boeing's chief engineer for 777 systems, said most planes
in Renton and in Everett had been inspected and the suspect parts
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the case, the company acknowledged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokeswoman Yvonne Leach said all planes in Everett have
been inspected and about 35 were found to have the suspect
connectors. But only five have actually had the parts removed and
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are first removing suspect parts in planes on the flight
line, then they will work their way down the assembly lines, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not flying any planes with these defective parts,'' she
said. ``But so far, we have not had any late deliveries because of
this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspections in Renton are only about 30 percent complete, she
said. It's believed about 60 to 65 planes there have the suspect
parts. But as of Thursday, workers had replaced the suspect Burndy
blocks in fewer than 5 planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people working this issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing source who is familiar with the parts problem said the
company's estimate that only about 100 planes are effected ``is
very low.'' The final tally will be significantly more, this person
said.
</P>
<P>
   And even though no planes have been delivered late to customers
because of the parts problem, this person said workers had to
scramble Thursday to yank defective Burndy blocks from a 777 on the
flight line in Everett so it could be turned over to the customer
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Leach said Boeing has enough non-defective Burndy blocks on hand
to avoid delays in getting more connectors from the sole-source
supplier.
</P>
<P>
   About 700 of the connectors are used each day on Boeing's
production lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working closely with our supplier and they can supply
us with about 800 connectors a day,'' she said. That will increase
to about 1,300 a day by next week, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally, who replaced Ron Woodard as head of Boeing's Commercial
Airplane Group Sept. 1 in a management shakeup, said the parts
problem is not expected to throw the company's current production
schedule off track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have assured ourselves that the next month's plan looks
good,'' he said. ``We have enough parts in the production line to
support production. These things happen and they are always hard,
but we feel like this is a manageable situation.''

BANKERS TRUST POSTS LOSS OF $488 MILLION; LAYOFFS EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (dl) 
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bankers Trust Corp. reported a quarterly loss of $488
million Thursday, considerably worse than expected, and announced a
cost-cutting agenda that is likely to mean some layoffs among its
18,300 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The financial results at the big Wall Street banking company
reflected the impact of Russia's default on some debts in
mid-August and upheavals in other foreign markets that deeply hurt
many big U.S. financial businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust said the loss amounted to $4.98 a share for the
three-month period that ended Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus of analysts' forecasts had predicted a loss of $3.70
a share, according to First Call Corp., which tracks earnings
estimates. In last year's third quarter, Bankers Trust earned $246
million, or $2.19 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said it would cut as much as $300 million, or 8
percent, from its annual operating costs. It is widely expected
that Bankers Trust will announce detailed spending cuts, including
layoffs, in the next few weeks. ``The program will target all
costs, but will focus primarily on personnel and agency and
professional-service costs,'' the bank said in a statement on
Thursday. Bankers Trust expects to take the charge for the
restructuring in its fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The problems the bank faces have recently renewed speculation
that it may seek to merge with another, bigger financial
institution. In the last week, there have been reports that Bankers
Trust might entertain a merger with Deutsche Bank after one of the
leading German bank's board members met with several bankers in New
York. Spokesmen for both companies have declined to comment on
these reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankers Trust faces significant challenges,'' said David
Berry, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. ``Their primary
earnings engine _ investment banking _ doesn't have much to do in
this kind of market.'' Berry, who had predicted a loss of $380
million, said he considered Bankers Trust ``significantly more
challenged than the big money-center banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Biggar, an analyst with the Standard &AMP; Poor's equity
group, said, ``Certainly, the per-share loss than was worse than
expected.'' He speculated that the bank would ``cut back on areas
of weakness, areas of the marketplace that they don't see
reviving,'' but he declined to be more specific or to estimate what
layoffs might be in the offing. ``The decisions will be made in the
fourth quarter,'' he added. ``It was a weak quarter, but a lot of
it you could say were one-time events,'' he said, citing the events
in Russia and difficulties in high-yield bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's stock price, he noted, was on Thursday ``up
moderately despite the worse-than-expected results.'' Shares of
Bankers Trust closed at $61.375, up $1.25.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining its poor results, the bank pointed to the
difficult markets of recent months. ``This quarter's disappointing
net loss occurred during one of the most severe global market
dislocations in the post-World War II period,'' said Frank Newman,
the chairman and chief executive, in a statement Thursday.
``Bankers Trust sustained significant losses in emerging-market
debt, high-yield debt and in our equity holdings,'' he added,
alluding to net losses of $309 million in emerging markets, and of
$142 million in investment banking.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Newman has sought to diversify its earnings and re-emphasize the
company's client businesses after the bank was rocked by scandal
involving disastrous losses in derivatives it sold to Procter &AMP;
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   A career banker and former high Treasury Department official,
Newman pursued this strategy by buying Wolfensohn Inc., a New York
investment banking firm, and also acquired Alex Brown Inc., the
Baltimore-based brokerage house. The bank also purchased equity
businesses in Europe last year as it sought to build its worldwide
equity and investment banking businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has, since the beginning of his tenure there,'' worked to
insure that Bankers Trust's businesses would ``be more diversified
and less volatile,'' Biggar of Standard &AMP; Poor's said. ``And he had
been making some headway, although perhaps not fast enough.''

 NAIROBI, Kenya: intelligence services.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a court appearance earlier this month, Ahmed said that he had
contacted the British Embassy in Dar es Salaam the day after the
bombings and offered investigators his help.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed said he returned to the British Embassy twice to meet with
FBI agents. A British diplomat confirmed that Ahmed had come to his
country's embassy, but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them everything I knew,'' Ahmed blurted out in court.
In halting English, he added that it was ``not the first time'' he
had cooperated with Western officials, and that he been doing so
``since last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mwengela, his lawyer, said that his client had approached the
British Embassy after the bombing ``as a good Samaritan'' and that
he wanted to see the information passed on to the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed's claim that he had previously been an informant for both
the Americans and the Egyptians and that he had warned about a plot
to bomb the American Embassy in Nairobi was first reported on Aug.
18 by The Nation, a prominent daily newspaper in Kenya. The paper's
investigative editor, Mutegi Njau, quoted a spokesman for the
American Embassy as denying that it received any warning of the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the spokesman, reiterated that denial to a reporter
for The New York Times in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed's past remains something of a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   He told Kenyan intelligence officials he is an Egyptian who grew
up in Zaire, attended university in Cairo, worked for the Kuwait
Ministry of Defense in the years before the war in the Persian
Gulf, and came to Kenya as a gem dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Almost none of these details have been independently confirmed.
His Tanzanian friends knew him as an Iraqi and when he was arrested
in August in Dar es Salaam, he had passports from Egypt, Yemen and
Zaire, and a thick pile of passport photos, some showing him him
with a beard, others depicting him as clean shaven.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview with Kenyan intelligence officials, Ahmed
asserted that he had met Osama bin Laden, the virulently
anti-American Saudi exile in the mid-1980s. American prosecutors
have identified bin Laden as the mastermind of the embassy
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   When he lived in Sudan, bin Laden directed some of his worldwide
business dealings through a company known as Taba Investments,
prosecutors have said. In Kenya, Ahmed worked as a gem dealer at
Taba International, a company he set up, according to Kenyan
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan officials said he arrived in their country around 1994.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men charged in the United States with bombing the
Nairobi embassy has told Pakistani investigators that he moved to
Kenya that same year at the invitation of ``Mustapha,'' a soldier
who had fought with the United States-financed Afghan rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, said the bombing in Dar es
Salaam was organized by ``Mustafa,'' described in a Pakistani
summary of the interrogation as an ``Egyptian Leader.'' A senior
Tanzanian law enforcement official said these were believed to be
references to Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan authorities deported Ahmed late last year and he appears
to have arrived in Tanzanian soon after.
</P>
<P>
   In Dar es Salaam, he became a regular at the al Rawdah mosque in
the heart of the capital's bustling Kisutu market. With a few
Arabic friends, he often had juice and sweets at the New Kisutu, a
small stand adjacent to the mosque's entrance, a young man at the
stand recalled last week.
</P>
<P>
   This 22 year-old worker, who asked not be named because of fear
for his safety, said he believed that the circle of Ahmed's
associates included Odeh, one of the defendants in the Nairobi
bombing. Odeh's picture has appeared in newspapers in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   About a week before the bombing, Ahmed and his friends stopped
coming, the man said, adding that he has not seen them since.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed did not maintain a low profile in Tanzania. In the days
before the bombings, he called a reporter at a local newspaper, The
Express, peddling a story that his business partner was selling
Iraqis false documents.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, Steven Kyomo, said he spoke three times with Ahmed
on his mobile phone on Aug. 6, the day before the bombings. Three
times, they set a time and place for a meeting. But Ahmed did not
show up.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed has said he was in the Tanzanian city of Arusha on Aug. 7,
which is 300 miles north of Dar es Salaam on the border with Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 8, Ahmed has said he returned to Dar es Salaam, where he
immediately contacted the British Embassy to relate what he knew
about the plot.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, he checked into the Palm Beach Hotel in Dar es
Salaam. He started signing the register with his real name,
Mustafa, but crossed it out, and wrote his name as Muhamed
Mustakeem. He checked out the next morning, but came back that
night, telling the hotel staff not to let anyone know he was there.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, he returned to Arusha and he paid $13 for a night at
the Meru Guest House. He registered as a businessman and presented
a Zairian passport, according to hotel records.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, the hotel's owner, Robert Mbise, recalled
in a recent interview, Ahmed hurriedly departed again for Dar es
Salaam, taking with him $3,500, in U.S. currency that he had put in
the safe deposit box. He asked the hotel to store a plastic bag
filled with documents.
</P>
<P>
   About a week later, the FBI came to the hotel, with Ahmed in tow
to retrieve the cache. He was not hand-cuffed. He did not appear
upset and he joked with FBI agents, said Abdul Baba, the manager of
the hotel restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you asking so many stupid questions?'' Baba recalled
Ahmed saying to the agents. ``Ask clever questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Baba heard one of the agents ask Ahmed why he had used different
names when registering at various hotels. Ahmed replied that it was
because people were always pestering him for money, Baba said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI took the bag Ahmed had left behind and dumped the
contents on a table. There was a Koran, and more than 200
passport-size photographs of various people, and of Ahmed himself,
in various guises.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed told the FBI that he was an importer of food, as well as
cars from Dubai, where he said he had a big agency.
</P>
<P>
   One theory the investigators are chasing is that the 400 pounds
of explosives used in the bombings came by ship secreted in a
shipment of rice consigned to one of the Islamic relief
organizations. Off-loaded at Dar es Salaam, some of the explosives
were then hauled by road north to Nairobi.

 &HT;    Braves' Jones tells of affair, illigitimate child
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO; BBO-CHIPPER-IMAGE; BBO-CHIPPER-FALLEN
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Braves third baseman Chipper Jones shocked the state
Wednesday with the revelation that he fathered an illegitimate
child during a binge of extra-marital activity that began two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The affair nearly ended his six-year marriage with his wife,
Karin, and left Jones living a duplicitous life as wholesome
baseball personality on the outside and fretting philanderer on the
inside. Although Jones has pledged to support the child, born seven
months ago, and has patched up his relationship with his wife
through counseling, the shock waves rippled through the same town
that only last month was stunned by another paternity confession
from heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I had to make a decision on what the most important
thing in my life was,'' Jones told Morris News Service reporter
Bill Zack. ``The most important thing was Karin. So, in order to
keep Karin around, I had to make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who is on a hunting trip in central Georgia, did not
return repeated telephone messages Thursday, and his Alpharetta
home was dark and locked Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The news was hardly welcomed at the Braves' front offices, where
another front-line player, Andruw Jones, who is single, already has
been subject to a paternity suit this year. The public clamor over
the team's early elimination from the postseason, fanned by some
flippant comments from Chipper Jones, had begun to subside, only to
be replaced by a larger public-relations concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever those concerns may be, they are insignificant next to
my concerns for Chipper and Karin,'' club President Stan Kasten
said. ``That's all I really care about.''
</P>
<P>
   It already was an important offseason for Jones, whose four-year
contract with the Braves expires after next season. Jones, who made
$2.5 million last season, is one year short of free-agent
eligibility and is seeking a long-term deal that could more than
triple his salary.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the revelations could jeopardize contract discussions,
Kasten replied, ``I just don't think it's appropriate to connect
the two issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones told Morris he had several sexual flings after the Braves'
1996 World Series and that he befriended a waitress in West Palm
Beach during 1997 spring training. The waitress later became
pregnant. The woman and the child are living in Michigan with her
parents. Details on legal support have not been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going through a pretty rebellious period where, it
didn't matter what Karin said, I was going to do the opposite,''
Jones said. ``I was really self-absorbed. I was going to go out and
do what I wanted to do. I was so self-absorbed there for a while,
the only thing that mattered was self-satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   He informed Karin of the situation last winter, and the couple
has worked since to reconcile the marriage. But the
public-relations hit is not so easily repaired, given Jones' image
and vast following among school-age fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a better role model,'' Jones told Morris. ``I
don't want to be what I've been the first four or five years of my
major-league career.''

NIH BUDGET GETS $2 BILLION BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sharply partisan year that saw tobacco and
health insurance legislation falter, Congress and President Clinton
united with little fanfare behind another major health initiative:
the biggest boost ever in research funding for the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   That is good news for Massachusetts, which gets more in NIH
grants than any state but California. If past trends hold, about 10
percent of the $15.6 billion NIH budget that Clinton signed into
law Wednesday will find its way to Massachusetts laboratories.
Money sent to other states could wind up paying for equipment and
biotechnology products purchased from Boston's large cluster of
high-tech firms.
</P>
<P>
   The money may also help pay overhead costs for several Boston
research hopsitals that are planning new laboratory buildings.
Boston University and the Boston Medical Center are developing as
much as 16 acres of research space off Albany Street, and Tufts
University has proposed 180,000 square feet on Harrison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a period of grant growth, we &UR;  &LR; know we'll be able to pay the
mortgage,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Gelfand, dean for research at Tufts
University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember a time when people have been as optimistic
about the future of biomedical research,'' said Dr. Deborah Cotton,
clinical research director at BU Medical Center. ``For many years,
we've had more ideas and more investigators than could be funded.
We think that will change now because of this new money.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for the new NIH money included an unusual mix of
characters, including Fidelity Investments guru Peter Lynch,
political columnist Morton Kondracke, and Boston attorney Arthur
Ullian, a spinal cord injury patient who has become a leading
advocate of research on the nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   But many lawmakers were ready to spend more on research even
before the lobbyists launched their campaign. From Senator Edward
Kennedy to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, lawmakers say this year's
increase is only a down payment on a plan to double the nation's
research spending within eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The $2 billion boost in the NIH budget, which amounts to a 15
percent increase, was part of a broad commitment by Congress to
scientific research in fiscal year 1999, which began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   At the Defense Department, basic research spending has fallen
for five years when inflation is considered. This year, it will
rise 6 percent, a potential boon for math and computer science
programs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The
Department of Energy, another major sponsor of MIT programs, will
spend 8 percent more on research. Research funding at the National
Science Foundation will rise 8.8 percent, compared to 3 and 4
percent gains in the prior two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the year of NIH,'' said Christopher Jennings, health
policy adviser to Clinton. ``In this year of partisanship, this was
one of the few issues that was nonpartisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates argue for more scientific research every year, but a
variety of factors made the sale easy this time.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the federal government enjoyed a $71 billion
surplus in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, allowing Congress
more latitude in funding new programs without stripping money from
other parts of the government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NIH grants go to a variety of congressional
districts, giving a large number of lawmakers a reason to support
the agency. ``I don't think this is as strategic as some of the
Department of Defense funding has been,'' said Jennings, referring
to the practice of making components for a weapons system in
various states to win greater political support. ``But I'm not
naive enough to suggest this has no relevance.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, new research funding gave Republicans an opportunity
to support a health program in a year when Democrats chastised them
for opposing the ``Patients Bill of Rights.'' That bill would have
given patients new powers when fighting insurers to cover medical
treatment. Pollsters said the bill was popular with voters, but
Republicans said it would raise costs and impose unreasonable
requirements on insurers, who are also major campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   By supporting health research, lawmakers of both parties were
able to tell voters they were working to improve health care.
``Talk about being able to connect with peoples' concerns: There is
not a family in American that you can't touch when you talk about
cancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's,'' said Senator Connie
Mack, a Florida Republican who wants to double NIH funding within
five years. ``It's just a natural thing for us to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for a substantial increase in NIH funding began at
least as early as 1994, the year Republicans took control of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Reliable supporters of medical research, such as Senator Mark
Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, were about to retire, and lobbyists
were hearing that budgets were becoming tighter. ``We were afraid
we had lost our champions, and the Contract with America might be
cause for deep budget cuts,'' said Kevin Casey, director of federal
and state relations for Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard and other universities had already formed a group called
The Science Coalition to lobby for research funding, and fear of
budget cuts swelled the group from 15 members to about 40.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition was not the only group to call for a new
commitment to research. Another organization called ``NIH x 2''
began arguing that the NIH budget should be doubled. Kondracke,
whose wife has Parkinson's disease, helped promote the group and
wrote about the campaign for medical research funding several times
in the political newspaper Roll Call. In his columns, Kondracke
disclosed his personal interest in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   From Boston, Ullian and his colleagues arranged a meeting with
Jennings, the White House health adviser, to lobby for more money.
They also helped organize a Capitol Hill event last summer where
Lynch, the Fidelity stock-picking ace, argued that medical research
benefits the broader economy.
</P>
<P>
   But many lawmakers, such as Kennedy, were already on board. Mack
says the Republican Senate conference backed new research money as
early as January 1997. And according to Casey of Harvard, when
Ullian, Kondracke, Lynch and others met with Gingrich last summer,
the House speaker said he supported new funding, though he wanted
the federal commitment to include math, physics and other fields,
not just medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, is pleased with the idea of doubling the
NIH budget over five years. ``There's no way they could spend that
money responsibly,'' said Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute, a
Libertarian think tank. ``It would be like the Department of
Defense in the early 1980s. They'd be spending $500 for a single
hammer.''

INTELLIGENCE CHIEF STEPS UP TO PLAY A KEY MIDEAST ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A director of central intelligence, says George J.
Tenet, the man who holds the job, ``should be seen and not heard _
and preferably not seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But this week Tenet has been center stage, pressing the Israelis
and Palestinians to make peace. Their talks have been hanging on a
crucial question. Can he create a measure of trust and cooperation
between the Israeli and Palestinian spy services?
</P>
<P>
   It is a role that he has played since 1996, shuttling in secret
to Jerusalem and the West Bank, working the case but never cracking
it. He has arranged to train Palestinian security officers at a
secret base in North Carolina to increase professionalism and
Israeli confidence in them.
</P>
<P>
   He and the Central Intelligence Agency's station chief in Israel
have mediated disputes between their Israeli and Palestinian
counterparts. And Tenet has changed from a suit to casual clothes
in the Israeli Cabinet room, under the gaze of a portrait of Golda
Meir, between meetings with the Israeli prime minister and the
Palestinian secret police.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday he made a last-ditch effort to work on the Israelis
and Palestinians, who may detest each other but appear to trust
Tenet, insofar as trust exists among spies.
</P>
<P>
   ``CIA's relationships with the intelligence services in both
countries allow it to bridge gaps otherwise unbridgeable,'' said
Jeffrey Smith, who as the general counsel of the agency worked with
Tenet on his mediation efforts in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet, who looks and talks like a New York City police
detective, first saw the delicate interplay of nations and
religions as a child while watching customers at the 20th Century
Diner, a restaurant that his father, a Greek immigrant, ran in the
borough of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   He has kept a big shillelagh on his coffee table at CIA
headquarters, twirling it from time to time, playing the tough cop
with the world's evils as his beat. But for eight days he has
played good cop at the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing for the president or the secretary of state to
say, `We're going to professionalize the Palestinian security
service,' and it's quite another to have the guy who's directing
the program say it,'' an administration official said. ``He's built
a degree of political capital with these people. That makes him a
key player.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet, 45, says he does not want to be a public figure. But in
the last week he won a windfall for American espionage, and he
agreed to his first on-the-record interview as director, sending a
message that an agency beset by shortcomings needs an infusion of
money and talent to repair its problems.
</P>
<P>
   With his role in the peace talks Tenet, who barely three years
ago had a low-profile post on the National Security Council staff,
has become a name on the daily news programs, even if not one
American in a hundred knows who he is.
</P>
<P>
   He had been regarded skeptically by some old pros, seen as too
young, too inexperienced, too soft to run the intelligence empire.
Some still say he lacks the gravity to command the senior military
officials who head the Pentagon intelligence services or to control
the clandestine service of the CIA. And that agency's reputation,
damaged for years by self-inflicted wounds, has not been wholly
redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   But if he can repair the agency's battered image, and help make
a lasting Mideast peace deal, he has the potential, in some eyes,
to become the most potent American spymaster in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy will be the best or one of the best,'' said his
predecessor, John M. Deutch, who hired Tenet as his deputy in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Tenet let it be known that he was on a mission to
revive the CIA. ``Unless you bring more people in and unless you
develop the expertise, we won't achieve what we want to achieve,''
he said in an interview. ``In 10 years we won't be relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   That problem may be nothing that billions of dollars and
thousands of talented new people cannot solve.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet won an additional $1.8 billion from Congress on Wednesday
for the intelligence agencies that he oversees, bringing the budget
to $29 billion. The CIA spends 10 percent of that.
</P>
<P>
   Some money will jump-start the biggest recruitment drive in CIA
history and some to spy satellites and supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring a new generation of spies and analysts is crucial, he
said. ``I want people to know that this is not a fat old
organization just asking for money,'' Tenet said. It has to pay for
new people, ``recruitment, retention, pay, performance, education
and training,'' and new equipment or hang up its cloak and dagger.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tenet said he realized that to rebuild the agency he would have
to win public trust. That may come only through public victories in
the wars to penetrate terrorist groups and to understand, and
sometimes undermine, nations like Iraq, where the United States has
no embassies, no spies and no crystal ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an expectation that we have built a no-fault
intelligence system,'' Tenet said. ``That intelligence is expected
not only to tell you about the trends and to tell you about events
and give you insight, but in each and every case has a
responsibility to tell you when the date, time and place of an
event is. That will not happen. We will continue to be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States lacks the brainpower and technology to avoid
those surprises, he said. ``There will always be days where we have
to race to catch up to events we did not foresee, not because
somebody is asleep at the switch, but because what's going on is so
complicated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said he had focused on rebuilding morale and now needed to
turn to trying to manage other intelligence agencies like the
National Security Agency that are run by senior military officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest challenge for him,'' said Rep. Porter J.
Goss, R-Fla., who is a former CIA officer and is now chairman of
the House Intelligence Committee. ``That's not where he has the
experience and the good-old-boy network he has elsewhere. He has
got to be the director of central intelligence,'' not just head of
the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   But Tenet does have power with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, said Louis J. Freeh, the director of that agency who
as a young field agent in Queens sipped many a cup of coffee at the
20th Century Diner. ``Nice place,'' Freeh remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, when the CIA and the FBI tried to work together
overseas against terrorists and thugs, mistrust prevailed. By
instinct and training an FBI agent confronted with a criminal wants
to string him up. But a CIA officer wants to string him along, to
learn what he knows. Now the two chiefs get along much better,
Freeh said, and the arrests in the African embassy bombings prove
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to trust and understanding,'' he said. ``George
is someone I can absolutely trust.''

1.4 MILLION BLACK MEN DISENFRANCHISED, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Mass., Utah, Vt., Ala., Fla., Iowa, Miss., N.M., Va.,
Wash., Wyo.) (mk) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nationwide, 1.4 million African-American men _ 13 percent of all
black men _ cannot vote because of their criminal records,
according to a report made public Thursday by Human Rights Watch
and the Sentencing Project, two nonprofit research and advocacy
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Every state except Maine, Massachusetts, Utah and Vermont denies
prisoners the right to vote. And 15 states bar former felons from
voting even after they have served their sentences; 10 of them
impose lifetime disenfranchisement on anyone convicted of a felony.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama and Florida, nearly one in every three black men is
permanently disenfranchised, and in Iowa, Mississippi, New Mexico,
Virginia, Washington and Wyoming, the ratio is about one in four.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proportions in some black communities are so large now
that we've reached the point where this is an issue that can
potentially affect some elections,'' said Marc Mauer, assistant
director of The Sentencing Project, and co-author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a basic question of democratic rights and societal
inclusion,'' Mauer added. ``Given our low rate of voter
participation, we should be looking for ways to encourage people to
vote, not locking them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, 3.9 million men and women of all races are
disenfranchised, according to the report, the first state-by-state
analysis of criminal disenfranchisement. Of those, nearly 1.4
million are former offenders who have completed their criminal
sentence, another 1.4 million are on probation or parole, and more
than a million are in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But the report cautioned that all numbers should be considered
estimates, since necessary data at the state level were often
incomplete or available only for selected years.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, former offenders can regain the right to vote in
states where reinstatement is not automatic, usually by order of
the governor or action of the parole or pardons board. But in
practice, the report said, that rarely happens: In Virginia, for
example, where every felon loses the right to vote for life, and
only the governor can restore it, only 404 of the state's 200,000
ex-convicts have had their voting rights restored in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, no other democracy denies as many
people, either in absolute or proportionate terms, the right to
vote because of their criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least, it seems to me that the states that
permanently disenfranchise ex-offenders should reconsider those
policies,'' Mauer said, ``not only because they are so racially
discriminatory, but because they fly in the face of the idea that
once you've paid your debt to society, you should be able to take
your place back in the community.''

 &HT;    Georgia students earn stake in shuttle mission
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook and Diane R. Stepp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ Does your chewing gum lose its flavor on the
Shuttle overnight? Does your popcorn pop or crayons melt when they
fly into outer space?
</P>
<P>
   These are things inquisitive second-grade students at Dowell
Elementary School in Marietta want to know, and NASA is going to
help them get the answers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the space agency's student education program, the
class is among eight others in the nation whose experiments were
chosen to fly aboard next week's nine-day shuttle mission, the one
that will carry former astronaut John Glenn back into space.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several days, an NBC film crew has been at the
Marietta school taping the students as they prepare for their
high-flying experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The network will be broadcasting live from the school next
Thursday when the shuttle lifts off. (cq ds) The student's
experiment, which NASA has dubbed ``Effects of Microgravity on an
Object's Physical Characteristics,'' will fly in a container in the
shuttle's cargo bay. Inside the container will be 20 vials
containing a variety of everyday items: chewing gum, popcorn,
bread, stickers, paper clips, chalk, crayons and bubble wrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objects will be examined by the students after the vials
fly in the shuttle to see if there are any changes,'' said
assistant principal Denise Feezor.
</P>
<P>
   Dowell's experiment was selected by NASA after first-grade
teacher Andrea Apple submitted her class' proposal over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations for the experiment began last year, when the
students were in the first grade. In science class, they had been
chewing gum and doing taste tests to see how quickly the gum runs
out of flavor. Chewed gum and some unchewed gum will fly on board
the shuttle, and the students will check the unused gum to see if
its flavor is depleted after flying in space.
</P>
<P>
   The students will also send popped popcorn and unpopped popcorn
on the shuttle to see if the unpopped corn loses any of its
explosive properties. They also want to see if microgravity and
being closer to the sun has any effect on crayons and chalk.
</P>
<P>
   Dowell third-graders have also built a replica of the Friendship
7 space capsule in which Glenn became the first American to orbit
the earth in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping back for a critical view of the nearly life-sized
model, third-grader Kimberlee Chauncey, 8, announced her assessment
of Glenn's first ride into space: ``He must have been really
squished and scared, but happy that he was going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are used to seeing (the movie) `Apollo 13' and
don't realize how little room there was on the early space
capsules,'' said third-grade teacher Dorrie Harrell, who was
herself a third-grader in Texas when she and her classmates watched
Glenn lift off.
</P>
<P>
   Alexia Holdiman, 8, thought it noteworthy that Glenn had lights
on the tips of his gloves to help him see the instrument panel on
his first ride and that the early spacecraft had no computers.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hord, 8, has a word of advice for Glenn. ``I hope you have
a safe trip. Just be careful not to run out of fuel or oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids are hoping to meet their hero in person. He's been
invited to visit Dowell in March, said Feezor.

 &HT;    Cops compare hotel slayings
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A motel slaying in College Park that occurred just two days
before the weekend triple murder at an upscale downtown Atlanta
hotel has investigators from both agencies comparing notes to
determine whether they are related.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Police Maj. Mickey Lloyd said Thursday Atlanta
investigators contacted College Park this week to discuss the Oct.
15 fatal shooting at a Days Inn on Old National Highway and the
Oct. 18 triple, execution-style murders at the Atlanta Hilton &AMP;
Towers on Courtland Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to them and we've met with them to talk about the
cases,'' Lloyd said. ``We haven't ruled anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerrold Shropshire of Altamonte Springs, Fla., Ronnie Gutkowski
of Leesburg, Fla., and Phillip Dover of Gainesville, were found
shot in the back of the head in room 2414 of the Hilton early
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Deputy Chief C.B. Jackson has said the men probably were
shot sometime after midnight on Sunday in a hotel that was only
half-occupied.
</P>
<P>
   There was no forced entry to the cramped, cream-colored room,
which overlooks two tennis courts and the city's skyline.
</P>
<P>
   College Park Detective David O'Neal said his case bears some
similarities to Atlanta's.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, 19-year-old Ladaris Hawkins was shot in the face
with a handgun after he either let someone into his motel room or
perhaps gave someone a key. O'Neal said Hawkins, who lived at the
hotel, was found on his bed, but did not die until he arrived at
the hospital. Crack cocaine also was found in Hawkins' underwear,
O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a robbery-homicide,'' O'Neal said. ``The victim
didn't have a wallet on him. We believe he may have been awoken by
this person.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal would not discuss other similarities between the two
incidents. The victims' bodies also have been released to the
families for funerals, the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office
said. Blood samples to determine whether the victims had drugs and
alcohol in their systems have been sent to the GBI.
</P>
<P>
   Dover's funeral was Thursday. Mourners in Central Florida plan
to say goodbye to Gutkowski, 51, and Shropshire, 50, in services
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in Atlanta asked their counterparts in Central
Florida this week to look into the background of Gutkowski and
Shropshire, and a search turned up no evidence that Florida police
have had dealings with either man.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Don Gregory of the Lake County Sheriff's Department said
their search for any police contact yielded results that jibe with
descriptions from friends and relatives that Gutkowski and
Shropshire were family men who went to church and steered clear of
trouble. ``We have no indication of these gentlemen being involved
in anything,'' Gregory said Wednesday. ``We've done a complete
history.''

   Texas board votes down border nuclear dump
</P>
<P>
   By Hilary Hylton
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - A Texas commission voted Thursday to deny a
crucial permit for a proposed nuclear waste dump near the
U.S.-Mexico border, making it unlikely the controversial facility
will be built.
</P>
<P>
   The dump was opposed by environmentalists and the Mexican
government, who said the site at the west Texas town of Sierra
Blanca, 16 miles from the Rio Grande, was not safe because of a
nearby geological fault.
</P>
<P>
   The three-member Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission,
the state's environmental regulators, voted unanimously against the
dump. Chairman Barry McBee said there were enough doubts about the
facility's safety to deny an operating license.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is insufficient direct evidence about the fault. Without
that we cannot truly get a sufficient picture of how it would
perform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was welcomed by Mexican Environment Minister Julia
Carabias, who said: ``This underscores the good neighbor policy
which the Mexican government has been demanding for several months
from the United States and opens the way for an atmosphere of
collaboration for the well-being of the frontier zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a triumph for the Mexican people and the government,
which together opposed the project,'' she added in a news
conference at the Mexico City airport.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's decision was a serious blow to the proposed
dump, but not a final one. Supporters, who include Texas' largest
utility companies, said they would likely ask for a rehearing by
the commission within the next 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised and disappointed. The science showed this was a
good site,'' said Lawrence Jacobi, general manager of the Texas
Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority, the state agency
that selected the proposed site.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's vote was greeted by cheers from opponents, who
have waged a long battle against some of the state's most powerful
economic interests. They had accused dump supporters of
``environmental racism'' because Sierra Blanca is a poor and mostly
Hispanic town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel my prayers have been answered. I was bracing myself for
another defeat,'' said Maria Mendez, a 66-year-old Sierra Blanca
resident - one of the few in the town of 500 who opposed the dump.
Most wanted it because it would bring jobs and money.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Blanca is in a harsh and sparsely populated region about
90 miles east of El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   David Duggins, a spokesman for the state's utilities, said the
only place that nuclear waste could now be stored was at a dump in
South Carolina. He told the commission that ``Texas has an
obligation, a moral and legal obligation'' to construct its own
facility.
</P>
<P>
   The dump, utilizing concrete canisters buried 16 feet
underground, would have stored radioactive waste from hospitals,
industry and nuclear power plants in Texas, Maine and Vermont, the
latter two of which would have paid $55 million to Texas. The U.S.
Congress and President Clinton approved the compact between the
states this summer, which many thought would clear the way for the
dump's final permit.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexican officials, including President Ernesto Zedillo,
lobbied hard against the permit in meetings with Texas Gov. George
W. Bush. So powerful were sentiments in Mexico that a group of
Mexican congressmen staged a hunger strike to protest the dump.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, considered a front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination in 2000, cautiously took no stand except to say that the
dump would not be allowed if it was unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   He said the decision would be left to the resource commission,
whose members are all Bush appointees.

U.N. ISSUES AGAIN: IRAQ, NERVE GAS AND WEAPONS INSPECTONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Experts on chemical and biological weapons met
here on Thursday to examine whether Iraq loaded deadly nerve gas on
some of its missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place as the United Nations is set to consider
on Friday questions posed by Iraq about what it can expect if it
reopens the country to U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Neither development holds out any sign of a breakthrough in the
impasse that began on Aug. 5, when Iraq boycotted the United
Nations because it wanted to see some hope of ending the sanctions
imposed on it after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is now angling for a ``comprehensive review'' of its
cooperation over the last eight years in destroying its nuclear,
chemical and missile weapons. It charges the United Nations Special
Commission, which conducts the inspections, with engaging in a
political vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has accused the commission, known as UNSCOM, of being
subservient to the United States, which is opposed to lifting the
sanctions as long as Saddam Hussein remains president of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western envoy described Iraq's attempt to obtain a
pledge of some leniency as ``a foolish move that makes them look
like they are imposing conditions.'' The official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said, ``We are not willing to do anything
until they come into compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, exchanges on Thursday suggested further escalation
of this confrontation. Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapon
inspector and head of UNSCOM, accused Iraq of diverting attention
from its manufacture of the deadly nerve gas VX.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are calling us spies,'' he said in an interview with
Reuters Television. ``The real issue is VX. They have never, ever
told us the truth of how much of that hideous nerve gas they
made.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has reported that in June its military
laboratory at Aberdeen, Md., found traces of VX on some metal
fragments of shells taken from a weapons-demolition site in Iraq
without UNSCOM supervision. Similar tests were conducted on other
samples in French and Swiss laboratories when Iraq questioned the
objectivity of the American report. The results of the French tests
are unclear; the Swiss said they found no trace of the nerve gas in
their tests.
</P>
<P>
   The 18 scientists gathered here for an examination of the tests
are expected to end their meeting on Friday and results are
expected to be released on Monday. However, the senior Western
official said the results might not be conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Banking instead on a new and separate comprehensive review _
which the Security Council hinted it will accept _ Iraq is
exploring the possibility of having inspections resume on different
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The questions raised by Iraq include, among other things,
whether new inspections could begin immediately after its allows
U.N. inspectors into the country. The United States had suggested a
waiting period of six to eight weeks. Iraq also asked whether
``some degree of uncertainty will be acceptable'' in evaluating its
efforts to destroy its weapons, noting that different experts could
interpret tests in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq also asked whether experts other than UNSCOM officials can
be included in the effort. And it asked ``in which manner would
Iraq be invited to participate in the review,'' and what role the
Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, would play. In
the past Iraq has favored a greater role for Annan.

FISHER-PRICE RECALLS UP TO 10 MILLION BATTERY-DRIVEN VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (dl) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the largest recalls in the toy industry, Fisher-Price
is pulling up to 10 million battery-driven Power Wheels cars and
trucks off the market for repairs because they can catch fire or
fail to stop while children are riding them.
</P>
<P>
   The products, which can also catch fire while not in use,
contain electrical-component defects and faulty wiring that can
cause them to overheat and catch fire or fail to stop, according to
the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which announced the
recall Thursday. The problems have caused nine children to suffer
minor burns to the hands, legs or feet, six others to suffer
bruises and scrapes, and have resulted in up to $300,000 in
property damage to houses and garages, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the safety commission and the company, a unit of Mattel,
have received nearly 700 reports of electrical problems and about
150 involving fires. There have also been 71 reports of vehicles
not stopping.
</P>
<P>
   The toys are intended for children 2 to 7 years old. They reach
speeds of up to 5 miles per hour and sell for $70 to $300.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can take the toys to Power Wheel service centers,
whose locations can be obtained by calling the company at
(800)-977-7800. The recall involves Power Wheels sold after 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The toys have been sold under nearly 100 model names, like Jeep
Adventure Team, Barbie Beach Buggie and My First Roadster. The
Power Wheels logo is on all types, and the company said it would
help consumers determine whether their Power Wheel model was part
of the recall.
</P>
<P>
   Although the recall is considered voluntary because it did not
require the safety commission to sue the company to bring it about,
the agency's chairman said Thursday that the toys remained on the
market two years longer than necessary because of the company's
repeated lack of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We first learned in late 1996 and early 1997 of fires in these
vehicles and we learned about it from consumers. We then had to go
to Fisher-Price to get this recall. It took a long time; they were
slow and difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company and safety commission are still at odds
about the action. The agency says it is investigating why
Fisher-Price withheld information about potential problems with
Power Wheels for two years, but the company maintains that it was
under no obligation to provide the information even though, by law,
manufacturers must report product defects as soon as they are aware
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher-Price insisted, however, that the problems stemmed from
``consumer tampering'' and not design defects. According to the
company, consumers replaced burned-out fuses with incompatible ones
or used metal objects such as paper clips to jump-start the cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those involved in fires we sent to independent fire forensic
experts and what we found in virtually every single instance was
that the fire was related to tampering,'' said Sean Fitzgerald,
vice president of corporate communications for Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   The safety commission said the company's characterization of the
problems was disingenuous at best. ``I think that is a totally
irresponsible charge and one that is rather heartless,'' Ms. Brown
said. ``Our engineers found an inherent design defect after
extensive testing,'' adding that the problem was with the
engineering system and ``if there was consumer tampering there
would be no recall. The very fact that they are going along with
this recall is an admission that there is a defect.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She said the company also backed out of an agreement Thursday
that required it to distribute a video news release containing
footage of the products and urging consumers to return them for
repairs. Such releases, which are a standard requirement in recall
agreements and typically reach 20 million television viewers, are
among the agency's most effective method of informing the public of
such actions, said Ms. Brown, adding that the commission
distributed the footage on its own, over Mattel's objection.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel also released third-quarter financial results Thursday
and said it took a $270 million charge against profits in the
period to pay for the recall and product modifications. And Toys R
Us, the nation's largest toy retailer, said it was pulling the
product off of shelves in its 700 stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have notified all of our stores to stop selling the item
and they will not be sold until Fisher-Price makes the
corrections,'' said Rebecca Caruso, vice president of corporate
communications at Toys R Us.
</P>
<P>
   The recall is not expected to significantly impact Mattel's
bottom line because the product line is a small contributor to the
company's annual revenues of nearly $5 billion. ``It is a one-time
item which has a cost attached to it but it's not part of the
company's ongoing business,'' said David Leibowitz, an analyst who
follows the company for Burnham Securities. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland _ The global financial turmoil has jolted
big banks across Europe and the United States, but few can match
the woes in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   First came the agreement this summer by the biggest Swiss banks,
led by Credit Suisse Group and UBS AG, to pay $1.25 billion to
settle a suit brought by Holocaust survivors concerning plundered
wealth that had been stored in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in September, Credit Suisse acknowledged it had lost at
least $500 million through its activities in Russia. Most analysts
say the total losses could easily be twice that.
</P>
<P>
   And three weeks ago, the chairman of UBS abruptly resigned after
the bank lost $780 million in connection with the near-collapse of
Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   More bad news is probably on the way. Most analysts say Credit
Suisse will have to write off at least another $500 million in
Russian debt, while UBS faces a mountain of potential trouble in
Latin America _ not to mention the lingering possibility of more
bombshells from wayward derivatives trading.
</P>
<P>
   All this has gravely undermined the elite mystique of Swiss
bankers as being too stable and sure-footed to be tripped up by the
lure of fast money. Such stumbling also carries international
significance, given the global reach of both institutions. After
its merger in January with Swiss Bank Corp., UBS is by some
measures the world's biggest bank.
</P>
<P>
   And though both banks can easily handle their losses, their
dignity and credibility will be far more difficult to repair.
Indeed, the very notion of a ``Swiss'' bank is under strain. Two of
UBS' top executives now are American, including the man who is
charged with redefining ``risk'' for the entire institution: a
33-year-old derivatives wizard from Chicago named David Solo.
</P>
<P>
   UBS is also still struggling with a sweeping reorganization in
the wake of its merger with Swiss Bank and its trading catastrophe
with Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have had so far are only profit warnings,'' said
George Koh, an analyst at Paribas Capital in London. ``But sooner
or later they are going to have to take new provisions'' for
expected losses.
</P>
<P>
   How much? UBS has not spelled out much about its exposure to
risky loans; its looming losses are unclear but are expected to be
big. At Credit Suisse, which has provided detailed information
about its loan portfolios and trading activities, Koh and others
are betting on $1 billion in additional losses just from Russia and
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the turmoil, the two banks appear to be responding in very
different ways. Ever since UBS stunned the industry by announcing
that its chairman would resign, the bank has hunkered down in
silence to rethink its strategy toward higher-risk activities like
proprietary securities trading and investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   UBS executives refused to be interviewed, but the bank told
shareholders recently that it was re-evaluating its ``risk
profile.'' Some industry experts speculate that UBS might go so far
as to sell or spin off its investment bank, Warburg Dillon Read,
though most analysts say it will simply hew to a far more
conservative tack.
</P>
<P>
   At Credit Suisse and its investment bank, Credit Suisse First
Boston, executives remain almost pugnaciously determined to stick
to their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some European banks will decide this is a business they do not
want to be in,'' said Richard Thornburgh, Credit Suisse's chief
financial officer. ``It appears to us that there is an opportunity
here to capitalize on the reduction in capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though UBS and Credit Suisse face different problems, both have
been expanding in more profitable but riskier areas. Because of
Switzerland's historic role as an international financial center
and the country's small domestic market, both banks are far more
internationally minded than other European banks, and far less
dependent on traditional commercial lending.
</P>
<P>
   UBS became one of the world's biggest banks when it merged with
Swiss Bank Corp. early this year. But the giant new bank is now
having intense heartburn because of its problems in Russia and Asia
and its disastrous involvement with Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   The bank revealed last month that it had lost $780 million
through a complex series of transactions with the American hedge
fund, in part because top bank executives had failed to realize the
extent of their exposure. Hoping to restore some of the bank's lost
credibility, Matthis Cabiallavetta, the chairman, resigned along
with other top executives on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the problems appear to have originated at the old
UBS, which lost more than $450 million on derivatives trading in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from the old Swiss Bank, which had a much bigger
business in derivatives, are now largely in control of the combined
operation. Marcel Ospel, who built up much of Swiss Bank's
investment banking business, is UBS' chief executive. Solo, the
33-year-old chief operating officer of UBS' Warburg Dillon Read,
has been named to the new job of ``chief risk officer.''
</P>
<P>
   But UBS' problems extend beyond its adventures with hedge funds.
Many were dismayed Sept. 24 when UBS announced a loss of $468
million in emerging markets, much of it in Russia. Just four weeks
earlier, the bank had said its losses in Russia were only about
$133 million.
</P>
<P>
   UBS also has a big exposure to Latin America, which has become
infected by much of the currency turmoil that hit Asia and Russia.
Total exposure in Latin America is about $3.56 billion, but the
bank has taken provisions adding up to less than 10 percent of that
amount.
</P>
<P>
   That percentage would be ``certainly too low,'' said Morgan
Stanley in a recent report, should the region endure more financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse's biggest problem is Russia. In a bold bid to
capitalize on the reconstruction of Russia after the fall of
communism, Credit Suisse First Boston became the dominant dealer in
Russian government bonds, accounting for 40 percent of the trading
activity. It also became a big lender to Russian companies and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Credit Suisse has estimated its exposure in Russia _
through government bonds, currency contracts, loans and trading
activities _ at about $3 billion. The bank has set aside about $1
billion in provisions, but most analysts now assume it will need to
set aside far more.
</P>
<P>
   ``My assumption is they have another half-billion or billion to
go,'' said John Leonard, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Thornburgh of Credit Suisse conceded that more provisions may
well be necessary, but said the ultimate extent of the losses will
depend in large part on how the Russian government restructures its
bonds and how Russian banks decide to meet their commitments.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake we made in Russia was that no one ever thought
that you would get the combination of a devaluation, a default and
a fall of the government _ and effectively the government has
fallen,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse's Russia problems come in several flavors. As of
early September, it had trading positions in Russian government and
corporate bonds worth $147 million. It also had about $1 billion in
loans to government agencies or big Russian companies, like the
natural-gas conglomerate Gazprom, and about $571 million in loans
to other corporations and banks.
</P>
<P>
   Many loans were made in the expectation of underwriting future
bond offerings, whose proceeds would be used to pay off the loans.
But bond offerings are now virtually impossible, and the bank is
waiting to see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest dangers is in currency contracts, which are
usually entered with Russian banks to hedge against a devaluation
in the ruble. These contracts were crucial for investors buying up
Russian bonds, which pay high interest rates _ but only in rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse said it has about $1.1 billion worth of these
contracts on its books, money that Russian banks theoretically owe
it in the wake of the ruble's plunge in value since the summer. But
the Russian government has imposed a moratorium on paying off these
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criticism that everyone can make is that our concentration
on Russia was too high,'' Thornburgh said. ``But there was nothing
wrong about the activity in itself. This is what banks do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Russia's economic collapse, Credit Suisse said
last week it would eliminate about 100 jobs in that country. But in
most parts of their business, bank executives say they have no
intention of retrenching.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Switzerland's two big banks are hardly alone. Scores
of other big American and European banks, from Deutsche Bank in
Germany to BankAmerica, have taken big losses in Asia and Russia.
Spain's biggest banks have huge exposure in Latin America, as do
American and German institutions. Compared with Japan's big banks,
many surviving only on life support, the giant Swiss institutions
are bastions of robust health.
</P>
<P>
   For all the problems, some analysts argue that the Swiss banks
retain important advantages over rivals like Deutsche Bank or
ABN-Amro of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of the euro as a single European currency _ even
though Switzerland will remain outside the new currency zone _ the
overwhelming trend in Europe is toward a handful of money-center
banks, said Hans Kaufmann, an analyst at Bank Julius Baer in
Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will happen in the new euro area is that major companies
will not need 11 different local banks,'' Kaufmann said. ``They
will go for the major banks that are capable of organizing
large-scale economies. At the end of the day, there is only one way
you can survive and that is by being efficient.''

BOEING BEATS 3RD-QUARTER FORECASTS, ALTHOUGH JET ORDERS ARE
THREATENED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash.)  (dl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. reported third-quarter earnings Thursday that
were higher than expected, but it warned that the recession in Asia
would cause it to lose more airplane orders than it had previously
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the aerospace giant based in Seattle, became profitable
during the quarter after facing production problems and other
difficulties last year that forced it to take a $1 billion charge.
But with the economic downturn in Asia threatening to spread to
Europe and the United States, it appears that Boeing's internal
troubles caused it to miss out on one of the biggest airplane booms
in history. By the time next year when the company's airplane
division is expected to be fully recovered, demand for new jets is
expected to be declining.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, the company earned $347 million, or 36 cents a
share, on $12.7 billion in revenue. The per-share figure was well
above the average estimate of 27 cents forecast by Wall Street
analysts surveyed by the First Call Corp. In the period a year
earlier, Boeing reported a loss of $696 million, or 72 cents a
share, on revenue of $11.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were puts and takes that got you to the slightly better
number than expected,'' said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York. ``Most of it was driven by other income
and tax benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives said the company was re-examining its market
forecasts in light of Asia's economic turmoil. Airlines serving
Asia are responsible for a large part of the sales of Boeing's 747
jumbojet, its most lucrative civilian airplane. But many airlines
have reduced their flights in the region over the last year or are
switching to smaller planes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing recently increased production of the 747 and the newer
777 widebody to five and seven a month but was planning to reduce
production in the middle of next year. Now, it is considering
cutting the production rates even further. The company says it is
holding 34 completed planes in storage while its customers try to
come up with the money to pay for them or Boeing tries to line up
alternate buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company is still struggling to meet its
production schedules. To meet its target of delivering 550
commercial airplanes this year, it must produce 182 during the
fourth quarter, more than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mulally, who was named head of Boeing's commercial airplane
division last month after the ouster of his predecessor, Ronald
Woodard, said Thursday that Boeing was delaying previously
announced plans to begin production of 737 narrow-body jets in Long
Beach, Calif., so the company could focus on meeting its delivery
schedule.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Boeing was dealt a new setback recently when it learned that one
of its suppliers had shipped it thousands of defective electrical
connectors. Mulally said that no planes containing the faulty parts
had been delivered to customers and that enough functioning parts
were available to allow production to continue. But workers must
spend hours inspecting recently completed planes to find out which
ones were affected and then fix them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all its travails and weakening demand for its commercial
airplanes, some analysts think Boeing, which has seen its stock
fall 35 percent since April, has turned the corner. Nicholas
Heymann, the aerospace analyst at Prudential Securities who was one
of the first on Wall Street to turn bearish on Boeing last year,
upgraded his advisory on the stock Thursday to ``accumulate'' from
``hold.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Boeing executives were beginning to cut costs and
that the company would start generating a large amount of cash next
year. Indeed, Boeing announced a stock repurchase plan in August
and said Thursday that it spent $364 million to buy 10.6 million of
its own shares in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we believe people will have to revise upward
their estimates after having revised them down for six quarters,''
Heymann said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing shares closed Thursday at $36.4375, up 43.75 cents, on
the New York Stock Exchange.

CLINTON PRESSES MIDEAST TALKS, AS PROGRESS IS REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ Critical issues were apparently resolved
Thursday at the Middle East peace talks as President Clinton pushed
into the night to close a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Possible solutions emerged on issues that include a agreement by
the Palestinians to revise their charter to remove clauses calling
for the destruction of Israel and to arrest 30 of 36 Palestinians
the Israelis want extradited.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said a deal on a third withdrawal of Israeli
troops from the West Bank, as the Palestinians demand, is near.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clear breakthrough,'' the Israeli industry
minister, Natan Sharansky, said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal was not finished, and American officials sought to
deflate expectations of a rapid settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ``spirits are good _ he is determined to stick with
this as long as it's a productive use of his time,'' Joe Lockhart,
the White House spokesman, said Thursday night. He and James P.
Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said advances but not
resolutions were made on a number of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the half dozen serious issues, there have been advances,''
Rubin said. ``But an advance doesn't mean that it's closed,'' Rubin
said. ``I've seen them talk for hours over a few words.''
</P>
<P>
   One critical issue apparently resolved Thursday night involved
the Israel demand that the full Palestine National Council amend
the Palestinian charter, formally removing 26 clauses calling for
the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   This issue was resolved, Israeli officials said, when the
Palestinians agreed to convene the council along with all other
relevant Palestinian institutions in the territories within days
after this three-month deal concludes.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials say it is more complicated, involving a
main decision by the Palestinian Central Council, to be ratified
informally after thatby ``all relevant bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Palestinian and Israeli officials say Clinton will attend
that larger meeting, presumably in Gaza, in person, but there was
no immediate confirmation from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue was the Palestinian demand that the Israelis
guarantee a separate troop withdrawal from the West Bank, the third
called for under the 1993 and 1995 Oslo accords. The Palestinian do
not want it to be simply wrapped into talks about a final
settlement that would also settle the Palestinian Authority's final
boundaries. Officials say language is being worked out on this
issue.
</P>
<P>
   A commission of both sides working in parallel with the final
peace talks will handle the timing and size of the third
redeployment, essentially postponing the issue for now. American
officials said that by being handled in that way, the issue should
not block the peace process later, as the first two deployments
have for 19 months now.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli demand for the extradition of 36 Palestinians _ 31
of them wanted for capital offenses like murder _ was resolved with
a Palestinian agreement to arrest 30 of the 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian demand that Israel release some 3,500
Palestinian prisoners arrested for security offenses, as called for
under the Oslo accords, while Israel says it won't release those
``with blood on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials say the Israelis have agreed to release
``several hundred'' prisoners, and that this may be enough for a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The exact method by which Israel will provide safe passage for
Palestinians traveling between the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who arrived Thursday morning for his sixth day of
intense personal involvement here, spent the evening talking first
to Netanyahu while Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke with
Arafat, and then vice-versa, in what the Americans called
``tag-team diplomacy.'' Jordan's King Hussein spoke to the leaders
on the telephone from a nearby farm.
</P>
<P>
   The main discussions were taking place in a tent off the main
dining room, to keep the numbers of participants small, officials
said. Thursday night, Clinton reconvened a joint meeting of the key
members of both delegations to try to finish off the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday evening, the Israeli and the Palestinian
delegations, of about 20 people each, were about 20 feet apart in
the dining room, the Israelis gathered around a fireplace on
couches and chairs and the Palestinians sitting at a table. The
Americans were at the main dining table, with Clinton, Albright,
Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, and special envoy
Dennis Ross huddling over bridging proposals to bring to one side
or another.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin compared the atmosphere to ``a cloakroom, with the feeling
and flavor of a legislative session drawing to a close,'' as final
deals are being made. ``But that doesn't mean that they will draw
to a close,'' Rubin hastened to add. ``But it certainly had that
flavor of a lot of people standing in different parts of the same
room, shuttling between one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin spoke over a speakerphone to a huddled mass of journalists
crowded around a small table in the press center here, at
Chesapeake College.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders were working with the text of an American plan given
to them at dawn Thursday morning. After 19 months of stalemate, the
American plan, a product of hundreds of conversations and many
drafts, seeks to lay out a deal whereby Israel will redeploy from
another 13 percent of the West Bank _ 3 percent to be a nature
reserve _ in return for specific Palestinian steps to combat
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans have been briefing both sides for months on
drafts of the plan, this is the first time it has been physically
handed to the parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Marty Whitman _ undoubtedly the only person who ever
called him Martin was his mother _ is on a crusade.
</P>
<P>
   The man who has made several fortunes betting on corporate lost
causes has now taken on Japan, the epicenter of the Asian financial
crisis. At a time when many foreign investors have bailed out,
Whitman's Third Avenue Value fund has 11.4 percent of its net
assets sunk into Japanese stocks, mostly insurance companies and
Toyota Motor Corp. affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his ill-fated decision last summer to buy 50 million
shares in the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, the symbol of the
Japanese financial crisis, that awakened his zeal.
</P>
<P>
   With his Yale University rep tie perpetually askew and his shirt
sleeves rolled to his elbows, Whitman, 74, looks like the Wall
Street equivalent of John the Baptist, and his message is no less
fiery.
</P>
<P>
   If Japan fails to come up with a rescue program for troubled
companies, he warns, the country's financial and economic system
will collapse and bring the rest of the world down with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless Japan creates an environment in which bad loans can be
worked out so that debtors are rehabilitated and creditors recover
something, the bad-debt problem here is hopeless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Whitman has run funds that did well by buying
companies caught up in bankruptcy and later selling them for a big
profit. And he thinks Japan would do well to imitate Chapter 11 of
the United States Bankruptcy Code, which gives distressed companies
protection from creditors while they set their houses in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan needs a Chapter 11 of some sort,'' he said. ``Japan is
particularly suited to that kind of process because it calls for
consensus and this is a consensual society, unlike the United
States, where things tend to get adversarial.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, for all the urgency of his message, he is having a hard
time persuading Japanese power brokers to listen to it. On a recent
trip here, he held a series of meetings with financial executives,
but the only politician who would give him the time of day was a
senior researcher for the main opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nicest thing I have to say now is that I'm often wrong,''
he said wearily over a sushi lunch as he licked salmon roe from his
fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly was wrong about Long-Term Credit Bank. In July, he
bought the stock for $1 a share, figuring it could not go much
lower. Its shares now trade at about 2 cents apiece, and Third
Avenue has been bailing out, selling 49 million of its 50 million
shares in recent weeks for a total loss of $46 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible mistake,'' Whitman mused.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he took the unprecedented step of suing the bank in
an American court for its plans to forgive $1.9 billion in loans to
three affiliates. After all, he said in the interview, ``They're
not running the bank for their borrowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Or are they? Whitman said he was told during his meeting with
Katsunobu Ohnogi, president of Long-Term Credit Bank, that debt
forgiveness was ``a matter of tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept telling me that the relationship between the bank and
its affiliates was like the relationship between a mother and her
child,'' Whitman recalled. ``I finally asked him, `Don't children
have any obligation to their mother?' ''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Long-Term Credit Bank said the bank did not want
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman says he was also was unsuccessful in pitching an idea to
Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance, in which Third Avenue has a stake
currently valued at $60 million, to pump up its flagging returns.
Even so, he can take heart in some recent developments.
</P>
<P>
   The country's political opposition, sympathetic to his views,
threatened to hold up passage of financial reform legislation if
Long-Term Credit Bank insisted on adhering to its original plan. As
a result, the government decided last month to nationalize
Long-Term Credit Bank and forbid it from pursuing its
debt-forgiveness plan. On Sept. 29, one of its affiliates, the
Japan Leasing Corp., went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's major business federation, meanwhile, proposed something
dear to Whitman's heart _ a tax break for Japanese companies that
sell off their stakes in group companies.
</P>
<P>
   And despite his gloom while he was here _ ``The future looks
rather discouraging to me,'' he said during lunch _ he did find a
few sympathetic ears. Although Kiyoshi Sugawa, the opposition
researcher, had to cut short his meeting with Whitman to deal with
legislative battles, he said he found Whitman's proposals
provocative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his ideas for attracting private investment capital to
increase the depleted capital bases of some banks are very good,''
Sugawa said, though he confessed that he found some of Whitman's
message too technical to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Is Whitman's campaign to play a role in Japan's financial
changes quixotic? Asked whether he was aiming for a tombstone
inscribed ``Marty Whitman, Japan's Savior,'' he answered: ``No!
`Marty Whitman, Savior of the world.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was joking. But he cautioned against dismissing him.
``My wife is very involved in the whole human rights thing, and I
used to always ask her why she was wasting her time,'' he said.
``Then the Berlin Wall fell, and Vaclav Havel was there on
television thanking all the human rights groups and telling them
that without them, none of it would have been possible.''

HISTORICAL SEASON OF WINNING WITH INNER CONCEIT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott Brosius imagined all year that he would make the final
play to end the World Series. A vision like that can be weird, the
Yankees' third baseman said. ``You're playing a game and you think
to yourself, `OK, this is the World Series, and you're going to
make the last out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius fielded the ground ball from San Diego's Mark Sweeney,
threw to first base and clinched the World Series sweep for a team
that could be remembered as the best ever, after 114 victories in
the regular season and 11 more in the post-season _ more than any
team in major league history.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees celebrated late into Wednesday night, swigging from
Champagne bottles and smoking cigars, and were sure to be drained
Thursday, when they flew back to New York. They will be honored in
a ticker-tape parade this morning through the Canyon of Heroes on
lower Broadway and begin dispersing for the off season, left to
savor their accomplishment, their memories, their feelings of
pride.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, the 20-game winner, deflected questions about
whether the '98 Yankees are the best team ever. ``But,'' he added,
``we deserve a lot of credit for playing hard.''
</P>
<P>
   That intensity, that respect for the game, for their opponents
and for each other was at the core of the 1998 Yankees. Veterans on
the team trace the gene back to Don Mattingly, the first baseman,
who retired after the 1995 season. ``It was the way he treated
everybody,'' Paul O'Neill said, ``the way he played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill watched and learned from Mattingly and, Cone said,
O'Neill set the competitive tone all year, with the rage he directs
inward every time he doesn't succeed and the fight he wages in
every at-bat. That was the first domino: Don't take any at-bats for
granted, don't take any innings for granted, don't take any games
for granted, don't take any opponents for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, Tino Martinez, Chuck Knoblauch, Bernie Williams,
they all played with that approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees played as hard against the lowly Kansas City Royals
this year as they did against the Padres in the World Series. All
year, they ran hard and played harder, even on days when they
didn't necessarily need to play hard.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, Manager Joe Torre said, ``had this inner conceit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they're good, but they don't really care about
telling other people how good they are,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew in spring training we had quality people, quality
players, but to be able to maintain a focus and determination all
during the year, and then knowing the pressure going into the
post-season _ that's unusual, in my experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees lost four of their first five games before holding
an angry team meeting in Seattle. That night, Knoblauch led off the
game with a home run, and the Yankees proceeded to win 22 of their
next 24 games. David Wells pitched his perfect game against
Minnesota on May 17, seemingly his debut as a front-line ace. Two
days later, the Yankees engaged in a nasty brawl with Baltimore
that Torre believed galvanized the team even further.
</P>
<P>
   A mere two weeks after that, on June 3, came the much
anticipated debut of Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban defector who had
been rescued from a raft at sea in December and signed by the
Yankees for $6.6 million. Known as El Duque, Hernandez had been
dominating the minor leagues with a 7-1 record when a dog bite
sustained by Cone disabled him and paved the way for Hernandez's
first major league start.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was impressive in his seven-inning, seven-strikeout
bow, and George Steinbrenner, the Yankees principal owner, forced
his baseball people to keep El Duque in the starting rotation _ a
decision that would pay off in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees finished the first half of the season with a 61-20
record. They held a lead in 48 consecutive games, a major league
record. It became clear in August, after the Yankees blew through a
West Coast trip with a 7-3 record, that this team would challenge
many records, and that anything less than a World Series title
would be considered failure.
</P>
<P>
   They clinched a playoff spot Aug. 29, earlier than any other
team in history. Without anything to chase but statistical goals,
they finally slumped a bit in early September, losing five of six
games in one stretch. Torre barked at them one day in Florida,
where they were playing the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, for their
lackluster effort, and they responded by winning their final seven
games of the regular season, finishing with more victories than any
team in American League history.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer played with Class AAA Columbus in August, and
after a home run binge in the majors in September, he wound up on
the cover of Sports Illustrated. Cone earned his 20th victory,
Williams won a batting title. Pitcher Andy Pettitte had said in
spring training that the Yankees looked so good that it was
sickening, and they looked extraordinary as the regular season
closed.
</P>
<P>
   As the playoffs began, however, outfielder Darryl Strawberry
felt continuing pain. In the midst of the division series with
Texas, he received a diagnosis of colon cancer, and many of his
teammates wept. (Other Yankees were dealing with personal strife in
the post-season _ Brosius' father with cancer, Knoblauch's father
with Alzheimer's disease, and Pettitte's father had heart surgery a
week ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Yankees crushed the Rangers, came back from a
two-games-to-one deficit to eliminate the Cleveland Indians in the
league championship series, before sweeping the Padres. Dating to
the last days of the regular season, the Yankees won 18 of their
final 20 games of the year.
</P>
<P>
   When is was all over, Jeter waved two fingers happily at Yankee
fans screaming in the stands, and when Steinbrenner emerged from
the clubhouse, the fans chanted his first name. But the greatest
roar came with the appearance of the championship trophy, the 24th
won by the Yankees. Brosius, who hit two home runs in Game 3 and
drove in a run in Game 4, was named the most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no one guy who's carried the load,'' Brosius
said. ``There's been 25 important players on the team. If we can go
home and sit back and look at it, maybe we'll realize what an
amazing team it has been.''
</P>
<P>
   They probably already realize that, with that inner conceit
Torre referred to, but now they may allow themselves a few moments
of enjoyment. They will have a long time to consider their legacy.

FCC OFFERS RULES INTENDED TO SETTLE WIRETAPPING DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dl) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission on Friday issued a
proposed set of rules intended to settle a dispute over high-tech
wiretapping that has pitted the FBI against the telecommunications
industry and privacy advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on a 1994 law, the Communications Assistance
for Law Enforcement Act, which was intended to guarantee that
law-enforcement officials would be able to continue telephone
surveillance as communications technologies evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying out the law has been stalled, however, while the FBI
has quarreled with the communications industry over cost and
feasibility and with privacy groups that contend that the law would
permit broad new government surveillance powers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed rules, the FCC would give law enforcement
some concessions, including the ability to get certain information
about the location of a person using a cellular telephone. But the
agency rejected some new capabilities requested by the FBI and
deferred a decision on other issues, including surveillance of
Internet communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress sought to balance the needs of law enforcement
against legitimate privacy and industry interests,'' William
Kennard, the FCC chairman, said in a statement. ``The differences
that remain are significant but by no means insurmountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives praised the steps taken by the FCC, saying
that the new laws could have been carried out years ago if the FBI
had not insisted on broad and costly new powers.
</P>
<P>
   The communications agency said that by granting law-enforcement
officials the ability to collect location information that is
already available to a telephone company they were stopping short
of turning cellular telephones into tracking devices.

BOEING EARNINGS BEAT EXPECTATIONS, BUT COMPANY WARNS OF TROUBLE
AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. Thursday announced third-quarter
earnings that were better than Wall Street had expected, but
company executives warned that the unsettled financial crisis in
Asia will mean fewer orders and lower production rates by the year
2000, and possibly sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest concern going forward is that the economic crisis
in Asia is more severe and more prolonged than previously
anticipated,'' Alan Mulally, who replaced Ron Woodard as head of
the Commercial Airplane Group on Sept. 1, said in a conference call
with industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scheduled production rates are being assessed, and downward
revisions are expected to be made based on customer requirements,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally also said that Boeing still has 34 planes in desert
storage. Many of those were intended for Asian customers who can no
longer afford to buy them, or no longer want them as fleets are
reduced. But most will have to find homes if the company is to meet
its year-end goal of delivering 550 planes.
</P>
<P>
   To reach that number, Boeing must deliver 182 planes in the
fourth quarter. The company has never before delivered that many
airplanes in one quarter, Mulally said. Boeing delivered 374 planes
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Getting planes delivered between now and the end of the year is
so critical that Boeing said Thursday it has delayed from Nov. 2
until March 1998 the next phase of implementing its billion-dollar
production overhaul initiative known as DCAC/MRM. It is intended to
improve efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is simple,'' Mulally said of the delay in a
management information bulletin sent to Boeing workers. ``Each time
we implement a phase of DCAC/MRM, we disrupt factory operations
because people must learn new processes and we must transition to
new computing systems. We can't afford that during this busy
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the conference call with analysts, followed by one with
reporters, Boeing executives said they remain convinced they can
reach their 550-plane forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research, said even if Boeing
does not make its 550-plane goal, it probably will not hurt
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe they will give it the old college try and make
it,'' he said. ``But it's not critical unless they miss it by a
large amount. ... Regardless of whether they make it to the last
plane, they are still going to be up around $1 a share profit, and
maybe better.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third quarter, Boeing reported a net profit of $347
million, or 36 cents a share. The earnings reflected a tax credit
of 6 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had
estimated operating earnings at 27 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues rose 12 percent to $12.72 billion from $11.37 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial airplanes accounted for 61 percent of revenues but
just $77 million in operating income in the latest quarter. Defense
and space operations accounted for 38 percent of revenues and $362
million in operating income.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's shares closed Thursday at $36 7/16 on the New York
Stock Exchange, up 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Boeing lost $696 million in the third quarter after
taking a $1 billion charge to offset production problems.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit said the company forecasts $56
billion in revenue and just over $1 billion in net earnings for
1998. Revenues should be about the same in 1999, but profits should
be about $2 billion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is now reviewing the impact Asia will have on future
airplane orders and current production rates, and will announce the
results later in the quarter, Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Boeing estimated it and other manufacturers would lose
up to 150 airplane orders over the next three years because of
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's going to be much higher than the 150,'' Mulallay
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing recently increased production of its next generation 737
from 14 to 21 planes per month. That will go to 24 per month in the
second quarter next year, Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing plans to cut production of its 747 from 5 per month
to 3.5 per month in the second quarter, and slash 777 production
from 7 a month to 5 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Any change in those previously announced rates are unlikely
until well into next year, Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we will see significant changes to the 1999
numbers,'' he said, but added. ``There will be a significant effect
on the year 2000.''

INTELLIGENCE CHIEF STEPS UP TO PLAY A KEY MIDEAST ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to fix slug; sent earlier as MIDEAST-TENET)  (gm) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A director of central intelligence, says George J.
Tenet, the man who holds the job, ``should be seen and not heard _
and preferably not seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But this week Tenet has been center stage, pressing the Israelis
and Palestinians to make peace. Their talks have been hanging on a
crucial question. Can he create a measure of trust and cooperation
between the Israeli and Palestinian spy services?
</P>
<P>
   It is a role that he has played since 1996, shuttling in secret
to Jerusalem and the West Bank, working the case but never cracking
it. He has arranged to train Palestinian security officers at a
secret base in North Carolina to increase professionalism and
Israeli confidence in them.
</P>
<P>
   He and the Central Intelligence Agency's station chief in Israel
have mediated disputes between their Israeli and Palestinian
counterparts. And Tenet has changed from a suit to casual clothes
in the Israeli Cabinet room, under the gaze of a portrait of Golda
Meir, between meetings with the Israeli prime minister and the
Palestinian secret police.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday he made a last-ditch effort to work on the Israelis
and Palestinians, who may detest each other but appear to trust
Tenet, insofar as trust exists among spies.
</P>
<P>
   ``CIA's relationships with the intelligence services in both
countries allow it to bridge gaps otherwise unbridgeable,'' said
Jeffrey Smith, who as the general counsel of the agency worked with
Tenet on his mediation efforts in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet, who looks and talks like a New York City police
detective, first saw the delicate interplay of nations and
religions as a child while watching customers at the 20th Century
Diner, a restaurant that his father, a Greek immigrant, ran in the
borough of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   He has kept a big shillelagh on his coffee table at CIA
headquarters, twirling it from time to time, playing the tough cop
with the world's evils as his beat. But for eight days he has
played good cop at the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing for the president or the secretary of state to
say, `We're going to professionalize the Palestinian security
service,' and it's quite another to have the guy who's directing
the program say it,'' an administration official said. ``He's built
a degree of political capital with these people. That makes him a
key player.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet, 45, says he does not want to be a public figure. But in
the last week he won a windfall for American espionage, and he
agreed to his first on-the-record interview as director, sending a
message that an agency beset by shortcomings needs an infusion of
money and talent to repair its problems.
</P>
<P>
   With his role in the peace talks Tenet, who barely three years
ago had a low-profile post on the National Security Council staff,
has become a name on the daily news programs, even if not one
American in a hundred knows who he is.
</P>
<P>
   He had been regarded skeptically by some old pros, seen as too
young, too inexperienced, too soft to run the intelligence empire.
Some still say he lacks the gravity to command the senior military
officials who head the Pentagon intelligence services or to control
the clandestine service of the CIA. And that agency's reputation,
damaged for years by self-inflicted wounds, has not been wholly
redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   But if he can repair the agency's battered image, and help make
a lasting Mideast peace deal, he has the potential, in some eyes,
to become the most potent American spymaster in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy will be the best or one of the best,'' said his
predecessor, John M. Deutch, who hired Tenet as his deputy in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Tenet let it be known that he was on a mission to
revive the CIA. ``Unless you bring more people in and unless you
develop the expertise, we won't achieve what we want to achieve,''
he said in an interview. ``In 10 years we won't be relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   That problem may be nothing that billions of dollars and
thousands of talented new people cannot solve.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet won an additional $1.8 billion from Congress on Wednesday
for the intelligence agencies that he oversees, bringing the budget
to $29 billion. The CIA spends 10 percent of that.
</P>
<P>
   Some money will jump-start the biggest recruitment drive in CIA
history and some to spy satellites and supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring a new generation of spies and analysts is crucial, he
said. ``I want people to know that this is not a fat old
organization just asking for money,'' Tenet said. It has to pay for
new people, ``recruitment, retention, pay, performance, education
and training,'' and new equipment or hang up its cloak and dagger.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tenet said he realized that to rebuild the agency he would have
to win public trust. That may come only through public victories in
the wars to penetrate terrorist groups and to understand, and
sometimes undermine, nations like Iraq, where the United States has
no embassies, no spies and no crystal ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an expectation that we have built a no-fault
intelligence system,'' Tenet said. ``That intelligence is expected
not only to tell you about the trends and to tell you about events
and give you insight, but in each and every case has a
responsibility to tell you when the date, time and place of an
event is. That will not happen. We will continue to be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States lacks the brainpower and technology to avoid
those surprises, he said. ``There will always be days where we have
to race to catch up to events we did not foresee, not because
somebody is asleep at the switch, but because what's going on is so
complicated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said he had focused on rebuilding morale and now needed to
turn to trying to manage other intelligence agencies like the
National Security Agency that are run by senior military officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest challenge for him,'' said Rep. Porter J.
Goss, R-Fla., who is a former CIA officer and is now chairman of
the House Intelligence Committee. ``That's not where he has the
experience and the good-old-boy network he has elsewhere. He has
got to be the director of central intelligence,'' not just head of
the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   But Tenet does have power with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, said Louis J. Freeh, the director of that agency who
as a young field agent in Queens sipped many a cup of coffee at the
20th Century Diner. ``Nice place,'' Freeh remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, when the CIA and the FBI tried to work together
overseas against terrorists and thugs, mistrust prevailed. By
instinct and training an FBI agent confronted with a criminal wants
to string him up. But a CIA officer wants to string him along, to
learn what he knows. Now the two chiefs get along much better,
Freeh said, and the arrests in the African embassy bombings prove
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to trust and understanding,'' he said. ``George
is someone I can absolutely trust.''

 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (For release Sunday, Oct. 25) 
(af) 
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a junior at the State University of New York at Buffalo.
So far, I've completed internships in international business,
public relations and city government. I am currently working as an
intern with a political campaign, and I plan an internship in
international relations or security before I graduate. How will
prospective employers react to my involvement in such a wide range
of apprenticeship programs? I don't want to look as though I'm
``internship hopping'' or can't commit myself to a single job.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Relax. Yes, a handful of preternaturally focused people know
from Day One of kindergarten that they want to be doctors or
lawyers or forest rangers _ and build their lives accordingly. Few
employers will penalize you, however, for not being one of that
rare (and somewhat disturbing) breed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people, even in their late 20s, don't know exactly where
they want to work,'' said Mark Oldman, managing director of Vault
Reports, a New York company that provides job seekers with detailed
information on internships and employers. It would be unrealistic,
he added, for companies to expect college students to know their
exact career paths.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, your internship choices hardly seem off the wall. On
the contrary, all of them point in the general direction of public
relations. And far from raising alarm bells, the accumulation of so
much workplace experience in your college years is likely to please
potential employers, whatever path you pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most employers see internships, even in fields that are not
directly relevant to the one you end up in, as a way of gaining the
soft skills needed in an office,'' Oldman said. ``There are things
common to most businesses: gaining a professional demeanor, knowing
how to fit within a hierarchical institution, not stepping on toes.
These are things you learn only by being on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Price Hicks, who directs the intern program for the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles, agreed. ``I don't
think employers want to spend their time acclimating a person to
the realities of everyday work life,'' she said.

   Even more broadly, internships are a signal to employers that
you are equipped to deal with life after college. Oldman said
intern coordinators believe that ``internships in general are a
real sign of maturity and initiative _ that someone hasn't spent
his summers flipping burgers or twirling the lifeguard whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   If eyebrows are raised about the diversity of your experience,
pitch your background as a plus. ``In addition to showing that you
can work in a variety of environments, it suggests you might have
something interesting to contribute to your new office,'' Oldman
said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, having explored several options, you are now better
qualified to choose the field that's right for you _ and to avoid
job-hopping in your post-college years. ``One of the great things
about internships,'' Oldman said, ``is that they help you decide
where you don't want to go.'' &QL;

Sanford Weill, the co-chief executive of Citigroup and one of the
few Wall Street executives to speak publicly about hedge-fund giant
Long-Term Capital Management, concedes he was blind to the huge
risks the fund was taking. ``I think the lesson of this is that if

elsewhere,'' he says. (Ozier Muhammad/New York Times Photo)

The Greenland Family Farm in Cutchogue has a corn maze that is
expected to last through Halloween. It's nothing fancy, just a set

<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin ital)Writer's note: The following is not to be
interpreted as an actual event, a re-enactment of an actual event
or ever having the chance of becoming an actual event.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   So I'm walking down the street with Dan Dierdorf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that antique desk in the window,'' I say as we pass a
storefront. ``Boy, I'd love to have that. But...''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what?'' Dan asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't think I can afford it,'' I sheepishly admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Dan continues, stopping to add dramatic effect and
pulling a pamphlet from his checkered blazer, ``you don't have to
have money (begin ital)in(end ital) a bank to get money (begin
ital)from(end ital) a bank. Just pick up the phone today and
call....''
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)OK, All right. Wavy lines, whatever it takes.(end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   No doubt you've seen the TV commercial in which Dierdorf starts
telling a couple _ and there's a couple born every minute _ about a
way to get money from a place, Advanta, that sounds like a
hair-restoration scam.
</P>
<P>
   I hear that, I scram.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the fact this particular company had to overlook
every Q-rating ever deciphered and picked Dierdorf as its pitchman
for an outfit no one's ever heard of before this spot, there is one
very frightening element to all this.
</P>
<P>
   Credibility and accountability has met up with instant cash and
easy work. These days, the latter two win.
</P>
<P>
   For an afternoon of their time, sports-media members who've
built reputations as trustworthy, fair and impartial observers have
suddenly been given carte blanche to pose as financial gatekeepers
on the golden path toward debt consolidation _ provided, of course,
we're a homeowner with plenty of equity to gamble with.
</P>
<P>
   Given, ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' windbag Dierdorf didn't
risk a whole lot of ethics before making this commitment and this
commercial. Jim Lampley, however, makes a strong case toward total
journalistic decertification.
</P>
<P>
   This esteemed multinetwork host of countless Olympics _ he took
us through the first moments of that tragic bombing at the Atlanta
Games in '96 _ has been turning in a gold-medal performance in
spots for NFC.
</P>
<P>
   That's NFC as in National Finance Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   In this expanded theatrical infomercial, Lampley (as himself)
takes a guided tour of the company's offices, as if he's setting
the stage for some kind of sting in a report for HBO's ``Real
Sports.''
</P>
<P>
   But here's the real gotcha _ doing some very impressive method
acting, Lampley is called upon to re-enact a phone-call
conversation with a satisfied customer.
</P>
<P>
   A re-enactment? Who's directing this, Oliver Stone?
</P>
<P>
   Before he throws it back to the studio where a propped-up Phil
Rizzuto waits to complete the pitch, Lampley exclaims: ``Count me
convinced!''
</P>
<P>
   At least Lampley was not wearing his Eagle Eye Super-Dooper
Ultra-Violet blocker sunglasses during the making of this
infomercial.
</P>
<P>
   If one financially misguided sportscaster is an accident, what
we have now is some sort of interstate pileup. The line has not
only been crossed but erased by Dierdorf's size 13. Lampley is
somewhere beyond the point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   Dumb viewers are to assume that these well-paid sports guys with
microphones will lead them out of debt. Loan points, points on the
scoreboard _ what's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   But even the wiser viewers are to assume that well-paid sports
guys with microphones are so destitute at what they do that they
need the extra dough, apparently to add another wing to their
complexes for all those Emmy Awards that keep piling up in the
basements.
</P>
<P>
   Why else would their employers grant them enough rope to hang
themselves and put a chokehold on their careers?
</P>
<P>
   Let's not say it all started when Chris ``Klitz'' Berman broke
the manacles and sold himself out to everyone, which opened the
floodgates for ESPN guys like Keith Olbermann (Boston Market) or
Dan Patrick (7-Up) to moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching quick-dry paint and meatloaf sandwiches is an innocuous
way of selling out when compared to what door Rizzuto, the Yankees'
longtime broadcaster, opened when he did his first Money Store
commercial, which was more like a bad 30-second vaudeville act. He
gave way to another Hall of Famer-turned-broadcaster Jim Palmer,
then hooked up with NFC's friendly lenders without a worry about
how he'd be perceived by the gullible public.
</P>
<P>
   (And Rizzuto wonders why it took him so long to be voted into
the Hall of Fame. The voters couldn't stop laughing for years.)
</P>
<P>
   In Dierdorf-ese, these guys are not just cashing in (begin
ital)at(end ital) the bank, they're doing it (begin ital)with(end
ital) the bank.
</P>
<P>
   And you know some of these companies have notorious lending
practices that precede them.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Terry Bradshaw, for example, jumped into the fray earlier
this year when he did spots for The Associates _ ``We make loans
that make life better.'' But when Bradshaw's people started looking
into this business with wider eyes, Bradshaw pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   The journalistic thing here would be to call Lampley and ask why
he's involved in these ads. But I'm not in the mood for perfectly
suitable multisyllabic rationalization.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what if Lampley is convincing enough to get me to
refinance my place. When I get in so far over my head in debt, I
wonder if he'll be out there passing out blankets and serving hot
coffee to my family when we're on the curb.
</P>
<P>
   Worse of all, out there without any cable hookup. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES &UR;  &QL; 
_ &LR; In the November issue of Maxim, Michael Jordan says the NBA's

young kids are (expletive). And that's because of y'all. The more
media coverage the kids get, the more money they get, and that's

on this one. In fact, on behalf of media everywhere, we'd like to
apologize for not doing our part to properly rear today's young NBA
players, which, by and large, is our primary goal. And on top of
that, how about we stop covering MJ and his comeback overtures as
well? &UR;  &QL; 
_ &LR; Can you say ``Lunes en la Tarde Futbol?'' Starting with Monday's
Steelers-Chiefs telecast, ABC's weekly semi-prime-time NFL game
will be, for the first time in its treinta y nueve anos, a Spanish

do you say ``Boomer'' in Spanish? &UR;  &QL;

_ &LR; In a SportsBusiness Journal story on concerns about the long-term
prospects of the Major League Soccer, commissioner Doug Logan
acknowledges that the media has contributed to the league's

and Univision put the games on the air with little promotion. On
behalf of the media everywhere, we apologize for not doing our part

And just to warn you: Sunday's MLS Cup championship from the Rose

LATE COMEBACK GIVES DOW 13.91-POINT GAIN FOR DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Blue-chip stocks staged a late comeback Thursday and
pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to a seventh straight gain
while the Nasdaq market continued a two-week advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market looks great,'' said Gary Kaltbaum, the chief
technical analyst at J.W. Genesis Securities. ``Every day it's
repairing itself from the damage that had been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks fell on another batch of poor earnings, notably
Chevron's, dampening early trading, but the Dow, down as much as 97
points during the day, climbed after lunch and finished with a
modest gain of 13.91 points, or nearly 0.2 percent, to 8,533.14.
</P>
<P>
   The gain in the technology-laden Nasdaq was a much heftier 1.67
percent, lifting the index to 1,702.64, or nearly 20 percent above
its low on Oct. 8. Microsoft, whose antitrust trial began on
Monday, once again led the way, rising 3 9/16, to 110. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index edged slightly higher, rising 8.56 points,
or 0.8 percent, to 1,078.48.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of Treasury bonds fell Thursday, raising interest rates,
suggesting resumed outflows of the money that had poured in when
the risk of world economic meltdown seemed most acute.
</P>
<P>
   With credit now beginning to flow more freely _ and the
difference in borrowing costs for borrowers of various quality
narrowing _ a sense of relative stability has emerged on Wall
Street. Bank and brokerage stocks are no longer in retreat but on
the rise, with BankAmerica and Chase Manhattan, for example, up
Thursday by 2 11/16 and 2 1/16, respectively. Merrill Lynch climbed
1}, to 55 3/16, after stumbling to a low of 35} on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   To James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Norwest Investment
Management in Minneapolis, the key to market recovery has been the
decline in the dollar, which he said brought some stability to
distressed currencies in Asia and other regions and allowed
officials around the globe to cut interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of rocket fuel under this stock market if you
just convince people we're not in a global abyss,'' Paulsen said.
He called the extent of this year's decline in stocks ``vastly
underappreciated'' _ thus putting them in position to rally _
because the decline in bond yields combined with the drop in stock
prices have made equities more attractive than they were in any of
the previous 12 postwar bear markets.
</P>
<P>
   Other upbeat analysts pointed to earnings reports for the third
quarter that have matched or slightly beaten expectations and,
perhaps just as tellingly, to the fact that the handful of surprise
disappointments has seldom had wide repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most things seem to be coming in on line, maybe a penny or two
better,'' said Joseph Yurman, managing director of BankBoston
Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, however, reported an unexpectedly severe 47 percent
drop in third-quarter profits, and its shares slumped 5}, to 81{.
Atlantic Richfield, also reporting lower profits that reflected low
oil prices, fell 2{, to 67 1/16, while Exxon, which reported on
Wednesday, and Mobil fell 3 13/16 and 3, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, shares of Halliburton, Schlumberger and some
other companies in the oilfield-equipment business rose a point or
more.
</P>
<P>
   What had been a dormant market for new issues was enlivened by
the arrival of Conoco, which traded 38.5 million shares and
finished at 24 7/8, up 1 7/8 from its offering price of 23. This
DuPont spinoff was the biggest U.S. initial public offering ever.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow components, Procter &AMP; Gamble was up 3 3/16, to 87, to
account for 94 percent of the index's modest gain. General Electric
gained 2}, to 86 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Most drug stocks posted solid gains, with Bristol-Myers Squibb,
Pfizer and Warner-Lambert gaining more than 2 points, but Baxter
International plunged 7 7/8, to 57, on fears about future earnings
growth.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,852 stocks with
gains compared with 1,228 declines, and the gap by which new lows
exceeded new highs _ 37 to 28 _ continued to narrow Thursday.
Volume was again moderate by recent standards, 754.97 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell index of 2,000 small-company stocks resumed its
advance, climbing 1.8 percent, to 366.40, beating even the Nasdaq
composite.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas stock markets were mixed, moving higher by 3.44 percent
in Brazil, 0.5 percent in Japan and 0.4 percent in Britain but
falling 1.88 percent in Germany, and 0.6 percent in Paris.

PERMIT DENIED FOR LOW-LEVEL NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP NEAR MEXICAN BORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A state commission unanimously denied a license
for a proposed radioactive waste dump near the West Texas village
of Sierra Blanca on Thursday, eliciting whoops from grassroots
activists who had fought the proposal for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, promoters of a site in Andrews County, near New
Mexico's jutting corner into West Texas, began handling out flyers
extolling their location as a site for the dump that would handle
low-level radioactive waste from nuclear plants, hospitals and
other industries. The Andrews County site is owned by Dallas
millionaire Harold Simmons and ex-Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance.
</P>
<P>
   The three Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission
members, all appointees of Gov. George W. Bush, cited insufficient
analyses of a geological fault under the 250-acre Sierra Blanca
site and of the project's social and economic impact as reasons for
denying the license.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the weightiest matter we've dealt with in three
years,'' said commission chairman Barry R. McBee, explaining that
his vote was based on a recommendation by two administrative
judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know enough, scientifically, to have a reasonable
assurance'' that the site would be safe, McBee said.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned officials of the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Disposal Authority reacted by publicly weighing their options.
These include appealing to a state district court, asking the
Legislature to allow it to re-address the geological and
socioeconomic complaints, or seeking another site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is, what are we going to do with our
radioactive waste?'' said Doug Caroom, lawyer for the authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature created the waste disposal authority in
1981 to develop and operate a waste facility. The authority looked
at several sites in West Texas before settling on the Sierra Blanca
location in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement with Maine and Vermont would have allowed those
states to ship radioactive waste to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's final arguments on the Sierra Blanca site, the
administrative judges said basic questions about the geological
fault's length and whether it extended to faults in
earthquake-prone areas were not fully answered.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the proposed dump responded by saying the geological
fault hadn't shifted in at least 750,000 years. Even in a worst
case scenario in which the 5-inch-thick, concrete canisters of
radioactive waste somehow ``crumbled into dust,'' no contamination
would leave the site, they asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of the session, McBee maintained courtroom-like
decorum by cautioning the 250 spectators not to cheer or make any
noise. When he announced that the license was denied, dump
opponents burst into whoops and shouts.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-nuke activists who had devoted years to the struggle
against the site loosened their neckties and pony tails and hugged.
Pro-dump Sierra Blancans quickly slipped away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a victory for the people _ but we'll still be wary of
what they do next,'' said Erin Rogers, director of the Sierra
Blanca Legal Defense Fund which spearheaded the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited I can hardly talk. Now I feel I can live a
normal life,'' said Gloria Addington, who owns a store in Sierra
Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   To win over the impoverished, predominantly Hispanic community
90 miles east of El Paso, project promoters spent millions planting
sod for the first time on the high school football field for the
six-man ``Vaqueros'' squad, providing a clinic and a library, and
delivering a new ambulance and fire truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sierra Blancans can keep them _ things that they should have
had in the first place,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a score of Mexican children from a Chihuahuan dance
troupe twirled joyfully to thunderous drums. Ten visiting members
from Mexico's federal Congress gave non-stop interviews via
cellular phones. The Congress had publicly opposed the dump site,
which is only 20 miles from the Rio Grande, although Mexico's
executive branch had sent mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   Political pressure was never hinted at during the hearing, but
Dr. Milton Guiberteau, the waste disposal authority chairman,
conceded that it hovered, invisibly, throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Blanca became an issue in the state's most heated
political race _ for lieutenant governor _ when Democrat John Sharp
voiced opposition to the proposal during a campaign swing. During
the gubernatorial debate in El Paso, Democrat Garry Mauro came out
flatly against the site and Bush said it wouldn't be built if the
site was unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was politics which put it there and it was politics that
took it away,'' said state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, an El Paso
Democrat. ``The emotional, heart-felt campaign shows that the issue
of siting it in West Texas was what caused the decision by this
commission.''

 &HT;    NRA opposition to gun law grows
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The National Rifle Association has
expanded its opposition from the state's proposed gun law to the
entire list of revisions on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In a flier urging Florida voters to reject a revision giving
counties control over gun shows, the NRA also opposed eight other
changes they dub ``Tricks and Deceptions in Revisions 5-13.''
</P>
<P>
   The group sent 5,000 fliers to its Palm Beach County affiliate
this week, president George Russum said.
</P>
<P>
   The flier is a meager campaign compared to the intense lobbying
waged by former NRA president Marion Hammer earlier this year when
the revision commission first began considering the gun law change.
Some expected the group to spend as much as $10 million, but in
recent weeks, speculation put the amount at as little as $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   National NRA officials did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In major television markets, station sales representatives said
they still had not heard from the group and time is running out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond booked up. The boat's sinking. They can preempt
someone else, but it's crazy,'' said Jay Burmer, a sales rep at
WFLA in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   The flier attacks the 37-member commission, which started
studying the Constitution in 1997 and drafted the revisions after a
series of public hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they've got them grouped together and the way you'll
see them on the ballot, you don't have any idea what you're voting
on,'' Russum said. ``We're just recommending they shoot down the
entire thing,''
</P>
<P>
   Russum plans to mail the fliers to local members and hand them
out ``wherever we can buttonhole people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dexter Douglass, chairman of the commission and former
general counsel to Gov. Lawton Chiles, said the flier
``irresponsible'' and inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they're consistent. They're against everything that's
good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglass pointed out that the commission, made up of both
Republicans and Democrats, devised the groupings in an attempt to
make the ballot understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not the case that anybody wants the public to go in
blindly and vote yes,'' he said. ``Our job on the commission was to
inform people about what's in it and not just to vote. We haven't
run campaigns to tell people to vote yes or no.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the NRA is attacking all the revisions because
the gun law has received overwhelming support, with some polls
showing 80 percent favor it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's apparent to us they can't defeat the amendment on its own
merits, so they're just going for the general scare,'' said Don
Ungurait, assistant to Miami Dade State Attorney Katherine
Fernandez Rundle, who sponsored the gun revision. ``We expected
exactly that attack. We expected that kind of tactic and they have
not disappointed us.''

MICROSOFT DISPUTES NETSCAPE MEETING ACCOUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lawyer for Microsoft Corp. on Thursday portrayed
the company's competitor in the Internet software business,
Netscape Communications Corp., as a willing and eager participant
in deal-making that culminated in a June 1995 meeting at which the
government and Netscape now say that Microsoft illegally offered to
divide the market.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting and the charge of an illegal offer to divide the
market for Internet browsers, the software used to navigate the
World Wide Web, are central elements of the antitrust suit by the
Justice Department and 20 states being heard in United States
district court here.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, the Justice Department made public an e-mail
that seemed to support elements of the government's account.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, from Dan Rosen, a senior Microsoft executive who
attended the meeting with Netscape's leaders, was written to Bill
Gates, Microsoft's chairman, and others. It summarizes the meeting
and begins with a list of ``Our goals going into the meeting, in
priority order.''
</P>
<P>
   The first goal, the memo said, was to ``establish Microsoft
ownership'' of the market for Web browsers that run on Windows
computers.
</P>
<P>
   In his third day cross-examining James L. Barksdale, Netscape's
president and chief executive, the Microsoft lawyer, John Warden,
suggested that the market-division allegation stemmed from anger on
the part of Netscape executives when they learned at that meeting
that Microsoft intended to bundle its own browser with its Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there really anything going on here other than a difference
of opinion between you and Microsoft on where the line is'' between
a browser and an operating system? Warden asked.
</P>
<P>
   At that Barksdale _ normally a calm and unerringly polite
witness _ exploded: ``We feel strongly that a browser is a separate
application, and a manufacturer that controls 90 percent, plus, of
the world's operating systems and pulls the browser into it has
stepped across that line!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's your objection?'' Warden asked. ``You disagree with
them building it into the operating system?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do, I do, I do,'' Barksdale said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other charges, the government's suit accuses Microsoft of
trying to persuade Netscape executives, at the meeting on June 21,
1995, to quit marketing browsers that run on Windows computers. If
they did not agree, the government says, Microsoft threatened to
destroy Netscape. Such a collusion to divide markets would be a
violation of federal antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   When Netscape refused, the government further charges, Microsoft
decided to bundle its own Web browser, Internet Explorer, with the
Windows system to drive Netscape out of the browser business.
Windows runs more than 90 percent of all new personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, Microsoft presented memos and e-mail messages
suggesting that Netscape had eagerly sought the June meeting.
Barksdale acknowledged that he had written memos to other Netscape
executives in early June 1995 in which he had enthusiastically
reported that in an earlier meeting, Microsoft had shown an
interest in investing in his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, they didn't do anything as rash as trying to buy us (yet)
but they did suggest that they wanted to invest in us,'' Barksdale
wrote to another employee three weeks before the meeting. ``It was
a good session.''
</P>
<P>
   Another memo from Barksdale to several senior Netscape employees
reported that Microsoft had been ``very friendly, nonthreatening''
and had congratulated Netscape on having ``done a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   As Barksdale's e-mail recounted it, the Microsoft executives had
added, ``How can we work together? Discussion done with Bill's
blessing,'' a reference to Gates.
</P>
<P>
   With that as a prelude, Warden, Microsoft's lead counsel in the
case, produced several other e-mail messages and memos suggesting
that Netscape and Microsoft had both plunged into planning for the
June 21 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Warden used each to cast further doubt on the government's
allegations. One piece of documentary evidence indicating that
Microsoft did propose dividing the browser market are notes that
Marc Andreessen, a cofounder and executive vice president of
Netscape, took on his laptop computer during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of those notes was released Thursday by the court.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen wrote that Microsoft had issued a ``threat that
Microsoft will own the Windows 95 client market, and that Netscape
should stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of evidence is the memo from Rosen to Gates,
written the day after the meeting. Rosen quotes another member of
the Micrsoft team as telling the Netscape executives: ``We need to
understand if you will adopt our platform,'' Windows, ``and build
on top if it, or if you are going to compete with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo continued, ``They understand that we are going to
incorporate into the platform technology that they provide today.''
The Microsoft executives, according to Rosen's memo, told
Netscape's leaders that their intention was to ``suck most of the
functionality of the current Netscape browser'' into Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosen's memo did not indicate that the Netscape executives
had reacted negatively to this.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was introduced into evidence Thursday, but not referred
to in court.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, summing up his conclusions after three days of
testimony, Warden said, ``I suggest to you, Barksdale, that if you
look at the whole record of events leading up to June 21, the only
fair conclusion that can be reached is that Andreessen imagined or
invented the proposal to divide the markets, and that you and your
company signed onto it in order to assist in this prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely disagree with that,'' Barksdale retorted. ``It's
absurd. I was in the meeting. I know what I know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there,'' he said. ``You weren't.''

NOMURA REPORTS $1.7 BILLION LOSS IN ITS FIRST HALF
</HEADLINE>
   (dl) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nomura Securities Co., Japan's largest brokerage, reported a
$1.76 billion loss for its fiscal first half Thursday and provided
an emergency infusion of funds to rescue its hemorrhaging U.S.
operation, which caused most of the losses at the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura, long considered the most aggressive and innovative
Japanese brokerage, suffered huge losses on bets it made in
financial markets around the world. Its biggest blow came in
America, where the firm's once highly profitable business of
repackaging and selling commercial real-estate loans turned sour
after Russia's default on its debt in August scared investors away
from risky debt securities. Nomura Holding America had losses of
nearly $1.2 billion before taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes amid a worldwide management shakeup.
Nomura officials in Japan told reporters that Managing Director Max
Chapman, former president of the now defunct Wall Street powerhouse
Kidder Peabody &AMP; Co. and the pioneer of Nomura's business
strategies outside of Japan since 1989, has lost his authority to
make management decisions. Chapman continues as non-executive
chairman of Nomura's units in the United States, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Nomura said he had no information about
Chapman's role at the parent company. Chapman could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The demotion comes as many of the proprietary trading stars who
generated big profits for Nomura _ and some of the fattest
paychecks on Wall Street for themselves _ have either left or been
fired. William Wraith, chief executive of Nomura Holding America,
and Mark McGauley, the chief operating officer, resigned last month
after Nomura suffered $240 million in Russia-related trading
losses. Ethan Penner, the high-flying founder of Nomura's
real-estate lending arm, also resigned. His unit contributed to
losses approaching $1 billion in Nomura's mortgage-backed
securities business.
</P>
<P>
   The company is disbanding its emerging markets trading operation
in New York, Nomura executives said. One person who works there
estimated that six or seven traders in that department have lost
their jobs. But Nomura officials said they do not expect wholesale
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the mid-1980s, Nomura named a Japanese
national, Atsushi Yoshikawa, as the sole chief of its U.S.
business. Nomura said it has begun a review of all aspects of its
international operations. Executives there said that they expect
the firm to move quickly to reduce the risks it takes with its own
capital. They said they anticipate that Tokyo-based officials will
tighten their supervision over foreign operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question you will see them tighten
controls,'' said a senior Nomura executive in the United States of
the Japanese parent company. ``When you cause a billion dollars in
losses, you have to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   To strengthen the ailing American operation, Nomura announced
that it would inject $1.2 billion into Nomura Holding America in
addition to an equity infusion and debt forgiveness made last
month. That brings Nomura's bill for the bailout of the U.S.
business so far to $1.78 billion, or about half the size of last
month's rescue of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management by a
consortium of 14 banks and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   The new capital reaffirms the parent company's commitment to the
American market, Nomura officials said. Yoshikawa, Nomura Holding
America's chief executive officer, said the new capital will
guarantee the financial wherewithal of all its subsidiaries here,
including the mortgage-backed securities operation.
</P>
<P>
   The steep losses almost certainly signal the end of Nomura
America's heavy emphasis on cowboy-like trading strategies, Nomura
executives said. In the past, the firm often acted like a
speculative hedge fund in the way it used the firm's own capital to
make bets on high-interest bonds, like those issued by the Russian
government. Under Penner, 37, Nomura became a big player in real
estate finance during the early 1990s property slump. Recently, he
pioneered a way to make loans to people and companies, including
sports and movie stars, then pool them into securities and sell
them to big investors.
</P>
<P>
   The business was highly profitable in recent years. Propriety
trading and real estate finance accounted for about 90 percent of
Nomura America's revenue, and they made the firm the most
successful Japanese brokerage in the U.S. market. Penner was one of
the best compensated traders on Wall Street, earning $93 million
over the past three years. Many other Nomura executives in America
were also paid bonuses far larger than people in similar positions
at the biggest U.S. securities companies.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past two months, Nomura's fortunes were quickly
altered. Jitters in emerging markets prompted investors everywhere
to dump fixed-income securities considered risky, with many seeking
safe haven in U.S. Government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Nomura executives said most of the U.S. losses came from
marking down the value of its huge inventory of real-estate related
loans. In mid-September, Nomura had a loan inventory valued at $3
billion, which it intended to sell off to investors. But it managed
to sell only one-third that amount, and the market has continued to
sink.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura's losses were not confined to the U.S. operation,
however. It European arm lost $564 million and its Asian operation
posted a $145 million shortfall. To improve earnings, Nomura said
it will cut 2,000 jobs in Japan, or 15 percent of its 13,000-strong
workforce. The firm also said it will concentrate on managing the
company worldwide from its Tokyo headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are successful in implementing our business plan, we
expect to be profitable by the end of the next fiscal year, or the
year after,'' said Nomura President Junichi Ujiie.
</P>
<P>
   But the results prompted Moody's Investors Service to cut the
company's long-term debt rating one notch o ``Baa1,'' two notches
above ``junk,'' from ``A3.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomura's ``potential further mark-to-market losses in its real
estate and emerging markets portfolios, compounded by a shortage of
client-driven recurring businesses and by reorganization costs,
will prevent Nomura's overseas businesses from contributing
sustainable and predictable earnings in the near future,'' the U.S.
rating company said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Japanese brokerages also posted bad results. Daiwa
Securities Co., Japan's second-largest broker, on Thursday reported
a 66.839 billion yen net loss, or 50.16 yen per share and Nikko
Securities Co. reported a 57.724 billion yen net loss, or 37.96 yen
per share. Daiwa said it would cut 1,500 jobs by the end of March
2001.

PRIMAKOV'S SILENCE RAISES WORRIES, AND THE RUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Now that Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has spent six
weeks leading one of the biggest nations on Earth through its worst
fiscal crisis, one thing is becoming increasingly clear: Nobody
outside the Kremlin knows what the prime minister is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this is by design or accident, or good or bad, is open
to dispute. But it is indisputably making economists, financiers
and politicians nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Never a gregarious sort, Primakov has been almost Delphic on the
subject of Russia's economic policy since taking over day-to-day
management of the government on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no shortage of pronouncements: He has pledged to
start paying both current and back wages to state workers and the
military; to collect more taxes; to improve management of the
40,000 companies in which the Russian government holds a stake; to
satisfy foreign debtors hurt in August by default and devaluation
of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   But where he will find money for wages, how he will rake in more
taxes, whether he will increase state control of private business
and what he will do to meet $17 billion in foreign obligations next
year alone are, so far, mysteries. Indeed, he and his top advisers
sometimes seem publicly and directly at odds with each other over
even basic matters.
</P>
<P>
   That was never clearer than this week, when the deputy prime
minister in charge of finance, the Communist Yuri Maslyukov,
announced that the budget for the last three months of 1998, about
130 billion rubles, would run a deficit of between 40 and 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the Kremlin planned to cover such deficits,
Maslyukov's deputy said the government would mostly print new
money, an inflationary policy dubbed ``emission.'' Primakov said
there would be very little, if any, emission. And Maslyukov said
emission would occur, but that much money would presumably come
from foreign lenders like the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Some Westerners, noting that Russia already has failed to make
payments on some government debt, roll their eyes at the notion
that Russia can finance such a huge budget deficit with borrowed
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of ideology,'' said Tom Adshead,
co-director of research at United Financial Group, a Moscow
investment bank. ``They're denying reality. They're just not
competent to be in charge of anything. They shouldn't be running
the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Adshead's firm, which was closely associated with the
free-market reformers who led Russia before Primakov, publishes a
daily newsletter of financial analysis. Wednesday's edition bore
the headline, ``Another Day in the Government's Economic
Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   Bald contradictions like those are not rare in the Primakov
government. Some say Primakov is reflecting his personal history as
a diplomat, in which compromise was generally preferred over
confrontation. Others say the outward inertia could have been
expected from a government that combines Communists and
free-marketers and middle-roaders _ the very opposite of the
charges that Primakov's predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko, pursued
free-market goals without regard to political realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The silence of the government _ the uncertainty of future
economic policy _has also become an economic factor on its own,''
said Andrei Netchaev, president of Russian Financial Corp., a
government-backed investment bank. ``There are many complicated
problems in the Russian economy. Businesses need concrete
information about future exchange rate policy, monetary policy,
emissions and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. On the other hand, it is hard to say that Primakov's
deep-inside-the-vest strategy has done the country visible harm.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble, which briefly dived to a rate of more than 20 to the
dollar this fall, has more-or-less settled in the last week or so
at an exchange rate of about 17. The Moscow stock market, which all
but vanished in the wreckage of August's financial collapse,
suddenly has gained almost 50 percent in two weeks as measured by
one major index, albeit on thin trading.
</P>
<P>
   Store shelves are not bulging as they were before the August
crash, but they are fuller than in the weeks of panic buying after
the ruble was first devalued. And while the statistics say that
Russia's gross domestic product fell nearly 10 percent in September
alone, the cities continue to bustle _ running, perhaps, on their
residents' savings from years past.
</P>
<P>
   There are explanations for Primakov's opacity, not the least of
which is that a little benign neglect is not a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Primakov and others have said their priority is not
to set long-range strategy but to put out the fires that already
threaten to turn the rest of the economy to ashes.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, the prime minister has already begun issuing
back pay to some federal workers and has pledged to start making up
unpaid pension checks. He has ordered the repeal of new duties on
food imports, in an attempt to alleviate shortages, and announced
plans to cut corporate income and value-added taxes to spur
production.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks after his aides threatened that Russia was ready to walk
away from Western debts unless creditors ponied up still more
loans, the government has warmed up to Western investors and the
IMF. Recent reports suggest that Primakov would give the investors
special treatment in restructuring the repayment of near-worthless
government bonds, which the banks bought at the height of the
Russian speculative bubble last fall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Experts from the monetary fund are in Moscow this week, poring
over the government's fiscal strategy in an effort to noodle the
future of a $22.6 billion bailout of the government and the economy
that was announced this summer. The fund already has put off
releasing a $4.3 billion dollop of that package, and virtually no
one expects much of that money to be released anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The government's latest line on the budget _ the one with the 40
percent to 50 percent deficit this quarter _ envisions a massive
drop in spending compared to the proposal that was floated before
it, a move some view as a bow to the IMF's pinch-penny philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bottom line remains that none of the proposals are
official, the hallmark of Primakov's brief reign. And to Western
analysts, at least, no news is good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about it is that there seems not to be a final
decision to go out printing money like crazy,'' said Jan Lunden,
the European executive director of the Russian-European Center on
Economic Policy. ``If they do print, say, 100 billion rubles in the
last quarter of 1998, you could have inflation of 40 percent to 50
percent a month.''

HOLLYWOOD'S HEGEMONY OVERSEAS MEANS BUCKS AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood's salvation is coming from Britain,
Brazil, Bulgaria and nearly every other nation on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   That trend was underscored last weekend when ``City of Angels,''
which generated a modest $78 million in the U.S., became the 12th
movie this year to top the $100 million mark in foreign grosses.
The Warner Bros. remake of ``Wings of Desire'' has grossed $15.8
million in Japan, $15.4 million in Germany and $8.4 million in the
United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign performance is particularly impressive since it came
from a slow-paced spiritually themed movie starring Nicolas Cage
and Meg Ryan. It clearly lacked the three key elements -- slam-bang
action, special effects and major international stars -- that
usually lead to big audiences in overseas theaters.
</P>
<P>
   But ``City of Angels'' was also an American film, a big plus
overseas. Even though moviemaking is a worldwide art, Hollywood's
films are the ones that are allocated most of the screens, often
well over 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``American movies are the coin of the realm in foreign
markets,'' observed analyst Tim Baskerville recently. ``Although
it's usually the big action movies that we tend to associate with
doing well overseas, the other thing to keep in mind is that those
markets tend to be dominated by U.S. product.''
</P>
<P>
   The top foreign performers list is led by ``Titanic'' with an
astounding $1.2 billion in overseas box office receipts, or double
the U.S. total. ``The Man in the Iron Mask,'' released at the peak
of Leonardo DiCaprio's popularity, was a major beneficiary of the
frenzy over ``Titanic'' in overseas markets and cleared well over
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million-overseas list will be augmented by ``Mulan''
and ``The X-Files'' by the end of the year, with ``Mulan'' expected
to reach $200 million by the end of its run. The surprise U.S. hit,
``There's Something About Mary,'' which has just started its run in
many markets, could also join the club.
</P>
<P>
   Baskerville recently released a forecast showing foreign markets
will increase their influence during the next decade, rising from
60.8 percent of worldwide revenues this year ($10.96 billion) to
65.6 percent in 2007 ($15.37 billion), representing a gain of 40
percent. North American box office grosses will rise 24 percent
from $7.07 billion to $8.81 billion in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas business will boom in large part because of the growing
popularity of new multiplexes, often in towns where traditional
cinemas had either become outmoded or were closed. Baskerville said
that trend will lead to 22 percent more screens by 2007 with the
average admission ticket rising 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the total revenue and profit picture for a
significant-budget American release, the majority of the money is
often going to come from outside the United States,'' Baskerville
said. ``If you're a major studio, a very high percentage of your
movies will get released in foreign markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Top U.S. movies move into foreign markets a few weeks to a few
months after opening domestically. North American theatrical
grosses -- generally split 50-50 with exhibitors -- were once the
dominant factor in the success of a film; that area now accounts
for 35 percent of a movie's revenues and that figure will fall
because of growth in foreign theaters, video markets and television
rebroadcast rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studios have more opportunities than ever to recoup their
investments,'' Baskerville said.

MOTHER OF DEAD LOGGING PROTESTER SAYS INVESTIGATOR TO RECOMMEND
MANSLAUGHTER CHARGES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BILL DAWSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mother of the Pasadena, Texas, man killed while protesting
Houston-based Maxxam's redwood-logging practices says the lead
investigator in California has told her he would recommend
manslaughter charges be filed against her son's fellow activists.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a small band of Earth First! protesters who were with
David Chain when a falling tree struck him on Sept. 17 have said a
logger for Maxxam's Pacific Lumber subsidiary had threatened them
and should be charged in his death.
</P>
<P>
   Chain's mother, Cyndy Allsbrooks, who lives in Coldspring north
of Houston, said Thursday she believes the Humboldt County
Sheriff's Department is conducting a ``biased'' investigation
because of its close ties to Maxxam's Pacific Lumber subsidiary,
the county's largest private employer.
</P>
<P>
   Allsbrooks and her attorney, Steven Schectman, held a San
Francisco press conference to call for an independent inquiry into
her son's death.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheriff Dennis Lewis, a former Pacific Lumber employee,
dismissed the bias accusation as ``hogwash.'' He said he would
welcome an independent inquiry if another law-enforcement agency
would do it, but he doubts that will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Chain, 24, grew up in Pasadena, Texas, but in recent years lived
in Austin. When he was killed, he was on company property with
other activists, participating in a ``cat and mouse'' practice
aimed at slowing or stopping logging.
</P>
<P>
   Allsbrooks said she returned to California ``to find out what
happened to my so so he wouldn't have died in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   She said said she was ``outraged'' when Detective Juan Freeman
told her Monday he was recommending that Chain's fellow activists
be charged with manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   She said Freeman also told her the logger, A.E. Ammons, was
``doing what any logger would have done when kids are messing with
his livelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   Surviving members of Chain's party of Earth First! activists
have released a videotape to support their contention that the
logger cursed and threatened to drop a tree in their direction.
Their attorney has said the activists do not think Ammons intended
to kill Chain, but should be charged ``at least with involuntary
manslaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he agrees with his investigators that Ammon did not
mean to harm Chain, but he does not know enough about what the
protesters ``were doing to form an opinion about whether they are
criminally culpable.''
</P>
<P>
   A decision on prosecution is up to Humboldt County District
Attorney Terry Farmer, whose office received partial results of the
Sheriff's Department's investigation on Wednesday, Lewis said.
Farmer could not be reached for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Schectman, Allsbrooks' attorney, who released a letter calling
for a state or federal investigation, said Pacific Lumber shares
some responsibility for Chain's death for failing to implement
policies on dealing peaceably with protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokeswoman Mary Bullwinkel said Pacific Lumber has such
a policy and tells employees at all safety meetings ``to notify
authorities when people are discovered trespassing at active
logging sites.'' &QL;

KINGS ADD GOALIE DEPTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The Kings added goaltending depth Thursday,
acquiring Ryan Bach from the Detroit Red Wings organization in
exchange for a conditional choice in the 2000 NHL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Bach, who turned 25 on Wednesday, is expected to be the backup
to Manny Legace tonight when the Kings play the Tampa Bay Lightning
in the second game of a five-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   He was recalled Thursday from the Utah Grizzlies, where he had a
2-1 record with a 2.74 goals-against average with the IHL team.
Last season with Houston in the IHL, Bach _ the 262nd player chosen
in the 1992 draft _ was 26-9-6 with a 2.32 goals-against average.
He has never appeared in an NHL game.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since losing Frederic Chabot to Montreal in the NHL waiver
draft earlier this month, the Kings' goaltending depth has been a
major question mark, one that was exposed this week when Stephane
Fiset and Jamie Storr suffered groin injuries in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   Legace, 25, was outstanding in stopping 49 of 50 shots in his
NHL debut Wednesday, a 1-1 tie at Florida. But his backup was a
teen-ager, 18-year-old Alexey Volkov, the Kings' third-round choice
in this year's draft. With Bach's acquisition, Volkov was returned
Thursday to the Halifax Mooseheads of the Quebec junior league.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Larry Robinson said the small sample of the NHL was
positive for Volkov.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets to practice with NHL caliber, where things are
happening a little bit quicker, he gets to see what the life is
like at the pro level, and it gives him something to shoot for,''
Robinson said. ``I think it's a great educational experience for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Volkov said: ``I'm so young. It's unbelievable. I still can't
believe I'm in NHL. It's like a dream come true, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Before learning he'd been sent back to Halifax, Volkov said he
felt ready to play in the NHL if called upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice,'' Volkov said. ``I'm not scared. I'm
confident in myself. I just go and play like any game. It's very
tough sitting on the bench. You never know what can happen to the
first goalie. You have to keep focused in the game. It's very tough
being second goalie. To be honest, for me it would be better if I
stay in the net. I'm not nervous in the net. I'm nervous on the
bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Fiset will not play tonight because of his groin
injury. Neither will center Jozef Stumpel (hip-flexor strain) and
winger Josh Green (shoulder strain). Defenseman Steve Duchesne,
however, might return after missing a game with a mild groin
strain.... Lightning right wing Stephane Richer will miss the next
four weeks following arthroscopic surgery to remove scar tissue
from a sore left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved rumors: Pittsburgh Penguins holdout center Petr Nedved,
who is playing for the Las Vegas Thunder in the IHL, has denied
rumors that he might be coming to the Kings. Kings general manager
Dave Taylor also has denied the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source close to the Thunder, the Buffalo Sabres
have been scouting Nedved, and the New York Rangers also are
believed to be interested. Nedved, 26, has not played in the NHL
since the 1996-97 season. His best season was in 1995-96, when he
had 45 goals and 99 points for the Penguins.

HEDGE-FUND FIRM DENIES BEING IN TROUBLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Paloma Partners Management, a Greenwich, Conn., firm that runs
hedge funds, acknowledged Thursday that it had been battered by the
recent turmoil in the bond markets but insisted that it was still
in sound financial health. The firm, which operates more than 10
funds and is said to have at least $1 billion under management,
issued a statement in response to increasing speculation about its
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``To allay concerns and set the record straight, Paloma's funds
are financially sound and our portfolios are in strong cash
positions,'' Donald Sussman, chairman and chief executive, said in
the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about hedge funds have abounded since the near-collapse
of Long-Term Capital and the recent troubles at firms like
Ellington Capital and D.E. Shaw. Despite their secretive natures,
many funds are being forced to be more open about their positions.

WALDORF FIRES 63 FOR 3-SHOT LEAD AT DISNEY WORLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ All things considered, it was a
pleasant day for Duffy Waldorf. His family enjoyed being at Walt
Disney World. And Waldorf had a great time on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a nine-under-par 63, including six birdies on his first
seven holes, Waldorf cruised to a three-stroke lead after
Thursday's first round of the National Car Rental Golf Classic.
Tiger Woods, Len Mattiace and Jesper Parnevik were in a three-way
tie for second place at six under par, but Waldorf's opening round
was so good, his peers wondered if he would ever stop making
birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few more putts on the back nine, and he could have
definitely broken 59,'' said Parnevik, who played with Waldorf on
the Palm Course at Disney. ``He got off to an unbelievable start.
He was definitely hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldorf, Woods and Parnevik played on the Palm Course, while
Mattiace played on the more difficult Magnolia Course. The players
will switch courses Friday, and the final two rounds will be held
on the Magnolia Course.
</P>
<P>
   Waldorf's round was even more impressive because the wind gusted
up to 20 mph, making club selection difficult. But nothing seemed
to bother Waldorf, and his putting was superb. Waldorf used a new
putter Thursday, and it served him well. He made a 30-foot putt for
birdie on No. 3, a 45-foot putt for birdie on No. 4 and a 20-foot
putt for birdie on No. 6. Needless to say, Waldorf plans to keep
his new putter in the bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Zebra Tear Drop, and I was really rolling the ball
nicely,'' he said of his new putter. ``I made putts and I haven't
been doing that lately. It was a fun day to play. I don't know if
everyone else was having fun, but I was.''
</P>
<P>
   A 36-year-old native of California, Waldorf has just one PGA
Tour victory, the 1995 LaCantera Texas Open. However, with $285,952
in earnings this year, Waldorf is 102nd on the money list, safely
among the top 125 who will automatically earn their tour cards for
next year after this weekend's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   This is a high-pressure week for those fighting to stay in the
top 125, or for those trying to make the top 30 on the money list
who will qualify for next week's Tour Championship. But Waldorf is
in a position to relax. And on Thursday, he played that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago when I came here, I was 30th on the money list,
and it was a tough week,'' Waldorf said. ``If Payne Stewart had won
that week, he would have passed me on the money list and knocked me
out of the Tour Championship. After I finished, we were at Disney,
and I was making calls to see if Payne had won. It turns out Tiger
won. But it was a harder way to spend at Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldorf's round was two strokes off the course record, a 61 shot
by Mark Lye in 1984. After making the turn at six under par,
Waldorf birdied No. 11, then made another birdie at No. 12 when he
chipped in from 40 feet. His next birdie came at the par-5 No. 14,
when he reached the green in two shots and two-putted. Waldorf went
to 10 under par with a birdie at the par-3 No. 16, when he hit a
6-iron to 7 feet, then made the putt.
</P>
<P>
   But Waldorf finished with a bogey at No. 18 when his second shot
missed the green, forcing him to chip on, followed by two putts.
</P>
<P>
   Waldorf was not certain he could hold off proven winners like
Woods and Parnevik for another three rounds, but he was certain
that he would have a good time. After Thursday's round, he was
headed to Disney World, where else?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going with Tom Lehman,'' Waldorf said. ``People don't
recognize us in our swimsuits. You see our bodies. They go, `Who
are those guys?' We don't look like golfers. We don't look like
athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Woods, he continued the consistent play he has shown all
year, and he hoped that it would lead to a victory. Despite winning
just once on the PGA Tour this year, Woods has more top 10 finishes
(12) than anyone else, and he hoped his luck might change this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am actually more satisfied this year than I was last year,''
said Woods, who had seven birdies and just one bogey on Thursday.
``Even though I won a major last year, I would rather be more
consistent. When you are more consistent, down the road, the wins
will pile up.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This tournament is very special to me, because it
was a tournament I won in '96, and I had to win in order to get
into the Tour Championship. It was a great week. I still get good
vibes when I come back here.'' &QL;

HOME VIDEOS: JUST WHERE DID THE GIRLS GO? 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The young women are still nowhere to be found, but this week the
movie is back. Tied up for 15 years by various financial
complications, Peter Weir's acclaimed ``Picnic at Hanging Rock''
has returned to video in tape and DVD editions released Tuesday by
Home Vision and Criterion.
</P>
<P>
   The film, shown in theaters in 1975 (and most recently in a
revival this summer), is based on the novel by the late Joan
Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   During a picnic on St. Valentine's Day in 1900, a group of
schoolgirls is hypnotically compelled by an unknown force to climb
a rock formation in central Australia. Three of them and a
chaperone who goes to look for them disappear without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, both spooky and sexy, broke fresh ground in at least
two respects. For one, it was the first internationally distributed
representative of what was to become a noted school of filmmaking.
``There wasn't much of a theatrical film industry in Australia
then,'' said Karen Robson who as a 17-year-old portrayed a
picnicker named Irma in the film and is now an entertainment lawyer
in New York. ``The fact that it just was a movie and not a
glorified piece of television set it apart.''
</P>
<P>
   In a riskier departure, the film dared to pose a mystery, and a
riveting one at that, and then take leave without providing a
resolution or even a suggestion as to what could have happened to
the missing persons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappearance is to be neither dead or alive, so I thought it
was an interesting area to take a film,'' Weir said this week on
the telephone from Sydney. Caught by the seductive moodiness,
audiences generally didn't seem to mind the lack of explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The answer might have come from Irma, who at first vanishes with
the others, but is later found in a trancelike state. When she
revives, interrogators cluster around. She can't remember a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lindsay's book was supposedly based on a true story, but
records reveal no such incident. ``Yet another red herring,'' Ms.
Robson said with a laugh. ``Totally typical of the author of this
book. She was a very playful woman.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Family values loom all too large in the film's formula,''
Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. Despite, or perhaps
because of this, ``Lost in Space,'' Stephen Hopkins'
special-effects-laden film about the Robinson clan's wanderings
through the cosmos is video's best renter and seller this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a narrower vein, however, the movie, which is distributed by
New Line, is also notable for its DVD version, which links film and
additional features to be called up in the DVD-ROM drive of a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Watch the movie, remove the disk from the DVD player and plug it
into the computer for, among other things, the screenplay, deleted
scenes, commentary about space travel and links to New Line
Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   If extras of that nature induce a yawn, remember that DVD-ROMs
are likely to become much more innovative in future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Don Roos' gleefully acerbic first feature, the nail-hard
teen-ager Dedee Truitt (Christina Ricci) quits boring Louisiana and
goes north to camp out for a while with her nice homosexual
half-brother, Bill (Martin Donovan), whom she hasn't seen in years.
Bill, a sensitive high school teacher who tries to lead a fairly
orderly life, never knows what hits him.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, little Dedee seduces his boyfriend, Matt (Ivan
Sergei), announces herself pregnant and runs off to California with
Matt and most of Bill's life savings. Remaining remarkably
philosophical under the circumstances, Bill is left with a scandal
that costs him his job.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Lucia (Lisa Kudrow), the constantly complaining
and very funny sister of an earlier lover of his, Bill chases ``the
human tabloid,'' as Lucia calls Dedee, to the West Coast in, Janet
Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``a busily plotted, nicely
unpredictable sex comedy with a sarcastic edge.'' &QL;

   Turn the direction of a disaster film over to a woman (Mimi
Leder) and the action drifts away from the action mode to look for
what salutary effects the calamity might have on relationships and
family. When a top government official resigns, the MSNBC reporter
Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) at first thinks it's because he's having
an affair.
</P>
<P>
   Later she learns that he has revealed too much about an
impending Extinction Level Event, i.e., a collision with a
meteorite the size of Manhattan below 110th Street. Though
astronauts are dispatched to deflect the big rock, as they are in
``Armageddon,'' the summer's other meteor disaster movie, here the
focus is on bonding lovers, mending family rifts and taking care of
art, antiques, elephants and flamingos.

O'Sullivan), Francie has no choice but to try life on his own, and

   ``Yes, I do believe I shall be off on my travels,'' he concludes
to himself during one of his parents' boozy fights. Work in peat
bogs, electroshock therapy and other familiar indignities follow,

film emerges, this story moves far outside the realm of the

CAN JOHNSON LAST WITH FOX?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Got a baseball club that isn't ``King of the
Hill?'' Well, then, fire one manager, move another and bring in a
third who has earned decidedly mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know better, you'd think the Dodgers were another
branch of Fox's network programming. With Rupert Murdoch's minions
running things at Chavez Ravine, managers Bill Russell and Glenn
Hoffman lasted only slightly longer than Fox's failing fall sitcoms
``Costello'' and ``Getting Personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing personal against Davey Johnson, the Dodgers' latest
replacement show _ er manager _ but if he doesn't extend to 11 his
streak of exhorting clubs to first or second-place regular-season
finishes, he can count on being extended the same courtesies shown
a slow-starting comedy series.
</P>
<P>
   There were bolder choices out there for president Bob Graziano
and general manager Kevin Malone _ former Dodger Davey Lopes,
ex-Yankee Chris Chambliss and Taft High product Kevin Kennedy, to
name just a few.
</P>
<P>
   Don Baylor, whose patience got worn as thin as the mile-high air
in Colorado, also was there for the taking had the Dodgers been
determined, after Felipe Alou turned them down, to stay the course
in hiring their first minority manager.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for the Dodgers' purposes, there might have been no
better candidate than someone the Fox network tried to hire as a
color commentator last year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ultimately passed on that job and was turned away from a
managerial position in Toronto because, in the words of Blue Jays
general manager Gord Ash, ``Davey's track record indicates that
after a couple or three seasons he's usually found in some
controversy, and not necessarily ones of his own making.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your perfect matches. What we have here is the union
of a manager not prone to staying long and a club that wields a
quick hook.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't used to be that way, of course. The Dodgers had only
two managers in their first 37 years in L.A. Everybody talks about
the risks of entrusting the club to an unproven member of the
Dodgers family (i.e., Lopes), forgetting that in 1977 the franchise
did precisely that.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers gave a former player, Tommy Lasorda, his first
major-league managing opportunity and you could say Lasorda did all
right by the people who went out on a limb for him. He shepherded
the club to the National League title in his first season and the
World Series championship in his 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Fox showed that kind of commitment once, sticking with the
``X-Files'' long enough for it to carve out its niche in prime
time. But from the beginning, its baseball brass has shown no such
patience. Within three months of assuming control of the club from
Peter O'Malley, Graziano traded the Dodgers' resident superstar,
Mike Piazza, and the bulk of its top prospects. Then he fired
Russell and general manager Fred Claire.
</P>
<P>
   The new Dodgers blueprint is as plain as it is stark: Change the
complexion of the team and if that doesn't do the trick, then bring
in new faces.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is no stranger to the situation that will greet him when
he arrives here. In 1996 he took over an Orioles team that had lots
of egos and experience and a 13-season playoff drought. He led them
to consecutive postseason appearances before faxing in his
resignation in Nov. of 1997 (because he believed he was about to be
fired).
</P>
<P>
   It was the third job Johnson had lost in eight years for reasons
that have nothing to do with his record. In 24 seasons as a player
and a manager, Johnson has been affiliated with only four sub-500
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   No other manager currently in the majors has a better winning
percentage than Johnson's .575 (985-727). He also has one of the
more prickly personalities. Johnson has been described as stubborn,
mercurial, selfish and manipulative. And that's just his allies
talking.
</P>
<P>
   Friends or foes all agree, he's not one to kowtow to management
or spoiled stars. He benched three of his better players for a 1997
playoff game against Seattle and feuded with Marge Schott in
Cincinnati and Peter Angelos in Baltimore (when Malone was there as
the assistant GM).
</P>
<P>
   One of the players Johnson rode hard in Baltimore was Bobby
Bonilla, of whom he once said, ``He's not a Gold Glover wherever I
put him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla's glove _ and his $11 million salary over the next two
years _ belong to the Dodgers now. It'll be interesting to see how
Johnson goes about wresting Bonilla and his cohorts from their
collective comfort zone. No question the clubhouse could use some
shaking up, considering the Dodgers haven't won a postseason game
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   One unidentified baseball executive told the Sporting News last
year that Johnson ``knows how to manage a game as well as anyone,
but he's not a disciplinarian. He's going to get his time in on the
golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Having had a whole year to roam the links to his heart's
content, Johnson seems eager to get back to baseball. The tagline
on the column he wrote for USA Today during the World Series read
like a position-wanted ad: ``Davey Johnson, whose most recent job
was with Baltimore, hopes to return to managing soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Be careful what you wish for, isn't that what they say? &QL;

ISRAEL, PALESTINIANS NEAR ELUSIVE PEACE ACCORD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israeli and Palestinian negotiators neared an
elusive interim peace accord Thursday after each side gained
concessions on land and security during marathon sessions with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart described the afternoon
sessions between Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat as the most
intense so far in the eight-day summit.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the two sides said they had reached an agreement
on Israel's push for changes in the Palestine Liberation
Organization's charter that calls for the destruction of Israel.
But Lockhart warned that the issue had not been fully settled.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in the two camps told Reuters the Palestinian National
Council would ratify changes in the 1964 provisions after Israel
completed a staged withdrawal of troops from portions of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted sources as saying Clinton personally
would attend the PLO session but there was no confirmation from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The potential breakthrough on the issue, which Netanyahu made a
centerpiece of his agenda, was one of several advances in the
roller-coaster talks.
</P>
<P>
   Just 24 hours earlier, Netanyahu packed his bags and ordered his
airplane on stand-by as he threatened to walk away from the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, urging the Israelis to remain, crafted a
20-page text outlining the agreements so far and proposals to
resolve remaining problems.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, Clinton rushed back to Wye Plantation on
Maryland's Eastern Shore to keep the negotiations going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest decisions now, at last, are on the table. Israel,
the Palestinians, the region and the world have very much at stake
today. I hope the parties will seize this opportunity and not
retreat from the clear moment to capture the momentum of peace, and
keep it moving forward,'' Clinton said before departing Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The late evening talks focused on provisions in the PLO charter
that calls for the destruction of Israel, the release of 3,000
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and a third Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the events of yesterday behind us, we are in a situation
where the leaders arrived at the Wye Woods conference area and
began what I would describe as a very serious and intensive effort
to try to make the key decisions necessary for us to put the peace
process back on track,'' said James Rubin, the State Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his sixth appearance at the Wye River conference
center for direct negotiations with Netanyahu and Arafat. The
president has invested more than 70 hours trying to broker a deal.
</P>
<P>
   He later was joined by Jordan's King Hussein, the ailing monarch
undergoing cancer treatment in the United States. The king flew to
the Wye River conference center briefly and has remained in touch
with both sides through telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein, who made peace with Israel in 1994, has played a
key role as a Middle East peace broker.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides appeared to resolve key security issues such as a
Palestinian crackdown on militant groups and arrests of suspected
terrorists. Israeli negotiators had balked at withdrawing troops
from another 13 percent of the West Bank until Arafat agreed to a
detailed security plan.
</P>
<P>
   The AP reported the Israelis considered that progress was made
on the security issue while Palestinians claimed the ``security
file was closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin later said that the security issue no longer was the focus
of the talks, saying major progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the significant gaps have not been closed. The key
decisions that need to be made today include areas where gaps
remain. We wouldn't be here, the president wouldn't have rolled up
his sleeves and urged the leaders to get down to serious business
today if there weren't significant gaps remaining,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that with the tough issues on the table the
president was pressing for decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wants the parties to make important decisions
today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart declined to speculate about where the talks were
headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've repeated ad nauseam we take this one meeting, one day
at a time. But again, the tough issues are on the table and we're
working toward making decisions and having the parties work through
these issues,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The AP quoted Ahmed Tibi, an Arafat adviser, as saying the issue
of the Palestinian charter and Israel's third-phase withdrawal of
troops had been the most difficult issues remaining. Tibi said
Israel dropped its demand that the Palestinians extradite suspected
terrorists to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   However, the delegations may be facing some artificial deadlines
that could force a resolution to the talks. The Jewish Sabbath
starts at sundown today and Clinton planned to travel to California
this weekend on a trip that was rescheduled from earlier this week.
Also, Netanyahu may face a vote of nonconfidence by Israeli
lawmakers on Monday. &QL;

 PUC's Ruling on Net Calls to Cost Pac Bell  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Internet takes you into cyberspace, but the phone call that
gets you there is local, California regulators ruled yesterday.
<P>
   The 3-to-2 decision by the state Public Utilities Commission
requires local phone companies, including Pacific Bell and GTE, to
pay their competitors millions of dollars in fees.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are phone calls placed by Pac Bell and GTE customers to
Internet service providers who use competing phone companies for
local service.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, local phone companies must pay one another a
fee when they handle a call from each other's customers.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell has refused to pay fees on calls its customers
place to local ISP numbers. Even though both numbers are in the
same local calling area, Pac Bell has argued that Internet calls
are long-distance because they could end up anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the PUC sided with 21 other states in determining that
Internet calls to local numbers are local. What happens after the
call hits the ISP's modem makes no difference, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competing local phone companies are entitled to compensation
for the functions they perform,'' said Commissioner Jessie Knight,
who voted in favor of classifying the calls as local.
</P>
<P>
   The commission ordered all local phone companies to start making
reciprocal payments on Internet calls immediately.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Pac Bell already owes more than $5 million to competing phone
carriers and has been keeping the money in an escrow account.
</P>
<P>
   In California, most Internet users have Pacific Bell, while most
ISPs use competing phone companies because their rates are lower
than Pac Bell's. That's why Pacific Bell owes so much to its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mashek, a spokesman for Pac Bell, said the company is
``disappointed'' with the commission's ruling and is considering
whether to appeal. The company has not decided whether it will pay
the fees pending a possible appeal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the calls had been deemed long-distance, Pac Bell and GTE
competitors might have raised rates to make up for lost fee income.
And those higher rates might have been passed along to ISPs, who
might have passed them along to Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Cindy Schonhaut, senior vice president for ICG
Communications, a local phone company, applauded the commission's
decision but said she's not sure the battle has been won.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the track record from other companies is a model, then Pac
Bell is going to appeal the decision,'' said Schonhaut, whose
Englewood, Colo., company provides service to many ISPs. ``The
regional Bell operating companies in other states have done
something along those lines. They appeal and then continue to
litigate.''
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, Ameritech Corp. appealed a ruling against it on the
same issue and refused to pay bills of $6 million to four rivals.
SBC Communications Inc. also appealed a similar ruling from the PUC
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Four state courts have upheld PUC decisions that local Internet
calls are local.

 Cal Fed Plans More Staff Cuts  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
California Federal Bank said yesterday it will cut more jobs than
it originally projected following its recently completed takeover
of Southern California's Glendale Federal Bank.
<P>
   The San Francisco savings and loan now expects to eliminate
1,215 jobs, about 75 more than it forecast when it agreed to take
over Glendale Federal in February, Cal Fed President Carl Webb said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cuts will occur in Southern California, though more
than 100 Bay Area jobs will vanish when the thrift closes 15
branches in the region. The two thrifts together had about 8,000
full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts, which are taking place through a combination of
firings and attrition, are aimed at slashing the combined thrift's
expenses, Webb explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on track to realize $160 million in (annual) cost
savings,'' Cal Fed's president said.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts include 415 positions that were vacated and never
filled while the merger was pending, 225 jobs that ended when the
transaction took effect September 11, and 575 slots that will
disappear over the next four to six months as the two thrifts
combine operations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cuts that haven't already been made will take place
when Cal Fed closes 56 branches across the state in mid-November,
including four in San Francisco, three in San Jose, four in San
Mateo County, two in Marin County and two in Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   Other jobs will disappear when Glendale Federal's loan servicing
center in San Diego and data processing facility in Burbank are
shut over the next few months. Job cuts are common in bank and
thrift mergers as institutions look to save money by shutting
overlapping operations.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Golden State Bancorp, Cal Fed's corporate parent,
reported a third-quarter net loss of $32.2 million (44 cents a
diluted share), including an extraordinary charge for refinancing
about $2 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the item, the thrift earned $47.8 million (62 cents)
as it originated $2.7 billion in mortgages and other loans.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said earnings comparisons with previous periods were
not meaningful because prior reports didn't include Glendale
Federal's results.
</P>
<P>
   The thrift's future profits will depend on how many customers
pay off mortgages ahead of schedule to take advantage of lower
interest rates, it told analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Fed's profits shrink when borrowers pay mortgages ahead of
schedule because it loses income from servicing loans and must
replace mortgages with assets that earn lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Fed is the nation's second-largest savings and loan and
California's fourth-largest deposit holder.  &LR;

 Kaiser Expects Big Loss  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Kaiser Permanente said yesterday it is expecting a big
third-quarter operating loss that, unlike losses in previous
quarters, probably won't be offset by investment income.
<P>
   ``We will be reporting a loss, but until I have the actual
numbers, I can't comment on the size,'' said David O'Grady, a
spokesman for the 9.2-million-member health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, which is headquartered in Oakland, suffered $162 million
in operating losses during the first half of 1998. But those losses
were offset by gains of more than $130 million in investment
income, for a net loss of just $31 million in the six months that
ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Now the giant health plan is predicting more operating losses
for the quarter ended September 30. But, sources said, there are
unlikely to be any investment gains this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the stock market gone so far south, we probably won't be
able to offset our operating losses as in the past,'' said a source
within Kaiser, which will release its third-quarter numbers at the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's poor financial returns this year come in the wake of a
whopping $270 million loss in 1997 _ the health plan's first annual
loss in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cited a variety of reasons for the continued red ink:
Hospitalization costs are rising throughout the health care
industry, after declining for several years. Drug costs are also
rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``These problems are unique to Kaiser only in scale,'' said
Wanda Jones, a health care analyst with the New Century Health Care
Institute in San Francisco. ``We'll be seeing more of this (kind of
loss) elsewhere, but Kaiser is big enough to really notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser also ran into trouble by adding members more quickly than
it could handle in areas such as Southern California. That meant it
had to spend extra money sending patients to hospitals and doctors
outside its own system.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser has responded to its losses by a companywide cost-cutting
program, which included selling its money-losing Texas unit.
</P>
<P>
   It is also trying to boost its revenues through rate increases _
for instance, winning a 10.7 percent rate hike from the California
Public Employee Retirement System last June.
</P>
<P>
   But most of these rate increases won't go into effect until
1999. So they didn't add anything to Kaiser's bottom line in the
recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether this round of rate increases will be enough
to offset the losses _ so there may be more rounds of rate
increases in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaiser's best recourse is going back to their purchasers and
saying, `Do you really want us around? If so, we have to
renegotiate the contracts upwards,' '' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest health maintenance organization, Kaiser
provides health care for 5.7 million Californians. That includes
2.7 million people in Northern California, or one-third of this
region's insured population. &LR;

 AirTouch Posts Record 3rd Quarter  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Strong demand for wireless service overseas boosted AirTouch
Communications Inc. to record third-quarter profit levels as the
No. 1 wireless carrier added more than 1 million new subscribers
this quarter.
<P>
   San Francisco's AirTouch reported a 59 percent increase in net
income from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company earned $213 million (30 cents a share) compared to
$134 million (18 cents) a share in the third quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues rose 24 percent to $1.96 billion from $1.58 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Ginn, AirTouch chief executive, said the company was not
harmed by the economic flux overseas that has hurt many companies
with international ventures.
</P>
<P>
   He said AirTouch's international operations added 735,000 new
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``International is just exploding, and we expect to see huge
growth in the international market,'' Ginn said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which beat Wall Street's estimates by at least 4
cents, plans to continue expanding into new markets, Ginn said.
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch stock closed up 25 cents at $53.50.

 New Life in Vacaville for Genentech  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Genentech Corp. will christen a $250 million manufacturing facility
today in Vacaville, augmenting a 15-year-old South San Francisco
production line that can't keep up with demand for its biotech
remedies.
<P>
   Today's event highlights Genentech's rebound from the management
and product woes that plagued it in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genentech is a huge turnaround story,'' said Meirav Chovav,
with Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ``Management has taken a
company that had no new significant products in the pipeline and
not only created those products, but the facility to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, for instance, Genentech said it would ask the Food
and Drug Administration for permission to make a new growth hormone
called ProLease. Genentech already earns a quarter of its revenues
selling hormones for children with clinical growth deficiencies.
But Chovav said the existing remedies must be administered by daily
injection, whereas ProLease, if it wins FDA approval, could spur
growth with biweekly shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers wouldn't need to chase the kids with a needle once a
day,'' Chovav said, making the hormone easier to administer and
thus more likely to be used.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Joel Sendek, with Gerard Klauer Mattison, said that in
addition to improving its current products with innovations like
ProLease, Genentech has introduced new remedies like Herceptin, a
protein that fights the most aggressive forms of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main sexiness of the new manufacturing facility is that
they're bringing it on line just as their cancer lines are taking
off,'' Sendek said. ``The plant is a key element of their strategic
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Jackson, general manager of Genentech's Vacaville
facility, said the five-building campus includes its own utility
building to provide the purified water, steam, compressed air and
refrigeration units that are part of the biotech manufacturing
process.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the operation will be a 12,000-liter
stainless-steel fermentation tank, 25 feet tall and 8 feet in
diameter, where Genentech will ``grow'' Herceptin, the first
product planned for the new facility. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The process begins with special cells that create the Herceptin
protein as a byproduct. In a simplified sense, these cells
multiply, producing more and more Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   Once the cells have produced enough Herceptin, this &UR;  &LR; refined
protein &UR;  &LR; must be separated from the cells and stored in smaller
stainless-steel containers. These bulk-protein containers, which
are about three times the size of a beer keg, must be chilled to
minus 20 degrees Celsius to protect the Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   It is this bulk protein, in super-chilled tanks, that will roll
off the assembly line in Vacaville. The Herceptin then will be
shipped to South San Francisco, where existing Genentech facilities
will pump the protein into tiny glass vials destined for hospitals.
There, doctors will load the Herceptin into syringes and inject it
into breast cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Young, Genentech's chief operating officer, estimated that
each keg of bulk protein contains about 15,000 doses _ or about $8
million worth of Herceptin. Once the Vacaville plant is in full
swing, about three or four tanks of frozen bulk protein should roll
out of the facility each week.
</P>
<P>
   But before Genentech can start this profitable process, the
facility must win FDA clearance to go into operation. Jackson said
Genentech has about 160 people at work in Vacaville, doing
shakedown tests to show the FDA that the facility can meet exacting
standards for purity and safety. Assuming all goes well _ and
analysts anticipate no problems _ the plant should go into full
operation late next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of our industry is that we have a long investment
cycle,'' said Young, adding that Genentech started planning the new
facility in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the Genentech plant is another feather in the cap
for Vacaville, which quietly has become the Bay Area's
biotech-manufacturing center. Biosource Technologies, an
agricultural biotech firm, is based in Vacaville. Alza Corp. of
Palo Alto and Chiron Corp. of Emeryville already have manufacturing
sites in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech's Young said Vacaville had several draws: It is close
to the R&AMP;D labs and headquarters of Bay Area biotech firms, and it
has cheap land, a responsive local government and qualified labor.
</P>
<P>
   When the Vacaville plant is in full swing, it will employ
roughly 300 people, about a third of whom will be manufacturing
technicians starting at $28,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech employs about 1,200 manufacturing people at its South
San Francisco headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares closed at $70.06 yesterday, off 6 cents. The company
hit a 52-week high of $74.94 on October 12.

 Trio of Top Execs Bailing Out of Wells Fargo  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Three of Wells Fargo's highest-ranking executives are leaving the
bank as a result of its pending merger with Minneapolis's Norwest
Corp.
<P>
   Those departing are Vice Chairman Joseph Stiglich, head of Wells
Fargo's retail branch network; Vice Chairman Michael Gillfillan,
the bank's credit chief; and Executive Vice President Dudley Nigg,
online banking manager.
</P>
<P>
   The two vice chairmen will get severance packages providing
three years of salary plus bonus. Because they are not among the
bank's five highest-paid executives, their salaries do not have to
be disclosed. But they are among Wells Fargo's 10 highest-ranking
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Stiglich's position won't exist after the merger and his
responsibilities will be divided among several regional managers,
Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kim Kellogg said.
</P>
<P>
   Stiglich, 51, joined Wells Fargo in 1971 and took over
management of the bank's retail network in 1994. During his tenure,
the bank moved away from traditional offices to alternative ways of
reaching customers, such as supermarket branches.
</P>
<P>
   Gillfillan, 50, agreed in July to be chief credit officer of the
combined bank but later decided not to take the job, Kellogg said.
He joined the bank in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Nigg, 51, will retire at the end of the year. He recently bought
a boat and plans to sail to New Zealand, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Osberg, a division manager in the bank's online banking
unit, will replace him on an interim basis. Under the British-born
Nigg, Wells Fargo aggressively moved into Internet banking and now
has some 540,000 online customers.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo's merger with Norwest is set to take effect November
2, forming the nation's seventh-largest bank.

 Investors Suing S.F Fund Manager Robert Pryt and Bear Stearns  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Hedge fund fallout is hitting full force. A group of Bay Area hedge
fund investors, including Gymboree Chairman Stuart Moldaw, is
striking back.
<P>
   In a case that is sure to capture national attention, angry
investors are suing San Francisco fund manager Robert Pryt and his
broker-dealer, Bear Stearns, for mismanaging their money and
misrepresenting the fund's performance, which was used to determine
how much Pryt got paid.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, investors contend that Pryt made unauthorized bets
on privately held companies and wildly exaggerated the value of
their shares in his reports. Pryt folded his fund, BKP Partners, in
June after losing as much as $100 million, according to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the fund's liquidation rippled from San Francisco to
Hollywood because Pryt happened to blow the dough of some
star-studded investors. They included movie producer Jon Peters,
his former squeeze Barbra Streisand and O.J. Simpson's former
lawyer Robert Shapiro. Peters reportedly lost ``millions''
personally, but neither he nor the other two celebrity investors
are currently party to the lawsuit filed earlier this week in
Superior Court in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Why the Tinseltown investors didn't join the lawsuit isn't
clear. Peters would not comment and referred inquiries to Michael
Klein, a Los Angeles broker-dealer. Klein, who is the son of former
San Diego Chargers owner Gene Klein, did not return telephone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to trusts connected to the family of Gymboree's
Moldaw, dozens of other old money trusts tied to well-heeled Bay
Area families are participating in the lawsuit. The investor group
that is suing says its combined investments accounted for a
majority stake of the fund, which at its peak had assets of about
$270 million, says Solomon Cera, a San Francisco lawyer who
represents the group.
</P>
<P>
   Above and beyond the starpower of some of Pryt's investors, the
lawsuit against the 39-year-old money manager will be eyed closely
by the investment community because it is testing how basic
principles of common law &UR;  &LR; treat hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, hedge funds have been grabbing big headlines, mostly
due to the multibillion-dollar bailout of Long-Term Capital. And
unfortunately for the hundreds of money managers who run these
private investment partnerships, the term ``hedge fund'' has been
thrown around so loosely that the funds are greatly misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Most hedge funds are, in fact, largely unregulated private funds
that usually invest in stocks. And they almost always devote
portions of their portfolios to short-selling as well as to bets
that stocks will go up. Hence, they ``hedge'' against swings in the
stock market. The investment model is supposed to outperform the
broader stock market if executed well.
</P>
<P>
   However, by definition, hedge funds aren't limited to stocks and
can invest in anything that the partners agree to, including bonds,
currency, futures, options and other vehicles. Long-Term Capital,
for example, is really a quasibank that borrowed billions from
banks and major financial firms to perform highly technical trades
on a global basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Pryt fund, on the other hand, fit the definition of an
ordinary hedge fund. But here's the chief complaint: The partners
are accusing Pryt of investing in vehicles that were not approved
by the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our contention is that (Pryt) went beyond the scope that his
investors had approved,'' Cera says.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the investors accuse Pryt of buying stock in
private companies and inflating the value of that stock in his
reports. Stock of private companies is risky and highly illiquid,
making it difficult to sell and place a value on.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, when the fund's other investments were performing
poorly, Pryt allegedly jacked up the values of the private-company
stock to boost the performance record of his portfolio, Cera says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically tried to turn a hedge fund into a venture capital
fund'' without his partners' authorization, Cera says.
</P>
<P>
   And then Pryt placed grandiose valuations on the private shares
in order to pay himself full compensation, Cera says. The lion's
share of Pryt's bonus, which was 20 percent of all profits, was
paid only when his performance exceeded his best previous effort.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted at his office, Pryt would only say that ``the
lawsuit was without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   The other twist to the lawsuit, which should grab Wall Street's
full attention, is that the investor group is also suing Pryt's
prime broker, Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Sterns is a securities firm with an operation that
specializes in making and clearing trades for hedge fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a brokerage simply executes decisions ordered by its
customer _ in this case, Pryt. But the investor group is accusing
Bear Stearns of taking an active role in managing the fund and that
it should have notified Pryt's investors of any alleged wrongdoing
by the money manager.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the investors contend that a Bear Stearns
executive became an employee of a Pryt-controlled arbitrage entity.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, like Pryt, Bear Stearns is saving its explanation
for the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the case is completely without merit, and we will
respond accordingly,'' a Bear Stearns spokeswoman says.

 New Life in Vacaville for Genentech  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Genentech Corp. will christen a $250 million manufacturing facility
today in Vacaville, augmenting a 15-year-old South San Francisco
production line that can't keep up with demand for its biotech
remedies.
<P>
   Today's event highlights Genentech's rebound from the management
and product woes that plagued it in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genentech is a huge turnaround story,'' said Meirav Chovav,
with Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ``Management has taken a
company that had no new significant products in the pipeline and
not only created those products, but the facility to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, for instance, Genentech said it would ask the Food
and Drug Administration for permission to make a new growth
hormone. Genentech already earns a quarter of its revenues selling
hormones for children with clinical growth deficiencies. But Chovav
said the existing remedies must be administered by daily injection,
whereas the new growth hormone, if it wins FDA approval, could spur
growth with biweekly shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers wouldn't need to chase the kids with a needle once a
day,'' Chovav said, making the hormone easier to administer and
thus more likely to be used.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Joel Sendek, with Gerard Klauer Mattison, said that in
addition to improving its current products with innovations like
the new growth hormone, Genentech has introduced new remedies like
Herceptin, a protein that fights the most aggressive forms of
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main sexiness of the new manufacturing facility is that
they're bringing it on line just as their cancer lines are taking
off,'' Sendek said. ``The plant is a key element of their strategic
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Jackson, general manager of Genentech's Vacaville
facility, said the five-building campus includes its own utility
building to provide the purified water, steam, compressed air and
refrigeration units that are part of the biotech manufacturing
process.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the operation will be a 12,000-liter
stainless-steel fermentation tank, 25 feet tall and 8 feet in
diameter, where Genentech will ``grow'' Herceptin, the first
product planned for the new facility. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The process begins with special cells that create the Herceptin
protein as a byproduct. In a simplified sense, these cells
multiply, producing more and more Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   Once the cells have produced enough Herceptin, this &UR;  &LR; refined
protein &UR;  &LR; must be separated from the cells and stored in smaller
stainless-steel containers. These bulk-protein containers, which
are about three times the size of a beer keg, must be chilled to
minus 20 degrees Celsius to protect the Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   It is this bulk protein, in super-chilled tanks, that will roll
off the assembly line in Vacaville. The Herceptin then will be
shipped to South San Francisco, where existing Genentech facilities
will pump the protein into tiny glass vials destined for hospitals.
There, doctors will load the Herceptin into syringes and inject it
into breast cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Young, Genentech's chief operating officer, estimated that
each keg of bulk protein contains about 15,000 doses _ or about $8
million worth of Herceptin. Once the Vacaville plant is in full
swing, about three or four tanks of frozen bulk protein should roll
out of the facility each week.
</P>
<P>
   But before Genentech can start this profitable process, the
facility must win FDA clearance to go into operation. Jackson said
Genentech has about 160 people at work in Vacaville, doing
shakedown tests to show the FDA that the facility can meet exacting
standards for purity and safety. Assuming all goes well _ and
analysts anticipate no problems _ the plant should go into full
operation late next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of our industry is that we have a long investment
cycle,'' said Young, adding that Genentech started planning the new
facility in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the Genentech plant is another feather in the cap
for Vacaville, which quietly has become the Bay Area's
biotech-manufacturing center. Biosource Technologies, an
agricultural biotech firm, is based in Vacaville. Alza Corp. of
Palo Alto and Chiron Corp. of Emeryville already have manufacturing
sites in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech's Young said Vacaville had several draws: It is close
to the R&AMP;D labs and headquarters of Bay Area biotech firms, and it
has cheap land, a responsive local government and qualified labor.
</P>
<P>
   When the Vacaville plant is in full swing, it will employ
roughly 300 people, about a third of whom will be manufacturing
technicians starting at $28,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech employs about 1,200 manufacturing people at its South
San Francisco headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares closed at $70.06 yesterday, off 6 cents. The company
hit a 52-week high of $74.94 on October 12.

HORSE OF YEAR A HOT TOPIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There will be between 75 and 90 horses in the Breeders' Cup
races, but for the promoters and most fans, only two really matter.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm, with his Goodwood Handicap victory last Saturday
at Santa Anita, showed he'll be a formidable opponent for leading
Horse of the Year candidate Skip Away. This should make the two
grays' long-awaited showdown in the Breeders' Cup Classic the most
anticipated race of the Nov.7 card at Churchill Downs in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm flew to Louisville the morning after the Goodwood,
and owners Bob and Beverly Lewis of Newport Beach already had a
check made out for $480,000, the cost of making the 4-year-old colt
a supplemental nominee for the $4 million Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race didn't take too much out of him at all,'' trainer
Bob Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first odds posted on the Classic, the main event of the
seven-race Breeders' Cup, Skip Away was a 2-1 favorite and Silver
Charm was the 5-2 second choice of the Daily Racing form's Mike
Watchmaker. The Pat Byrne-trained pair of Awesome Again and Touch
Gold was a joined third at 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup should include plenty of long-distance banter
between Baffert and Skip Away trainer Sonny Hine.
</P>
<P>
   Hine fired the first volley Tuesday during a conference call
with national turf writers when he ridiculed Baffert's optimism
that Silver Charm could edge Skip Away out of Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's assuming he's going to win,'' Hine said. ``I don't think
he (Silver Charm) can be Horse of the Year off what he's done, not
at all. Grade I's are the epitome of this game, and you're talking
about a horse who hasn't won a Grade I in this country in a year
and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm won the $4 million Dubai World Cup overseas in
March, but his three biggest U.S. victories _ the San Fernando and
Strub Stakes and the Goodwood _ were Grade II races.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away has won five of the six Grade I races he has started
in 1998. He has a good shot to be the first repeat Classic winner
in the Breeders' Cup's 15-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The field for the 1\-mile Classic could include Gentlemen,
Coronado's Quest and Belmont Stakes winner Victory Gallop, though
Gentlemen also will be kept eligible for the Mile when the
pre-entries are taken Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With the major prep races in California, New York and Kentucky
complete, here's an early look at the other six Breeders' Cup
races:
</P>
<P>
   Turf: Chief Bearhart, the Canadian horse who won the 1{-mile
grass race when the Breeders' Cup was held at Hollywood Park in
'97, must contend with a platoon of foreign-trained horses. Royal
Anthem, who came from England to win the Canadian International
last weekend, is ridden by Southern California's Gary Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Mile: The shorter turf race got a lot more interesting when
Favorite Trick, the '97 Horse of the Year as a 2-year-old but a
disappointment in '98, won his first grass start last Saturday at
Keeneland. The '97 Juvenile winner could become the first horse to
capture Breeders' Cup races on both dirt and grass.
</P>
<P>
   Distaff: Looks like a two-filly race: Sharp Cat and Banshee
Breeze, winners by 11 and 12 lengths, respectively, in their preps.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile: The departure of Del Mar Futurity winner Worldly
Manner, who's off to Dubai after being purchased for $5 million,
leaves eastern 2-year-olds to dominate the field. Boston Celtics
coach Rick Pitino owns two of them _ Champagne Stakes winner The
Groom is Red and Belmont Park allowance winner Cryptodiplomacy.
Both are trained by Nick Zito.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile Fillies: Baffert, whose only Breeders' Cup win is the
'92 Sprint with Thirty Slews, has two contenders in Excellent
Meeting, winner of the Del Mar Debutante and the Oak Leaf, and
Silverbulletday, a winner at Keeneland.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint: New York's Affirmed Success is the favorite, but
California has contenders in Gold Land and 3-year-old Reraise, the
latter to be supplemented for $120,000 after winning the Kentucky
Cup Sprint at Turfway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: It's the calm before the Oct.31 California Cup and
the following weekend's Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Oak Tree highlight is Sunday's $125,000 Carleton F. Burke
Handicap at 1{ miles on turf. Amerique, co-high-weight with Crystal
Hearted at 118 pounds, tries for his first victory since the San
Juan Capistrano Handicap, another marathon on the Santa Anita grass
course.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the $100,000 Harold C. Ramser Sr. Handicap for
3-year-old fillies is headed by Diamond on the Run, making her
first turf start as she tries to give jockey Kent Desormeaux and
trainer Neil Drysdale their 12th stakes win together at Santa Anita
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In perspective: Alex Solis on recording his 3,000th career
victory aboard Secret Advice R.N on Saturday: ``It's a great
feeling to know I'm only 5,000 wins behind Laffit (Pincay) and Bill
Shoemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-seven men have ridden 3,000 winners. Six are active at
Santa Anita: Pincay (8,649 through Saturday), Chris McCarron
(6,689), Eddie Delahoussaye (5,961), Gary Stevens (4,390), Kent
Desormeaux (3,666) and Solis. Shoemaker's record is 8,833. &QL;

FORMER MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR FRANCIS SARGENT DIES AT 83 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He was so much the archetype of the Massachusetts
Yankee _ lanky frame, sandy hair, lantern jaw, toothy grin, the
whistling S _ that Norman Rockwell painted his portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Francis W. Sargent, who governed the state with vigor and humor
from 1969 to 1974, died, of heart failure at age 83 Thursday in the
Dover, Mass., home where he'd lived for more than half a century.
His remains will be cremated, and a memorial service will be held
early next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarge,'' as he was universally and fondly known, was a rare
species in the state's political bird book _ a liberal Republican
who relished hobnobbing with Democrats, a blueblood with an R-rated
tongue who delighted in poking fun at himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was an architect by training, an outdoorsman by nature, and a
politician by accident. If Mr. Sargent savored his six years in the
corner office (``I got a hell of a big kick out of it.''), it may
have been because he arrived there by serendipity.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sargent, who had never held elective office, was voted
lieutenant governor in 1966 under the slogan ``Put Sarge in
Charge.'' When John A. Volpe left the corner office in January 1969
to become transportation secretary in the Nixon administration, Mr.
Sargent suddenly found himself unquestionably in command.
</P>
<P>
   So he plunked down a puckish sign (``Don't Ask Me, I Didn't Go
to Harvard'') on his desk and set about wooing enough Democratic
lawmakers to allow him to function. ``I pissed off some
Republicans,'' Mr. Sargent conceded, ``but there was no other way
to get anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have been Republican by affiliation, but Mr. Sargent was
colorful Democrat by temperament. He loved marching in parades,
slapping backs, pumping hands, and hanging out with Irish pols who
loved to needle him.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sargent golfed with House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill
Jr. (``I thought he was absolutely wonderful.''), lunched with
Boston Mayor Kevin H. White, and traded quips with state Senate
President William M. Bulger on St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I could be funny, but Bulger is the funniest
S.O.B. I know,'' Mr. Sargent said. ``There was no way of beating
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sargent's plain talk and self-deprecating wit were
undeniably popular with the electorate. Running against White in
1970, Mr. Sargent won by more than a quarter of a million votes,
even winning the mayor's home city.
</P>
<P>
   Freed from the ``acting'' governor label, Mr. Sargent made the
most of his mandate, signing more than 1,000 laws in 1971 alone. He
created a cabinet system, approved a dozen state colleges, pushed
for special education and public housing programs, stopped the
building of new expressways within Route 128, fought forprison
reform (introducing inmate furloughs) and safeguarded privacy
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Mr. Sargent's most enduring legacy may have been his impact
upon the state's judiciary. He filled 190 judgeships, three times
as many as any previous governor (in part because judges were now
required to retire at 70), and the quality of the appointments was
generally regarded as excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Sargent was one of the finest human beings I've ever met
and certainly the best governor I've served under,'' David Bartley,
House speaker during Mr. Sargent's tenure, once said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1974, though, with inflation rampant and Watergate
aftershocks affecting Republican candidates everywhere, Mr. Sargent
found himself on shaky footing. Michael S. Dukakis, White's 1970
running mate, unseated Mr. Sargent by 200,000 votes that autumn.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a personal rejection, Mr. Sargent concluded. It was
``the price of hamburg.'' So he segued into political punditry,
writing a syndicated column, doing analysis on television and
radio, and serving as a senior lecturer at the Joint Center for
Urban Studies of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Harvard University. But he had no desire to run for office again.
</P>
<P>
   Politics had been a grand adventure for Mr. Sargent, but he had
never meant for it to be his profession. After graduating from MIT
in 1939 (I.M. Pei was a classmate and friend), Mr. Sargent joined
the prestigious Boston architectural firm of Coolidge, Shepley,
Bulfinch and Abbott, then started his own firm of Sargent and
Sweeney in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   When World War II began, Mr. Sargent enlisted as an infantry
private, ended up commanding a rifle company with the 10th Mountain
Division in Italy and was awarded the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star
for heroism and the Combat Infantry Badge.
</P>
<P>
   Though he designed his rambling Dover house himself, Mr. Sargent
soon left the drafting board for the seashore, settling his family
on Cape Cod. He founded and ran a sporting goods store (the Goose
Hummock Shop) in Orleans, operated a charter fishing boat, and was
a guide for duck hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sargent was an ardent environmentalist before there was a
label for it. After he pounded on Governor Robert Bradford's desk
to demand something be done about overfishing, Bradford named Mr.
Sargent his director of marine fisheries. ``I told him, I'm awfully
busy with my store, but I'll start in,'' Mr. Sargent said. ``I had
no idea I'd take it for 10 years,''
</P>
<P>
   That set the hook in Mr. Sargent for politics. During the next
two decades he was the state's commissioner of natural resources,
director of fisheries and game, public works commissioner, and a
member of two federal commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sargent foresaw the ``rape of the Cape'' when most of Cape
Cod was still sand dunes and scrub pines, and he was the initial
crusader for what became the National Seashore.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Unless we move fast, private developers are going to move
in with their bulldozers, rip apart all this natural beauty, and
jam those areas with cottages,'' Mr. Sargent predicted. ``And there
will be `no trespassing' and `no picnicking' signs all over the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   After heart problems sent him to the hospital and a
rehabilitation center last spring, Mr. Sargent was largely
housebound. ``I'm 83,'' he shrugged. ``What the hell are you going
to do?''
</P>
<P>
   After the Boston Globe ran a feature on Mr. Sargent earlier this
month, he said he was flooded with cards, letters and calls from
well-wishers. ``From people I know and people I don't know and
people I never heard of,'' Mr. Sargent mused.
</P>
<P>
   He was flattered and amused when visitors still referred to him
as ``governor.'' ``Don't call me governor,'' Mr. Sargent cracked.
``I'm unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been two dozen years since Sarge had been in charge,
but the memory of his salty sibilance (``I have a rather raunchy
way of speaking.''), his infectious cackle, and his angular profile
endured. F.W. Sargent was the last working model of a vanished
make.

AFTER DAYS OF BARGAINING, A POLITIAL BOTTOM LINE EMERGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-RDP, MIDEAST-SCENE, MIDEAST-REACT, MIDEAST-CIA) 
(gm) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ When the Israelis finally claimed a
breakthrough Thursday night, it did not involve the concrete issues
of land and security, but rather matters of acute political
sensitivity _ the Palestinian charter and the seizure of
Palestinian suspects wanted by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On the Palestinian side, one issue still hanging fire in the
talks as day moved into night was an equally emotional one _ a
demand for the release of Palestinian prisoners being held in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians also demanded that Israel accept its
responsibility to complete a third withdrawal from the West Bank
before a final agreement is reached; that it call a ``time out'' in
settlement construction on the West Bank, and that the Palestinians
finally get their airport and safe passage between Gaza and the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Whether there was, in fact, a breakthrough would be known only
if there was an agreement, and James Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, went to considerable lengths Thursday night to say that
nothing had been fully resolved, and that much hard bargaining lay
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But the emergence of these issues as the last and largest
hurdles demonstrated the degree to which, in the end, success
depended on insuring that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, could return
home claiming that they had reaped real benefits and had not sold
out.
</P>
<P>
   That was what the conference was really all about. The fact that
Israel would have to cede 13 percent of the West Bank and that
Arafat would have to agree to security measures was a given from
the outset. The problem was to make it politically possible for the
leaders to agree.
</P>
<P>
   After 19 months of stalemate, during which each side demonized
the other, the two leaders could not simply move on as if nothing
had happened. Each needed the other to make amends; they needed a
major political symbol.
</P>
<P>
   For Netanyahu, the challenge was to convince his right-wing
constituency that he had firmly impressed on the Palestinians his
government's insistence on concrete evidence that the Palestinian
Authority was turning its people away from hatred and rejection of
Israel. A formal security agreement monitored by the CIA was not
enough, nor were promises by Arafat in English.
</P>
<P>
   What the Israelis needed was a loud and clear proclamation, made
not only before the West, but before the Palestinian people. For
Israeli conservatives, the major signals that Arafat was not
sincere were the fact that he had never completed purging the
Palestinian Charter of calls for Israel's destruction, and that he
continued to allow Palestinians wanted by Israel to wander free.
</P>
<P>
   Among many Israeli liberals, as among Americans and
Palestinians, the charter never loomed as a major issue. It was
perceived as a relic of a different, demagogic era. In April 1996
the Palestinian National Council adopted a resolution declaring
that offensive articles in the charter were void. But to
conservatives that was not enough: The resolution did not spell out
which articles were to be erased.
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, the minister of trade and industry and one of
Netanyahu's close allies, emerged as the leader on the issue of the
charter. Thursday night, as he prepared to board a plane to
Jerusalem for his daughter's bat mitzvah, he was happy.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had made a special effort to convince Clinton that
the demand to change the Charter was not a negotiating ploy, but a
fundamental requirement that the Palestinians demonstrate in the
most public way possible that they no longer regarded Israel as a
mortal foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fully accepted that this was not some juridical problem,
but an important social problem on which Arafat must pass the
message to the Palestinians,'' he said. ``I leave with optimism. I
only hope when I land in Jerusalem that my optimism will prove to
be founded.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Palestinian side, Arafat faced much the same need to
return to his people with some indication that the peace he signed
was bearing fruit. Another 13 percent in the West Bank was no major
achievement for people who believe 100 percent is rightfully
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   But releasing Palestinian prisoners, opening an airport, setting
up safe passage _ these were tangible benefits. And getting a
commitment from Netanyahu for a ``time out'' on settlements would
be universally viewed as a serious ideological concession.
</P>
<P>
   So after seven days and seven nights of posturing, senior
members of the two delegations sat down across from each other and
agreed to name the most difficult questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis zeroed in on the Charter and the terrorism suspects
still at large; the Palestinians established their bottom line, and
the real game got under way.

`BRIMSTONE': A GUY JUST BACK FROM HELL HAS ONE HECK OF A
CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(af) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For anyone who fears that heaven is out of reach, here is some
consoling news about the other place. It seems the gates of hell
aren't that heavily guarded, and escape is a distinct possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The strained concept of ``Brimstone'' is that 113 of hell's most
vile souls (some dead for centuries) have escaped and returned to
earth. The man Satan chooses to haul them back is Ezekiel Stone,
who landed in hell because he murdered the man who raped his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Stone also happened to be an ace New York City detective in the
1980s. Now he can redeem himself by bringing the evil dead back
home.
</P>
<P>
   This show is so high-concept that its many concepts collide.
Invulnerable to bullets, Stone is part detective, part Superman.
The show is partly ``The Fugitive'' and partly about time travel.
It's about good and evil and ``The Twilight Zone.'' But always, it
is dull.
</P>
<P>
   Taking Stone's name literally, Peter Horton plays him as
stony-faced. After 15 years in hell, you'd think he'd show a little
more enthusiasm about being alive. And the plots are lugubrious and
slow, even when they try to be lurid.
</P>
<P>
   The escapee who is the focus of this week's episode is a priest
who is kidnapping altar boys, not for sexual purposes but because
his insane reading of the Bible has convinced him that their deaths
will hasten the Second Coming. It's icky and boring at once. So is
an episode to be shown in two weeks, in which a young woman from
medieval days tries to have sex and incinerates her lovers every
time she touches them. (OK, so you can run from hell but you can't
hide.)
</P>
<P>
   Even John Glover, who seems ideal for the Devil's role, is
low-energy here. Maybe he's trying not to overact, but on this show
a little scenery-chewing, or any sign of life, would have been an
improvement. &QL;

   ``They're hot, they make people laugh,'' said Brandon Steiner, a
Manhattan sports marketer. ``The guys are unusual-looking. New
Yorkers think they live in the capital of unusual-type people. And
that's the nerve they tapped into.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wild, the campaign's copywriter for the Leagas Delaney
advertising agency, remembered the casting call. Any actors
unwilling to doff their shirts were eliminated from consideration.
``It was big, meaty and sweaty,'' Wild said. ``We probably saw 80
fleshy bodies. Mr. S is especially hairy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wild recalled the day last year when the five actors taped their
most famous spot, climbing over each other in the back seat of a
crowded taxicab to change their misconfigured human anagram from
A-N-S-K-Y to Y-A-N-K-S.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the hottest day of the year,'' Wild said. ``One thing
you don't hear is one guy saying, `Is that a puddle of sweat?' The
nice thing is they got along. Most people wouldn't want to touch
themselves the way they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Why ANSKY? Why not SANKY? Or SNAKY? NASKY?
</P>
<P>
   ``We mixed it up so the five of them would have the most
difficulty moving around,'' said Peter Nicholson, the campaign's
art director. ``And it was the funniest anagram, it made them do
the most twisting around in the cab.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials are the most visible element of a controversial
10-year, $95 million Adidas sponsorship that George Steinbrenner,
the principal owner of the Yankees, signed in 1997. The Yankees
disputed Major League Baseball's contention that the deal violated
its rules and sued all other teams in federal court. Eventually,
the suit was settled.
</P>
<P>
   The first advertising spots last season excluded using any
Yankees because of the litigation. But once it was settled, Adidas
drafted pitchers David Cone and Hideki Irabu. Irabu's spot ends
with skinny Mr. K being hung by his ANSKY mates beside a series of
strikeout K placards at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the K anymore,'' Mr. K complained,
pathetically.
</P>
<P>
   In Cone's spot, he is cautioned by Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching
coach, to rest his arm. The ANSKY's hold his cell phone, feed him,
sign his autographs and provide unspecified assistance in the men's
room.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials don't sell specifically shoes, apparel or
anything else Adidas manufactures. The campaign is a bonding
experience for the Yankee and Adidas names, one that may be more
lucrative, at least for the Yankees, than the neurotic link between
George Costanza and George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Cocciolo, the agency's creative director, added: ``It was
a recognition that there's a uniqueness to the Yankees, that
they're legendary. It's a shared acknowledgment of a partnership
and shared values.''
</P>
<P>
   The spots are so removed from selling products that they could
be mistaken for a pure Yankee campaign. But recognizing the spots'
appeal, Adidas is selling T-shirts with the key line from the ads:
``What the hell is ANSKY?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've even seen some bootleg copies being sold,'' said Travis
Gonzolez, an Adidas spokesman. ``Some national retailers are very
high on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign may have started in 1997, but it achieved its most
notice this season, as the Yankees rolled to their 24th World
Series title.
</P>
<P>
   Until the playoffs, Adidas paid to run the spots only in the New
York market. But the campaign was seen nationally since the
division series. A 30-second World Series spot on Fox cost about
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected a reaction, but not this much,'' Gonzolez said.
``When the Yankees played Cleveland, we got calls from Cleveland
fans wanting us to do this for the Indians. People are getting
jealous the Yankees have these fans.''
</P>
<P>
   During a visit by Messrs. Y, A, N, K and S to Yankee Stadium
last Saturday for Game 1 of the World Series, the shirtless
superfans were besieged by fully clothed fans seeking their
autographs (which they ink with their initials).
</P>
<P>
   ``We caused a riot,'' Gonzolez said. Once seated in the upper
deck, the ANSKY boys spied another shirtless group carrying a
stuffed Mr. K mannequin.
</P>
<P>
   They are expected to return in new commercials next season,
Gonzolez said, and may co-star with the other Yankees who wear
Adidas shoes, including Orlando Hernandez, Ricky Ledee, Shane
Spencer and Ramiro Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, maybe the Yankees will go shirtless. &QL;

 &HT;    Disaster chief pledges quick help for Texas
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Federal disaster chief James Lee Witt, pledging
to provide fast assistance to thousands of Texans whose lives and
homes have been left in shambles by record-setting floods, said
Thursday the devastation follows a pattern of increasing weather
brutality nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the flood events we get now are more serious than
they were a few years ago,'' said Witt, the director of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. ``Instead of a two-inch or a four-inch
rain, we get 20 inches ... Events like this are getting stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas to begin a two-day survey of flood-devastated areas in
20 counties, Witt said 1998 has been a record year for weather
disasters across the country.
</P>
<P>
   While 168 people died across the country last year in disasters,
more than 400 have perished this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The destruction this year has been unbelievable,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Witt and state disaster officials toured
flood-clobbered areas of New Braunfels and Comal County with local
officials as other FEMA officials raced to establish an assistance
network for victims. Among those on the tour was Comal County Judge
Carter Casteel _ whose own home was severely damaged, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Witt and Gov. George W. Bush are scheduled to tour
flooded areas in Victoria and Cuero.
</P>
<P>
   Witt said he wants to get aid programs up and running as quickly
as possible _ and hopes FEMA officials can cut checks or provide
other help to victims within 10 days of applying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure this goes smoothly ... that it goes
quickly,'' Witt said after a morning briefing with state disaster
relief officials in Austin. ``When you lose everything you've
worked for in your life, in just a few minutes, you are
devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Wednesday declared 20 counties federal
disaster areas, making them eligible for federal aid, and state
officials put preliminary damage estimates at $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, Bush had asked FEMA to add five Southeast Texas
counties _ Austin, Fort Bend, Harris, Montgomery and Waller _ to
the disaster zone, and other officials said at least five others
could be added before the flooding subsides.
</P>
<P>
   Such a designation makes victims eligible for federal assistance
_ such as money for temporary housing in motels and apartments,
Small Business Administration help, counseling services and
rebuilding assistance.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 state agencies worked with FEMA Thursday in the
recovery effort, said Jo Schweikhard Moss of the Texas Division of
Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Millwee, state emergency management coordinator, said the
floods have made 1998 a record year for disasters. The flood decree
is the fourth federal emergency, compared with three each in 1993
and 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 deaths reported so far compare with 27 people who died
during the 1994 floods that wracked Southeast Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a remarkable year,'' Millwee said, noting that
the emergency-operations center _ activated during significant
state disasters _ has been in use about 160 days so far this year,
first for wildfires beginning in June and later for tropical storms
Charlie and Frances that pummeled Del Rio and Houston.

 CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico: weapons charges.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Albanese and Patterson had their charges reduced from possession
of military weapons _ a .22 semiautomatic rifle, a 20-gauge bolt
action and a 12-gauge pump shotgun _ to a lesser charge and were
expecting to pay a bond and be released as early as Thursday night
and then return home to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Albanese and Patterson were in high spirits recently when they
returned from a hearing where they learned that the prosecutor's
attempt to reinstate the harsher charges against them had failed.
``It's almost over, I can't believe it,'' Patterson said. ``It's
like you fell into a big black hole and there's no way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel offered them one of his cigarettes, but his eyes clouded
when he heard their good news. ``I wish I was going home with you
guys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In El Paso, where Interstate 10 runs less than a quarter-mile
from the Rio Grande and a wrong exit can easily feed a driver onto
a border bridge, U.S. officials say they have been improving the
signs warning Americans about carrying firearms into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On the Mexican side of the bridge in Juarez, there are 10 lanes
for those with nothing to declare and two lanes for those who have
something to declare.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they come to us and declare that they have a firearm, we
will allow them to leave it with us and pick it up on their way out
of Mexico, no problem,'' said Rodriguez Cid, who added that no one
has ever done this. ``But if they go through one of the other lanes
and are pulled over and searched and we find firearms after that,
even if they volunteer them to us, we must consider that they have
intentionally not declared them and that they are being brought
illegally into Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The best idea, Rodriguez Cid said, is for Americans ``to leave
their weapons at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the man who was leading two vans of relatives to
California and now is awaiting trial on weapons charges, said he
wished he had done that.
</P>
<P>
   His wife died of breast cancer in July. The trip to California
in August was, in part, an attempt to break out of the grief from
that loss, he said. As he sat in a corner of the noisy prison yard,
his eyes misted and he talked about his 16-year-old daughter and
14-year-old son, now left without their mother and him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go through anything myself, but when I think about
those kids,'' he said, and then stopped and wiped his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who like the other Americans in the jail in Juarez said
he had been treated very well, recently started to work out and has
asked permission to run laps on a jogging track. He has to toughen
himself, he said, in case he ends up spending five years or more in
the prison.
</P>
<P>
   He took another deep breath and looked through the bars toward
the distant peaks of the Sierra de Juarez, leading back toward El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the people I was sorry,'' he said. ``What else can I
do?''

 &HT;    Flood death toll rises
 &HT;    By Kelly Daniel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sunshine returned to Central Texas on Thursday,
but the toll from this week's deadly flooding mounted as divers
located the bodies of five missing people and South Texas towns
braced for record water surges today.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll stood at 28 after searchers Thursday morning
recovered the bodies of four San Antonio residents and 7-year-old
Devon McCoy of Giddings, who was swept away in a vehicle in
Caldwell County. About 2,800 people _ 1,100 in Cuero alone _ stayed
in 34 shelters open across the region. Two Lockhart residents
remained missing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so sorry for everyone's loss,'' said Kathy McCoy, Devon's
mother, after her son's body was found.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush requested that five more counties be
declared disaster areas, bringing the total to 25, with more
requests for federal aid expected. James Lee Witt, director of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, toured New Braunfels and other
flooded areas Thursday and compared the damage to the Midwestern
floods of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, weather forecasters were watching a tropical
depression over the Gulf of Mexico and predicting more rain for the
early part of next week if the storm system does not shift. The
skies should remain clear and sunny through the weekend, however.
</P>
<P>
   Floodwaters were receding slowly, but 30 percent of Cuero
remained underwater, and authorities said 35 percent of Victoria
had been flooded. U.S. 183 south of Goliad was still under 6 feet
of water, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton officials continued evacuating residents as the town
prepared for the Colorado River to surge at a record 48.5 feet
early this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a strange animal since we're not having any rain,
the sun is shining and it's a beautiful day,'' said Wharton County
Judge Lawrence E. Naiser. ``We keep waiting and waiting and
waiting. This is torture.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay City, the last significant city before the Colorado rolls
into the Gulf of Mexico, should escape extensive flooding tonight
since the river is projected to crest at 41 feet _ 3 feet below
flood stage, said Bill McCann of the LCRA. It would still be at a
record level.
</P>
<P>
   The Guadalupe River was back in its banks in towns north of
Gonzales, though floodwaters were receding slowly, said Judy
Gardner of the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, divers found the the bodies of San Antonio
residents Donna O'Bar, 65; her son, Richard Hartman, 47; Jennifer
Allensworth, 20; and Allensworth's 2-month-old baby, Mallory
Hartman, inside a white Lincoln Town Car submerged in 10 feet of
water in muddy Salado Creek.
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Public Safety helicopter had noticed a gasoline
slick on the creek Wednesday, and divers found the car in a
follow-up check.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Hartman of Bryan, the infant's father and O'Bar's
grandson, fainted when the car was pulled from the creek. Relatives
said he was traveling in separate vehicle when the Lincoln
disappeared. The family was last seen Saturday night in suburban
Jourdanton as they left a wedding reception.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday morning, searchers recovered Devon's body at the
base of a construction dam at Brushy Creek, about a mile from where
he disappeared Saturday. The boy was swept away when the sport
utility vehicle his mother was driving washed into Brushy Creek,
about two miles from Niederwald.
</P>
<P>
   A ranch foreman spotted the boy's body and flagged down a nearby
Army National Guard helicopter and Caldwell County sheriff's
deputies, authorities said. Divers on Tuesday had retrieved the
body of a 10-year-old family friend also swept away with Devon.
</P>
<P>
   Still missing were Leandro Acevedo, 71, and his wife, Melva, 60,
who left their son's home in Galena Park near Houston about 11 p.m.
Saturday headed toward Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Red Cross and Salvation Army began handing out
supplies Thursday as volunteers arrived from counties across
Central Texas to assist flood victims in their long trek back to
normalcy. As many as 14,000 people have evacuated their homes since
the floods began over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe this all happened only last Saturday,''
said New Braunfels retiree R.J. Thorson, 76, standing near his
ruined home. ``It seems like an eternity.'' Southeast Austin
residents gathered donations of clothes, towels, linens and other
household items for 19 families whose homes were washed away by a
bloated Williamson Creek. In San Marcos, officials distributed more
than 300 kits, including brooms, mops, shovels and wet-vacuums, to
help people remove debris from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Damage estimates continued to trickle in, but exact numbers were
not yet available. Statewide, the tally has been estimated at $400
million.
</P>
<P>
   With so many agencies working overtime, and with so many
disasters striking the state in succession, officials began to
worry about the impact on the state budget. ``It's been one thing
after another this year,'' said Joe Allbaugh, Bush's executive
assistant and top aide.
</P>
<P>
   So far, officials said, $8.3 million of the $12.8 million in the
state disaster relief fund has been spent on hurricanes, earlier
flooding and wildfires _ most for the National Guard and Texas
Forest Service. The fund still contains $4.5 million, a Bush
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Other developments Thursday included:
</P>
<P>
   -More than 430 National Guard troops remained deployed, mostly
in the hardest-hit areas from Seguin south to Wharton, Victoria and
Cuero, with eight helicopters and 179 pieces of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   -Police had arrested 12 people in Guadalupe County and three
people in Comal County for looting. A 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew
remained in effect for flood-damaged areas in New Braunfels.
</P>
<P>
   -The Barton Springs/Edwards Aquifer Conservation District
canceled its drought alert. The agency also said the heavy rains
may be enough to carry well users through winter, a time of
typically low water levels.
</P>
<P>
   American-Statesman staff writers Kim Sue Lia Perkes, Rebeca
Rodriguez, Angela Shah, Jason Spencer and Mike Ward contributed to
this report.

 &HT;    Yankees pause `to enjoy moment'
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Yankees season was so unbelievable that it brought
the usually stoic George Steinbrenner to tears.
</P>
<P>
   The Boss wept.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly, you can say it now, one of the greatest teams
in baseball,'' the emotional Yankees owner said after his team
defeated San Diego 3-0 Wednesday night to sweep the World Series.
``We really worked for this. This is as good a team as ever played.
You can't say the best, because how do you really know?''
</P>
<P>
   Now Steinbrenner and the Yankees face the task of keeping
together a young team that has the potential to win 125 games again
and its third World Series title in four years.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star center fielder Bernie Williams and Series MVP Scott
Brosius are free agents. New York has to make a decision on a $2.5
million option for outfielder Darryl Strawberry, who is recovering
from colon cancer surgery. Tim Raines is a free agent. And starter
David Cone has a clause in his contract that gives him the option
of accepting or rejecting a $5.5 million salary for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about that right now,'' Williams said. ``I'd
be a fool not to enjoy this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees don't act as if Williams will be back. They have
offered a deal worth $8.25 million a season, but the feeling is he
will command more than $10 million a year. Arizona has that kind of
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is there is only so much money we can play
with,'' general manager Brian Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have plenty of young talent in the organization,
including Mike Lowell, who is considered one of the top third-base
prospects in baseball. Rookie left fielder Ricky Ledee had a great
postseason and could replace Williams in center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will celebrate for the final time today,
participating in a parade through 14 blocks of Manhattan called the
``Canyon of Heroes.'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will give the players
a key to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deserve to be compared with the best ever,'' first baseman
Tino Martinez said. ``We were like the Chicago Bulls.''
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Chili Davis said, ``We had high expectations.
Our owners had high expectations. Our fans had high expectations.
We had nothing to do but fail, and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been astounding,'' Steinbrenner said. ``That's the
best way to describe it. They just come through day after day. You
don't believe that it will happen. You don't believe they can do it
again, and they do. It's unbelievable.

 &HT;    Bush mulls political future; Mauro camp previews TV ads
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush said Thursday he is probably
on an up-or-out path that will lead either to a presidential race
in 2000 or an end to his career as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Between campaign stops in Temple and Corpus Christi, Bush said
he doesn't think he would be interested in a third term as
governor, or any elected office other than president, if he wins
re-election Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suspect, and I would guess, barring unforeseen
circumstances, that this would be my last term,'' said Bush, who,
according to polls, is headed for a lopsided win over Democrat
Garry Mauro. ``But I don't know for certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a race for the U.S. Senate holds no interest for him.
On yet another day when he spent considerable time talking to
reporters and supporters about a potential presidential bid, Bush
said he will make up his mind on that race early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Bush is trying to become the first Texas governor
elected to consecutive four-year terms, though he is not
guaranteeing he would serve another four years if re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I sit here right now,'' Bush said as he flew to South
Texas, ``I think two terms would probably be plenty. I don't want
to rule out anything for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked point-blank if the only other campaign he might mount
after this year would be for president, Bush said, ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, returning from San Benito to Austin, Bush said
he has not thought about what he might do if he skips the
presidential race and does not seek a third term in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never looked really far down the road in life. I've
always been a spontaneous person,'' he said, adding, ``I'm not
concerned about my future. I'm concerned about my immediate future,
which is getting re-elected governor of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   And on a day when he indicated he could be involved in his final
campaign as a candidate, Bush worked hard at stops in Temple,
Corpus Christi and San Benito to make sure his huge lead in the
polls does not backfire into voter complacency.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Billy Rogers, Mauro's campaign manager, said Hillary
Clinton has been asked to come to El Paso to be the featured
speaker at an Oct. 31 rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the first lady comes to Texas obviously it would energize
our base,'' said Rogers, adding that Mauro is ``hopeful'' that Ms.
Clinton will be able to attend. Mauro's campaign on Thursday also
previewed five, 30-second television ads airing around the state
beginning Friday. The ads will appear in Austin over the weekend
and in Dallas and Houston next week.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro introduces himself in each ad , makes clear he's running
for governor and highlights his positions _ and criticizes Bush's _
on Indian casino gambling, HMO regulation, education reform and
teacher pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running for governor because I can't find anyone who can
name one thing that George Bush has done to help Texas families,''
Mauro says in one of the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said recent voter opinion polls,
putting Bush well ahead of Mauro, show Texans believe Bush has a
good record and good plans for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has upheld the laws of Texas, proposed an
additional $3.6 billion for education, including money for
teachers' salary, and signed the toughest patient protection laws
in the country,'' Tucker said. ``Is Garry Mauro opposed to these
things?''

 &HT;    Weinke proving he's a big-leaguer
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sept. 12, 1998 _ a date which will live in infamy for
Chris Weinke, the starting quarterback at Florida State. A date
when Weinke thought that maybe riding the buses in the minor
leagues really wasn't so bad.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke is the 26-year-old sophomore who gave up pro baseball to
take another shot at college football. When he threw six
interceptions in a 24-7 loss at N.C. State, a lot of Seminole fans
questioned the wisdom of that decision. They also questioned the
judgment of coach Bobby Bowden, who entrusted one of college
football's most successful franchises to a guy who hadn't played
any significant minutes in a football game since George Bush was
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were wondering what was going on,'' Weinke
said. ``And I was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the reasons that Bowden has won 287 games is patience
in the face of adversity. Let's hang with Weinke, he told his
staff. Let's see if he comes around.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden's patience has been rewarded. Since the nightmare at N.C.
State, Weinke has gone five games and 149 passing attempts without
an interception. He comes into Saturday night's nationally
televised showdown with Georgia Tech (7 p.m., ESPN) with two
consecutive games with 300 or more passing yards. In wins over
Miami (26-14) and Clemson (48-0), Weinke completed 35 of 67 passes
(52.2 percent) for 618 yards and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you want is a guy who learns from his mistakes,'' Bowden
said. ``He's continually improving. That's all you can ask of
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Weinke, the Florida State coaching staff must
take some responsibility for the debacle at N.C. State. Emboldened
by his performance in the opener against Texas A&AMP;M _ 21 of 36, 207
yards _ they used an off week to add considerably more to Weinke's
playbook for the trip to Raleigh. The extra load confused Weinke
and made him tentative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it was frustrating,'' said Weinke, a native of St. Paul,
Minn. ``I knew what we wanted to do offensively, but I couldn't
make myself slow down. It seemed like I was always in a hurry to
make the throw instead of just waiting and executing the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   After N.C. State, the watchword for Weinke became simplicity.
The offense was scaled back to give him a better chance to succeed.
He wasn't asked to make as many complicated reads or as many
difficult decisions. The emphasis was shifted to better execution
of fewer plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't eliminate everything, but we started running the
ball better to open up the passing game,'' Weinke said. ``I just
knew that the main thing I needed to do was get better. I just
needed to slow down my motor and quit rushing my throws. I needed
to take what the defense was giving me and not try to hit the big
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked, as Weinke began to eliminate the mistakes.
Still, Weinke said he wasn't completely satisfied with his play
until Florida State traveled to Miami on Oct. 10. Weinke completed
17 passes for 316 yards and a pair of touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time I thought we went out and did exactly
what we wanted to do,'' Weinke said. ``It felt really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week against Clemson it got even better, as Weinke threw
for 302 yards and four touchdowns to four different receivers. The
scoring throws covered 40, 48, 12 and 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we feel like we're clicking,'' Weinke said. ``We're
not where we want to be just yet, but we're getting closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden gives the credit to Weinke for not losing faith when all
those around him _ the head coach included _ began to doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he had six interceptions against N.C. State, he never
lost his composure,'' Bowden said. ``He never let on to us that he
was not confident. Weinke, evidently, was challenged by those
interceptions and is determined not to let that happen again.

 &HT;    Tech's 5-game run driven by 5 factors
 &HT;    WITH FBC-FSU-WEINKE
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Georgia Tech got smacked in the face by Boston
College 41-31 to open the season six weeks ago, the Yellow Jacket
defense was embarrassed, Tech fans were irate, and prospects for
the rest of the 1998 season looked bleak.
</P>
<P>
   But something happened in the next five games. Tech won all of
them and is undefeated in the ACC with a chance at the title, as
Florida State arrives for a Saturday night showdown on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Five elements stand out as reasons for the turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   First is the emergence of Dez White. Second is the play of
Tech's special teams. Third, the Yellow Jackets have been able to
offset some defensive problems by scoring with turnovers. Fourth is
Tech's pass rush, which didn't exist against Boston College but
made the difference in the waning moments of the Virginia win.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding element in each of those four factors is Tech's
confidence. How else to explain erasing Virginia's 21-point lead
Saturday? How else does Tech rebound from one of its most
disappointing starts into one of its best stretches ever?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a closer look at the five:
</P>
<P>
   Dez White. Tech came into the season with doubts at receiver
because of the loss of Harvey Middleton and Derrick Steagall and
injuries to Mike Sheridan (knee) and Jon Muyres (foot). White has
done more than answer the call; he's elbowing such players as Peter
Warrick and Torry Holt for a share of the ACC spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   White started out tentative against Boston College, with a
couple drops on his way to a five-catch, 74-yard, no-touchdown day.
But at North Carolina, he repeatedly frustrated two-time
All-American cornerback Dre Bly and beat him twice for touchdowns
of 56 and 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   He's had at least one touchdown in every game since Boston
College and three games of 100 yards receiving or more. He burned
Virginia for 243 yards and three touchdowns, two in the last 8:13.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams. The Yellow Jackets have had some blunders,
including Rodney Williams' attempt to score at North Carolina on a
failed field goal and giving up a fumble return for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Brad Chambers, who missed a 34-yard field goal and barely
made a 23-yarder against Boston College, booted a career-long
47-yard field goal in the fourth quarter against Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Also against the Cavaliers, Charlie Rogers returned a punt 54
yards for a touchdown. Williams kept Tech in good field position
with three of five punts of 50 or more yards and four of eight
kickoffs into the end zone. On the other four kickoffs, Tech's
coverage limited Virginia to an average field position of the 18.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's special teams first made a difference against N.C. State,
taking a safety on a punt snap out of the end zone and then getting
a punt block from Travares Tillman that Jason Bostic returned for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive scoring. Tech has forced a quarterback fumble and
returned it for a score five games in a row now, which is an NCAA
record.
</P>
<P>
   Offenses are unable to concentrate on one or two Tech defenders.
Delaunta Cameron and Nate Stimson are repeat performers, but five
others also have contributed to the turnovers _ Jesse Tarplin,
Roderrick Roberts, Matt Uremovich, Felipe Clay and Bostic.
</P>
<P>
   Pass rush. Boston College quarterback Scott Mutryn wasn't
bothered by Tech, but N.C. State's Jamie Barnette, Virginia's Aaron
Brooks and Duke's Spencer Romine can't say the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets are blitzing and rotating a number of players
up front to keep the linemen fresh. After zero sacks against Boston
College and one against New Mexico State, Tech got three against
North Carolina and five in each of its last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Tarplin called the Boston College game the worst of his career.
Since then, the defensive end has piled up seven sacks, two more
than he had all last season.
</P>
<P>
   Stimson, moved from tackle in the Boston College game to end,
proved in the Virgina game that he's a force from the outside. He
pressured Brooks on two critical plays _ one to force the fumble
that Cameron returned for a touchdown, the other on Virginia's last
play from scrimmage when Brooks drew an intentional grounding
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence. The Jackets admit they had too much, or the wrong
kind, against BC. Since then, they've used confidence to their
advantage, going into North Carolina for their first win since 1945
and winning two of Tech's ``Big Three'' conference games, against
N.C. State and Virginia, with one left to go.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence is what Tech hasn't had against Florida State since
the crushing loss in 1992. It's what could make all the difference
on Saturday.

 &HT;    DeBerg has a number of connections on Jets
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The New York media are having a blast with the
possibility 44-year-old Falcons quarterback Steve DeBerg might
start against the Jets on Sunday, and not just because he would
become the oldest player to start an NFL game.
</P>
<P>
   A few Jets, including QB Vinny Testaverde, have beenteammates of
DeBerg. In fact, DeBerg and Testaverde still live near each other
in Tampa Bay, where they played together in 1987 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   They even worked out together last spring.
</P>
<P>
   But DeBerg made it more fun Wednesday, when he was on a
conference call with New York reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the media was going to ask about the possibility of him
starting instead of injured Chris Chandler, DeBerg began by saying,
``I hope you guys got the announcement that I retired this morning.
This is not part of my deal. Mop-up duty was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Jets H-back Keith Byars, a teammate of DeBerg in Miami in 1993,
said, ``(DeBerg) is always the life of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembered DeBerg showing up at practice wearing an old
leather helmet and black high-tops, like Johnny Unitas used to
wear. It only seems as if DeBerg has played that long.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly one of the best coaches I've seen in the game _
even when he wasn't coaching,'' Testaverde said. ``He showed me
quite a few different things this year that I really worked on, and
I'm continuing to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacillating Vinny
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde has had an up-and-down career, but he's on a definite
upswing. He's 3-0 as a starter and is the No. 2-ranked passer in
the NFL (108.8).
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jets coach Bill Parcells also likes backup Glenn Foley.
For proof, consider that Foley started three games, and when he was
injured, the job remained his even though Testaverde won two games
in his absence. The job became Testaverde's, however, after a 30-10
loss at St. Louis on Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one works harder than (Testaverde),'' Parcells said. ``He's
very diligent. If (quarterbacks coach, and former Falcon head coach
Dan Henning) says something to him, this guy makes sure every word
is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He manages a game well, and he has more experience, so he does
less dumb things. But Foley has some characteristics that are
admirable. He's not afraid to pull the trigger on some things. It's
a tradeoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the Jets
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are coming off their most physical game of the
season, and the Jets will play them the same way. They also make an
opponent adjust a lot. On offense, they are not shy about running
in passing situations, trying to take advantage because a defense
has more cornerbacks on the field.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, cornerbacks Aaron Glenn and Otis Smith are very
physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do a great job of scheming you ... and Glenn and Smith
play all over the field, and play a lot of bump and run,'' Atlanta
coach Dan Reeves said. ``They'll come in with a lot of different
blitzes. Sometimes, they'll have one defensive lineman and five
defensive backs and a few linebackers.''
</P>
<P>
   Police chase
</P>
<P>
   Suwanee police took off in their cars from Falcons practice
Thursday after a man set up a tripod with a high-powered lens on
his camera. They did not catch him. The man was in a gas station
parking lot at the southeast corner of the practice facility. He
got in a pickup truck when approached by off-duty officers employed
by the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons on Sunday return to Giants Stadium for the second
time in three weeks, but Reeves said there will be a big difference
between this game and the Oct. 11 game in which Atlanta beat the
Giants 34-20. It's a day game rather than night game, and, ``The
Jets crowd is totally different,'' he said. ``They're much more
rowdy than Giants fans.'' ... Former University of Georgia player
Jason Ferguson is starting at DT for New York, and former Murphy
High and University of Georgia standout Mo Lewis, a LB, has started
all 111 games in his eight-year career. ... Jets TE Fred Baxter
(knee) is out, and LB Chad Cascadden has been downgraded from
questionable to doubtful. Parcells said Cascadden will not play. DB
Chris Hayes (leg) remains questionable.

 &HT;    Steelers-Chiefs a pivotal matchup for both teams
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Six years after he sold his house in suburban Kansas
City and took a considerable loss in the transaction, Bill Cowher
still regrets he didn't just rent out the place.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh coach at least could have avoided hotels during
the Steelers' near-annual visits to a place where Cowher served as
defensive coordinator for Marty Schottenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you leave (a city), even after you've been there a
while, and you forget the street names and stuff like that,''
Cowher said. ``But when it comes to Kansas City, the league
apparently likes to make sure that doesn't happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggling Steelers face the cheerless Chiefs on Monday
night, and it represents the fourth matchup since '92 of Cowher and
his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   All four games have been played at Arrowhead Stadium, three on
Monday Night Football, and the Schottenheimer-Cowher series stands
at two victories apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Although the game probably won't be aesthetic, given the
offensive shortcomings of the two clubs, the coaching matchup and
the intensity of recent Steelers-Chiefs bloodlettings make it the
marquee game on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``And both of us desperately need a win,'' Chiefs quarterback
Elvis Grbac emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   A preseason pick by many people to represent the AFC in Super
Bowl XXXIII, the Chiefs already trail division rival Denver by two
games. Pittsburgh is a game behind Jacksonville in the AFC Central
and is counting on the Broncos to top the Jaguars on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The other ``bests'' for Week 8 of the league schedule:
</P>
<P>
   Upset opportunity: By late Sunday, fans might recall the day's
events as ``(Under) Dog Day Afternoon''' so numerous are the upset
possibilities. A trifecta of New England over Miami, Cincinnati
over Oakland and Denver over Minnesota is inviting. The best bet
might be the Lions, smoked 29-6 by the Vikings five weeks ago in
Charlie Batch's debut but playing much better now that the rookie
quarterback has reduced his turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Individual matchup: There will be plenty of collisions between
Lions tailback Barry Sanders and underrated Minnesota middle
'backer Ed McDaniel. Even more compelling is the battle between
Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan and Jets wide receiver Keyshawn
Johnson, who finally is playing to his potential. Buchanan will
give away six inches in height but nothing in the verbal jousting.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy play: Even if John Friesz replaces ailing Seattle
starter Warren Moon (broken rib), big-play wideout Joey Galloway
will torch a San Diego secondary forced to play the rest of the
season without injured cornerback Dwayne Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Grudge match: The Jaguars' loss at Buffalo stole some of the
luster from the Jacksonville-Denver contest. No matter, though,
because none of the acrimony has subsided. The Jaguars derailed
Denver's Super Bowl express two years ago. The Broncos countered by
trampling Jacksonville with 300-plus rushing yards in a playoff win
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Division game: New England is neither as good as it looked two
weeks ago in smashing the Chiefs nor as bad as it appeared in
Monday's loss to the Jets. The Patriots have possess more offensive
playmakers, however, than the Dolphins, however. That should be
enough to run their mastery over Jimmy Johnson to four wins in a
row.

 &HT;    Austin one of 10 sites in national anti-terrorism plan
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When a religious cult in Japan released a highly
toxic chemical in the Tokyo subway tunnels in 1995, more than three
hours passed before officials, taken completely by surprise,
identified the toxin as sarin gas.
</P>
<P>
   The delay added to the confusion, as emergency workers struggled
to treat hundreds of subway riders suffering from exposure to the
gas, which killed 12 and injured a thousand more.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to prevent similar chaos in case chemical or biological
weapons are unleashed on American soil, Congress this month
authorized two programs that will make the nation better able to
deal with terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Central Texas will play a key role in the government's efforts
as a site for the programs _ one that will create a National Guard
special response team and another that will provide training for
local police and fire departments.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard response team, called a Rapid Assessment and
Initial Detection or RAID team, will be one of 10 strategically
placed across the country. Austin was chosen for its relatively
central location. The teams,each made up of 22 specially trained
Guard members, will be in place by the fall of 2000 and would help
local police, fire and EMS officials respond to acts of terrorism,
said Charles Cragin,cq the senior Defense Department official
responsible for policy oversight in the military reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is a wide-open society _ this is the way we have built
our nation,'' said Cragin, who was in Austin on Thursday to speak
on a separate topic at a conference of the Defense Advisory
Committee on Women in the Service. ``Because of this, we are very
vulnerable to attacks at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Cragin quoted Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who called
biological and chemical weapons the ``poor man's atomic bomb''
because they are easy to acquire and transport, and are
catastrophically lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Cragin said there have already been attempts to use chemical
agents in the United States. He points to the World Trade Center
bombing in New York in 1993, where terrorists had planned to leak a
chemical agent through an explosion, but had improperly constructed
their bomb, so it incinerated the chemical when it exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't do a very good job with their plan, but if they
had, can you image the scope of the catastrophe?'' he said. ``We
also have serious domestic threats. What if the next Unabomber uses
biological weapons?''
</P>
<P>
   The RAID team, Cragin said, would have the expertise to help
local authorities quickly identify and contain a chemical or
biological agent as well as provide additional manpower to help
treat victims. In cases of biological weapons, often there is an
incubation period, as with the deadly bacterial agent anthrax. The
RAID team would help confine a spread, Cragin said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Defense Department team in Austin, Central
Texas will also be home to a federally sponsored program for
training up to 1 million police, fire and emergency medical
personnel to deal with chemical and biological attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Money for the training program was part of the massive federal
spending bill approved this week by Congress. Under the bill, Texas
A&AMP;M University will receive $3 million in the coming year to
establish the training program in conjunction with Louisiana State
University, New Mexico State University and the Nevada
nuclear-weapons test site. Each participant will receive $2 million
for training and facilities, plus $1 million each for equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is taking a leading role in preparing America's
emergency response to acts of terrorism,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas, who worked to secure the money for Texas A&AMP;M
from the 1999 budget for the U.S. Justice Department. ``We are
forming the basis of a unified, national strategy to respond to
terroristic acts _ and sending a message to those with evil intent
that we mean business.''

 &HT;    Gramm vs. the CRA: How Texas senator Texas killed banking bill
 &HT;    By Christi Harlan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Congress appeared poised this year to dismantle
a Depression-era law that has prohibited consumers from one-stop
shopping for banking, insurance, stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, with his objection to a tiny piece
of the overhaul, stalled a reform that had been 20 years in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   His beef: the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 federal law
that requires banks and savings and loan associations to record the
gender, race and income of loan applicants and report each year
whether those applicants received loans.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said the law has been turned into an extortion device by
groups representing consumers and minorities. These ``professional
protest groups,'' Gramm charged, use the publicly available data
about lending practices to pressure banks and S&AMP;Ls to set quotas
for lending and hiring and to financially support the protesting
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Community Reinvestment Act, designed to ensure that banks
were making loans in communities where they receive deposits, ``has
become a rich source for extortion and kickbacks,'' Gramm said in
an interview last week. Asked why banks don't complain, he said
that ``the merchants being shaken down by the Mafia don't complain
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's objection, shared by a few other senators, stopped the
legislation from coming to a vote in the Senate. Even if the bill
had passed, presidential advisers had enough doubts about the bill
that a veto from President Clinton was considered a good
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gramm played a big enough role in stopping the
financial-services overhaul that he was blamed by some for killing
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came closer to passing comprehensive financial services
reform in the 105th Congress than we have in a generation,'' said
Dean Sackett, a vice president of the National Association of
Professional Insurance Agents, a proponent of the bill.
``Unfortunately, turf battles within the Clinton administration,
the looming threat of a presidential veto, opposition by key
senators to Community Reinvestment Act requirements and the narrow
interests of a small minority prevailed over the interests of the
country at large and those affected by the legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's willingness to scuttle the overhaul of financial
services because it could expand the Community Reinvestment Act
beyond banks was the most recent example of his lack of compunction
about delaying or even killing widely supported bills that contain
items he opposes. Earlier this year, for example, he delayed for
weeks an agriculture-research bill because he objected to a
provision that restored food stamps to legal immigrants, including
children, whose aid had been cut off under the 1996 welfare
reforms. The agriculture bill eventually passed, unlike the
financial-services bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's willingness to do in the banking bill also gives a hint
of what might be in store if Sen. Al D'Amato, R-N.Y., loses his
re-election bid Nov. 3 and Gramm succeeds him as chairman of the
powerful Senate Banking Committee, which oversees banks as well as
securities and federal housing policy. Earlier this week, the trade
groups for banks, insurance companies and securities firms that had
backed the bill conceded defeat in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   They also pledged to work together for passage next year. The
ease with which Gramm blocked the bill, known as H.R. 10, also
illustrates continued uncertainty in Congress about undoing the
Glass-Steagall Act, written in the Depression to prevent the
concentration of banking, insurance and securities in mammoth firms
whose failures could wreak untold havoc.
</P>
<P>
   After many failed attempts at rewrites, Congress thought it got
it right this year, but H.R. 10 squeaked out of the House in May by
only one vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needed some more fixes to be a really good bill,'' said
Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston, a former investment banker and a
member of the House Banking Committee. Bentsen voted against H.R.
10, saying he was concerned about the assignment of regulators for
the new multipurpose entities that the bill would create. He also
said he thought the bill shortchanged small banks.
</P>
<P>
   Similar concerns by others kept the bill on hold in the Senate
until September, when D'Amato finally brought it before the Banking
Committee. It emerged from committee in mid-September and was
headed for a full Senate vote with the blessing of the banking,
insurance and securities industries, all of whom overcame historic
rivalries to back the Senate's version of H.R. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gramm took to the Senate floor Sept. 30 and declared: ``I
intend to do everything in my power to impede this bill . . . to
use all of the rules of the Senate, no matter how long it takes, no
matter how difficult it may be.''
</P>
<P>
   He laid out his concerns that the bill expanded the Community
Reinvestment Act and ``literally set up the vehicle for billions of
dollars to be extorted from financial institutions in America by
people who are professional protesters.'' In an interview, Gramm
said he was thinking of groups such as ACORN, the Association of
Community Organizations for Reform Now, a consumer group that often
stages protests of businesses it considers unfriendly to the
elderly and poor.
</P>
<P>
   On hearing Gramm's charges, ACORN policy analyst Patrick Woodall
in Washington, said, ``We must be the worst extortionists and
kidnappers in America.'' The group filed objections with the
Federal Reserve to three of the five big bank mergers this year;
not one was disallowed, Woodall noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that community groups have an incredibly
difficult time with lenders who are in theory the lifeblood of the
community,'' Woodall said. ``We do end up exerting pressure because
that's what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   ACORN and other groups also seek and receive financial support
from banks _ a practice Gramm said he would have moved to outlaw if
the bill had come to a vote. Woodall said the financial support
helps ACORN screen loan applicants for the banks; Gramm called the
practice extortion. Banks themselves said they have noticed ``some
heavy-handed tactics'' by groups wielding lending records under
CRA, but the banks have learned to deal with both the pressure and
the paper work that the law creates, according to Pattie Cinelli,
spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association. The association
supported H.R. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Was the bill worth killing over CRA? ``Not for the American
Bankers Association members,'' she said.

 CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico: weapons charges.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Albanese and Patterson had their charges reduced from possession
of military weapons _ a .22 semiautomatic rifle, a 20-gauge bolt
action and a 12-gauge pump shotgun _ to a lesser charge and were
expecting to pay a bond and be released as early as Thursday night
and then return home to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Albanese and Patterson were in high spirits recently when they
returned from a hearing where they learned that the prosecutor's
attempt to reinstate the harsher charges against them had failed.
``It's almost over, I can't believe it,'' Patterson said. ``It's
like you fell into a big black hole and there's no way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel offered them one of his cigarettes, but his eyes clouded
when he heard their good news. ``I wish I was going home with you
guys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In El Paso, where Interstate 10 runs less than a quarter-mile
from the Rio Grande and a wrong exit can easily feed a driver onto
a border bridge, U.S. officials say they have been improving the
signs warning Americans about carrying firearms into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On the Mexican side of the bridge in Juarez, there are 10 lanes
for those with nothing to declare and two lanes for those who have
something to declare.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they come to us and declare that they have a firearm, we
will allow them to leave it with us and pick it up on their way out
of Mexico, no problem,'' said Rodriguez Cid, who added that no one
has ever done this. ``But if they go through one of the other lanes
and are pulled over and searched and we find firearms after that,
even if they volunteer them to us, we must consider that they have
intentionally not declared them and that they are being brought
illegally into Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The best idea, Rodriguez Cid said, is for Americans ``to leave
their weapons at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the man who was leading two vans of relatives to
California and now is awaiting trial on weapons charges, said he
wished he had done that.
</P>
<P>
   His wife died of breast cancer in July. The trip to California
in August was, in part, an attempt to break out of the grief from
that loss, he said. As he sat in a corner of the noisy prison yard,
his eyes misted and he talked about his 16-year-old daughter and
14-year-old son, now left without their mother and him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go through anything myself, but when I think about
those kids,'' he said, and then stopped and wiped his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who like the other Americans in the jail in Juarez said
he had been treated very well, recently started to work out and has
asked permission to run laps on a jogging track. He has to toughen
himself, he said, in case he ends up spending five years or more in
the prison.
</P>
<P>
   He took another deep breath and looked through the bars toward
the distant peaks of the Sierra de Juarez, leading back toward El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the people I was sorry,'' he said. ``What else can I
do?''

YANKEES RETURN HOME, WANTING STRAWBERRY IN PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Darryl Strawberry was watching the Yankees celebrate
their World Series title on Wednesday night when the telephone rang
and he was verbally transported from Fort Lee, N.J. to San Diego.
It was Derek Jeter and some of Strawberry's closest friends on the
line. About 24 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a different teammate squealed into the phone, every
time the Yankees chanted ``Darryl, Darryl,'' and every time someone
mentioned his name during a television interview, Strawberry was
pulled closer to a scene that he missed because of colon-cancer
surgery three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the world to me being part of what this team was all
about this season,'' said Strawberry. ``In the playoffs, I got
sick. But I felt good about what we accomplished. I feel good about
my whole situation. Being healthy and watching them win last night
was one of the greatest moments of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was answering the phone and feeling lively because he
is eating three meals of solid food per day and because he is about
to receive his third World Series ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks wanted Strawberry to participate in Friday's
ticker-tape parade or at least meet up with them afterward at city
hall, scenes which would have rivaled an airplane hangar for the
amount of noise yielded. But Strawberry, 36, conceded he is still
weak and at first thought he would not be be in Manhattan Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, from a physical standpoint, it could be too
much for my body,'' he said earlier. ``I've told them that.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently he changed his mind later in the day. Colleen Roche,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's press secretary, said Thursday night that
Darryl Strawberry might be present at Friday's parade or at city
hall ceremony. ``We're very hopeful, and the possibility looks
good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre called Strawberry a few hours before Game 4 on
Wednesday and asked him what he was doing. So Strawberry replied,
``I'm about to take a nap so I can stay up and watch us win.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre laughed at Strawberry's confidence, but all of the Yankees
were supremely confident. After sweeping the Padres in four games
and finishing with 125 victories, the Yankees can argue that they
are the best team in major league history. Strawberry, who also was
on the 1996 Yankees and the 1986 Mets, cast his vote for these
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to say we were the greatest team ever,'' said
Strawberry. ``I heard all the comparisons and I don't know about
the older teams, but in the last 10, 20 or 30 years no one has won
125 games. It's not easy to win 100. This team cannot be
overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   With Strawberry's number 39 embroidered on their caps and
thoughts of him in their minds, the Yankees never forgot about him
during the post-season. Moments after their clubhouse celebration
began, David Wells gathered the Yankees together and they hoisted
bottles of Champagne in a toast to Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's name was chanted more frequently than Scott
Brosius, who was the Most Valuable Player of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for Darryl,'' said Wells. ``We dedicated it to him.
It's too bad that he can't be here, but he's in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis added, ``Darryl Strawberry will always be a part of
this ballclub. I hope next year he's a part of this ballclub. I
love Darryl Strawberry. Not just because he's a ball player. He's a
great guy. He's like my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry claimed that he came close, but did not cry as he
watched the Yankees rejoice on television, but indicated that his
wife, Charisse, used enough tissues for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed the doctor's orders and tried not to get too
emotional about it,'' said Strawberry. ``My heart and soul was with
that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry will return to his permanent home in Rancho Mirage,
Calif. next week to begin six months of chemotherapy treatment
because the cancer spread to one of 36 lymph nodes that were
removed from his abdomen in surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said he also needs to be in warmer weather for the
walks that are part of his recuperation. The fight on the field is
over for the Yankees, but the fight off the field is still in
progress for Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all set to go,'' said Strawberry. ``I'm looking forward to
getting completely healthy again and then getting back out there in
the middle of another championship next season.''

COMMENTARY: A STADIUM IMPERFECT IN ITS GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dl) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A season that began with an inauspicious West Coast crash and a
scary South Bronx collapse played out in seamless, spectacular
style. After stumbling out of the gate, the Yankees won 125 games.
After being closed for repairs, Yankee Stadium held up to a record
number of fans. More than ever, team and stadium stand tall and
imperfectly proud.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks-as-champs was a conclusion befitting a season of
repentance, a season when the muscular new home run champ
practically bragged of unburdening himself in psychotherapy, a
season when even George Steinbrenner cried as he celebrated the
ultra-achievement of his special and most human team.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees in many ways were the reflection of their blemished
owner, battle-worn manager and Bronx-scarred ball park. Almost to a
man, they were never afraid to admit to their warts and how much
they needed each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You waiting for me?'' Chuck Knoblauch snapped as he stepped
through the news media after his mental lapse lost Game 2 of the
Cleveland series. Yes, we had been waiting for him to pick up the
ball, and now were waiting for him to admit, in the spirit of Joe
Torre's clubhouse, that he had done the inexcusable. Only when
Knoblauch did fess up the following day did he seem to join his
team's essential core.
</P>
<P>
   The true, modern-day Yankee does not wear a mask to cover his
flaws. From Darryl Strawberry to Scott Brosius, Orlando Hernandez
to David Wells, the roster was replete with tales of salvation and
redemption, special cases who had the intangible experience of
hardship to give. You always had the feeling that these
superstar-less Yankees could appreciate more than most what it
meant to be so much greater than the sum of their parts.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams are like that, and you can't measure their worth by
what they hit or how much they make. Some ball parks are like that,
too, and you can't expect some out-of-town aristocrat to understand
why they just shouldn't be picked up and moved.
</P>
<P>
   What, for instance, would the San Diego Padres owner, John
Moores, know about generations of fathers and mothers and sons and
daughters who have strained their necks to glimpse the Stadium as
the No. 4 train rumbled from the subway tunnel, and on into the
161st Street station? Moores probably thought he was doing
Steinbrenner a public relations favor when, before Game 3 of the
Yankees' four-game sweep, he compared the Stadium to a ``Little
League park,'' said that he didn't ``know how they could be in a
worse location'' and added that ``the city ought to do the right
thing for the public.'' Instead, he came off like some
pontificating, small-town dullard.
</P>
<P>
   Even before a 500-pound concrete and steel expansion joint from
the upper deck became loose and crushed the empty seats below last
April 13, no one disputed that the Stadium, while still
asymmetrically beautiful, was outdated. Wider corridors, bigger
bathrooms? Obviously. More parking and a Metro North train stop?
Absolutely. Luxury boxes so the Boss can keep up with the Joneses
and the Jacobses? Aye, New York City loves a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of location is only one to men like Moores,
Steinbrenner and his spokesman, the mayor. Nearly three million
fans rushed to the Bronx this season, coming on weekends and
weekdays, for games against Baltimore and Tampa Bay, riding the
trains and braving the traffic. Yes, as Moores said, the city
``ought to do the right thing for the public,'' but the public in
this case is the Yankees fans who by and large want the Stadium to
remain in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   New York is not Baltimore, Cleveland or San Diego, cities with
comparatively small downtowns. What, exactly, is the most central
location for the majority of Yankee fans, who come from upper
Manhattan, the Bronx, Connecticut, Westchester and New Jersey? It
is not East Rutherford, N.J., or the West Side of Manhattan. It's
the South Bronx, where last week, before Game 2, I found more than
few out-of-towners in Monument Park who seemed to be far more
enlightened on this subject than Moores.
</P>
<P>
   I was especially impressed by two elderly sisters _ one from
Portland, Ore., and the other from Moscow, Idaho _ who had taken
the train up from Times Square, and were thrilled, not frightened.
Beverly Schaffer said she loved being in the Bronx, in the ball
park that had filled her television screen for so long. ``They're
not going to tear this down, are they?'' she asked. Flaws and all,
she said the Stadium was everything she imagined it would be. A
sight and site to behold, and, for reasons you feel as much as see,
so much greater than the sum of its parts. &QL;

USC SECONDARY EXPECTS BIG TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Oregon quarterback Akili Smith's vaunted
ability to elude a pass rush, the USC defensive line knows it will
have problems containing the Heisman Trophy candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But the real test could come for the Trojans secondary, which
will be forced to cover receivers for a longer time than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our hands full,'' cornerback Daylon McCutcheon said.
``It's hard enough to cover regular receivers. When you learn the
cornerback position, you get a feel for routes, but when a
quarterback scrambles, the receiver is running natural, against the
route. You don't practice against that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon is also worried Oregon may have Smith run more
against the Trojans, with starting tailback Reuben Droughns out for
the season with a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's able to win with his arm and win with his leg,''
McCutcheon said. ``They're probably expecting him to make even more
plays now that they're using new running backs.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said he is confident the secondary will
meet the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three cornerbacks and two safeties that we can play in
the nickel situation and feel very good,'' Hackett said. ``I think
our secondary has been one of the real strong parts of the team all
year long.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line banged up: There are no major injuries along the
offensive line, but a growing number of players are nursing nagging
injuries. Left tackle Brent McCaffrey missed Wednesday's practice
with a sore ankle, right tackle Matt Welch is still recovering from
mononucleosis and his replacement, Ken Bowen, strained his groin
Thursday. Reserve Rome Douglas is bothered by a hip flexor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today and yesterday were so up in the air,'' Hackett said.
``I've been assured everybody's injuries are so mild (that I
shouldn't) worry about it. We've got some bumps and bruises.''
</P>
<P>
   USC had Donta Kendrick work out at left and right tackle, and
starting guard Jason Grain also practiced at several positions,
just in case someone is unable to play.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett may cancel today's practice at Autzen Stadium, because
he is concerned about giving the injured Trojans more time to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Cusano might play: Although he didn't practice Thursday, Hackett
said linebacker Mark Cusano (sore left thigh) could play in an
emergency situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very discouraging today,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Zeke Moreno, who had nine tackles last week against
Washington State, will start.
</P>
<P>
   Penalty problems: USC had 11 penalties against Washington State,
but Hackett said the Trojans are showing signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only had six or seven major penalties,'' he said. ``I
thought we made a little bit of a stride.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, it's doubtful the Trojans can afford another
double-digit penalty performance against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now going to go into a couple games where every little
inch makes a difference,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   USC leads the Pacific-10 Conference with 74 penalties in seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   Moving up the charts: After his seven-catch explosion against
Washington State, wide receiver Billy Miller of Westlake Village is
now tied for the team lead in receptions (23) with R.Jay Soward.
</P>
<P>
   Woods still out: Wide receiver Quincy Woods will miss his second
straight road trip with a sore knee. X-rays performed on the knee
were negative, and Woods may take a magnetic resonance test next
week if the inflammation persists.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In the race for Florida governor, Kenneth MacKay is the
candidate with the record as state legislator, congressman and,
most recently, lieutenant governor in an administration presiding
over good times. He is the Democrat in a state where registered
Democrats outnumber Republicans. He is the native Floridian, and
the one invariably described as nice.
</P>
<P>
   He is also widely expected to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very unfair, but he's acquired the mantle of a
loser,'' said Richard Scher, a political scientist at the
University of Florida and a personal friend.
</P>
<P>
   If polls that have given MacKay's opponent, Jeb Bush, a
consistent double-digit lead prove accurate, Florida is poised to
come under the rule of a Republican governor and a state
Legislature led by Republicans for the first time since
Reconstruction. It is a changing of the guard happening across the
South, but Florida Democrats say it is not inevitable in their
state.
</P>
<P>
   Despite gains by Republicans over the last two decades, they
note, Florida is still a two-party state where voters are prone to
behave as independents regardless of party registration and are
still electing Democrats in statewide elections.
</P>
<P>
   What has so drastically dimmed the prospects of a viable
Democratic candidate can be better attributed to a confluence of
troubles: a spectacular miscalculation by the state's Democratic
legislators, the successful re-invention of an opponent and
MacKay's failure to excite even his own supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``MacKay is a bland person, no charisma,'' said James Drayton, a
bookstore owner in West Palm Beach and a supporter who attended a
recent campaign appearance by MacKay. ``Bush is attractive,
somewhat glib, has a good name. That's what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 45, a son of former President George Bush, is a Miami
businessman who is running for governor a second time after
narrowly losing to the retiring Democratic governor, Lawton Chiles,
in 1994. Bush has undergone a political transformation, having
tempered his hard-edged conservative talk to present himself as
someone who has ``listened and learned,'' and he has courted
blacks, Jews and other traditional Democratic voters he once
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   And while the 65-year-old MacKay, who is known as Buddy, focuses
on qualifications and issues, Bush has contrasted leadership style
and dynamism to capture people's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida needs a governor with a new vision, new energy,'' Bush
said in a radio debate last week.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as April, a group of prominent Democrats was looking
for an alternative to MacKay, who started campaigning late, who has
lost statewide elections before and who has been regarded by many
as too much of a technocrat.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also brought to the fore organizational problems in
the state's Democratic Party that critics say account for a decline
in its share of registered voters to 45 percent and its failure to
revitalize as the Republicans gained dominance in Tallahassee, the
state capital, in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But a more pressing problem was the party's disarray after
Democrats in the Florida House this year rejected a black state
representative who was next in line to become their leader, a snub
that caused a rift that has yet to heal and has antagonized one of
the party's most loyal and vital constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Although MacKay, who calls Bush ``Jeb come lately'' on matters
of concern to blacks, has held on to the endorsement of influential
black political and religious leaders, the aggrieved
representative, Willie Logan, and a few other black politicians
endorsed Bush, who got only 6 percent of the black vote in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been other defections in the party. too, some
Democrats say all these problems pale in comparison with that of
finances. As of Oct. 9, MacKay's campaign had raised $3.9 million
and spent all but $300,000. Bush's campaign had raised $7.1 million
and still had $2.6 million to spend. Florida's Republican Party
also has more to spend on campaign advertisements than does the
Democratic Party.

</P>
<P>
   In an interview, MacKay said that his party had typically been
less organized and well financed than its counterpart, but that its
problems had subsided ``just in time.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay said a worse problem had been getting the public to focus
on the race because ``the noise level from Washington makes it more
difficult for us to get our message out.'' Although President
Clinton has helped with fund raising and does not appear to have
become a liability for MacKay, a longtime ally who still stands by
the president, neither has Clinton been able to provide the boost
that MacKay needs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his candidacy suffered from unfortunate timing,
MacKay replied that ``not everything is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best economy we've had in 20 years,'' he said. ``
We've got a lot of good things going on this year, and I'm running
in effect as the incumbent.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay indeed has been an active partner of Chiles during the
last eight years, serving by most accounts as an able
trouble-shooter in reorganizing state agencies, brokering deals and
overseeing Miami during the city's financial crisis. But because he
worked mostly behind the scenes, many voters may not have noticed
him or become familiar with him.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail and during debates, MacKay, a lawyer and
citrus farmer from Central Florida, is prone to begin answers with
``the truth of the matter is,'' sometimes appearing passive next to
the taller, more animated Bush. During the last televised debate of
the campaign on Tuesday, MacKay came closer to matching the energy
of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There are substantive contrasts as well: MacKay differs from
Bush in opposing school vouchers, supporting a woman's right to
abortion and favoring a ballot measure that would allow counties to
impose stricter gun control but that Bush argues would prevent
uniform statewide regulation.
</P>
<P>
   And MacKay asks voters whether they can trust a candidate who
has no government experience other than a brief stint as Florida's
commerce secretary in the 1980s and who portrays himself as far
more moderate than his party is and than he himself was four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   As Election Day nears, MacKay has concentrated his attacks on
Bush's business background. In a radio debate last week, he brought
up what he called Bush's record of ``questionable deals'' and
``mismanagement,'' including his tenure on the board of a company
that collapsed and that was the subject of lawsuits alleging
mismanagement and stock manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the issue in debates, Bush responds that the press
has examined his past thoroughly and found no wrongdoing. A
millionaire who has staked his business reputation on a successful
South Florida real-estate development firm that he joined in 1980,
Bush has accused MacKay of ``gross distortions.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay said he expected his gap in the polls to close _ it has,
to 10 percentage points this month, down from 15 to 17 points in
September _ as people focus on the race in its last weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But polls have also shown that most voters are barely interested
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues and trust will decide the race,'' MacKay said moments
before a waitress in a Fort Lauderdale restaurant stared at him as
he got up to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw you on TV,'' she said. ``The Republican?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the Democrat,'' MacKay answered with a smile.

<P>
   MIAMI _ In the race for Florida governor, Kenneth MacKay is the
candidate with the record as state legislator, congressman and,
most recently, lieutenant governor in an administration presiding
over good times. He is the Democrat in a state where registered
Democrats outnumber Republicans. He is the native Floridian, and
the one invariably described as nice.
</P>
<P>
   He is also widely expected to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very unfair, but he's acquired the mantle of a
loser,'' said Richard Scher, a political scientist at the
University of Florida and a personal friend.
</P>
<P>
   If polls that have given MacKay's opponent, Jeb Bush, a
consistent double-digit lead prove accurate, Florida is poised to
come under the rule of a Republican governor and a state
Legislature led by Republicans for the first time since
Reconstruction. It is a changing of the guard happening across the
South, but Florida Democrats say it is not inevitable in their
state.

PROUD IN DEFEAT, AND NOT WITHOUT REASON 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO, Calif. _ It sounds strange to say a team that was
just swept out of the World Series did not get embarrassed as well.
But even though the San Diego Padres dropped four straight games to
the Yankees, they were never made to look foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we got beat four games in a row,'' said Tony Gwynn, who
batted .500 for the Series. ``But three of them, we made them earn
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres took three-run leads into the seventh innings of
Games 1 and 3. And Game 4 on Wednesday was scoreless after five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely feel like the Series was pretty close,'' Kevin
Brown, the San Diego ace who struck out 13 Yankees in 141/3 innings
over two Series starts, said Wednesday night. ``We were one break,
one pitch away from it being a totally different Series. I can't
for the life of me think of one good break we had the whole Series.
They had the talent, yes. But like Wednesday night, they had
everything go their way, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two turning points. In Game 1, the Padres' middle
relievers, handed a 5-2 lead by Brown, could not hold it until it
was time for Trevor Hoffman, the closer supreme, to enter the game.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 3, Hoffman failed to maintain a 3-2 lead in the eighth
inning in his only appearance of the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Padres taken Game 1, they would have been assured a
split in New York and there would have been less pressure on them
at home. Had they held onto Game 3, they would have been down by
2-1, with Brown, who finished with a post-season record of 46
strikeouts, pitching the next day with a chance to even the Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take away Game 2, and all three games were pretty evenly
played,'' Kevin Towers, the San Diego general manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bruce Bochy said: ``We had them on the ropes and they
came back on us. They had no weakness. And whey they got breaks,
they took advantage of them. Sometimes you make your own breaks.
But I don't think we got a lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were just the better club, one that Bochy said
``should go down as one of the best teams ever.'' The Yankees had
the deeper pitching, both starting and in relief, the more balanced
lineup, the stronger bench. And aside from Gwynn, who went 8 for 16
and fittingly singled in his final at-bat, the heart of the San
Diego order was more or less silent.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs in the regular season, did
belt two more in his first three at-bats of Game 1, but he went
hitless in his final 12 at-bats. Ken Caminiti, the National
League's most valuable player in 1996, went 2 for 14 and tied the
World Series record for most strikeouts (7) in a four-game Series.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn and Caminiti were playing hurt, Vaughn having strained
his left quadriceps and Caminiti being bothered by a groin pull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't help,'' Caminiti said. ``I couldn't move the right
way out in the field. And to try and hit, especially right-handed,
I couldn't put any weight down there to twist on it. I know I could
have hit them. I can hit anybody when I'm feeling good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a great team,'' Caminiti added. ``But I still feel in
my heart that we could compete with them if we were strong and
able.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, Brown, Wally Joyner and Steve Finley are all free
agents who may have played their final game for the Padres. Even if
a resolution to build a new ball park passes in a city referendum
on Nov. 3, Towers said it was doubtful he would be able to re-sign
all four.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the first priority. The Padres are hoping to sign him
for four years at $10 million to $11 million each. Even if he
returns, the pitching coach Dave Stewart, who has greatly helped
the staff, most likely will not. He wants a front-office job, and
Toronto, if not other teams, is said to be interested.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the record Qualcomm Stadium crowd of 65,427
spent 20 minutes on its feet after the game, demanding a curtain
call from the Padres, who had retreated to a somber clubhouse.
Thanks for everything you have done for us, even if it was four
games short, the fans seemed to be saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most special moments in my life as an
athlete,'' Hoffman said after he and the bullpen had been greeted
with a thundering ovation as they walked off the field while the
Yankees piled on one another on the pitcher's mound.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn felt the same way. He said he was thankful for finally
having the opportunity to play a game at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It had been 14 years between trips to the World Series for
Gwynn, the eight-time batting champion. ``I don't want to have to
wait 14 years again,'' he said. ``I'll be 52.''

 &HT;    CLINTON URGES MIDDLE EAST LEADERS: TRY TO MAINTAIN 'MOMENTUM OF
PEACE'
 &HT;    With ISRAEL-SETTLERS-1023; MIDEAST-BUDDY-1023.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders were grinding
their way toward a Middle East peace agreement late Thursday night,
amid determined diplomacy by President Clinton, a dramatic appeal
by Jordan's ailing King Hussein and a reported breakthrough on the
contentious issue of eliminating Palestinian language calling for
the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who has been in the country undergoing cancer
treatment, praised some hard-won progress in day eight of the
talks, and urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to take the final steps toward
peace, for the sake of ''their children,'' and ''their children's
children,'' said U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very strong push by the king,'' Rubin told reporters
at a late-night break in the talks Thursday. ``The participants
were all moved by his presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the mood of growing optimism, though, Rubin cautioned that
ninth-inning snags remained over issues critical to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Middle East peace process, end-games can be longer than
perhaps one would wish,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been at some tough, hard bargaining,'' he said, but ''we
don't know how long this phase will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who journeyed for the sixth time in eight days to the
secluded compound where the talks have been held since last
Thursday, was still meeting shortly before midnight with Arafat and
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, National
Security Adviser Samuel E. ``Sandy'' Berger and a gaggle of other
high-level foreign policy aides, the group met around a roaring
fireplace in a large dining room at the Wye River Conference
Center, while American diplomats shuttled in and out from an attic
enclave some dubbed ``the cobweb room.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and Arafat, however, remained far apart, Rubin said,
on half a dozen issues that frame the heart and soul of a peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sticking points were questions over Israeli troop
withdrawals, the treatment of suspected terrorists by Palestinians
and safe passage across Israeli-controlled land for Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In an optimistic sign, though, Rubin signalled that both sides
had narrowed their differences over part of the Palestine
Liberation Organization's charter that calls for Israel's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Palestinian covenant issue, substantial progress has
been made,'' Rubin said in a statement, ``but details are still
being worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of the issues and the severity of the remaining
gaps, after eight days and nights of negotiations, left the talks
suspended in a stomach-wrenching netherworld between culmination
and collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the parties will seize this opportunity and not retreat
from the clear moment to capture the momentum of peace,'' Clinton
said at the White House, before journeying by helicopter to the
summit, where he has spent more than 70 working hours since the
talks began. ``The hardest decisions now, at last, are on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of bargaining at its most earnest, Netanyahu and
Arafat held a rare one-on-one meeting for two hours in the
afternoon, as their aides huddled in side meetings trying to come
to terms with various aspects of an overall deal.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, though, they had yet to reach agreement on a host
of important issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting there, on some of them,'' said Rubin, who
compared the atmosphere to that of a last-minute political
horsetrading session on the eve of a critical legislative vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had a little bit of the flavor of a legislative session,
drawing toward the close, where people were working very hard,''
Rubin told reporters gathered near the conference center, where the
talks are unfolding at a 1,000-acre riverside retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ''But that doesn't mean that they will draw to a close,'' Rubin
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still obstacles,'' he said. ''I would say it's in
the half-dozen category.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the talks is a proposal for Israeli troops to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the occupied West Bank,
in exchange for a Palestinian commitment to combat anti-Israeli
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement would leave some 40 percent of the West Bank
under full, or partial, control of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Under a U.S. proposal, agents of the Central Intelligence Agency
would assist Palestinians in handling difficult terrorist problems.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is seeking additional promises from the Palestinians,
specifically over the issue of how to handle suspected terrorists
in territory under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is also insisting on the specific recension of a
provision in the Palestinians' charter that calls for the
destruction of Israel. Arafat counters that the policy-making arm
of the Palestinian Authority has rescinded the provision -- even
though it is yet to be officially excised by a broader, 700-member
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, for his part, is pressing for promises of additional
Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank, as called for in the
1993 Oslo accords that spawned the current peace process.
</P>
<P>
   That process has been stalemated for 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye talks are an attempt to advance the process toward
so-called final, or permanent, status talks, which, under the Oslo
accords, are to be completed by May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent status talks would be aimed at resolving the most
difficult issues remaining in a conflict that has endured for half
a century, including the future of Jerusalem, which both Israelis
and Palestinians claim, and a host of economic, territorial and
security issues.

IN MIAMI, HINTS OF LOVE TRIANGLE PUT NEW TWIST ON A CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dl)

<P>
   MIAMI _ When Miami City Commissioner Humberto Hernandez Jr. was
convicted in state court of helping cover up voter fraud in last
November's election, many in this city saw the case as part of
Miami's healing from a period of widespread corruption in local
politics. Hernandez later pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy
to commit bank fraud in an unrelated federal case, insuring he
would face at least five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But now the case of Hernandez, 35, has taken another turn.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, five days after The Miami Herald reported that
Hernandez's wife and lawyer were spotted kissing at a popular
Coconut Grove restaurant, a federal judge ordered the lawyer, Jose
Quinon, to have no more contact with Hernandez and to return all
fees paid for his representation. She ordered Quinon's business and
personal bank accounts frozen until he complied.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing the order after prosecutors presented her with a
sealed motion on Monday, the judge, Joan Lenard of U.S. District
Court in Miami, did not explain why she was taking the action. But
she wrote: ``The court recognizes that these matters impact
sensitive and personal issues of great human dimension, affecting
real persons and their families. The court further recognizes that
these matters are of significant import to the legal community, to
the clients whom attorneys represent with integrity and to the
community at large.''
</P>
<P>
   The Herald reported that Hernandez screamed ``I'm going to ruin
him! I'm going to make sure he never practices law again!'' when he
read the Saturday article while at the Federal Detention Center in
Miami, where he is being held.
</P>
<P>
   But the turn of events has left Miami's legal community almost
as jarred as Hernandez. Neither Quinon nor his lawyer returned
telephone calls seeking comment, but other criminal defense lawyers
worried about the reputation of someone they regard among the best
in their field.
</P>
<P>
   A former state prosecutor, the Cuban-born Quinon, 47, has been
involved in numerous high-profile cases, representing Colombian
drug cartel leaders, politicians accused of corruption and most
recently the president of the Cuban-American National Foundation
during a federal investigation of a plot to kill Fidel Castro.
Friends said he has three children and was separated from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always found him to be not only an outstanding human
being but a great lawyer,'' said Richard Sharpstein, a former
colleague of Quinon's when they both worked as prosecutors in Janet
Reno's Miami-Dade County state attorney's office and a friend of 23
years. ``Even though this may open up doors for Hernandez from a
legal point of view, these are doors he may not want to walk
through.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Quinon and Mrs. Hernandez had a
relationship while Quinon defended Hernandez, or even if they have
one now. But defense lawyers said Hernandez could use any evidence
of a relationship to argue that Quinon might not have represented
his best interest. The lawyers said Hernandez could then say that
was grounds to have his plea deal in the federal bank fraud case
withdrawn and to win a new trial on the state voting fraud
conviction, which is being appealed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Sharpstein and other lawyers noted that Hernandez was
acquitted of the more serious charges in the state case and
convicted only of a misdemeanor, for which he was sentenced to a
year in jail. And in the federal case Hernandez, himself a lawyer,
had faced a 23-count indictment on charges of money laundering and
mortgage fraud that could have put him in jail for 13 years. But
federal prosecutors accepted his plea and agreed that at his
sentencing next month he be given a four-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
   In its Oct. 17 story, the Herald reported that Quinon and Esther
Hernandez, the commissioner's wife, were spotted together last
month at a Mexican restaurant during happy hour. Among the
restaurant's patrons who saw them that night were Judge Thomas
Wilson Jr. of the state circuit court and Miami-Dade County
Commissioner Jimmy Morales and his wife, Dori, who was quoted as
saying: ``They were hanging out at the bar, kissing. I was
horrified.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wilson told the newspaper: ``It looked to me like a couple
that had just started going out and found each other attractive.''
Wilson refused to answer questions about the case through a bailiff
and Commissioner Morales did not return calls made to his office.
</P>
<P>
   Lenard also appointed Bob Josefsberg as a lawyer for Hernandez.
Josefsberg, who expected to meet with Hernandez for the first time
on Thursday, said he would advise Hernandez not to talk to the
media but had not decided what to do next.

updates throughout
 &HT;    CLINTON URGES MIDDLE EAST LEADERS: TRY TO MAINTAIN 'MOMENTUM OF
PEACE'
 &HT;    With ISRAEL-SETTLERS-1023; MIDEAST-BUDDY-1023.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders were grinding
their way toward a Middle East peace agreement late Thursday night,
amid determined diplomacy by President Clinton, a dramatic appeal
by Jordan's ailing King Hussein and a reported breakthrough on the
contentious issue of eliminating Palestinian language calling for
the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who has been in the country undergoing cancer
treatment, praised some hard-won progress in day eight of the
talks, and urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to take the final steps toward
peace, for the sake of ''their children,'' and ''their children's
children,'' said U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very strong push by the king,'' Rubin told reporters
at a late-night break in the talks Thursday. ``The participants
were all moved by his presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the mood of growing optimism, though, Rubin cautioned that
ninth-inning snags remained over issues critical to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Middle East peace process, end-games can be longer than
perhaps one would wish,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been at some tough, hard bargaining,'' he said, but ''we
don't know how long this phase will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who journeyed for the sixth time in eight days to the
secluded compound where the talks have been held since last
Thursday, was still meeting shortly before midnight with Arafat and
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, National
Security Adviser Samuel E. ``Sandy'' Berger and a gaggle of other
high-level foreign policy aides, the group met around a roaring
fireplace in a large dining room at the Wye River Conference
Center, while American diplomats shuttled in and out from an attic
enclave some dubbed ``the cobweb room.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and Arafat, however, remained far apart, Rubin said,
on half a dozen issues that frame the heart and soul of a peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sticking points were questions over Israeli troop
withdrawals, the treatment of suspected terrorists by Palestinians
and safe passage across Israeli-controlled land for Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In an optimistic sign, though, Rubin signalled that both sides
had narrowed their differences over part of the Palestine
Liberation Organization's charter that calls for Israel's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Palestinian covenant issue, substantial progress has
been made,'' Rubin said in a statement, ``but details are still
being worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of the issues and the severity of the remaining
gaps, after eight days and nights of negotiations, left the talks
suspended in a stomach-wrenching netherworld between culmination
and collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the parties will seize this opportunity and not retreat
from the clear moment to capture the momentum of peace,'' Clinton
said at the White House, before journeying by helicopter to the
summit, where he has spent more than 70 working hours since the
talks began. ``The hardest decisions now, at last, are on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of bargaining at its most earnest, Netanyahu and
Arafat held a rare one-on-one meeting for two hours in the
afternoon, as their aides huddled in side meetings trying to come
to terms with various aspects of an overall deal.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, though, they had yet to reach agreement on a host
of important issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting there, on some of them,'' said Rubin, who
compared the atmosphere to that of a last-minute political
horsetrading session on the eve of a critical legislative vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had a little bit of the flavor of a legislative session,
drawing toward the close, where people were working very hard,''
Rubin told reporters gathered near the conference center, where the
talks are unfolding at a 1,000-acre riverside retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ''But that doesn't mean that they will draw to a close,'' Rubin
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still obstacles,'' he said. ''I would say it's in
the half-dozen category.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the talks is a proposal for Israeli troops to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the occupied West Bank,
in exchange for a Palestinian commitment to combat anti-Israeli
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement would leave some 40 percent of the West Bank
under full, or partial, control of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Under a U.S. proposal, agents of the Central Intelligence Agency
would assist Palestinians in handling difficult terrorist problems.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is seeking additional promises from the Palestinians,
specifically over the issue of how to handle suspected terrorists
in territory under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is also insisting on the specific recension of a
provision in the Palestinians' charter that calls for the
destruction of Israel. Arafat counters that the policy-making arm
of the Palestinian Authority has rescinded the provision -- even
though it is yet to be officially excised by a broader, 700-member
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, for his part, is pressing for promises of additional
Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank, as called for in the
1993 Oslo accords that spawned the current peace process.
</P>
<P>
   That process has been stalemated for 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye talks are an attempt to advance the process toward
so-called final, or permanent, status talks, which, under the Oslo
accords, are to be completed by May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent status talks would be aimed at resolving the most
difficult issues remaining in a conflict that has endured for half
a century, including the future of Jerusalem, which both Israelis
and Palestinians claim, and a host of economic, territorial and
security issues.

EDITORIAL: FOR THE LEGISLATURE FROM NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Many of New York state's legislative districts are so dominated
by one party that the real elections occur in the primaries. These
are our endorsements for some of the more contested races in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Senate District 23 (Brooklyn, Staten Island): Sen. Vincent
Gentile, a first-term Democrat, is being challenged by a
conservative Republican, Christopher Mega, who gave up the seat
five years ago to become a judge. Recently Mega left his post as
presiding judge of New York state's Court of Claims to try to
regain his old Senate seat. If he is elected, Mega, 67, plans to
keep collecting retirement pay from his earlier years as a senator
and judge, as well as his full salary as senator. That amounts to a
six-figure income _ a spectacular example of double-dipping for a
politician who bills himself as a fiscal conservative. When he left
the Legislature for the judiciary, Mega said it was time for fresh
faces in Albany. We agree. Gentile, who is 39 and has worked hard
for his district, deserves to continue as its representative.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly District 26 (Queens): Ann-Margaret Carrozza, a
Democrat, is also facing a vigorous rematch, with Douglas Prescott,
a Republican who narrowly lost to Ms. Carrozza two years ago.
Prescott held the seat before that for 14 years, with little to
show for it. Ms. Carrozza's own political identity still seems
unformed. While she complains about the lack of independent
thinking in Albany, she has stuck close to the Democratic
leadership in her first term. But her record for hard work tops
that of her predecessor. She has been quietly fighting for seniors
and the public college system. After only two years on the job, Ms.
Carrozza should be allowed to continue to pursue these vital
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly District 30 (Queens): Margaret Markey, a Democrat, is
making overcrowded schools her prime issue, in contrast to Michael
Kuzmicz, her Republican opponent, who is focusing on crime.
Kuzmicz, an assistant district attorney in Queens, has run an
energetic campaign, but Mrs. Markey gets our endorsement for her
much broader history of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly District 49 (Brooklyn): Peter Abbate, the incumbent
Democrat, is being challenged by Luigi Marano, a retired state
Supreme Court justice. Marano, who is 77, says his main mission in
campaigning for the Assembly after 30 years as a judge and
assistant state attorney general is to work against late-term
abortion. His other mission may be to bring out Republican voters
for other races on the ballot this election. Although Abbate has
nuzzled too close to the tobacco interests in recent years, we
endorse him for his efforts on behalf of senior citizens, his work
pushing for improvement of legislative operations and for tax
abatements in historic districts.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly District 60 (Staten Island): This race has turned into
a bitter and expensive contest between a likable longtime
Democratic incumbent, Eric Vitaliano, and his Republican
challenger, Glenn Yost, a former New York City police detective.
Yost favors term limits but opposes limits on campaign donations, a
far more important tool for political accountability. We endorse
Vitaliano.

   NEW YORK _ Now is the time for all good museum directors to
collect on the silly bets they made before the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, MICHAEL HAGER, the executive director of the San
Diego Natural History Museum, wrote to ELLEN FUTTER, the president
of the American Museum of Natural History. He proposed that the
person whose team lost the Series treat the other to two nights in
the losing city. He also said that his museum had a great white
shark with a Padres cap and a Yankees jersey in its mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Futter put a Yankees cap on an allosaurus and a Padres
jersey in its mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the evolutionary superiority of the New York
animal,'' she said Thursday. ``We're a winning species. Not
necessarily gracious, but winning.'' And as far as going to San
Diego, ``we believe in the investigation of other civilizations.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, during Game 3, JACK NICHOLSON went to Matthew
Bourne's ``Swan Lake,'' the testosterone-fueled Broadway remake of
the 120-year-old ballet. At intermission, he went backstage.
Someone said it was the bottom of the third, and the score was ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to know,'' Nicholson snapped, sounding like a
tough guy from the movies.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Swan Lake,'' he went to his hotel, where his assistant
had taped the game. He watched it from opening pitch to final out.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Nicholson went to a party at Lot 61, a restaurant
west of Chelsea, for ALAN FINKELSTEIN, an inventor who devised a
credit card with a built-in magnifying glass. KEVIN COSTNER, ART
GARFUNKEL and SEAN PENN were there, too. But it was Nicholson who
wanted to see Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   So AMY SACCO, an owner of Lot 61, set up a television in a back
room for Nicholson. And only Nicholson.

   NEW YORK _ The invitation for the International Press Freedom
Awards dinner listed well-known news executives and television
personalities. Right between the names of RICHARD M. SMITH, the
chairman and editor in chief of Newsweek, and MATTHEW STORIN, the
editor of The Boston Globe, were ``Kenneth and Marisa Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   Has the Whitewater independent counsel decided to spend an
evening socializing with journalists?
</P>
<P>
   This is a tale of two Kenneth Starrs. The Committee to Protect
Journalists, the sponsor of the Nov. 24 event, says the one who is
coming to dinner is a business manager with his own firm on Park
Avenue. (For the record, the independent counsel's wife's name is
Alice.)
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the two George Stephanopouloses. The one who
moved from Washington to New York used to work at the White House.
The one who recently moved from New York to Washington is the
director of business affairs for Discovery Communications, a
company that runs several cable-television channels.
</P>
<P>
   Do people confuse them?

   NEW YORK _ The Brooklyn Museum of Art gave a party fit for an
empress on Wednesday. The empress in question _ an empress in
exile, really _ was the widow of the shah of Iran, FARAH PAHLEVI.
The occasion was the opening of an exhibition of Persian paintings
from the 19th century, a time when patronage of the arts flourished
under the Qajar dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   The talk turned to the changes in Iran. Some people at the
dinner, including the philanthropist CECILE ZILKHA, expressed hope
that the increased openness could mean that Iranians who fled after
the shah's expulsion could eventually return, at least to visit.
The former empress, whose image was fixed in many Americans' minds
when she and the dying shah searched for a new homeland in the late
1970s, divides her time between Connecticut and France.

CAN JOHNSON LAST WITH FOX?
</HEADLINE>
 10TH GRAPH-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Got a baseball club that isn't ``King of the
Hill?'' Well, then, fire one manager, move another and bring in a
third who has earned decidedly mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know better, you'd think the Dodgers were another
branch of Fox's network programming. With Rupert Murdoch's minions
running things at Chavez Ravine, managers Bill Russell and Glenn
Hoffman lasted only slightly longer than Fox's failing fall sitcoms
``Costello'' and ``Getting Personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing personal against Davey Johnson, the Dodgers' latest
replacement show _ er manager _ but if he doesn't extend to 11 his
streak of exhorting clubs to first or second-place regular-season
finishes, he can count on being extended the same courtesies shown
a slow-starting comedy series.
</P>
<P>
   There were bolder choices out there for president Bob Graziano
and general manager Kevin Malone _ former Dodger Davey Lopes,
ex-Yankee Chris Chambliss and Taft High product Kevin Kennedy, to
name just a few.
</P>
<P>
   Don Baylor, whose patience got worn as thin as the mile-high air
in Colorado, also was there for the taking had the Dodgers been
determined, after Felipe Alou turned them down, to stay the course
in hiring their first minority manager.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for the Dodgers' purposes, there might have been no
better candidate than someone the Fox network tried to hire as a
color commentator last year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ultimately passed on that job and was turned away from a
managerial position in Toronto because, in the words of Blue Jays
general manager Gord Ash, ``Davey's track record indicates that
after a couple or three seasons he's usually found in some
controversy, and not necessarily ones of his own making.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your perfect matches. What we have here is the union
of a manager not prone to staying long and a club that wields a
quick hook.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't used to be that way, of course. The Dodgers had only
two managers in their first 37 years in L.A. Everybody talks about
the risks of entrusting the club to an unproven member of the
Dodgers family (i.e., Lopes), forgetting that in 1977 the franchise
did precisely that.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers gave a former player, Tommy Lasorda, his first
major-league managing opportunity and you could say Lasorda did all
right by the people who went out on a limb for him. He shepherded
the club to the National League title in his first season and the
World Series championship in his fifth and 12th years.
</P>
<P>
   Fox showed that kind of commitment once, sticking with the
``X-Files'' long enough for it to carve out its niche in prime
time. But from the beginning, its baseball brass has shown no such
patience. Within three months of assuming control of the club from
Peter O'Malley, Graziano traded the Dodgers' resident superstar,
Mike Piazza, and the bulk of its top prospects. Then he fired
Russell and general manager Fred Claire.
</P>
<P>
   The new Dodgers blueprint is as plain as it is stark: Change the
complexion of the team and if that doesn't do the trick, then bring
in new faces.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is no stranger to the situation that will greet him when
he arrives here. In 1996 he took over an Orioles team that had lots
of egos and experience and a 13-season playoff drought. He led them
to consecutive postseason appearances before faxing in his
resignation in Nov. of 1997 (because he believed he was about to be
fired).
</P>
<P>
   It was the third job Johnson had lost in eight years for reasons
that have nothing to do with his record. In 24 seasons as a player
and a manager, Johnson has been affiliated with only four sub-500
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   No other manager currently in the majors has a better winning
percentage than Johnson's .575 (985-727). He also has one of the
more prickly personalities. Johnson has been described as stubborn,
mercurial, selfish and manipulative. And that's just his allies
talking.
</P>
<P>
   Friends or foes all agree, he's not one to kowtow to management
or spoiled stars. He benched three of his better players for a 1997
playoff game against Seattle and feuded with Marge Schott in
Cincinnati and Peter Angelos in Baltimore (when Malone was there as
the assistant GM).
</P>
<P>
   One of the players Johnson rode hard in Baltimore was Bobby
Bonilla, of whom he once said, ``He's not a Gold Glover wherever I
put him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla's glove _ and his $11 million salary over the next two
years _ belong to the Dodgers now. It'll be interesting to see how
Johnson goes about wresting Bonilla and his cohorts from their
collective comfort zone. No question the clubhouse could use some
shaking up, considering the Dodgers haven't won a postseason game
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   One unidentified baseball executive told the Sporting News last
year that Johnson ``knows how to manage a game as well as anyone,
but he's not a disciplinarian. He's going to get his time in on the
golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Having had a whole year to roam the links to his heart's
content, Johnson seems eager to get back to baseball. The tagline
on the column he wrote for USA Today during the World Series read
like a position-wanted ad: ``Davey Johnson, whose most recent job
was with Baltimore, hopes to return to managing soon.''
</P>
<P>

A LAWYER'S FALL SHATTERS IMMIGRANTS' LIVES
</HEADLINE>
   (dl) 
 By MIRTA OJITO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the tightly ordered, self-contained world of Li Yu
Mei and Wei Liang Li there is little room for chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Married just over a year ago, the couple, Chinese immigrants who
live in Sunset Park in Brooklyn, had planned their life down to the
last detail. Their marital bed is big enough to accommodate the
children they hoped to have (``so no one rolls off the bed,'' Ms.
Mei says). They had talked about having a girl next year, the
Chinese Year of the Rabbit, so that she would be soft and pure. The
following year, the Year of the Dragon, they hoped for a boy, so
that he would be strong and daring.
</P>
<P>
   But the events of the last week have wrecked their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Li, a 26-year-old handyman who came to the country illegally in
1994, is now being held in a federal detention center in Elizabeth,
N.J., where he awaits deportation to China. Ms. Mei, a 25-year-old
graduate from the University of Rhode Island, is trying to stop his
deportation by calling lawyers and sending faxes to the White House
and human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up every night and don't see him next to me and I just
cannot go back to sleep,'' said Ms. Mei, who cried throughout a
recent interview. ``I don't know what I'm going to do without him
or even if I can go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Li's predicament is an object lesson on how everything can go
wrong, and usually does, when immigrants who do not speak English
and do not understand the laws of the United States try _ by
themselves or following the bad advice of inept or corrupt lawyers
_ to decipher the intricate ways of the immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   Li's arrest comes at a time when federal officials have a
mandate and the resources to detain and deport more people than
ever before, because of a 1996 law that makes it harder for illegal
immigrants to stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Li, his wife said, was the victim of a bad lawyer who filed a
political asylum claim on his behalf three years ago. Ms. Mei said
her husband, who had no intention of seeking political asylum, had
gone to the lawyer only for a work permit. Without Li's
understanding of the process, she said, the asylum claim was filed
and denied. That denial led to a 1996 order of deportation that Li
ignored. His wife said that without telling him the contents of the
order, his lawyer had advised him to ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   It is not possible to know what Li's former lawyer, Sheldon
Walker, can say in his defense or even if he recalls Li's case.
Walker, a 60-year-old immigration lawyer from Great Neck, N.Y., is
finishing the first month of a 42-month sentence in a federal
prison for defrauding the Immigration and Naturalization Service
and misleading thousands of clients who sought his help at his
Manhattan office near Pennsylvania Station.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Walker's clients were non-English-speaking immigrants
from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, India, Turkey, China and the
former Yugoslavia. Prosecutors in the criminal division of the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Manhattan got an indictment of Walker with the
help of dozens of his former clients. Seven of them testified at
his two-week trial in May.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants testified that they had gone to Walker hoping to
receive a work permit. Walker had told them that for $600 he could
get them the permit, a much-sought-after privilege. Some of them
did not even know that Walker had applied instead for their
political asylum until prosecutors seeking evidence against Walker
showed them the asylum application with their signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's mishandling of thousands of cases has caused many
expensive and time-consuming administrative problems for the INS.
In a letter sent to the judge during the sentencing of Walker last
month, Edward McElroy, INS district director in New York, said that
Walker's conviction would force the agency to scrutinize all
pending applications filed by his office and, most likely, also
lead to a review of old cases in which benefits were granted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because Li was not granted any benefit from the application
Walker filed on his behalf, his case is not up for review, though.
Following an agency policy of not discussing individual cases, INS
officials declined to answer questions about Li this week.
</P>
<P>
   Li's ordeal began Oct. 14, when, accompanied by his wife, he
walked into the immigration office in lower Manhattan for a
much-awaited interview on his attempt to legalize his status. After
marrying Ms. Mei last year, he had applied to obtain legal
permanent residency, or what is commonly known as a green card.
(Ms. Mei, who came from China when she was 12, is an American
citizen.)
</P>
<P>
   The couple hoped that within an hour, Li would walk out with a
green card. Instead, Li and Ms. Mei were ushered into an office on
the 12th floor. There, an immigration officer asked Ms. Mei to
translate his words to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said: `Ask your husband if he has anything he wants to give
to you, because we are going to take him now. He is on his way to
China,''' Ms. Mei recalled. ``And that was it. My husband was gone
in five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Li has been held at the Elizabeth, N.J., detention
center. The day after his arrest, Li came within 10 minutes of
deportation. Immigration officials shackled him and took him to
Kennedy International Airport, hoping to send him to China. Just
before he boarded the plane, his new lawyers filed a motion to stop
the deportation. Li was sent back to the detention center but the
motion was denied later and so was the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Li's new lawyers, Stephanie Yutkin and Theodore N. Cox, were
able to postpone the deportation only after filing a request for
what is commonly known as a torture convention interview, a
last-minute appeal that stops the process while the authorities
determine whether the immigrant is likely to be tortured on
returning to his country.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mei says she so wants to be with her husband that if he is
deported to China, she will follow. That could present a problem,
though. Ms. Mei, who was born in the province of Guangdong, about
an hour's drive from Hong Kong, is what she calls a black-market
child. Because her parents already had a child when she was born
and China has strict laws that allow one child per family, Ms.
Mei's birth and young life were not properly recorded in her own
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I don't exist over there,'' she said. ``My parents
always had to bribe officials to hide my presence everywhere we
lived and to be able to send me to school.''
</P>
<P>
   And the one-child rule has become even stricter in recent years.
Having a family is especially important for Li, an only child whose
mother was forced to have five abortions, Ms. Mei said.
</P>
<P>
   He so wanted to become a father, she said, that he had already
bought a pretty little frame with room for two pictures. The frame,
resting on a shelf near a sunny window, is for the first baby
portraits of their future children.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to discuss
Li's case beyond what they argued in court. They contend that Li
could not possibly have been lied to by his lawyer because in 1995,
at an asylum hearing, he testified in detail about how, as a
student leader in China, he had been a victim of persecution. That
hearing should have indicated to him that he was seeking political
asylum, not work authorization, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they said, even if he was lied to by his lawyer, he
should have been alert enough to understand that something was
amiss when he had signed the letter of deportation he had received.
At the very least, a prosecutor said, he should have walked into an
immigration office in order to inquire about the deportation order.
He could also have turned his lawyer in, they said.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers vehemently argue that Li had been misled and could
not possibly have understood the legal or bureaucratic terms
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also point to the findings of the immigration judge
who ruled against Li in his 1995 asylum hearing. Noticing the
rehearsed way in which Li was testifying. the judge noted that Li's
demeanor in court was not that of someone speaking from personal
experience; instead, he appeared to be trying to recall facts he
had memorized.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed he may have been. His wife has not asked him about
this and it is not possible to communicate with Li now that he is
detained. His current lawyers said he was repeating in court what
he had been told.
</P>
<P>
   During court testimony in Walker's case, it was revealed that he
instructed his employees to prepare fictitious stories of
persecution for his clients to use, based on boilerplate model
stories that Walker maintained in his files.
</P>
<P>
   Li's new lawyers said that Walker's conviction should allow the
courts or the INS to reopen their client's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put the lawyer in jail, they know what he did and how and
they are unwilling to give a break to one of his clients,'' Ms.
Yutkin said. ``It's outrageous! I have never seen anything like
this in my years of practice.''

LAWYER'S CRUSADE ENDS IN MAN'S LIBERATION FROM PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add a definition of PATH in the 16th graf)  (mk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEARNY, N.J. _ Do not be deceived by Priscilla Read Chenoweth's
sweet manner, the dust on her resume, the spectacles on her nose or
her matronly appearance. Do not dismiss this 68-year-old widow as
some kind of amateur Angela Lansbury with a law degree.
</P>
<P>
   That is what prosecutors did seven years ago, Mrs. Chenoweth
believes, when she decided to try and save a stranger who she
believed had been wrongly convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought, `Here's that old grandma and her bleeding
heart,''' she recalled this week during an interview in her home
here.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Luis Kevin Rojas, Mrs. Chenoweth's cause and
crusade since 1991, an aspiring engineer who had spent a third of
his life in prison or on trial for a murder he swore he did not
commit, was freed for good, in large part because of her singular
persistence.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-week trial in state Supreme Court in New York City,
a jury acquitted Rojas of charges that, at age 18, he provided the
gun used in the 1990 shooting death of another teen-ager on the
streets of Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1991, after reading an account of the case in a New
Jersey newspaper, Mrs. Chenoweth spent much of her savings and many
of her days, nights, weekends and vacations chugging up legal hills
for Rojas. Mrs. Chenoweth, a lawyer who gave up her practice to
become an editor at The New Jersey Law Journal, smelled injustice
in a jury verdict that year that sent Rojas, a high school senior
with no prior record, to prison.
</P>
<P>
   So from the tiny cluttered study of her red-brick home here,
aided by her daughter, her sister and three retired detectives, she
set out to reinvestigate the crime and prove it was a case of
mistaken identity. She read transcripts, filed motions, interviewed
witnesses, enlisted the help of three dozen lawyers and ultimately
spent $50,000 of her own ``old age'' money _ more than a year's
salary.
</P>
<P>
   Before she was through, Mrs. Chenoweth and her team of paid
professionals and conscripted volunteers established an alibi for
Rojas: He was half a mile away at the time of the shooting. In
1995, they succeeded in getting the original conviction overturned.
And with the acquittal in the retrial state Supreme Court, they
rolled back the rest of the stone.
</P>
<P>
   For this effort, Mrs. Chenoweth has received all the
compensation she ever wanted _ thanks and affection from Rojas,
flowers from his family, and, perhaps most important to her, the
respect of all those high-priced lawyers she prodded into working
with her.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that, in this case, all those noble adages of
American jurisprudence, like ``justice will prevail,'' only proved
true because of Mrs. Chenoweth. Without her, they said, Luis Rojas
would still be working the sanitation detail at the Coxsackie
Correctional Facility, near Albany, N.Y., just halfway through his
15-year-to-life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the system worked,'' said Jethro Eisenstein, the lawyer
who donated his services and won Rojas' acquittal. ``But it only
worked because of Priscilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Even her adversary, Peter Kougasian, an assistant district
attorney, was impressed. ``I have never seen anyone pour their
heart and soul into an effort like this for a stranger,''
Eisenstein said he told him.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chenoweth said she became involved because it was obvious
to her that Rojas, a stable student with no history of violence,
was incapable of playing a role in a murder. Even though the murder
victim's family still believes that Rojas played a part, Mrs.
Chenoweth said his involvement just never made sense to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no record, no gang, nice friends,'' she said. ``They
were all going to college or were skilled technical workers. He had
a reputation for peaceableness.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred just after 2 a.m. on Nov. 18, 1990, when
two groups of teen-agers tussled on lower Broadway, near Waverly
Place. One teen-ager in a Day-Glo orange, reversible jacket pulled
out a gun, shot into the air, then passed the weapon to another
youth in a green jacket, who fired at the other teen-agers as they
fled. Javier Bueno, a 19-year-old planning to attend New York
University, was shot in the neck and died three weeks later. Rudy
Quesada, 17, was shot in the leg. The shooter, the youth in the
green jacket, has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, from Union City, N.J., was spotted by police several
minutes later in the nearby PATH station on West Ninth Street.
PATH, the Port Authority Trans-Hudson, is a rail rapid-transit
system between New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He was wearing a similar Day-Glo jacket, but the orange side had
been turned inside out. One of the friends of the youths who were
shot was brought to the station and identified Rojas, now wearing
the jacket orange side out, as the youth who had supplied the gun.
Police then brought Rojas to the crime scene, where other friends
of the victims identified him.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest shocked Rojas' friends at Emerson High School in
Weehawken, N.J., where 150 students wrote letters to the judge in
the case on his behalf. Though he had once taken a car without
permission and had been caught hopping a turnstile, Rojas was
viewed as a gentle soul, someone who counseled his peers on the
dangers of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas told police that on the night of the shootings, he had
been at a nearby restaurant with a friend and was returning home to
New Jersey when he was arrested. He said he had reversed his jacket
to wear the burgundy side out because he did not want it to get
dirty. That was the way he usually wore it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But police had seven witnesses who said Rojas was involved and
they did not believe his account.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chenoweth and her team would later undermine the
reliability of those identifications. Several witnesses had been
drinking or only picked out Rojas after seeing him in handcuffs.
The defense team contended that since police had Rojas wear the
jacket with the orange side out, the sight of him in custody, in
the jacket, within minutes of the shootings, overpowered the
ability of those distraught witnesses to make a reliable
identification.
</P>
<P>
   One of the witnesses identified someone else in the PATH station
that night as also having been involved in the shooting. But that
person turned out to have an ironclad alibi.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The police lineup the next morning was also stacked against
Rojas, Mrs. Chenoweth's team asserted. The ``fillers'' in the
lineup were well-rested, clean-shaven police cadets with crew cuts.
Rojas had medium-length hair and had been up all night.
</P>
<P>
   Few of these apparent holes in the evidence were brought forward
during Rojas' first trial, which ended in 1991 with a jury
convicting him of second-degree murder. The defense mounted by his
lawyer for that case, David Fronefield, was later derided by the
Appellate Division. ``It almost appears, at times, that Fronefield
acted as a second prosecutor,'' the appellate panel wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At home in New Jersey, Mrs. Chenoweth read an article about the
case in a local newspaper at her daughter's suggestion. She focused
on a statement from one of Rojas' teachers, who said the
teen-ager's involvement was simply impossible. Something moved her
to speak to the teacher and members of Rojas' family. Within weeks,
Mrs. Chenoweth was off to meet Rojas himself at Rikers Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear to me that it was a gross injustice,'' she said.
``The legal system had harmed this man, and the legal system should
right the wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chenoweth had some history at trying to right wrongs. She
had been involved in the civil rights movement for many years and
was arrested in New Jersey in 1963 for sitting down in front of a
truck to protest the lack of construction jobs for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But it had been 17 years since the mother of three and
grandmother of five had practiced law, a career she left because
``the money was a little erratic and I wasn't terribly good at
business.''
</P>
<P>
   While rusty, she did not lack for confidence. After all, she was
the daughter of a Harvard-educated stockbroker so convinced of his
abilities that he used to write corrections in the margins of the
encyclopedia. Still, she had only practiced for six years _ 1968 to
1974 _ and in that time, she had done only a smattering of criminal
cases, most of them misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd had court experience,'' she recalled, ``but never a jury
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, nonetheless, liked her from the very start. ``She really
believed in me,'' he said early this week in Eisenstein's Manhattan
law office..
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, whose mother had died while he was in prison, came to
rely on Mrs. Chenoweth for emotional support. He sent her cards on
Mother's Day. She told him to cut his hair. She carried a sport
coat in her briefcase for him to wear in court and worked to
persuade experienced lawyers to get involved in his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, I only saw myself as a conduit,'' she said, but
she ended up doing a lot of the legal work herself. She also heard
about a selfless retired New York City police detective who tried
to crack unsolved murders. Soon, Denis O'Sullivan, was part of her
team, putting up his own house to secure Rojas' $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Another retired police officer, Mike O'Connor, found a critical
witness _ a PATH police sergeant, John Apel. The sergeant
remembered that on the night of the crime, he had watched Rojas
just miss a train as it left the station. Research showed that the
train departed that night no later than 2:03 a.m. That meant Rojas
could not have been involved in the dispute on Broadway, a
half-mile away, at 2:07 a.m., when the shooting started.
</P>
<P>
   When Rojas' appeals lawyer, Tina Mazza, introduced this evidence
to the Appellate Division in 1995, it overturned the conviction,
citing as well ineffective counsel by his original lawyer and the
tainted identifications.
</P>
<P>
   After more than four years in prison, Rojas was out on bail. But
prosecutors decided to retry him. Their reasoning: The witnesses, a
solid, stable group of college students, still believed Rojas was
the man in the orange jacket who helped kill their friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also had circumstantial evidence,'' said Barbara Thompson,
a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, ``so we decided
to let the jury decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision made Mrs. Chenoweth's blood boil. ``They were not
interested in justice. They were interested in securing and keeping
a conviction,'' she said. ``It's like a pride of lions giving up a
kill.''
</P>
<P>
   The families of the victims applauded the move, however. They
still believe Rojas was involved. ``I think he got away with a big
lie,'' said Jose Bueno, whose brother was killed. ``Seven people
saw him pull out the gun. Luis Rojas will have to live with that
for his whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   For the retrial, Mrs. Chenoweth persuaded Eisenstein, a former
criminal defense lawyer, to try the case for nothing. Their
relationship was close but difficult. Mrs. Chenoweth liked to
second-guess. ``She had some loony ideas about what the rules of
evidence allowed,'' he said. But if he mentioned that, he
remembered, ``she would say to me, `Well, it's my loony ideas that
got Kevin this far.'''
</P>
<P>
   At that trial, Apel's alibi testimony was critical. Another
witness, William Davis, said he had told police on the night of the
shootings that Rojas was the wrong man. The man in the orange
jacket had had a ponytail and was built like a body builder. Rojas
was 5-foot-7 and weighed all of 125 pounds. Jurors noted that there
was no finding of gunpowder on Rojas' jacket, and the witnesses'
accounts about who had done what during the shooting began to
conflict on cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the jury deliberated 24 hours before coming back with a
verdict: Not guilty on all counts. Mrs. Chenoweth and Eisenstein
wept. Rojas, who is now working as a construction laborer, smiled
and began thinking about how to get his orange jacket back. He
wants to wear it again, a final symbol of vindication. ``It's my
jacket,'' he said plainly. ``I didn't commit any crime in it.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Mrs. Chenoweth took the train home to New Jersey, by
herself, had dinner with her daughter and started fielding phone
calls. People have been asking her now to get involved in another
case of someone they say was wrongly accused.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Chenoweth has a heart condition, asthma and a family
that believes she cannot handle the strain of another crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have taken a blood oath,'' Mrs. Chenoweth said, with obvious
reluctance, ``that I will not get involved in any more.''

TELEGROUP SAID TO ENTERTAIN BUYOUT OFFERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Telegroup Inc., a small international telephone carrier that was
flying high just six months ago, is on the verge of running out of
cash and is weighing takeover offers from at least two
communications companies, executives close to the discussions said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With insolvency looming, Telegroup is the first major
telecommunications casualty of the credit evaporation for companies
that are smaller than huge. As markets around the world have
devolved into turmoil, lenders have essentially halted financing
for companies whose prospects are considered uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The crunch could become particularly acute in the communications
industry, with its high capital requirements and fierce
competition. For instance, USN Communications Inc., a new local
phone company, has seen its shares starved to 62.5 cents from a
high of $23 in March, shortly after its initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   But while USN had only $47.2 million in revenue last year,
Telegroup had sales of $337.4 million. And that is attracting
suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Primus Telecommunications Group Inc. and IDT Corp., two of
Telegroup's brethren as new, fast-growing communications carriers,
have each made offers for Telegroup, said executives close to the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Telegroup's market value has decreased to about $110 million
from around $775 million in April. The company expects revenue of
about $105 million for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares closed at $3.25 Thursday, up 71.875 cents,
in Nasdaq trading. Last Friday, the shares traded as low as
$1.0313.
</P>
<P>
   The run-up could be a product of speculation that there may be a
bidding war for the company. But the Primus and IDT bids each would
give next to nothing to the public holders of Telegroup's stock,
according to executives close to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the offers are aimed directly at Telegroup's
bondholders, to whom the company owes about $105 million. The
largest holders of Telegroup's debt are Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and
Laurence Tisch's Loews Corp., according to executives close to
Telegroup.
</P>
<P>
   But Merrill Lynch and Loews do not even have the first claim to
Telegroup's assets. In August, Telegroup gave that right to
Foothill Capital Corp. as part of a $12 million credit deal.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Telegroup filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Foothill's loan ``is secured by substantially all of
the company's assets and expires on November 2, 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   An executive close to Telegroup, however, said Thursday that the
company had until the end of next month to repay Foothill and that
the loan was secured only by unpaid bills owed to Telegroup.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Telegroup does not have enough money to meet its
operating expenses for much longer, said executives close to the
discussions, and could be out of cash within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said there are subtle but important differences
between IDT's and Primus' offers. Primus, according to the
executives, has asked the bondholders to put an additional $40
million into the company. In exchange, Primus would continue to
service the debt at rates only slightly lower than those being paid
now.
</P>
<P>
   IDT, on the other hand, would commit about $25 million in cash
to Telegroup's business and include performance incentives for
Telegroup's management. In exchange, the bondholders would have to
accept interest rates potentially lower than those paid by Primus,
the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Telegroup, IDT, Primus, Merrill Lynch, Foothill and Loews all
declined to comment.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other companies that might bid for Telegroup include Star
Telecommunications Inc. and Worldxchange Communications.
</P>
<P>
   In early August, Telegroup prepared a high-yield debt offering
of between $225 million and $250 million. But then the bottom fell
out of the credit market and the company was forced to retrench. It
entered the deal with Foothill, postponed plans to upgrade its
communications network and said it would scale back its low-profit
efforts to sell communications services to other phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of timing more than anything else,'' said
Gregory Miller, an analyst for Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``Had these guys
caught the market 60 or 90 days earlier, they would be OK. Not
great, but OK. At least they would still be in business.''

PROPOSED ACCOUNTING RULE COULD CRIMP FUTURE MERGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board has tentatively decided
on new rules that might make companies think twice about future
mergers and acquisitions because of their effect on the bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   While working on a draft of the new rules on Wednesday, board
members decided to change the accounting method known as purchase
accounting so that companies would be forced to take bigger charges
to earnings in the early years after an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is significant because the board is also expected
to greatly restrict or even eliminate the other method that
companies use to account for mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   That method, known as a pooling of interest, was used in dozens
of deals this year, including the mergers of Daimler-Benz AG and
Chrysler Corp., and of Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc. With
pooling, two companies simply combine their balance sheets and thus
avoid charges they would face under purchase accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   Some accounting analysts on Wall Street said Thursday that
Wednesday's move by the accounting board, known as the FASB, would
force many companies to give up merger plans when they see that
future earnings will be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the acquisition makes strategic sense, I'm quite
confident that many acquisitions won't get done,'' said Robert
Willens, a managing director at Lehman Brothers, the securities and
investment banking firm. ``I'm quite upset about this. I think FASB
will find some fairly serious opposition from the business
community.''
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts and accountants have long criticized the
current accounting rules, especially pooling, because it often
allows companies to pay hefty prices for other companies but leave
barely a trace of what may have been a dangerous decision in the
accounting ledgers.
</P>
<P>
   While Wall Street bankers and analysts have been expecting the
accounting board to restrict pooling, they were cheered earlier
this year when the board decided to make the purchase accounting
rules more desirable by letting some companies avoid large charges.
On Wednesday, the board reversed that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Under purchase accounting, the acquiring company records the
assets and liabilities of the company being acquired on the balance
sheet at their market value. Any amount paid above the net value of
the assets must be recorded as an intangible asset known as good
will.
</P>
<P>
   For some companies with valuable trademarks, patents, technology
or licenses, the good will can be valued at billions of dollars.
When Walt Disney Co. acquired ABC in 1996, Disney recorded $19
billion in good will and other intangible assets.
</P>
<P>
   Under the purchase accounting rules, companies must gradually
write off the good will by taking annual charges to earnings. Many
companies, including Disney, write off the amount over 40 years,
the maximum length of time available under the current rules, to
minimize the annual charge.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, the accounting board tentatively decided to
limit the write-offs to 20 years, which means the annual charge
will double for many companies. If that rule had been in place when
Disney acquired ABC, for example, the company's charge to earnings
from good will would have been $950 million a year for 20 years
rather than $475 million annually for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the accounting board ruled out a plan to allow
companies to keep good will on their balance sheets indefinitely in
certain cases with no effect on earnings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Timothy Lucas, director of research at the accounting board in
Norwalk, Conn., said the board changed an earlier decision after
testing the proposed rules. Several companies that had recently
made acquisitions tried to prepare financial statements under the
proposed rules, he said, but found it difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The board is expected to issue a draft of the new rules for
public comment early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Willens said the accounting board was ignoring the many cases in
which it made sense to leave good will on the balance sheet
indefinitely because its value did not decline over the years. For
instance, he said, many intangible assets like trademarks, patents
and trade secrets may actually increase in value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good will is all the things taken together that make you
believe that customers will continue to buy your products,'' he
said. ``Those aren't depreciable assets. They're appreciable
assets.''

UCLA CORNERBACKS CORPS NO LONGER A CONCERN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's defense ranks ninth in the Pac-10 in yards
allowed (408 per game) and eighth in points allowed (27.6). The
line has not recorded a sack in five games. The linebacking corps
includes two freshmen and a sophomore. Safety is a constant
concern, two players having tried (and failed) to support
All-American Larry Atkins.
</P>
<P>
   The only position not of immediate concern is cornerback. For
longtime Bruins watchers, that's a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Bell and Ryan Roques, with a little help from reserve
Marques Anderson, have solidified an oft-troublesome position.
Playing man-to-man coverage almost exclusively, they're forcing
opponents to make difficult catches while eliminating the open
25-yarders that plagued the Bruins earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   In September, UCLA's opponents completed 51.3 percent of their
passes; in October, 44.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting more confident every game,'' Bell said. ``And
we're getting more comfortable. Everything's going real well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell thrives on being physical _ ``My high school coach told me
if I don't get a pass-interference penalty, I'm not playing hard,''
he said _ while Roques is a graceful athlete who converted from
tailback last season. He has four interceptions this season, tops
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're picking on Ryan, we talk about that all the time,''
Bell said. ``But they can only pick on him so much. He's in all the
right places at all the right times.''
</P>
<P>
   Positioning, Bell said, is the key to success. Each week
defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti instructs the cornerbacks to
eliminate one aspect of the opponent's passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Against Oregon, for instance, the defensive scheme prevented
post patterns (middle of the field), leaving Bell and Roques free
to concentrate on sideline routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we play, we try to take away 50 percent of the
field,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Just for kicks: Chris Sailer punted Thursday _ his only exertion
of the week _ and is expected to perform all his kicking duties
Saturday despite a strained right groin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels considerably better,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Walk-on kicker Chris Griffith will make the trip. The backup
punter is quarterback Cade McNown, who averaged 71.5 yards on two
punts last year.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo is hesitant to waste Griffith's redshirt year on a few
kickoffs and will give the order only as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Review of the Week: All-American offensive tackle Kris Farris is
a film buff who wants to make movies when his career ends. He has
agreed to review a movie each week for the Daily News. This week:
``Everest,'' showing at the IMAX theater in Exposition Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those unfortunate souls who have not experienced the
gripping visual splendor of an IMAX film, `Everest' is the perfect
way to start. It is, by far, the finest IMAX film to date and has
sparked new life in an exciting film genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film details the ascent of six world-class climbers
following the May '96 disaster. Full of breathtaking visuals,
`Everest' enables the audience to feel as if they are part of the
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes `Everest' special is the film's dramatic appeal,
something previous IMAX attempts had trouble accomplishing.
`Everest' is the must-see movie of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 4 pancakes (out of four).
</P>
<P>
   Note: Reading Jon Krakauer's book on the Mt. Everest disaster,
``Into Thin Air,'' is highly recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Steppin' in: Redshirt freshman Jason Stephens will make his
first start Saturday at strong safety, UCLA's most troublesome
position. Tod McBride started three games, then was removed because
of alignment difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason brings us a toughness,'' Aliotti said. ``I'm confident
he'll line up correctly, but he's got to learn to be more
disciplined.''

240 NBA PLAYERS MEET IN UNITED FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (dl) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Karl Malone made an impassioned plea for unity.
Michael Jordan and David Robinson said the greatest obstacle their
fellow locked-out players may face was divisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The largest assembly ever of NBA players _ 240 from all economic
classes _ stood shoulder to shoulder Thursday in a Caesars Palace
ballroom in Las Vegas. From Joe Kleine to Jordan, the message to
the owners was clear: They will not accept a hard salary cap even
if it means canceling the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in it for the long haul,'' said Buck Williams, the
former union president. ``We cannot give the owners the cost
certainty they feel they need. It's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I've been in the union for a long time, but I've
never seen the resolve or the dedication to the cause like today. I
was really taken aback by it. This is phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   The players voted unanimously at the end of a three-hour session
that they would not accept a hard salary cap in a new collective
bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his presence meant he would return to the Bulls, Jordan
said at a news conference after the meetings: ``I haven't made my
decision about coming back. I haven't made my decision, but that
doesn't mean I shouldn't be part of the union.''
</P>
<P>
   The league is no closer to opening for business than it was when
it canceled the first two weeks of the season on Oct. 7. The next
scheduled bargaining talks will probably be held on Thursday in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, boasted that the
same number of players would attend the owners' meeting next week
that attended Thursday. However, if 100 players showed, the union
would be ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   The players listened to union leaders from other sports,
including Gene Upshaw, the executive director of the NFL's players
association, and Donald Fehr, who holds the same title with the
Major League Baseball players association.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message to them was that they have some options, but in my
opinion I really believe they should decertify soon,'' Upshaw said.
``With no progress, I think they should sue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great plea for us to stay united and stick
together,'' Charles Barkley said. ``One of the reasons they wanted
all of the stars here is to let them know we're in this together.
The league wants it to be about the haves and have-nots. I'm one of
the haves. If I never work another day in my life, I'm going to be
fine. But it's not our intention to leave the young guys or the
middle-of-the-road guys out in the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Because ownership representatives from all 29 teams will be in
New York on Wednesday for the league's board of governors meeting,
the next talks should take place next week.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have rejected luxury-tax proposals and accused the
other side of failing to negotiate with the notion of working
toward a new agreement. Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner,
said the league would decide whether to cancel more games after the
board of governors meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Players on Thursday were not hopeful of a quick settlement. Some
openly voiced their concern about losing a season's worth of
salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, our effort should be focused on making the deal,''
said David Falk, the agent for Jordan and several other superstars.
``If the league makes that goal impossible, I think you have to
explore the other options.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing a key arbitration decision on Monday that killed
any opportunity for players to be paid during the lockout, a few
players around the country voiced genuine concern and wondered
aloud whether a hard-line approach should be kept up against the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   But as they left the ballroom this afternoon, each player
sounded as if he was working toward the same goals.
</P>
<P>
   Said Juwan Howard, the executive vice president for the union,
``After today, there will be no sell-outs.'' &QL;

WHEN SCRAPING THE SKY MAKES A CITY BLEED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He is polite about it, but Edward Rubin really
doesn't like to talk about himself with reporters. He will list the
firms where he worked as a young architect, before he started his
own firm in the Flatiron district. He will say that he and his
wife, Susan, a teacher at Stuyvesant High School, have two
daughters, one in high school, one in college. He will reveal that
he grew up in the Bronx, that his family was in retail (some
coaxing draws out the fact that his father ran a restaurant).
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin has often agreed to talk to reporters anyway _ he
remembers spending an hour with a television crew, just to see his
comments winnowed to a single on-air ``yes'' _ because he is
passionate about his subject.
</P>
<P>
   And his subject is one he has a hard time getting many other
people to be passionate about: zoning.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until someone starts to build an apartment tower in
their back yard. And suddenly, such soporific concepts as
air-rights transfers, zoning lot mergers and floor-to-area ratios
take on urgent meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings Rubin to Donald Trump and his plan to build what he
says will be the world's tallest residential tower, an 861-foot,
bronze-tinted glass palace across the street from the U.N. complex.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, 57, who heads the land use committee of Community Board 6
on the East Side, has long proselytized for a kind of quasi
religion practiced by an array of Manhattan architects, planners
and community leaders. They believe in the goodness of an urban
island made up of distinct neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that Manhattan neighborhoods are fast
losing their identity. And the catalyst is the 1961 zoning laws,
tattered with loopholes, that Rubin says allow developers like
Trump to build skyscrapers in neighborhoods where they do not
belong, cloaking streets in shadow and clogging them with people.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the laws and later interpretations of them have
allowed builders to buy rights to develop taller buildings _ known
as air rights _ from owners near their sites.
</P>
<P>
   This means that a church, for example, which has a right under
zoning rules to put up a taller building on its land, can sell that
right to someone who wants to build a tower taller than the law
allows next door or, in some cases, nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, a grandmaster of this delicate legal chess game, quietly
gathered air rights from several smaller buildings near land he had
bought on First Avenue between 47th and 48th streets. Then he
combined them to double the height of his building, meaning that
the tower will dwarf the U.N. Secretariat and that the top floor
will afford views almost as grand as those from the Empire State
Building.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin pulls no punches when asked about the tower. ``When you
look at the skyline of Manhattan and see the Empire State Building,
you see a symbol of New York,'' he said the other day in his
office, where an answering machine serves as his secretary. ``When
you see Trump's buildings, you see a symbol of his ego.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Trump responded by saying he did not know Rubin but
he did not completely disagree with him. ``I think there are
certain sites and certain areas that cry out for shorter
buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But of his new tower, he said: ``There are many buildings
surrounding the United Nations that are much taller than the United
Nations. Mine is taller, but there are many buildings that are very
tall in the area.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rubin stresses that he is not a knee-jerk opponent of
development. He has helped build smaller buildings himself, and
with only a whiff of irony, he calls development a ``perfectly
legitimate occupation.'' (Jesse Masyr, a lawyer who represents
large developers, says he often disagrees with Rubin but never
seems to go away hating him. ``You run up against people who take
positions mostly for their own glory, and I never felt Ed did
that,'' he said. ``And this is a guy who didn't support anything I
ever proposed, I think.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin cannot conceal his fervor when he believes that
builders are being allowed to rob Manhattan neighborhoods of their
character. In the early 1980s, he led a group that helped kill
Riverwalk, a luxury development planned for the East River between
18th and 23d Streets. In 1987, he joined hundreds of marchers,
including Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who opened umbrellas in
Central Park to symbolize the shadows they said would be cast by
towers planned for Columbus Circle.
</P>
<P>
   He avoids parties thrown by developers _ ``It's very easy in the
political sense to owe somebody something,'' he says _ and he loves
to tell a story about one of his design professors at the
University of California at Berkeley. The professor was talking to
a developer, who asked if he wanted to see a beautiful building.
The developer produced a balance sheet, pointed to the bottom line
and said, ``That's a beautiful building.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have different senses of aesthetics,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that competing aesthetics, even angrily opposed
visions, can coexist within rational limits. ``There are many
loopholes that can be closed, and I don't think it will affect
development in New York City at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Donald Trump didn't build an 800-foot building, somebody
else would have built a more contextual tower that may have been 30
stories,'' he said. ``They would have made a lot of money and
probably done a nice job.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Now that this New York Yankee team has certified its claim to
greatness by winning the World Series, and finishing the year with
an astounding 125-50 record, the debate has turned to whether this
is the best Yankee team of all time or merely the team with the
most victories. But for our money, the really interesting thing is
that the 1998 Yankees were a team that even Yankee-haters could
like.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, egos were in unusually short supply, as were
superstars. There was little of the old Yankee swagger, and even
less of the backbiting of the Reggie Jackson/Thurman Munson era.
When Chuck Knoblauch made a silly mental error that helped the
Cleveland Indians win a crucial playoff game a couple of weeks ago,
the team rallied around him, with nary a snide comment to the
press. The players seemed genuinely to believe in teamwork and
unselfishness _ virtues reflected in the series sweep, when
everyone made an important contribution. There is not, so far, a
sure-fire Hall of Famer in the bunch. But all year long you knew
that somebody somewhere in the lineup would cause the team's
opponents some real damage.
</P>
<P>
   The likability of this team extends to its manager, Joe Torre, a
nice guy who finishes first, and even, at least for this brief
moment, to its volcanic owner George Steinbrenner, who seems to
have mellowed this year. There were no tirades, no summary
dismissals of personnel. In the locker room Wednesday night he
actually choked up as he celebrated the fourth World Championship
of his tumultuous 26-year reign. As our colleague Harvey Araton
noted the other day, Steinbrenner is a throwback, an entrepreneur
in an era of faceless corporate ownership. Like him or not, he
doesn't hide.
</P>
<P>
   So here's hoping that these Yankees will survive the siren call
of free agency and stick together. Here's hoping, too, that
Steinbrenner, softened by victory and possibly by age, will drop
his scorched-earth campaign for a new stadium. The Yankees have
done rather well in the Bronx over the last 60 or so years, and 3
million people showed up to watch them win a pennant and another
World Championship this year. There's no more reason to move the
Yankees than there is to break them up.

COMMENTARY: JOHN GLENN'S PEERS ARE TICKLED BY HIS ADVENTURE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ All but lost in the whirl of important issues, like
which Senate candidate is proving to be rougher, was a recent
report on how federal agents arrested seven middle-aged New Yorkers
on burglary and racketeering charges. It put the lie to the slander
that the press never prints good news.
</P>
<P>
   If you are part of the fast-growing tribe that will never see 50
again, you had to be heartened by the exploits of this daring band,
which included a few men who are taking a bead on 60. One of them
even lives in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, or so the Feds say, the suspects broke into
thousands of homes and estates in New York suburbs _ thousands _
grabbing furs, jewelry and antiques worth millions. Then, it is
charged, they took their loot back to Manhattan and sold it to
fences. (And why not? Wasn't it Willie Sutton who said good fences
make good neighbors? Or was that from a Robert Frost poem? Can't
remember.)
</P>
<P>
   Faster than you can say Butch Cassidy, the suspects were dubbed
the ``Over the Hill Gang.'' Talk about insults! Over the hill? The
Magnificent Seven is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, stealing is wrong. Still, how can anyone not marvel at
talented men and women who have passed the test of time, who
avoided capture until well into their middle years, who favored
craftsmanship over violence and who epitomized virtues lost on many
young people, like diligence and attentiveness to detail?
</P>
<P>
   But a middle-ager's appreciation of their skills pales in
comparison with the admiration that many people of more advanced
years have for a distinguished member of their own generation who
still has the right stuff. We're talking about Sen. John Glenn,
scheduled to blast into space next week, 36 years after he became
the first American to orbit Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Too old at 77 to ride the shuttle Discovery? Nonsense, said
Carol Delmonte at the Luna Park Senior Center in Coney Island.
``Maybe he wants to make a name for senior citizens,'' she said.
``If he can do that, why can't I do that? After all, if I can still
get around and work, why shouldn't I? Why can't I?''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's imminent return to space was Thursday's topic for a
discussion group that convenes regularly at the senior center, run
by the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged with financing
from the city's Department for the Aging. Some of the 20 men and
women gathered around a big corner table were less than eager to
disclose their ages. Let's just say that most were in their 70s and
80s.
</P>
<P>
   And most, it is safe to say, felt encouraged by the senator's
adventure, finding in it an exciting affirmation of a point all too
often lost on a society that suggests that the only people who
count are those in the absurdly broad marketing category bracketed
by the ages 18 and 49.
</P>
<P>
   The point is simple: There is no such thing as being too old,
and while life may not begin at 80, it does not end there, either.
``We're young people in older bodies _ that's all it is,'' said
Anne Fink, who gets around these days in a motorized cart.
</P>
<P>
   What the Glenn journey in space reinforces is that there is
``always a past, a present and a future,'' said Rose Miller in a
swirl of overlapping comments about the importance of remaining
active, especially mentally. In that vein, Ms. Delmonte noted that
``people are getting married at 90,'' an observation that prompted
Norma Lichtenstein to chime in, laughing, ``You mean there's hope
for me yet?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. Not too many at Luna Park believed that the
world desperately needs to find out what effect weightlessness in
space has on the elderly. These are people who are not about to
board the nearby Cyclone roller coaster, let alone the Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to learn anything from this,'' said Thelma
Levine, dismissing the exercise as a waste of taxpayer money (a
remark that led some to damn the Starr report as an even bigger
waste and others to tell the latest Monica Lewinsky joke). Hy Silbe
suggested that ``John Glenn is more valuable doing what he's been
doing on the ground than going up in space.'' The flight is ``just
an ego trip,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ezra Levine saw nothing awful in an ego trip. His point may
well apply to skilled cat burglars of middle age, although it
probably works better with a 70-something astronaut hero. ``Maybe
he just wants to see if he can still do things,'' Levine said.
``Why not, if it gives him a longer life.''

 TWO FOREIGN AFFAIRS AGENCIES ARE ELIMINATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two independent foreign affairs agencies were
abolished this week by a stroke of President Clinton's pen, and a
third will have its independence sharply curtailed under a
reorganization plan for the State Department that was championed by
Republican leaders in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The two agencies, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and
the U. S. Information Agency, were abolished under the catchall
spending bill that Clinton signed on Wednesday night. Their
responsibilities will pass to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation allows the U.S. Agency for International
Development to remain in business but requires it to report to the
secretary of state instead of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The moves, which had been resisted by senior officials in all
three agencies, represented an important victory for Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., who made the reorganization of the State Department
a priority when he took over as chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the first things that he said he intended to do
when he became chairman,'' said Helms' spokesman, Marc Thiessen.
``Senator Helms kept pushing and it has finally happened. We've
actually shut down two government agencies. It's slimming down the
bureaucracy. It's bringing more coherence to foreign affairs
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration agreed to support the abolishments
and the reorganization in part to win concessions from Helms on
other foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation signed by Clinton said the purpose of the
reorganization was to save money through ``reductions in personnel,
administrative consolidation, including procurement, program
consolidation and consolidation of real properties and leases.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials said Thursday that it was
unclear how many employees of the three agencies, if any, would
lose their jobs as a result of the reorganization. ``This is more a
reorganization than it is a downsizing,'' a State Department
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
must submit a plan to Congress describing how the State Department
will incorporate the functions of the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency and the Information Agency into the department. The U.S.
Information Agency oversees a variety of programs, including the
Voice of America radio network and the Fulbright scholarships.

   Italy: Reassuring the People

   ROME _ Italy's new prime minister, Massimo d'Alema, presented to
Parliament a stay-the-course program designed to reassure Italians
concerned by the fact that he is the first former Communist to head
a government. D'Alema, who had already promised to adhere to the
same 1999 budget drafted by his center-left predecessor, Romano
Prodi, also indicated that he would not give into Communists'
demands for a 35-hour work week.

   The White House convened a meeting to convince officials from a
dozen oil companies to adopt its plan to build a pipeline from the
oilfields of the Caspian Sea through Turkey. The companies,
including AMOCO, Chevron, Mobil and Texaco, are interested in a
less ambitious project to extend an existing pipeline from
Azerbaijan to Supsa in Georgia. The oil would then be shipped
through the Bosphorus to Turkey. No decision was made but an
administration official said the meeting went well.

   For the fourth day, a blockade set by Maine woodsmen kept

reported.
